unstoppable domains has two products that's helping make the crypto world feel like the old world that we're familiar with but with these new crypto economic protocols under the hood and that is human readable crypto addresses as well as unsensible domains so i've got my unstoppable domains account open here and i've got my domains registered and so i've got davidhoffman.crypto right and i have my one of my ethereum addresses pointed to it and i'm also going to be able to add my bitcoin address here as well because this is a blockchain agnostic product any wallet that has unstoppable domains integrated will allow you to type in davidhoffman.crypto and if you're sending bitcoin or if you're sending eth or litecoin or hell even ripple it will send it to the address that i've associated on my account so i'm going to pull up my ether wallet here and i've loaded up an address with a small amount of eth and i'm going to send a little bit of eth to myself at davidhoffman.crypto it's going to populate with the ethereum address that it has but it's also linked to my twitter account because in unstoppable domains i've linked my twitter account to all of the addresses that i've plugged in and so chainlink is actually associating my twitter account with my ethereum address and you know these are the web2 platforms that we have today but think about what happens when decentralized identity becomes more of a thing i'm sure unstoppable domains is going to use decentralized identity solutions like bright id or circles to associate addresses with people in a extremely self-sovereign way unstoppable domains also allows you to spin up uncensorable websites which is i think going to become increasingly important in the world ahead of us using unstoppable domains you can purchase a website and use decentralized storage providers to host it as well meaning that no nation state can take down your website there is no cancelling in unstoppable domains world they even have templates ready to go to help you build out your first unstoppable domain so go to unstoppabledomains.com register your crypto addresses with a human readable name and maybe launch your uncensorable website today zapper is this new tool that i use to check out all of my assets in defy as you guys have known deepai has absolutely exploded recently and so managing your assets is getting harder and harder because there's so many different places and so many different assets that it could be so i'm going to put my ethereum address in here and zapper is going to tell me where all of my assets are across ethereum right so uh here are all of the assets in this wallet uh there's there's a decent amount of them and it's also going to tell me where i've deposited assets into various d5 protocols right so there's some yield farming going on there's some liquidity pooling going on we can also look more granularly at the specific protocols that it's involved with in this explore feature so it's got some assets deposited into uniswap it's got some assets deposited into balancer and also with zapper you can just exchange straight from the zapper interface right so this is just another layer on top of unit swap or other exchanges on ethereum that allow you to swap assets right so check them out at zapper.fi it'll give you a nice clean portal to invest your assets in defy and you can also connect to multiple wallets if you use multiple wallets all at once and it'll give you an aggregate of every single wallet that you own check them out at zapper.fi also this is definitely not my wallet hello bankless nation welcome to another episode of weekly rollups this is the fourth episode the fourth week of october and this is uh kind of a new episode format for david and i what we do is we bring this to you on friday morning so you can have a weekly roll up of everything that's going on in crypto with your morning coffee you can either view it on youtube watch us watch us there or you can also get this on the podcast what we do is every single friday so we cover five topics in five minutes and we get everything that is relevant everything that is happening in crypto in your ears we cover the market we cover releases we cover news hot takes and finally we end with things that we are personally excited about that have happened this week david how's your week going man really really good and i hope people listening on this friday morning are as engaged and energetic as we are about to be in this weekly rollups it's a fast-paced way to inject a bunch of information right into your brain so let's go ahead and get started all right man well let's start with what are the markets saying and do you want to start with bitcoin as we usually do yeah bitcoin is saying that he's happy yeah bitcoin's pretty happy with what's going on right now it seems to be kind of dominating the news cycle dominating the the market action uh and if you go to coinmarketcap.com you kind of see that bitcoin is going up and to the right and everything is flat at best and down and everything else is kind of down so it's a bitcoin dominated news cycle this week and why is that david has any catalyst happening or do you think this has just been a slow build and look defy and other um like ethereum based coins have had sort of their their time in to shine and now it's bitcoin's turn yeah sazel uh anthony cesano had a really good piece in his daily way where he talks about like the pendulum pendulum shift right like it was defy summer and now it's bitcoin fall and that kind of seems to be the narrative that seems to be playing out uh people like we've been saying on the bank list program people have really come to understand what bitcoin is not just inside crypto but outside of crypto and you know understanding bitcoin is bullish for bitcoin and people seem to be figuring out what bitcoin is supposed to do inside of their portfolio and that trend just continues to iterate and that's what we see going on in the markets today okay like so bitcoin is as we're as we're recording this at uh above 1300 do you think it stays there and you think it goes higher in the in the weeks to come yeah i think it's very likely that we are kind of seeing the last of the low tens for for for bitcoin uh we could maybe we could hang here and go flat for another quarter uh but people are looking to buy the dip there's a lot of hype uh dips are getting bought so uh you know it's worth noting that bitcoin has only spent five weeks of its life above its current price point so you know if you take a moving average uh perspective bitcoin is more or less at its all-time high all right five-digit bitcoin from here on out david's predicting that let's talk about eth price okay so eath has taken a bit of a hit within the last week or so but it's hanging in there 390. what's your take on eat price yeah eath price seems to be splitting the difference between bitcoin and d5 and we're going to get into d5 in in a little bit d5 is not doing so well this guy's not doing so well but youth prices is definitely doing well a lot east price is up against a lot of ethereum based tokens right and i think what we're seeing is a bunch of different variables i think investors understand that ether is extremely liquid and shares some of the same characteristics that bitcoin does right like a non-sovereign store of value permissionlessly available throughout the world that's extremely liquid right unlike all the defy tokens on ethereum which are relatively illiquid ethereum really does split that difference really well between bitcoin and and d5 uh and so i feel like we are seeing some some investor dissonance as to like you know is ether a defy token or is ether like bitcoin and the market says it's kind of right in the middle yeah and i that that feels about right to me it is right in the middle but it is the only other asset besides bitcoin that can get the type of institutional adoption this cycle that i think bitcoin will get it is the only cftc designated commodity along with bitcoin after all lots of uh lots of promise for ethereum and i think we're seeing that in these price um do you want to talk about um i i guess wi-fi real quick like that was sort of a hallmark of of defy um the d5 summer and now it has landed back to earth this goes back to kind of the pendulum shift you could you almost have to expect this after such a stellar rise where wi-fi came out of nowhere and i feel like this is this is one of the assets that we'll remember as kind of 2020 summer of d5 2020 um but what's happening to it now yeah so you know wi-fi like we like we talked about on the bank list program technically it started at zero it really got on people's radar maybe at one to three thousand and then it you know kind of zoomed all the way up to forty thousand and now it's down to eleven thousand right and so you know it being at eleven it it's technically i mean still people have made a lot of money but only if you got in really early right 86 of addresses that have purchased wi-fi purchase it at a higher price than it is today uh and so i kind of think that like defy is kind of where ethereum was at the end of 2018 kind of going into this bear market that's going to be a little bit longer than people thought that it was going to uh and we're seeing this with with other defy tokens like uni as as well this is really where like we we talked about this theme on the banquets podcast with our d5 founder series and our d5 protocols you know things happen in bear markets right and i think this is where you know wi-fi and uni and the community around these tokens really harden up like the true believers are going to stick around and the people that were here for the gains are going to defect and sell all right last thing we should talk for a minute about this chart this is a phenomenally crazy chart looks like uh mount everest over here this is the amount of bitcoin on ethereum right now as measured in bitcoin and it is from about april 2020 to up till now it's like straight up there's now two billion dollars worth of bitcoin on ethereum right now are we are we seeing sort of the the ether ethereum is a black hole meme is is that what's happening it's just sucking in assets like bitcoin abs absolutely ethereum is a nexus of economic activity that's what anthony cesano calls it and i really like that metaphor things just it's a settlement layer for everything including bitcoin right uh and i'm a really big bull on bitcoin on ethereum i think the market cap of bitcoin will ultimately be higher because of what it can do on ethereum what ethereum unlocks for it so it's just rational to put all of your bitcoin on ethereum i think that over time the majority of bitcoin will come to be on ethereum we're at 150 000 bitcoins on ethereum and you know to put that into context like um uh microstrategy the the company that all the bitcoiners are really stoked about putting btc on their balance sheet they bought 50 000 bitcoins right ethereum has a 150 000 and growing every single day ethereum's the largest buyer of bitcoin out ever buy like a long shot yeah that's a really interesting way to put it ethereum is the largest buyer of bitcoin by a long shot ever very fascinating all right we're done with markets david we've got to get to what got released last week do you want to start with ave yeah this has been a long time coming and this is something that we talked about with stani on the ave podcast ave is finally turning over the keys to the ave kingdom to token holders so the ave token holders now have governance over the protocol so really big step into maturity and development for ave so tip of the hat to stani and the ave team for getting to this point yeah i mean it starts to give actual governance rights over to token holders that's long been a criticism of some of these d5 protocols that the tokens actually don't come with governance rights the ability to control the underlying smart contracts well here they do avede takes a major step towards that that's quite fascinating also coinbase is making some moves coinbase is sort of a a giant we call them probably a crypto bank david but they're releasing a debit card to us customers i mean you know capital ones of the world the city groups the the chases of the world these are banks that released debit cards and have active like credit card debit card functions and now here's a crypto bank coming from the crypto side and getting into their world a little bit what's your take on this yeah this is a great example of how the world of crypto exchanges and banks are coming together to be the same thing like banks are like the natural precursor to a crypto exchange and crypto exchange are a natural precursor to a crypto bank and now these things are melding together coinbase issuing a visa debit card that has your crypto assets backing it in coinbase is a really interesting product i'm interested to see the product market fit that comes out of this or not we do know that people tend to be hesitant about spending their crypto uh but you know if for some people that like to denominate their wealth in crypto and only spend what they need this is a really good tool yeah it's definitely an interesting product and uh get ready i would say make ready for the coinbase ipo that is inevitably coming i feel like that is a virtual certainty and products like this kind of are along the road map towards that i bet speaking of banks in general jp morgan they created an entire unit for blockchain projects they have a well-known uh internal initiative that is building basically an ethereum private chain and a internal stable coin called jpmorgan coin actually that they're using for transaction settlement that's the reported use case we've got about a hundred folks in this blockchain ethereum-centric division what's your take on that yeah if i remember jp morgan and it's private uh ethereum it's an ethereum fork that it kind of manages itself called the forum was like the instigation of this like so this has actually been a project for a while i remember them being at east denver in 2018 so this is not something that just randomly popped up this has been in the works for a while so jp morgan has had stake in crypto and specifically in ethereum for a long time i'm pretty sure they're working closely with consensus on this as well consensus i think purchased quorum from jpmorgan which was always an interesting choice um but jp morgan is not soft on ethereum jp morgan's very hard on ethereum yeah yeah definitely very hard on ethereum all right so um also we've got the largest bank in singapore that just added a crypto exchange too i think that goes along with the theme so just last week largest crypto bank called dbs adding a crypto exchange jp morgan you know populating advertising their jpmorgan coin on ethereum this is coming from the other direction right we've got coinbase becoming more like a traditional bank now we have traditional banks becoming trying to become a bit more like a coin base and there's got to be some convergence in the middle uh fascinating stuff david we probably have time to talk about one more release you want to talk about audience yeah audience is a project that is trying to be a decentralized storage force like a soundcloud alternative you know soundcloud was the place to be if you are an artist who wants to remix other people's music but sometimes that comes with copyright infringement so audios is kind of this new sound cloud where you can take uh you know a famous artist music remix it and upload it to audience and it's not nation-state level resistant like ethereum but it is it does have corporate level resistance and so i think there's like 90 or 100 nodes that are supporting the audio system uh and that's what audience is all about and so i'm interested to see the experimentation with different levels of decentralization needed to produce a product yeah for sure we we also i lied we have one last release that we've got to talk about this is ftx the um the crypto derivatives exchange platform uh it has just announced that has launched a new way to trade stocks so you can actually get apple price exposure or google price exposure in ftx um you know bitcoin bitmex famously did derivatives mainly on crypto projects now this is moving derivatives over to derivative synthetic stocks what's what's your take there yeah this is really interesting especially when it comes hot on the heels of the bitmex uh uh you know attack from from regulators right like this is not a regulated product and uh sam bankman free the guy behind ftx is a us citizen i'm pretty sure uh and so this is a really bold move because this is definitely against cftc uh regulations uh and also i'm pretty sure the same uh bank secrecy act that applied to bit mix also applies to fdx so you know sam bankman freed and ftx are really throwing caution to the wind and taking a really bold move with with offering this yeah is this kind of an icarus flying too close to the sun you think things being a little too bold or do they have really good lawyers and really good advice i mean they are blocking traders from the us and other restricted jurisdictions but that certainly did not know right that did not help bitmex and the charges that uh the doj brought so we'll have to see what happens there all right david we've got to get to our next section five minutes what's in the news lately do you want to start with another crypto bank i feel like this is the week of like crypto banks right so um a few weeks ago we saw that kraken actually applied and became the second regulated bank this is a traditional bank there's a designation for that under the state of wyoming it was a bank charter basically and now a startup bank called avonte has become the second to receive this bank charter designation in the state of wyoming wyoming really turning into this almost u.s based crypto friendly jurisdiction right citadel of wyoming citadel right uh caitlyn long others i think have gotten very active in legislation in wyoming and turned legislators into sort of a crypto friendly state um so what's your take on this is this just more of the theme we've been talking about and here's crypto now becoming more bank-like and now instead of a meme it's like literally crypto bank charter not just crypto banks but crypto bank charter yeah absolutely absolutely there's a number of different takes to be had here one it's really cool to see another bank follow in the footsteps after kraken right and so like you know i didn't expect this to happen so soon turns out there's a ton of demand for a service like this so tip of the hat to kraken for really pushing the fold and allowing people to follow in the footsteps another take is that this is just about the professionalization and institutionalization of crypto this is how we make crypto more appealing to people that have bigger bank roles right uh and uh i i think yeah i think those are the big two takes yeah it's funny any any one of these stories i think if this was bull market territory fully in 2017 would have like absolutely blown up in in like price that sort of thing we're not seeing that yet we're still seeing kind of these news stories come in but stay under the radar i wonder how long that lasts super real fundamental folks they are here's another i think real fundamental but also interesting we've been talking a little bit about microstrategy putting bitcoin on their balance sheet but um it seems to be a way to like actually pump performance of their stock right because microstrategy since purchasing it's looking like a really smart hedge fund because since purchasing bitcoin they're already up 100 million from that investment what's your take yeah importantly a microstrategy earned 78 million dollars from its core businesses over the last 3.5 years and it's also earned a hundred million dollars based on its bitcoin trade that's made in the last like three months right so and and also the stock the stock price has also gone up and so what i have my eye on is perhaps like this inevitable fomo where you know company x puts x number of bitcoins on its balance sheet and then bitcoin goes up and then company x's stock price goes up if that continues to happen that's going to trigger just a viral feedback loop where other companies would be like well everyone else is putting bitcoin on their balance sheet and then their stock price goes up so like now we have to do it too uh there's a potential for a viral fomo feedback loop there and it is funny because you really get the sense that like high net worth individuals companies publicly traded companies themselves they don't know where to put their money right like that like they're like where do we put our money we have all of this money the fed keeps printing we have a lot of it and so they're putting it in places like crypto fascinating i didn't get caught up on this iran news david so so what's that i think um there's been some iran news that that came out about bitcoin for import payments yeah yeah so iran is allowing for imports to be paid with cryptocurrency right and so this is one part a strategy to get around sanctions uh united states and and all of our allies have put really heavy sanctions on iran and how they can pay for things because the united states controls the dollar system the the you know the international financial system uh but with bitcoin uh iran has a way to pay for things right and so it turns out like what the what's really interesting about this is it's alluding to that this is kind of just like the tip of the iceberg with iran's relationship to bitcoin it's highly likely that iran has at least been trying to accumulate bitcoin for its own purposes to pay for things because that's the only way that it can pay for things and now it's green lighting uh paying for imports with bitcoin right and so this is just how for better or for worse bitcoin is a tool of financial freedom for not just individuals but also for countries yeah i wonder if there's going to be some blow back though from the um you know the major countries of the world that are sort of the you know policing iran's activity right exactly not the best representative right bitcoin is for criminals and for renegade government like you can almost hear legislators in congress making that argument that's exactly right all right david their options are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in defy and it does that in a number of different ways but a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earned system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and d5 is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well we're also brought to you by monolith monolith is your cool new defy account your d5 savings account your d5 checking account except the cool thing about the monolith defy account is that it gets software updates right you actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time so here are some of the features monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect if you've come to know dfi and what it is you can you can add money to it you can put that money to work uh in compound and accessing yield uh but you can all and you can also swap through uniswap what was cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your smart monolith smart contract wallet on ethereum so it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a a savings account that gets software updates so this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world but you can still do real world things with you know real money and like buy your groceries so that's just fantastic coming soon to monolith actually already here to monolith is now you can buy die and get it sent to your wallet directly right so it's also being an on-ramp so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like coinbase or gemini or wherever you can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet so check them out at monolith.xyz all right david there a number of other things happened this week i don't know if you want to pick out one or two um flash loans are starting to make some governance decisions in in maker that's an interesting development we will include a link to that certainly um i guess along the lines of our banks becoming more like crypto banks and this convergence consensus is also helping a few central bank digital currencies start up one from a bank of of thailand this is a pilot project another a french bank do you have a take on that yeah this is this is just kind of the theme lately like the adjacent topics around cryptocurrency are really coming into the fold central bank digital currencies is a very hot subject right now and people are just kind of more or less assuming that almost all central banks are going to do one of these and so uh the the french central bank and also the uh in thailand central bank has also interestingly been working with consensus the ethereum startup studio to produce central bank digital currencies and so it seems to be that the world of central bank digital currencies are ahead of us and and consensus is really helping hand hold uh central banks along to get this job done yeah i think the only question is how long it takes it's now it seems inevitable and the question then becomes how long does this take for central banks to execute seems like it is uh heading in that direction at this point all right david let's move to some hot takes uh tell me what's on your mind what what have you been thinking about this past week as as these releases and these news events and kind of the market activity have unfolded yeah well one thing that's been on my mind lately is at least on crypto twitter and maybe that's not the most reflective place but it's a place where i spend a decent amount of my time uh is that the the fight between bitcoin versus ethereum or bitcoin and ethereum now i'm firmly in the bitcoin and ethereum camp however i i will sometimes put on my ethereum maximalist hat and and poke fun at bitcoiners but like i said earlier i truly believe that the combination of bitcoin and ethereum are mutually beneficial for both protocols and one of the things that we're seeing happen is two billion dollars worth of bitcoin on ethereum like we talked about so that's kind of what i've been chewing on and every time i see the ethereum and bitcoin blockchain become closer i get happier yeah well how many bitcoiners would you say do you think are on the on that train of thought david do you think that like because um there's been so much vitriol appointed at ethereum over the years from the maximalist community but also elements of the the more mainstream bitcoin community um are they happy about this all the bitcoin on ethereum are they saying haha got you ethereum is a side chain of bitcoin after all or are they uh upset that um you know ethereum is kind of taking all of this mind share and this asset value yeah yeah it's a really good perspective and some people don't like it some bitcoiners don't like it at all other bitcoiners like my my co-host on pov crypto ck he sees bitcoin on ethereum as proof of bitcoin's narrative and he also says that well ethereum along with many other blockchains also have to compete for bitcoin right and so he puts the ball in bitcoin's court saying you know ethereum is competing along with everyone else in the world for their bitcoins uh i'm i'm on the side where ethereum is the world's best transactional layer and so bitcoin is finding its way onto ethereum for that reason but these reasons are not mutually exclusive uh and there are a few bitcoiners i would say like nick carter and eric voorhees who are very much in the this is good for both camp and some others who just don't really care about ethereum that will put up the blinders and not really pay attention yeah very good i'm probably in the this is good for um both camp myself however i will say to leave this off every single bitcoin on ethereum pays fees to ethereum and those fees go to security of the economic network yes that's right absolutely all right ryan what are you stoked about what's on your mind um i you know i guess a couple things one thing that just popped up today david i was actually trying to uh move our a paypal account from one business entity to another just like a a tax id number a difference for for bank list i went into paypal and i contacted a rep because that's of course what you have to do everything goes through large office spaces and you know who knows where and centralized intermediaries and the response came back of course like two three days later please fax or mail the information back to paper yes fax or alternatively i can mail information what i have to do is mail a physical copy of my driver's license a physical copy of a like a business license from the irs stating a tax id number i have to either fax those which like i don't even know how to use like how do i use i don't know how to use the fax where's the nearest facts to you right so i'm just mailing it and once i mail it some department somewhere receives it uh and then they they process it and hopefully some weeks later i hear back my thought is just like people complain people talk about crypto having bad ux no no crypto does not have bad ux it has this different ux it has it has different ux this is bad ux like you should not have to fax information to a centralized intermediary filled with office parks full of full of people doing like jobs that um quite honestly could be automated away uh in order to get something done like this and it's just evidence to me and like it makes me more and more bullish on ethereum more and more bullish d5 more and more bullish bankless because now that you've unlocked this world once you go bankrupt like you don't go back like the banking ux sucks go try to wire money like i had you have to go to your local bank branch talk to them in person actually pay a fee to get funds from one place to another within 48 hours maybe yeah no it's it's crazy yeah so one take is there you know i've got a second take too for you hit me um this is maybe a little more spicy too all right missouri put out a a really fascinating graphic i want you guys to look at this if you're looking on youtube this graphic and this is basically a graphic of the distribution that various so-called eth killers have other smart contract platforms that or that are competing with ethereum and if you look at the blue section there that is tokens only available in pre-sale to insiders accredited investors if you look at the pink section and these killer platforms those are tokens that are allocated to foundations now the interesting thing about these foundations is the foundations are mostly controlled by the owners of the tokens themselves so it's effectively an insider's game too especially when you introduce things like on-chain governance where the coin vote holders get to essentially vote where the funds go like back or forth so anyway looking at the distribution of this and you look at us a solana for for instance that is well like close to 70 percent owned by insiders right like no public sale at all maybe some scraps breadcrumbs for uh community allocation whatever that means however you get that uh cello flow avalanche um block stack they're all the same i think that the distribution of these tokens these so-called earth killers basically means that they're toothless like they don't have the ability to kill an ethereum with a more credibly neutral distribution policy we've talked about in the past bitcoin's immaculate proof of work conception how that can't be repeated well ethereum has an immaculate ico inception very hard to repeat that it was not uh accredited investor insiders only you know distribution to like developers when you add proof of work ends up being like 10 of the network value um and i do think that is an underrated element of uh aetherium and one reason why eth killers will never catch up what do you think about that actually have a spicy take to your spicy take all right and you're absolutely right there's not one thing that i disagree about if you want to have a you know a global decentralized infrastructure you need mass distribution and mass community ownership which is what bitcoin and ethereum have i think that you are layering the perspective of wanting to be that upon these other alternatives but i think these guys are actually more going for a traditional business model route where yeah this is a blockchain that is going to be loosely decentralized but not mega decentralized and it's really just going to provide a service using an alternative substrate and this is kind of just kind of being not not going to be a centralized company but it's not really going to be decentralized either and so it's kind of splitting the difference between our old legacy business models and these new decentralized platforms like bitcoin and ethereum and saying yeah we're going to maintain a decent amount of centralization and we're just going to provide one service really really well and i think that's kind of where these people are going to be forced to be because they actually have no alternative because of exactly how you said yeah i kind of agree with that too and what it does though is i think it probably removes them from playing the uh their asset as money game that bitcoin and ether are playing right now that's right which is a huge loss a huge loss from a security perspective the money game is where you get core uh security at least that's that's sort of the you know our thesis where you can number go up too yes very important to have that all right let's talk about lastly david we're we're getting close sometime but what are you excited about yeah i'm really excited about this tactic that we put out yesterday on the bankless newsletter all about balancer smart pools as a toulon didn't read bouncer before now had two versions of pools public pools and private pools and public pools had all of the balancer pool parameters fixed so there are six different parameters that you can adjust that make up a balancer pool and then private pools have all six of these unlocked but having a private pool is like not really good for people who want to provide liquidity to those pools because whoever built the pool can rug pull basically in six different ways right and so uh balancer just released out smart pools which allows us to find a middle ground between having flexibility of parameters but also maintaining trustlessness right and so we put out and a protocol that used a balancer smart pool to issue a token is the perp protocol and it did something called a liquidity bootstrapping pool and what that pool did is that it started it started two tokens their perp token which is kind of like their their ico issuance token and die and it started with die at a low weight and their perp token at a high weight and then over a three day long period those weights adjusted right and so dye would become weighted more and more and more perp would be weighted less and less and less and this creates a dutch auction for those that aren't familiar a dutch auction is like a normal auction but in reverse the token price starts high and then moves and trends towards zero the assumption is that at some point before the token actually gets to zero the market buys all of it up right and so i think this is actually going to be a huge money lego for teams that are interested in issuing a token in this way it's got some massive advantages you can't run front run it you can't bought it it's liquid from day one there's no privileged access it's not like yield farming where people that have a lot of capital are able to yield farm it more than people that don't i think it's one of the fairest distribution methods we've ever come up with on ethereum so tip of the hat to balancer for getting this balancer smart pool up and running much fair distribution even borat approves as you can see in the post and that's a nice shirt you got there david does that have anything to do with the balancer smart pool perhaps a little bit so you guys remember the uh bap zero tokens which have these fantastic shirts if you're watching on youtube the escape the escape shirts yeah and so we initially sold these tokens on unit swap we put 50 tokens into unit swap paired with 50 each and then then people bought them except people bought 16 of them and then the price just got way too high right i think that price got up to like 12 or 1600 and then we couldn't sell the remaining of the 34 tokens like we ran into a dead end and so what we're doing is we're migrating those 34 tokens into a balancer smart pool we started the starting price at the highest price that a shirt was uh sold for and over the next month the price is going to trend towards zero uh fun fact ryan i actually did the math uh the last day of the sale is thanksgiving fun fact oh no kidding that's the last day and at that point in time if there's tokens left you can get the shirts for like something that approaches zero it depends on the demand of this thing right right yeah and so we put these 34 tokens into a balancer and the the starting price was at roughly 1200 dollars but then someone bought one and now the price is 1300 so it still does that uniswap thing where the more buyers there are the price goes up but the difference is over time the weights of the die versus bat zero token change and so the price will go down over over time so it's a little bit of it's a little bit of a game between you and the other participants it's how long are you going to wait for the price to come down before you purchase if you wait too long they might get all bought and if you right if you don't wait long enough you might have paid too high of a price right a little bit of a game to play yeah just like auctions are a game in real life this is super fascinating love to see how this experiment plays out it's it's gonna be super fun uh that's for sure um david you know one thing that i'm excited about of course is you know bank ledgers everything they're doing and ethereum but we've talked a lot about that um i i want to ask you like just maybe in closing how are you feeling about the election i know you've talked a lot about um and both of us have talked a lot about the election being sort of a major macro event that uh happens with crypto what's what's your take on it now i mean we're just days out of the u.s presidential election yeah the u.s presidential election seems to be a big fork in the road where a bunch of different things could happen right uh the the donald trump has signaled that he might be interested in contesting the election which would be bad that's that's bad for stability uh there's also a cohort of trump supporters that you know might cause civil unrest which would also be bad uh if i could think of the way that is uh the uh best for my bags i would think that joe biden would peacefully get elected and then start printing a bunch of money i think if you are a bitcoin bag holder that's kind of where you want to what what you want to see happen but i'm really excited about just getting this thing behind us i just want it over with it's exhausting are you exhausted i'm exhausted about it uh you know covet covert is spiking through the roof again that's that's also you know a lot of uncertainty there i want less uncertainty and so i'm ready to get this election just behind us and in the rearview mirror less uncertainty less noise more getting back to like what's what's kind of really important more like moving forward sounds really good and hopefully post election we uh we we have a bit more of that all right david we we are at time but we talked to market we talked releases we talked news some hot takes and uh thanks for letting us know and letting me know what you are excited about um guys this has been our weekly roll up every friday they're coming at you enjoy it with your morning coffee it'll be out first thing in the morning no matter where you live you can get caught up on the crypto news this has been ryan and david from the
