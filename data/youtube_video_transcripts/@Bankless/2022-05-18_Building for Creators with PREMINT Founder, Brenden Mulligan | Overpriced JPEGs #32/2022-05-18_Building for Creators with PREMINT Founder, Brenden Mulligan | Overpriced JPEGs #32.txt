[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i have a very special guest with us today brendan mulligan he is the founder of pre-mint which if you are in the nft space at all you have probably used at some point of late uh if only because you almost certainly tried to get on the moon birds uh raffle so uh very excited to have brendan here brendan's a serial builder entrepreneur he's built a number of startups sold a number of startups and really specifically has been building for creators for a really long time so excited brendan to talk to you about pre-med but also about like the creator economy building for creators and uh really your experience generally as as an entrepreneur uh we might talk a little bit about that the macro landscape here in

have you so consistently built products for creators and actually let me run through this list briefly before you go there i mean pod page was one of your more recent startups that i think is still an active company it builds websites for podcasters you earlier in your career built a site called artist data which i believe was from musicians launch kit i think was for creators sold to google i mean really you have it's it's impressive how prolific you've been in terms of creating companies that serve artists and creators so all right back to the question how did you get started doing this i was in the music industry it's the simplest way to put it i i went to school i was sort of always interested in like getting to know bands when i was in high school and stuff it wasn't just like i liked the music i also want to go to the shows and get to know him for some weird reason i'm sure therapy could draw out exactly what where all that started but um but when i was in college i went to school in nashville and i gave me access to just some of the best musicians and music business people in the world and so i ended up putting on um a massive festival in nashville every year and then i ended up going working for a talent agency called creative artist agency which i didn't really know but it's kind of one of the top in the world yeah it's so funny but it also seems so normal when like i was in so embedded in the industry um and nashville is very different than la where you know people are still trying to make it but it's a different tone there than it is in la um so anyway the music industry was really welcoming and open and i got pretty deep into it i want to work for a record label in chicago um and throughout the early 2000s basically as the digital transformation was happening in music i was working on the music industry side and i was seeing the importance of the internet the importance of online platforms um and how most musicians in record lives had no idea how to use them and so that sort of just naturally transitioned me i got really frustrated working on the business side and wanted to go and help actual musicians and music business people figure out how to utilize these platforms so um uh with not a lot of intelligence of what startups were or funding or how hard it all was i went and started a company called artist data which was as boring as you can get it was managing data um for musicians across the industry so if you have a bunch of new tour dates you need to put on a bunch of platforms that's what the service did and that was like three and a half years of learning what what a startup was and how impossible it was to do um and it does seem like the common denominator it seems like not knowing how hard it's going to be is like a prerequisite for starting a company because if you know you'll just never do it yeah especially and you know i love working with creators but it's it creators typically are the ones that are trying to get by and so building paid services for creators is a another layer of hard business to build um but anyway yeah so i did uh i did that and was lucky enough to sell that to a company after a few years that got basically got me out of debt there was no like big you know money shower it was thank god i can pay off these enormous credit card bills i have a master last three and a half years um and then kind of went from there that i wanted to be a little closer so i went from sort of being a i have an idea can other people build it for me to learning how to build it myself and so i started a company called one sheet which was uh websites for musicians to solve the problem of myspace fell apart musicians lost their audiences and they had no way of connecting directly to them so i just built a platform where they could do that and um did that for a while yeah we did a launch kit which was an app developer platform when mobile apps were getting more popular sold that to google and then um recently jumped into podcasters and now nfts so it's been fun i think it's just like i love creators right like every it's such a such a wonderful class of people who are out there like using creativity to to make things for other people and so my goal is always how can i make it so they can focus all of their time and effort on making the thing that they're good at and not all the other bs that they have to do to actually get that thing out there so like pod pages websites for podcasters because like you shouldn't be thinking about your website you should be thinking about booking great guests and like telling great stories not updating css so anything to take all that stuff off of the plate of the creator i think is worth doing that's awesome you you've touched on a lot there that stem a lot of questions come from from everything you just said but i'll i'll start quickly because i won't hover too long here on um you worked in the music industry you worked kind of deep in the music industry i think you were at like john mayer's label really early on when he was first coming up and things do you think about music and nfts you know i have the theory around this will go mainstream through nft ticketing are you bullish on that or having been in the industry or you're like oh it's going to take a long time for these two worlds to really intersect i tried to this was like in 2001 i feel like i was starting to put together like a stock market for the music industry so someone i was interested i like i got into bands early then they get popular and i always was like really cool if i could somehow benefit off of helping promote these bands really early when they become massive bands there's no i at the time i was like there's no way we can do this um i actually think there might be an mft play there in some way but ticketing is like to me a thousand percent the easiest draw of like mainstream people into nfts without maybe even knowing that they're ever in nfts but i think that ticketing is usually the example i give to people who don't know what nfts are about how easy and powerful it'll be this technology will be so i think like the only thing that holds me back on saying that it's a definite is that ticketing is generally owned by you know one or two companies yes um and it's just so when you have monopoly a monopoly like and it doesn't i think it actually would end up helping ticketmaster to go the mft route but maybe you know they've always been so slow and guarded on adopting new technology or doing new things that like and they want to keep control nfts i feel like in a lot of ways you're giving up a lot of control and moving things to entities and ticketmaster has not been a company that is excited about giving up control about anything so i think we'll see it i think it'll just get confusing because most of the tickets are still going to be sold by ticketmaster and it'll take them a long time to transition this is exactly what i've heard and that beyond that the bigger complication is somebody like alive nation who actually owns all the venues so if you're an artist at a certain scale you quite literally are dependent on live nation to be able to go on tour and book the venues that that fit you um so even if you wanted to leave ticketmaster and find some nft platform because it's better as you the artist you can't book the tour sites you need so i i think we'll get there eventually because i think ultimately like progress technology and what's better for masses of people tend to win out but uh that's interesting yeah okay echoing i think i guess the only only thing i'd add to that is we'll get there faster if we can find a way for ticketmaster and live nation to make a lot more money by moving to mfts and i think they actually could right i think hey your tickets will yeah your tickets you'll get i mean they've already built their own secondary sales platform because they didn't like that people were selling the tickets other places so now they get to make more money there i think nfts are a way where they can you can i you know what i would say to them is you don't need to build your own marketplace anymore put these at making them nfts they'll be sold on openc looks rare anywhere thousands of people might build ticket ticketing marketplaces and you will get paid everywhere um and you can lay off you know 100 people or 200 people who run your marketplace because you just don't need to do that anymore i feel like there's like there's probably a cost savings and revenue generation side to this the ticketmaster will look at way faster than look at like ooh interesting new technology it'll be like how can they make more money which is fine yep yep we'll take it however we can get it um you touched on something that i think is really interesting which is uh platform dependency you and i have spoken before so i'll give a little context here which is um folks not having their own website because they were like oh people will just go to my myspace you know i'm a musician i don't need even my own youtube whatever like i just link it into my myspace and then and then myspace dies and that you were very platform dependent um and creators still are are quite platform-dependent tik-tok instagram twitter do you think web3 can meaningfully change that in terms of allowing artists and creators to really control their own audiences in a way that right now when they're platform dependent they don't i think it's gotten better um since the old myspace days just because myspace was just not thought of as a long-term company um well actually that's not fair there's probably a lot of people in my space who thought it was a long-term company but i feel like there's so many companies that lo that taught lessons i don't worry about twitter just disappearing um like myspace literally kind of just disappeared uh but i do you know when you see about the elon musk stuff and then like the revolt on him owning it and whether he lets trump back on and how that changes the platform it's like at least everything is becoming so politicized that i that's what i worry about for all these platforms isn't so much the platform falling apart like myspace did it's like society saying like well i'm not gonna use twitter anymore and then all of those mft creators that have built these huge twitter audiences like it's not that twitter did anything wrong necessarily it's just that trends change but i think it's really hard to build to get every i think in order for these platforms to work everyone's got to be on them right twitter doesn't work i mean you see truth social starting and i think like maybe that starts working and then you basically have two worlds that people can choose to create like join i don't know i don't know if i see like lady gaga or some celebrities being like well we need a truth uh plot you know profile and twitter i think it's really noticeable i think decentralized yeah i mean and it's hard because i mean it's so political that right let's just say that there's just two platforms right right just a duopoly emergency yeah yeah i mean i even see this with twitter and like facebook pages i feel like a lot of people ended up being like no i'm just gonna go the facebook page route or i mean twitter out because it's just too hard to have to like maintain you know multiple platforms and all that so anyway all that said i think decentralization is amazing but i do feel like we basically decentralized into a centralized uh network maybe like the the twitter replacement that would be owned by creators would still in some way not be owned by them because in order for it to succeed everyone would have to be on it which would require some sort of coordination i don't know i think it's really hard um i guess is what i'll say i think that if twitter could have been built in web3 then there's a chance it would have all the same elements i don't know to be honest i think i think it's a really hard thing i think that i think our context of talking about it recently was talking about podcasters relying on all of these you know distribution platforms like if itunes decides to change their algorithm you might not rank in a certain place and then like that i feel like web3 has a there's like ways that web 3 can help with that but ultimately like the reason these platforms are so big and everyone uses them is because they spend a ton of time and money and energy making themselves big platforms so um it'll take a little while for web3 to coordinate in the same kind of way that i think a centralized company can it's definitely a squinting to see the future because in in the most abstract sense i think it's it's it's of course perhaps impossibly difficult to take down these huge social media network platforms that have all the network effects that the only thing that could maybe do it would be if the incentives were high enough for the individual like hey i can monetize better just being a user of a social media platform and i think it abstractly that makes sense i think it's in all of the implementation details that it's really foggy still if and how that that plays out say more on how you think if you if you have more to say on how you think web3 could help with the you know itunes youtube you know algorithmic changes impact a lot of creators in the in the world today yeah i think that um it's so hard because i think once so you strip away all of like the the content side of it and just look at what web3 has been able to do and like just looking at there's a ton of these currencies out there a ton of tokens and because it's all open there's tons of sites that can rank best tokens and you can go in and maybe you can say like oh i like d5 so it'll tell you here the tokens for you see it's not too hard to think like well if all of the player and listener data across all of these platforms were also exposed then i someone or a several communities could build way better discovery engines for podcasts than apple can because if i plug in all of my listening history which is somehow also public and then all of the listening history of everyone is public then in theory it could be some like 15 year old kid in italy has figured out a better way to serve me the podcast i want right now i'm sort of dependent on apple i'm sort of depending on whatever platform i choose to listen on the most this is the only ones who really know me and so i think that if there's a way to expose and it could be web3 right it also could just be like open apis but i don't think apple or anyone will ever do that but if this data could be used by everyone i think that's what's a powerful web three is the data is out there and everyone can build sort of solutions and interfaces on top of the data i think that would help podcasters you know specifically like rely a little less on the platforms where right now it's it's so much on the platform but you know you want it not game but you you're you're working to get up the charts so you get exposure on platforms as people go right and so um yeah i think that there's there's a lot you could do there in web3 and then as far as the distribution side that's the hard part because you know everyone about itunes and spotify and google sort of owning the podcasting space but they're great free distribution platforms and as a podcaster you just put your music on them and that everyone gets access to it or you put your podcast on it it's just like it's unbelievably easier than it used to be um and it's incredibly expensive to do for them and so you know they've had to align the incentives in the right way so they can actually afford to do it for free but it works before you launched pod page or i think you ended up launching pod page i believe out of a practice that you started after you left google where you were trying to launch something new like once a month can you talk about that period in your life and and if i'm right that's that's sort of how pod page emerged let's tell premium emerge too um oh wow okay so google's amazing yeah i mean it's kind of like it's it's just one kind of long exercise so when google's amazing it's an amazing place to work they have built world-changing products the it doesn't fit me in this stage of my life but i very much enjoyed having the opportunity to work in a big company but the worst part about it for me is like i said 10 years ago i decided to learn how to code and do some design work and so i could build things on my own i didn't need really a big team and at google you know google's built for big teams to work together and someone like me who's not nearly as good enough as an engineer as the lowest of low at google like i can't touch code there so i was a product manager and so google i had meetings and i called meetings and i wrote documents that's basically my entire job and so after three years of that i was going crazy um and so i decided to take a year and just get that building muscle back because i think that there's a lot of there's a totally different way you can approach a product when you're not writing a document about what the mvp looks like you're actually building it and putting it in customers hands and so i went through that process i didn't want to build i didn't want to if i leave google and say i'm going to am i launch my first thing and i don't put any context around it everyone expects like well this he just quit google what's this thing he's launching so instead i decided to come out and be like i'm going to launch a bunch of crap for the next year it's going to be one month project the ideas are going to be as small and constrained as possible these are not meant to be big companies this is just like going from zero to one and actually launching something which is really really hard to do you had a company like google and so yeah i launched um i've got some of the weirdest stuff it was like covered was starting so there's a lot of little code projects like qr code to menus that was a simple project it launched like a a way to keep in touch with people where it was like sort of a personal crm that was a big thing which i think that the personal crm idea is a flawed idea but that um i built something in that space and so one of the things that came out of it as i did this was i was building using basically the same code base over and over again and so i was building this framework to make it easier to launch ideas so at the end of the day like after doing this for a year i could launch launch a new idea a very simple idea in like hours not weeks or months and so um during that process pod page came out of that one uh it was a friend that had a a podcast that didn't have a website and i just asked why and that got me into the podcasting space and i learned that out of all the cr non-nft was it kevin rose it was kev kevin was it was the first that was the first site um wild and like it was uh it really came out like i didn't realize that podcasting was so open source in a way right like i built websites for musicians before for a couple other areas and it the hardest part of building a website platform for someone is they have to come on and input all the information at the beginning which is just like it's death for if you want to start a product and it's like before you get value out of us spend three days inputting data like you'll never get it but for anyone who doesn't know podcasting like all of the information in a podcast on itunes is a public feed of that information so anyone can take that and build an experience with it and so that's basically what i i learned and so i spent a weekend building pod page the initial version launched kevin's site uh just as like a proof of concept and then you know he was nice enough to let me like put it at his domain name to see how that impacted seo and it was a huge experiment for a while um and just sort of went from there so but yeah pre-med came out of that i mean pre-med is based off the same framework the initial idea for pre-med was built in about three hours one morning on my paternity leave um and it was a very tiny tiny idea that we just i was like ah let's see if this works so we will obviously again dive much more into pre-med but i want to ask so is this framework like a technical framework or it's like a mental framework for launching something well i mean there's there is definitely a mental framework you have to have which is you just can't be embarrassed on the thing it's horrible or buggy um that's a prerequisite for launching stuff quickly i've known some amazing engineers who are way better than i am way better designers way better product people that continually tinker with an idea until it's just until it's irrelevant almost because they they want they haven't gotten to the point where they can launch it and they're too afraid to launch it and then by the time they're finally finished kind of the idea used to be good now it's sort of fine it's nothing worth for me like i would love i'd much i mean this will get into it but like i've launched four web three products three of them were like basically total failures and um that's great right like because it was quick to launch him and see what see what happened and then um [Music] so there is the mental framework but there is a technical framework so i use very old technology called django which is like a framework pre-react native so for anyone it's just like it's not really a newer thing i think i was a computer science minor back in college i think i used that yeah i mean it's it's it's on it's a python framework it's a really it's it's very nice but there's better ways to do things in the client than than how django's built however as far as shipping ideas and getting things you know you don't need a website to be able to take a million hits a second when you don't know if anyone is ever going to come to the website and so django is is a great framework to get started and then um and on top of that you know like i built a user authentication part so just so you can create an account that sometimes you know when you're starting from scratch that takes a few weeks and so i was able to build that you know two years ago and then i can keep using that and so the framework at the end of that google year was like a lot of those like email notifications email confirmation um social authentication all that stuff that you have to build so all when i do a new project i just have to think of like the core thing that makes that project useful and just build that i want to build anything else around it which is nice and in that period which it sounds like maybe you've recently left but up until pretty recently we're we're kind of still doing like you were clearly trying to find maybe a full-time gig to come out of that it sounds like how would you get user feedback it sounds like ship quick get immediate feedback see if there's a there's an audi a product market fit and then move on if there's not yeah i think so this is one thing i learned when i was younger is that i used to look for the good feedback like search for it and then i'd get over validated by it um and i've done this both in bootstrap companies and venture funded companies where it's like cool this is a cool idea you put it out there and like you might tell 100 people about it and like 10 people are like that's a really good idea that's really cool and then you just focus on those 10 people and then you like and then they there's some times where that works where the 10 people are sort of the early adopters and they get it and the other night you don't so i'm not saying that anyone should ignore the 10 people but i i didn't really go back to the other 90 and say well tell me more why you didn't like it and then like maybe those people would have brought up a fundamental flaw that i would never be able to fix and so i tend to like really look at when i put something out there like and i'm sure that there's things that i've walked away from too early but i get this gut feeling of like did this resonate with that audience or like a clear there's always going to be a few people who are like this is amazing or this is a really good idea this is really smart but like you kind of can get an idea on a response from that so that helps me like cut projects really early i during that one year some of the things i launched were literally landing pages with a sign up button that led to a google form i didn't actually build the product and then i could just tell how many people actually signed up and would you put out ads like like to your target market like i heard you mentioned like a travel guide like how are you getting to a travel audience just to learn oh actually nobody wants to use this yeah i probably messed this one up because i probably didn't put it in front of the right people but i've been lucky you know i was on a couple suggested usual lists for twitter a long time ago so i have like i had like a hundred thousand twitter followers mostly bots but there's still enough people there and i have enough people in my twitter world where like if i could get a couple people to retweet something it could it could go farther and so i i overrelied on that um i've done like google ads where i've done like targeted google ads i'd have never felt like i'm particularly good at making sure that i'm actually doing google ads correctly um i was doing google ads for something a year and a half ago two years ago and someone looked at my account and i was like yeah i don't think anyone wants this thing because no one's clicking and they're like you're spending 95 percent of your money on like these crazy small countries and they're like you just it was just so fundamentally flawed that the campaign was that so but i i don't know most of the ideas that i've had are either targeted to my audience like startups like i had an idea this is an idea that i still think is it's a fun idea but it was so dumb and i spent time on it which was investor updates like a whole platform to write investor updates and send investor updates that is a very niche product um but it was fun to build and it was like a nice side project that i did a long time ago but i could have told you in the first tweet that that wouldn't have actually done well like looking at i mean yes you can get people to retweet and say like this is a cool idea but how many of those led to sign ups how many of the sign ups actually stuck around for a week so that's basically what i just look at that like tiny little waterfall and um and then there's some ideas that i think are just like like pod page took has taken years to sort of find its feet but it's just that that to me is like that's a really fun project to work on um it got enough traction at the beginning to keep plugging away at it but um it's taken that one's taken a long time okay let's talk about pre-min and some of the other web 3 products you launched out of this habit initiative i don't know practice you have of launching things quickly do you want to do you want to tell us what the other ones were or do you want to just dive right into pre-med yeah i mean so my journey into this space was i've built for creators for a long time the biggest problem with building for creators is typically they're not making any money and so at some point either you keep building for them and you get tired because you're not able to generate enough revenue to to make it worth it um or they just never no you can never get anyone to pay for anything and then you end up like what's the alternative raise venture capital like i've i've sort of as i've gotten older been less interested in like the venture capital non-revenue-based businesses and like hoping to sell the big company and like been more interested in like oh let's build something of value people pay for that's just not that's sort of been the direction i've gone and so um creators it's tough because it's really hard to to get creators to pay for something at scale um when nfts got started i got super interested because i've always been interested in art i love i've always been interested in crypto and then i saw these creators like having these fundamentally fairly simple problems that they had to deal with but no one had built tooling for them and so for me it was like i want to and i want to understand the space so i built um initially it was going to be product for nfts it's called alpha drop i was an early investor in product hunt so i've watched that product grow and so i was like i'm going to just replicate that for nfts um i ended up turning that into a newsletter that you know had a couple of thousand people subscribed but then sort of stopped growing and it was stopped growing because i stopped like there wasn't enough value being created for the subscribers to tell their friends in my opinion if that's the case then the newsletter doesn't work so that was kind of a failure um the cool thing about building the product on side of the actual like website was i built all these web 3 integrations which has ended up being the foundation for pre-med i think pre-med came next and it was one artist was starting to collect addresses with the google form i saw that and i just asked him why he was doing that this was back in the the the time of gas wars was like the art block everything was released on art blocks and it was a gas war and you could never get it you had to be a bot to be able to buy any nfts and so he started doing i was pinned our van armin with bit cans he started doing a uh google form sort of method of a green list and so i think i think he called it the bitcan green list and so i just would like i just chatted with them i was like what do you do with the google form afterwards like anyone can put any address in here there's no verification then he also would say like who are you on twitter or discord so i was like do you follow these things like how do you get any of this information he told me that you've some scripts that from he would do a forum for every drop and he was like if i look at the people who sign up over time i can start identifying some bad actors i was like literally was like i could build something for manual this [Laughter] yeah yeah and again like i'm talking i mean he's he's a very technical person his art is incredible um and uh but i i guess i just like i can't still have this idea that like you should be doing you should be focusing on the art you shouldn't be focusing on like cleaning ip addresses from google forms or whatever it was so anyway um premium came out of that it was like a one morning i was able to take some alpha drop code and just basically build a single page where you could connect your wallet you could connect your twitter you could connect your discord and you could hit a register and that was the entire product um and so that sort of floated for a while like we can talk more deeply about how the growth of that happened but that kind of didn't really work from a scaling perspective for months and then um i've also built a salesbot platform which you can very quickly say here's my my openc collection here's my twitter account here's my discord server post and tweet every time there's a sale it's like it is so easy i thought that thing was gonna fly i was like everyone will use this i'll sell like a thousand licenses for this in two seconds especially because i had over all these new projects trying to list on alpha drop i was like i've got a pipeline this is going to be so big that thing um it's fine i think in the last like six months like 50 teams have used it uh there's a fundamental flaw with that that i realized which is it's too easy to build these bots anyway and people in the community are always willing to build them for free so there's no re reason to like use a platform for it um and then there's another project that's sort of in in sort of a pattern right now which is portal which is a nft platform like community management platform we launched it with proof when proof launched it's sort of the way you log in to proof that product i think it's very cool it's insanely complicated and after launching it i got like a couple hundred people to sign up on the wait list which is great that showed there was some kind of legs then i invited them all in and i gave them pretty low payment option as like an alpha user i was like this is way less than i would like to charge for it but here's what you pay and no like a handful of people paid and in talking to them they were like well someone someone told me what they'd pay and i was like well it would take me like five years for you to be as valuable to me as a customer as you are for pre-med they were a premium customer they're like well that's because premium is part of my launch strategy which is how i generate the primary revenue which is like a big part of my in my income this product is more like a monthly expense and so the framework around thinking about the value of the two was so different and so portal ended up currently i still think there's a there's something to do there but it's way more complicated with way more customer support way more customizations and a massively lower willingness to pay so i haven't really figured out that equation doesn't really hasn't worked out yet so i'd say that product hasn't necessarily worked living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the device apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfts without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increase transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect po-apps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 something i really want to talk about is uh like payment models and and you're sort of doing this interesting thing which is like an nft as a way to get sort of like software as a service i don't know is that what you would call like as a way to get software so but let me just very quickly in case anybody hasn't fully been tracking pre-mint it was really launched as like a creator-focused tool to allow nft projects to capture your etherdress your discord your twitter certain amount of like bought protection there uh you know certain amount of just being able to validate who's on your allow list okay great i think we all understand why that's helpful you then launched this uh really consumer-focused side of it as well like collector focus side with like a collector pass so now you own the premium collector pass you can go onto the pre-min site see what collections are dropping you can maybe speak a little bit more on that but that gives the overview of i think where the product stands today is that right anything you want to add on on sort of product overview piece no i think that i mean with drops you either have like if you know with popular drops you have massive gas wars you have most collectors can't access them and so a lot of people have moved to this model of allow lists and premium it makes it really really easy to customize how you want to build your allow this and pretty much guarantee a gas free mint so um that's been the main goal for it from the beginning and still is is to provide a platform that like that just kind of completely removes the idea of um a bunch of people losing gas like they have in some of these more recent mints cool if a platform platforms like this that exist in the web 2 world i feel like are usually subscription services and you pay monthly and and i've said this in the podcast before but i feel like in the rest of the business world people are obsessed with recurring revenue models and obsessed with subscription models because you can then know hey i'm going to have x number of dollars coming in every month and that feels great and in the nft world it feels like we're like in the opposite space like we're like hey buy this thing one time and you get like lifetime access to something and it's a very funny juxtaposition to like the way the rest of the business world is operating how did you think about and determine the the model you use and and maybe explain exactly what the collector pass model is i think it's like a yearly thing but talk about that yeah well i've tried it three different ways right i wrote a um a blog post about this i think in earlier this year maybe late last year um and i never published it but i circulated it with some friends about what if software licenses were put into nfts it was just a question i had no clue if it was a good actually everyone read it said it was a horrible idea and i'm not saying that i proved them wrong because there there's definitely issues with it but um my the premise was like what if you were to gate software with nfts and then the cool thing about that is you could also other people could then offer your subscribers benefits that which could be good or bad for you but like i i could say if you're a figma user and you're people are already kind of doing this with oauth i don't know i think figma offers off but you could i could say like hey i'm building this cool screenshot building platform for apps which is we did eight years ago if you're a figma user you get twenty percent off and i like to do is you know just make sure your figma nft is in your wallet um i just thought it was like there's something interesting to me about gated access and then the other interesting thing it sort of goes back to when if anyone listening to this was alive at this point there used to be the software used to be so sold on disks and cds and so like you could theoretically own your you know you could use photoshop and after like six months if it wasn't for you you could resell it to someone else where we moved to software as a service and you're just paying you know once you pay for figma you pay for figma so i just i think there's some i think there's definitely going to be a life where nfts are software licenses i don't think it'll be all of them but i think there's definitely a model that's interesting okay so what if you do that well the problem that you're talking about is you buy the nft and you get tired of the software and you sell it to someone else and then they get the software basically for free from according to the company but then they come to the company with the expectation of being taken care of as a new customer so how do you support customers well you got royalties problem with royalties right now is that the main gate gatekeepers of marketplaces don't allow you to charge anything more than 10 now i think in art that makes sense but like if i'm selling a software license and a new person buys it you know i could make a case why i should be able to charge a 50 royalty because now i've got to support the new person the other person you know especially if it goes up in value that's something completely out of the control of the software creator but like it could go up in value and the person could come out like using the software making money so anyway so but that that isn't the world we live in right now you can't charge that much um so i just i had pre-med i had sales bought and i was like well let's just try it so i tried two models pre-mint was the original pre-med model is a creator pass to be able to access the the premium features is um is an nft that i just put on the openc contract which was a dumb idea but it got me going quickly um and you go into openc and you just buy it and you come to freeman you activate it that was that was the way that worked i asked you not to sell it and i said once you activate it i will tie the token to your wallet and if someone else tries to come and claim to activate that same token they will get a sort of an error message which is how it works and i'd say that worked so i basically made it not resellable which kind of goes against nfts but i don't really care it's an experiment um it was more like a receipt that's what your nft was and um but i wanted to do nfts versus just like pay an e through a button because i think it will be cool in the future to be able to like use the nft holder group to be able to offer them stuff potentially so i just wanted to do it in a way that wasn't just like send me some eve that's gone pretty well i think we sold like a thousand of those over the last six months um and there's probably been like 50 or so that have been resold um and we've had to deal with that as it comes but and most of those times people just didn't know they weren't supposed to resell them but you know that's worked as sort of this one-time nft thing um salesbots we said if you hold the nft your sales bot will work if you sell it your your sales spot stops working and someone ends whoever you buy sell it to get set up and because it's a self-serve platform that's been working really well um because there's not a lot of customer onboarding that needs to be done with the creator or the collector pass which you mentioned is sort of that other side of the premit marketplace um i see that as more of like you're becoming a member of like the creator passes you're paying for software the collector passes you're also paying to get access to software but it's not really a software as a service it's sort of like you're getting you have this like you get access to software benefits and it's subtle but the difference has been like you're sort of becoming a member of this thing that gets you access to software um as opposed to like you're exchanging money to to use software for your business so it's it's slightly different anyway so that one you know the problem with that is if you most of these nfts that are being launched right now they don't have a term it's just which is weird because people will stop the software will end at some point and so like there's a lot of like shady legal stuff that isn't shady like intentionally but people are selling nfts with promises that they will not be able to deliver like a lifetime pass like the i guess you could say it's the lifetime of the software but i don't think there's a terms of use that's specifically laying that out um for a lot of these projects but anyway the idea for the collector pass is you get it for a year or two years depending on which pass you're going to get right now the founders won less for the rest of this year and then all of next year and then if you hold the pass you are guaranteed a spot to buy another one if you would like at the midday of the next one that is the current promise now who knows what we'll do we might there's all kinds of stuff we can do with it but i wanted to give myself the option to figure that stuff out as it goes on and not have this like in perpetuity you get access to the software platform because who knows um if that's the right model oh i'm i'm i'm warring with myself if i want to double down and ask a follow-up on this or there's a theme i really want to touch on with you so i'm going to go there because you were starting to uh to say it and it's something i've talked about on the show and it's an issue i have with this space which is the like current state of just permanence like you launch an nft project and like you're supposed to be on the hook for the rest of your life and it's like this thing that hangs around your neck like it's but you know if you are an artist or a creator i was just having a conversation with a creator the other day who launched his project and was very adamant like hey like buy this because it's art and you like it it was like .01 each it was really cheap and of course they've somehow ended up like i don't know how this happened but i'm now sucked into the world of when utility and like i don't i didn't mean to get here you know so you're talking about the permanent thing when it comes to software which you think is fascinating you're also somebody who's had this amazing career of bouncing around trying ideas building a product abandoning it doing something else and been very successful that way and i'm curious if you have thoughts on the landscape in web 3 which right now doesn't necessarily allow for that it doesn't allow for that because you're taking money from consumers so of course you need to have it you weren't doing that you weren't like asking a bunch of retail investors to give you money to trial and error different products but what is your feeling around the space right now um with sort of the penalizing people who want to try something out and then leave and go do something else and try something out yeah i mean it's i think just to be blunt i think fundamentally it's a weird space where you buy a jpeg of a character and there is an expectation that there's going to be a team or community working their ass off to make that jpeg worth hundreds of thousands of dollars it's just like it's an odd setup to start um i love it but the whole thing is like when so many times i've been so early adopter on so many things and i've had family and friends kind of you know look at me like well you're gonna pay 600 for an apple phone like that seemed crazy all the stuff that seemed crazy before this is one of the first that when i explained i'm like i know it's crazy i just i can't i can't convince you on this one like you're just gonna have to yeah you buy you buy an ape and it's an ape and it's half a million dollars but it gets access to this other thing maybe or you know jimmy fallon has one like it's this weird it's just weird so let's just put the put the bases down it's a weird space in general um i think that uh there's a lot of artists that i think have successfully been like listen i'm releasing this and i don't give a what the floor is like my job is done when i release this thing that's the art i'm creating you all want to do something with it like great i think that it's nice when an artist thinks to like really frame it up i think over communicating which most projects don't do is is really a helpful thing in the space so like you know you mentioned kevin like he and i talked a lot about utility tokens and i think if you're going to launch a utility token or not a utility token you should be really really clear about what the utility is going to be at the beginning legally you should be very clear about what it is and isn't right there's so many so many legal issues you have to think about when you're when you're doing this and i think um setting a kind of a term of if the token is something like proof or like the premium collector pass which is more of a util like straight utility token um it's not like art with utility attached it's actually like i think you have to just be really clear about what you're buying and what you're going to get for it if you want to do extra things then that's great but um setting that baseline and and i think that putting a term on it is just you have to um it's actually also helpful from an accounting standpoint not that anyone does actual accounting here but um you know like when you have it and you have a three-month three-year membership and someone pays you a thousand dollars for the membership well then you if you're doing if you feel like doing approval accounting you can say like all right well this is going to be revenue spread over three years then i can put expenses over it like i think that's a big difference is like someone like me i know kevin i know a few other people who are like this is a business this isn't like an ethereum wallet that money comes and goes from this is like an actual business that give pays taxes and has employees and all that stuff and like if you're gonna go that direction you have to really think through a lot of the stuff otherwise you get yourself in a really weird position are there technical innovations we need i don't even know that innovation is the right word just i don't think it's necessarily complicated to do or maybe i'm wrong but like to be able to just have a more robust kind of types of transactions that are going through right like renting or you know monthly recurring subscriptions that can be with nfts it might be viable nfts in any ways like it seems like there's a lot of opportunity for pushing the space forward in those ways i think that i've seen a couple people um do some interesting stuff i mean this would i honestly this would be it'd be wonderful if you could say oh you can pay me in crypto and it's a monthly fee and we'll deduct it just like your credit card but you can't because you need to sign each transaction and so um i think that if i had to bet on anyone to fix this it'd be stripe just because they're amazing i love stripe um as a company and i think it's gonna have to be a custody thing in the same way where i can give openc the the right to move my wrapped eath once i win you know someone accepts my bid it'll have to be something where like i'm signing up and i've got to lock up some ether i i there's probably some simple simple solutions that are going to be take a while to get right but um but i think like recurring there should 100 be easy recurring revenue integrations for crypto which there just aren't right now um and i think it would be i mean you could kind of say that if you can solve that then you can solve recurring revenue for nfts because then you could just debit crypto airdrop the nft and so i think that um i think all that stuff will be coming like to me it's it's still crazy how hard it is to move money when you're not doing crypto like if anyone's done like a wire transfer recently it's just a hilarious process and it's funny because we use for the collector paths we use divergence which are the best contract writers in the world um they did moon birds and proof and grails and just they're just amazing so because i'm a company it's easier for me to pay in in fiat to compensate them for their for the work that they did versus like send them some crypto it's just it's just easier at this point with the way that we do accounting and it was just such a pain in the ass and it took so long to you know get all that going and it's just so of course like everything needs i think in addition to the payment side also like the the the uh sort of regulated traditional business side being able to like move crypto back and forth as a way of like doing having expenses income and expenses like it's still so early for all that and i think that only that infrastructure needs to be built too when you think about like recurring revenue if you're doing recurring revenue in crypto you need to also be able to have like very solid ways for that to get into quickbooks right it's just like it's stupid but it's just it's the boring crap that like to make it actually work so um yeah i mean as an example for pre-med every night for the premier collector pass which or a creator pass people to keep on buying every day and move all the money from ethan to usdc manually every single day i would prefer that whole thing just to be like a smart contract that's automated that'll do it you could write that into a smart contract though right the smart contract that gets the ether delivered to it could have could probably have sort of an automatically go into usdc right there's that i could have it sent to a wallet that would automatically do whatever there's all kinds of things that i could do that are all relatively complicated and i'd rather spend time like building better features for the collectors and creators but yeah but so this is all the stuff that it'll just like in a few years it'll be like that's really funny that i used to do that manually totally um at this point that's still what it is and and when i do it manually and this is going uh way too detailed but like the accounting for that is like someone pays an e even if i sell it five minutes later i need to account for the change in value of each over that period of time is it a gain or a loss like it's crazy complicated to take crypto as payment in general if you want to account for it correctly this is what makes me because it's so solvable right like it this will eventually like this is going to get solved which is you know it's the reminder i've said a lot on the show like we're early that doesn't mean prices are low like i mean it doesn't mean that nfcs are currently cheap right in fact most of them are probably overvalued um overpriced jpegs but we are early from like you know technically what's going on um so you you talked about token gated memberships versus subscriptions token gated memberships are cool because you could say hey like do you have a figma you know other software's could kind of partner with you differently are there other advantages you see to doing something token gated like that versus it being a normal subscription um yeah i was explaining to um so it's not a prerequisite for token gating but so when you think about pre-med we have collectors who there's a 10 000 collector passes and that's it and you know we might do a you know another you know yearly passes and then they'll be different but right now there's ten thousand there will never be more and there won't be less um the creator pass is more like traditional software where those are there's an unlimited supply and whoever wants to buy one they can buy it um so that's why i say that they're just mentally two very different things so the collector pass side um anyone who's built done software before use gen especially if you raise venture capital you're basically thinking a ton about two things growth and churn churn's part of growth but like how many people are leaving you and how many new people you're getting in so and that's such a big focus and when you sell you know a fixed supply of software licenses to a community there is no growth i will never have more than 10 000 customers and it's like the the amount of mental sort of space that gives you back i mean you had to think a lot about growth to get the 10 000 and to sell those ten thousand but like i don't think about oh because every time someone churns meaning someone quits the software and basically you know in the real world would cancel their license someone else buys so it's a hundred percent uh i forget you know and my buddy andy johns would kill me for forgetting his lingo here but like um whatever you know it's like a reactivation it's kind of like you reactivate everyone everyone leaves you get someone new you always have ten thousand and so it's it's just a totally different mentality i've i i need to eventually sit down and figure out why it feels so different but like i've been doing a lot of cool stuff for the collector community so we i'm giving everyone a free ledger as an example if you have a collector pass you get to claim a free pre-med ledger nano s plus which is a and like their new device that supports nfts really well um it's so fun to do that kind of stuff for this community versus like having like a bunch of subscribers and doing the same thing it's just it's a different mentality um when people are sort of being able to take the software that they bought from you and then sell it to someone else and maybe they make a buck maybe they lose a bit that they got some value out of it you know it's just a totally different way of thinking that's like a bit that's a really interesting insight because i think right now one of the problems is that like when we try to explain to the outside world like there is sort of this why is this better than like i could do the same thing in web 2. you know and i've given the comparison of like it's early cars like early cars were slower than horses so you know like there's some of that like this this will be more efficient though down the line but that's like a subtle thing you know that's not obvious but that's like a genuine psychological shift that you know makes me bullish because that makes total sense that that's sort of like a more interesting uh a more interesting way to go um even just the psychological shift of not having to worry about growth in the same way i mean is is really um fascinating is there an a do you is there an economic sacrifice to that in theory i guess it depends on the company but like do you feel like you're sacrificing something by way of revenue yeah i mean i think so when i first came up with uh the creator or the collector pass it was all right well we had i think 200 000 wallets connected to pre-med who had signed up for regis registered for lists and stuff and so i said all right well you know they all don't care about these advanced collector tools how many of them would uh 5 cool that seems right you know ten thousand is a nice number for the nft community and it seemed like oh five percent that seems i could see converting five percent of my users into a premium thing that seems standard okay cool we'll do that um we've now had over a million wallets connect to premish as a couple days ago um and so i get a lot of from people saying like well wait you're you're gating these collector features to just such a tiny group you know you should be selling it's funny to watch the community argue about this actually like people kind of come to the defense because some people are like you shouldn't be limiting and other people are like they could make so much more money if they were to do like 100 000 of these or unlimited supply like it's an interesting debate i actually don't know right this is all an experiment who knows what what would happen if we were to like do 50 000 or let gary vee and uh be friends do like a 55 000 collection to me you know it's people like why'd you keep it at 10 000. my answer is like it just feels right for right now at this stage of the company who knows what what the next um looks like i i still really like that number but um but yeah i think that there's definitely potentially a financial cost to it because i can only have 10 000 customers right and you can only set you know royalties it sounds like to a certain point which i actually did not realize and this is something that i i also have qualms with i think the royalties should be able to be said at the smart contract level which they can be but it doesn't it doesn't work properly right now i you can tell i'm not technical yeah uh so it's that at the at the marketplace no i'm with you i actually didn't i was talking to the diversions team the night before we launched uh the collector pass and i'm i hate these like you know i think i've shown that i like to launch stuff and change it a lot and just kind of like tweak it depending on what users want so the idea of something that is non-fungible is terrifying to me so i remember when i was like the night before i was like okay we're gonna lock the smart contract in oh my god like i was terrified of even like which wallet should i have the money go to should it be a ledger should it be that you know like this is a decision i have to forever and i was like what should the royalties be we decided on the royalties but what if we're wrong and diversion seems like all the marketplaces ignore whatever the contract says you said it at the marketplace level and i was like really and they're like yeah it's it's meaningless and i was like oh okay well that's fine which i find very strange and sort of very anti the ethos of this space in some ways though it is nice that you can i guess adjust it but i didn't realize that these marketplaces capped it because i'm really excited and i've now talked recently several times in the show about this this model and micah johnson mentioned it to me who's doing aku like you know for like a movie for example you could sell a movie direct to consumers through like a million nfts and that's the only way you could access the movie that person pays 15 to like it's a theater movie or i don't know whatever pick your number and then they resell it not to make a profit but basically to have been able to watch that content for free the original creator takes a 70 royalty so they're not really losing much on you know for the next person or whatever and then um and you basically got free content so it's not that you're trying to make a profit off that but i think that's fascinating i think you could see that is subscription services like i think there's so much you could see there where you're getting more money in the pocket of a consumer you're getting you're still getting money in the pocket of the creator and if those marketplaces won't let you i don't know there's a business there there's some there's servicing that kind of a thing i agree and and to me you know it's not like these marketplaces are intentionally trying to be bad about this like no you know i'm the openc team i know a bunch of them and they're all good people and they've got a million problems and this is on their list of things that they need to solve and so i think that what we'll probably see is at least being like that policy is different depending on the token type right maybe utility tokens or something like that are allowed for different or maybe they just let it be whatever it's going to be but um or maybe you know once you hit a certain level of you know once you get verified then you have more of a control i don't know i think they're doing it in the ultimately they're doing it to protect the collector right now and it's generally fine um the creators are having to deal with it i think that as these new models roll out i think they're going to have to adjust because ticketmaster is not going to you know ticketmaster wanted to do a 50 royalty or something which would be stupid but they just wouldn't list on openc you know they build their own marketplace and openc is going to want that transaction volume and so it'll work itself out yeah we didn't get into some of the specific new features that you're rolling out at pre-med or maybe have rolled out that i'm excited about it and we're running close to time i want to ask you one kind of macro question and if there's 30 seconds left we'll get into maybe a couple of specific features of premium that i'm excited about the macro question is what do you think is the future for the speculative nft trading we just had this downturn yesterday it seems to be bouncing back today it's friday may 13th as we're recording this your business model is sort of right now predicated on lots of drops and people trying to get in and is that gonna stick around what do you think is the future for that i mean it's so fun i was laughing about this this morning because i you know we everyone i know has spent the last two days writing blog posts and tweet storms about the end of times and the bear market that we're entering because of like a couple days of of a downturn right and then there's macro forces at play too interest rate hikes and vc slow down and you know there's lots of things i think playing into that but there here there is but i think that um we just don't know what it's going to look like we don't know you know it's like sometimes when the price goes down nft prices you know on in the e to go up because you it's now is and then it comes up and the mft stays or sometimes it goes it's all like someone was trying to help ask me to justify the secondary price of the pre-med collector pass and i was like listen i spent a lot of praise i was like i spent a lot of time making sure that the mint price i would be able to deliver the value that the mid price that is the only thing that i focused on and i can't have any control over anything else because some days the price goes up because there's a rumor some days the price goes up because it's thursday like there's no logic i haven't as someone who spends a lot of time in space i have not found a lot of logic to it um so i think that um and and the reason i think it's important is because when people are just looking at the money if they don't see like the opportunity to make a ton of money there might be less interest they might hold back that might slow down some of the mints and all that i think that um you know we're just going to hit different stages of maturity of this market there was a time where you could pick an animal throw it you know put a different colors background behind it and say this is a pfp collection and launch it and everyone would want to buy it um then so many people did that that it's hard now you have to do more work i think it's like any other creator class where there's going to be it's just going to take more work to be successful but that's that's a good thing um i see people who use preeminent as like preeminent initially was used by top creators like xcopy and for rogues for rug radio and shaq used it for his drive it was like used for for people who were like we need to avoid the gas war i feel like there's a an equal amount of people now using pre-men as like a marketing tool as a market testing tool being like i'm gonna launch an access so i'm gonna see what the the appetite for what i'm gonna do is so i'm fine and i think that like i think that people will still need there will be tons of people who want to be creative in the space i mean the celebrities are all itching to get in which that's a whole different episode whether or not that makes any sense but i feel like there's so many people regardless of what the market does they're going to be like no we need to get into this i think there's going to be plenty of opportunities for creators um we might see prices adjust i think great projects are still going to be in demand regardless of what the market looks like it just will be maybe at a different level so all right i'm going to say the the thing that i'm most excited about that you mentioned was pre-mint focusing on on building out some analytic tools for creators and how it's crazy that creators go into mint day being like i have no idea how much of my project is gonna mind out i mean with the rare except moon birds obviously knows they're gonna mint out but like you know for the most part creators you launch a project and you don't know how it's gonna go and there's and there's tools you can look at the history of different wallets who sign up for your allow list who mints who doesn't and and be able to gauge is your how many of your projects you're gonna sell i love that i think that's awesome that so obviously is needed i don't know if you want to say 30 seconds on that before we we hop off but one feature i'll highlight yeah i mean i think i think for pre-med on the creator side to be successful we need to basically make and we can't guarantee a sellout because we can't make a project interesting but hopefully we can make sure that you know what your mint day is going to look like that's that would be like the pinnacle for me um would be getting to the point where you'd be like cool like for the premier collector pass we had 36 000 people sign up we were selling 10 000 of them and i went to bed the night before having no clue whether or not we'd sell out i just had no idea and that i feel like you should be able to know you know what your list how if your list is going to show up so we're building a ton of stuff on the creator side to be able to identify bots to stop bots from coming in the first place to be able to identify the bots that are there to be able to have a sense of better like the quality of the lists of the on the wallets on your list to be able to like i tweeted last night just sort of to ask the community like what a referral program looks like for pre-men um we sort of built one behind the scenes where someone tweets about you and then someone goes and signs up from that tweet it does like sort of start tracking like what you're who's like drawing drinking a lot of people in um i think there's all kinds of stuff on that side to build so much yeah and i'm really excited for that there's also like the concept of hey like okay you sign up on the list you were picked as a winner will you reconfirm that you want this thing in the next 24 hours and if not your spot goes to someone else like there's that i teased an idea and it's literally just an idea around like when you win you get to mint a mint pass for free and then there's sort of like you the creator can say and i had 10 000 people who won 8 000 people minted the mint pass so therefore there's at least 8 000 people who are interested right there's so many ways to like derive interest and figure out who on the list is so that is going to be really fun um but ultimately the goal is to make sure that the creator knows what the midday is going to be like on the collector side um you know it's it's really hard because some of these projects are it's really hard to judge what's going to be popular or not because so much hype is such a big deal right for a while you can be like well if the twitter followers are growing really fast that means it's getting it's getting more hyped and it's probably going to sell out that means the mint price is probably going to be low compared to the value later that day or later that week but now people manipulate that so for the on the collector's side like my goal is to make it fundamentally like as the collectors signing up on all these lists makes organize their life for them make sure that they know what they've signed up for what they've won what they have when the mint is like some basic stuff still hasn't been solved in this space um but then also like how do you how do you evaluate projects and like how do we show you the projects that seem to be doing well and that you should be looking at how do we show you projects that you qualify for so if you have a moon bird like there might be five projects that are offering spots to moonberry people this week you might not know about any of them so how do we like look at your collection surface all the stuff that you are very eligible for what you should sign up you know and we have to find a way to do it in a way that is not financial advice because that's an area that we can't get into like it's not investment advice it's not financial advice but it's sort of like and that's legally the hardest part how do we like give you a little bit of information that is useful without saying like you should follow our advice and that's like that's the hardest part about a weird line yeah i love that i mean that's when discord is such a nightmare at this point and it's like i just want alerts for when there's like an access list i can be signing up for like i don't need to see the rest of the discord stuff like just tell me that you know um yeah awesome well brendan we'll have to have you back on there's there's so much more i'd love to delve into with you the financialization of everything what you think is like this concept that's very tied to the creator economy we'd love to get your thoughts on like are we just financializing everything to a detriment or to you know beautiful utopia um so we'll have you back on at some point it's your daughter's birthday so you gotta go celebrate happy birthday to uh to the baby but uh thank you so much for being here thank you for having me i really appreciate it oh i'll shout out one thing before we go you know we didn't fully go into all of the weeds of pre-mint i'll shout out my friend zenika had a conversation with you recently on zenika's youtube channel that really i think dives into to pre-mint specifically so if there's anything
