most d5 protocols are not run like businesses because if you were like if you were actually running your protocol like a business then you would make sure that it has sufficient liquidity to pay wages and invest throughout the bear market but we are seeing the opposite we are seeing that many protocols did very poor treasury management and now find themselves in a position where they have to reduce the head count they have to stop incentive programs they have to raise money at peak low prices and this is all things that if you had someone in charge of treasury management who had worked at a traditional company before i mean these are very basic things i think if projects thought of themselves more as businesses then you wouldn't see some of these easy mistakes
