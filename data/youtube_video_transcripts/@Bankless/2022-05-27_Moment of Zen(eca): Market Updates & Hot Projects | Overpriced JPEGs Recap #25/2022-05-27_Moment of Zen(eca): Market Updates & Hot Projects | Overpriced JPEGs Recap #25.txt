too can get into web3 all right seneca we're back i said relative stability of the nft market and you gave me a look for anybody who was on the podcast so i sense you do not feel like there's stability in the nft market give me the macro update from your perspective yeah well it's sort of like stability in both the nft market and sort of the crypto market and up until like we recorded this 12 hours ago i would have been in much more agreement but sort of woke up today and eth was down i think eight percent 10 it really just crashed now kylie's giving me a look with her eyes like no did you see this so my uh my fiance wrote a book and he the book came out yesterday so we had like a big celebratory dinner and drinks and whatever so the last 12 hours i've been less plugged in than i typically would be so cool got it market crash this is why we don't celebrate or do anything but track crypto markets at all times right it's um i mean it's come back a bit so it it's been basically sitting at 2k well ethan's been at 2k for like since we last spoke two weeks and that has certainly been relatively stable and the nft market's been doing various things but then yeah today eth was at i think it hit 1750 at one point it was down 10 now it's back to 1900 and again who knows by the time this recording goes out it could be wherever but let's let's assume it settles around 2k because that's that would be a nice result and i think that you know everyone be happy and and i can sort of speak more to that than than who knows what whatever speculatively could happen so as you alluded it's been sort of relatively stable for the last two weeks and i think that historically when crypto is stable so the price of ether stable nfts have a tendency to run it's very difficult for nfcs to go like completely bonkers up or even down per se um when ether is like zigzagging all over the place because people sort of want to see where it settles and there's all sorts of other stuff going on not to mention gas is often high when when ethan's doing a bunch of crazy stuff but um yes we've seen ether 2k for a couple of weeks and it's while the market is certainly bearish like we're down so much from all-time highs both in east terms and in usd terms because the price of beef has dropped uh it had been it's been feeling like the last week or so i don't know projects are like slipping through and project the good projects are minting out and their floor prices going up blue chips had relatively stabilized like there wasn't too much bleeding going on um for like bought apes anymore doodles had sort of settled moon birds were doing well um and yeah i mean it's sort of like we're setting into a new normal and who knows how long this is going to last for it could be another two days and then bull market hits could be three more months of this it could be two years i don't think it's gonna be two years but yeah who knows uh it's been a nice pleasant stable period where uh again it's just like builders can build and i can't say build without the meme okay without the kevin okay money yeah i just i just can't say that it's ruined it for everyone yeah um but anyway so it sounds like you think we're doing like a bounce along the bottom thing right where we're relatively with at the bottom and we'll have some rallies we'll have some falls like we're seeing with the last 12 hours but that this is this is a bounce along the bottom moment is that what i'm hearing yeah i mean that's what the optimist did me thinks uh obviously there's a chance like eth could drop to 1200 1500 900 in pretty disastrous scenarios but i think given and i think i might have spoken about this last time the the collapse of terror the azuki drama the macro economic situation the world everything going just crazy uh i think the crypto market has shown like a resilience that it may not have shown in 2017 and that's sort of like it's like this support level out again 2k ish that to me fills me with confidence and just sort of like not even looking at metrics this sentiment check hanging out in discords talking to people a lot of people who are bearish even they are saying all right now i'm going to start buying or like i'm setting in like um dollar cost average sell orders in you know laddering down at this point and and you know i'm not going to try and time the bottom but and then catch a falling knife but i want to like start buying in because it seems like a good turnaround and there's a lot of good buying opportunities so yeah bounce across the bottom is my gun in my head i would say i feel this is bottom-ish but you know obviously no one really knows anything i would distinguish between nfts and eth in this case or crypto right largely you know as as markets mature their bottoms get higher obviously and their and their fall in percentage terms gets lower like eth fell whatever it was 95 i think in the last you know bull then crash market and i don't know what it's fallen from its max here i think it's 70 percent or 65 or so it's something in that range which is obviously a good percentage bit higher than the 95 percent fell the last time but i think you're seeing other alt ones fall more along those or you know those those layer you know one kind of your well terra luna fully collapsed but yeah avalanche whatever some of these others having these more these steeper falls which i think is a result of there being newer right so lana fell bigger because of the new ecosystems and if they survive it next time around the next crash you know they'll fall less like people have been talking about this in in terms of amazon right amazon fell 95 during the first you know tech bubble collapse and then every time there's been bear markets it's fallen less and less until now it's obviously a deeply stable company in many ways um nfts are weird because nfts are newer right they're not ethereum they haven't been around in the kind of market that exists today since 2014 the way ethereum has for 2015 so um i have been surprised that they haven't fallen further obviously you've some projects that i just basically have no liquidity and are dead but and it almost makes me nervous that there's more of a crash to come because it feels better than i thought it was gonna be and that just makes me very nervous i also think if you want to make the the super bear case michael bury do you know michael who michael burgess uh the bot yeah wait no i'm thinking dr berry um sorry michael bury is the one he he got famous because of the big short if you've seen that movie or read that book he basically called the 2008 crisis now he was way too early but he's like this freak right who was literally reading the details of the mortgages that had been given out so he could quite literally see that like all these mortgages had been given to people who really could not afford their mortgage and so he was like hand picking mortgage-backed securities like these security that he wanted to bet against because he could see that the underlying like that the people who had bought these houses like couldn't afford them so he was like hand-picking the ones that he thought were gonna fail and of course he did very very well during 2008 because he just shorted basically the whole subprime mortgage market um and he's he's making the case that we have so much further to fall and look he's looking at the equities market in particular and showing that like we're still like above historical averages and that if we fell another 50 or something you would still be in line with some historical averages you know i know michael bury but again i'm sort of a cynic so like i hear somebody who i respect make that case and i'm like that's it further to fall so anyway that's i i'm a little bit bracing for there's still more pain ahead and that this isn't just bounce along the bottom though i think eath is probably i don't think eath will go below like 1500. i think eath is actually probably close to its bottom long rant over yeah um it really is interesting when you look at nfts uh a because like every nft collection is sort of different and distinct and sort of has their own little micro market uh but also it's like there's this strong correlation with eth and then it's like how do maybe it's fallen um let's say board apes have fallen i don't know almost 50 from the all-time high um in eth terms but then if you look at it in usd terms it's like 70 80 75 or something it's it's really i mean gone down a lot same with punks and stuff so it yeah i mean obviously there's always more room to fall but i think um i mean if bought apes and say i mean moon birds are probably down the same they're down 40 percent in east terms from all time high and then maybe 60 70 in usd um that's a pretty sizable drop and then and these are like the better collections there's so many lower tier collections that are down 80 90 percent from their all-time high in east and that's what it already is at the 95 mark if you look at it in usd terms um obviously there's more room to fall but uh i don't know i just nfts are so strange to me because yeah and i know this is a dangerous way of thinking but they're just so unlike any other asset market like the emotional connection people have the um the fact that you only need a few thousand people deciding hey i don't want to sell at the like below this price and and have a strong community they're almost like mini cults and it's really strange but it's it's you know you just need a certain number of people going i i value my goblin at 20th i'm looking to sell it less than that or i bought eight at 90. and there's basically just if there's no new sellers then even if there's no new buyers the market's not going to crash necessarily yeah yeah but if there are no new buyers price becomes an illusion because like you can say the prices well and i'll talk about this in a minute because i this we'll get to this when i talk a little bit about chimpers because that was a project that was blowing my mind i was messaging about it like how have i not heard of this chimpers project and then i think i've i think i found my answer but we'll get there so you're right nfts are weird the the emotional connection there's so many dependencies to this market that don't exist necessarily in other markets like you just don't feel an attachment to your amazon equity you know like your amazon stock the way you're going to to your dead fella and that does create a totally different dynamic i think if things really crash further though and the macro geopolitical situation for example gets worse of any number of these kind of tenuous situations right now that feel a little bit stable not that ukraine is stable but if we're here in the west we're lucky enough to kind of not be feeling it um if they get a little bit worse in any way i i think that you know people are going to start selling nfts in a because they're down from their all-time highs but who's to say those all-time highs were remotely the correct valuation and and that's where it's a little bit it just gets funky so anyways not trying to be the doomsayer here obviously please everyone i'm not i'm still not selling right like i've had nfts even go up i mean my v friends are up and i i haven't sold anything i'm still white knuckling it i believe in a lot of these projects in the long term i'm still just trying to wrap my head around how do we price these things it's this is the first time with this market that we're having a bear market like this you know within the nft market after such a bull run in the nft market because all of this is so brand new so we just don't know how any of this is going to shape out um yeah i mean we sort of had a little bit of it last year in uh sorry august the bull market and then like october november december was bearish and it felt different though didn't it every yeah it did but like it's every cycle feels different which is strange because we had a similar thing in like may last year as well um and then yeah it's like bounce back bounce back even this year but in may of last year it's like you had like cyber cons like what even yeah maybe last year there was like four projects four people buying yeah it's very different than i mean you didn't even have board apes yet board apes aren't even a year old no they are they had their one year birthday uh i thought board apes were in july no april 30th i think 30th or like end of april yeah oh wow okay okay okay anyway that bad carl bad influencer yeah um but that's still like it's they're basically a year old um january we had like a bullish bullish month and then like it's sort of been a slow bleed ever since then but then april i think we saw another like spike up all-time highs for a bunch of projects and then crashing down again and i don't know it's no one knows like it's it's just throwing data to dartboard and uh i sort of i so i wrote a twitter thread this morning and talking about um if you're feeling and i've mentioned this before if you're feeling really uh like stick to your stomach you're heart sinking and anxious and depressed it's it's often just a sign that you're overextended you're over leveraged your portfolio management and the allocation diversification is just off whack and so you should use this as a sign that well maybe i have too much of my portfolio and nfts and i should have some in um not that the other asset classes are doing fantastic right now but even stable coins and cash like that is that should be a a part of your portfolio yeah yeah absolutely i mean i learned that less than this time i you know i i had enough of angst when it felt like there was there was a night there where i really was like this is this all gonna go to zero like you know like is it literally all gonna be wiped out uh and it of course wasn't but in that moment i was like oh okay i'm feeling things that indicate to me that i let myself get a little bit too deep in this in this hole and um it's it is a great you know if you're fortunate enough that you're still paying your bills and all the rest of it like it's a good learning experience and it's something you can take forward with you last thing i'll ask on this macro front before we move on to some of the specific happenings going on in the in the world in nfts today um are you tracking the merge at all and uh have any thoughts on on that and the price of eth i have some some thoughts i am uh loosely tracking it i mean i i sort of hear things on twitter and in places and it seems last i heard it was looking really good to be happening around like august uh and then but then i saw a twitter thread yesterday the day before about how i think on the beacon chain there was a re-org of the block basically so they had like seven blocks were confirmed and they had to go back and undo it which we haven't seen on mainnet for years and years and years and it might be a sign that more work needs to be done to so we avoid that and i i i'm nowhere near technical uh technically-minded enough to know if that's gonna delay it or anything but prior to that everyone sort of who was it anyone really seemed bullish that it was going to happen in august or september august yeah yeah in case somebody doesn't know what we're talking about this is moving to proof of stake uh on ethereum which is going to be very i think um bullish for eth in you know when it happens so there's a great bankless episode i'll plug my i don't know parent company you can call it banquets the lovely bank list they did an interview with a guy named hal pressfield uh called betting the fund on the merge if you want to go check out that episode and this is a kind of a trad five guy who's gotten very into crypto and has a hedge fund and is basically like betting heavily on the merge really pumping the price of eth based on supply demand dynamics and just he makes a very strong case why um you know supply basically falls creating you know price uh pumps after we move to um to proof of stake and and like expense revenue dynamics right like ethereum is generates revenue and right now a lot of the expenses are are tied into the fact that it's proof of work and when it moves to proof of stake those expenses fall so if you're like evaluating it like a business those are really favorable dynamics anyway i certainly can't articulate this way he did but i would say go check it out he was bullish that it would happen in august september um interesting to hear you just said i hadn't been tracking the beacon chain piece so yeah i know they're right now testing on a couple different test nets and different chains so that's the process they're in now and if those go i think relatively smoothly that's when the august timeline should be hit i saw a tweet again i think this morning sort of like the bear case for the merge or i'm not basically saying uh what if the merge has already been priced in because like everyone knows that it's coming but rather a successful merge has been priced in but like a delay your unsuccessful merge has not and yes maybe that's the case but it's been delayed like 20 000 times already i feel like honestly that i would say a lot of people are still saying they would hear oh the merger's coming in august and they're like yeah we'll believe it when we see it it's gonna come next year it's gonna be delayed again and again and again so yeah i agree i don't i don't think it's priced in the other thing that that hal got into i mean maybe it's priced in a little but i think too many people are still a little bit uncertain about it how i got into like if you were to look at like evaluate on like a price to earnings basis and again earnings depends on how you consider expenses and how you know that you can play with these numbers but i i forget their specifics but it's basically like right now the pde ratio on eth would be like 165 or something but then after the merge it'll drop down to like five or again i probably probably butchered these numbers but it's dramatic you know according to the way that he's looking at this and he lays out a compelling case so it's just hard to me you know looking at it from that lens it's hard to see it as being priced in because the pde whatever the pde ratio was just felt so obviously off based on what it should be uh i don't know go listen to the hal pressfield episode again parroting some of this so so always go go direct to the source but wanted to address that i feel like the nft market isn't talking about it that much but it's certainly going to impact us so yeah okay any oh any projects you're eyeing right now we've we've sort of talked about this each time we've we've been at the bear market existing projects existing projects that you're like considering buying has your strategy change at all are you still white knuckling it um i'm basically holding i'm i'm selling goblins because i i bought a bunch of them and they were increasing it's hilarious that you bought all these goblins i want to talk about that we'll get into that um that's the only thing i'm really selling i'm buying um art blocks is basically the only thing that i'm buying still because i have literally and i say this excuse me like every month or two months and it's become like a running meme in in my group chat but i go i i see something i'm like i've never been more bullish on art blocks than than i am now and i saw snowferry speak it's he was speaking at stanford yesterday and like there was a zoom link that and just hearing him talk for 20 minutes about art blocks to a room of of curious interested people asking questions about how it works i it was inspiring and again just made me feel infinitely bullish on art blocks and generative art in general so most of basically all the stuff i'm buying is there um or i'm mostly just holding actually i'm interviewing snow fro at consensus so if you all are going to be at consensus oh my god come hang out wow um i'm looking at cyber brokers i mentioned that i've been looking at fly fish club and then of course like after i said that it was like 2.3 2.4 i was looking at it and it's out like 3.7 i'm like cool cool missed that boat um cyber brokers it was down like 2.3 2.2 i actually bought one yeah you did yesterday that was um when when the goblin floor flipped this i was just like this is ridiculous i sold goblins and bought cyber breakers and i probably was the goblins hi is that like one two last time i saw it one point two uh 2.5 i think oh my god yeah and it's over two still it no it's not check it right now check it right now you're telling me right now it's over two two point one eight shut the front door you've man this industry is so weird i'm not cut out for this [ __ ] yeah it we kind of deserve just to go to zeros this is why i'm so cynical because i'm looking yeah okay bears i was like and not okay bears no no no no no there's um okay duck yacht club yeah that's it i quit i [ __ ] quit i know i'm just waiting for the not okay duck yacht club no probably flip goblins god damn yeah okay so all right what we gotta do let's let's do goblin town then cyber brokers you bought one great i know i should probably um but i'm just again i'm just like white knuckling i can't i don't know it's the human psychology of like you know i'll i'll buy once at all pumps again you know i'll buy the top um so let's talk about goblin town okay goblin goblin town goblin town.wtf i feel like this thing has a bunch of names it feels like it came out of nowhere i was trying to get to like the origin story of this but i realized they don't have a discord which i actually love and i'll i'll get to that but uh you wanna you wanna talk about goblins when you decide to start buying in what what prompted you the story yeah it is it basically came up out of nowhere it's like this stealth project no one knows who's behind it um or the team it's you know my favorite love those yeah exactly it's um although uh i would say like again similar to azuki it's like they've executed well like they're good at marketing which you know for better or worse is um anyway i just heard about them as you heard about here about most projects just like oh i'm in a discord someone mentioned it in zen academy i think someone mentioned in proof i was in and out of calls meetings podcast stuff and so i just kind of ignored it and then i got a couple of dms from people saying um do you like um freeman's or like maybe like this is a website you you might like this so i actually clicked on and went to the website and that's when i was like huh this is cool website website's well made um the arts cool the music it's just thematically really nice and then it just got me with all the right buzzwords free mint cc0 no roadmap like that's me and then that's i've ate into so many projects like if someone out there wants to like target me and get me to meet your project that's just put that on yeah um but it had minted out like it was free mint one per wallet 10k collection and i i was like all right and then i saw on secondary is like .03 something and i mean i was just like i i i just liked it and that's without even considering the meme like people have been talking about goblin town for a couple of months on twitter just memeing about going to goblin towns as the bear market you go to dublin it's just like yeah and but i need you to explain that more i haven't been i haven't seen that so goblin town is just like a term for the bear market kind of yeah it's just like we're going to i don't know exactly where it uh originated from i think in lord of the rings there's a goblin town and it's just like yeah i i don't i don't know exactly the etymology of the meme but it is [Laughter] you know the memeology the whatever the origin story it's great phrase great phrase yeah um but i had heard it like 50 times on crypto twitter over the last this year basically and so power and memes it's i i i just almost never bet against memes and it was it was also at a time in the market where everyone's sort of down and depressed and just like they wanted something fun and again freeman is just like that's that's a good thing like people aren't like the team was not gonna make any money unless the project did well basically so i think that maybe that's why people were more happy to support an anonymous team uh and obviously they made just a ton of money off royalties now and they kept a thousand wait i can tell you exactly what they've made off royalties as of last night i did some and it was doing something he did some math yeah i think i did this right it so the the the average price of it so far that's what you know open sea will show you the average price the average price is like 0.32 um does that sound low i think that's probably right maybe but advertised yeah oh but that that's just open seat because there would be other marketplace anyways on openc was like average price point three two there'd been like five point seven thousand you know 5700 volume trading volume multiplied that together and then i don't think you have to multiply the trading you just look at it says there's open seas has volume traded and like right now it's 9400 eth and that's just the entire amount of sales so it's just like whatever the royalty percentage is of that so seven and a half percent so i [ __ ] that up i think i'm so clever and i way over complicated um yeah anyway they they probably made about like 700 eth from open sea in secondary damn yeah that's way higher than i thought because i was trying to do the math yeah and i did the math stupid because i wasn't thinking the volume traded was literally an east but you're 100 right and so i was like wow they've made way less money than i thought they would have uh well great hopefully great yeah hopefully i'll just learn something about how to calculate this everyone's like yeah we already knew how you're the one idiot who was like trying to do like extra math on this um okay so 700 ether yep made a killing yeah um yeah but they kept a thousand for the team as well which that was the one thing that i was like um i'm okay with that if there's no royalties yeah but and which you know obviously you know the team should get rewarded if they produce something and it does well um i think doing both is a little greedy even for a free mint but you know that's nitpicking anyway it it it took off the community loved it meme that ran with it there was a twitter spaces last night that was literally the most fun i've had in a twitter space in history it was just um goblins talking goblin talk and just making goblin sounds and then like oh my god yeah it reminds me of the the eight clubhouses where people i i was never actually in these but i've heard that back in like early days of the brought up yacht club people just make ape noises and then goblins were doing that and then shoot like people would come up and like ask a question and then they'd just try talking normally and then they'd just be like human and then just really just just stay in character and and and then the goblin team yeah the goblin well the goblin count twitter account and then i don't know who else is up there just a bunch of people goblin pfps whether it was community members having fun or the team members um but yeah then k money got up and then just it was there were like 2 000 people listening a space for like hours of just the goblin town community team just making sounds at like 6 a.m for me and i was saying to tune out it was fun it was wise wow that's hilarious i look i'm with you i i like i like the bold in your face this is what we are this is who we are you know it's what i loved about your zen academy thing was you were like yeah i don't i'm literally promising you nothing like don't buy this if you don't have the money for it like you know like just like anti-marketing on your part of just like this is quite literally i'm telling you exactly what this is going to be and you should know exactly what you're getting and then you know so and what you're not getting and um you know so they're they're sort of like it's a free mint royalties are seven and a half percent right like we're holding a thousand of them there's no discord there's no road map it's cc zero just like [ __ ] it like that i really respect that kind of very upfront vibe and it was it was incredibly well marketed um in terms of the the website was was great and all the rest of it it's so i i fully respected the project if you're gonna do a free mint like i i and you're gonna be really upfront about everything that you are and you aren't like i oh i don't hold you responsible for then yeah whatever's gonna come later right more people are like well it's not worth to eat well you know y'all did this yeah um and so but it does it does strike me that it's it's fully you know you you say it's betting on memes which is true but it feels like it fits into this broader category of like this space rewards vagueness and punishes specificity which is to say this project was very specific in that it has no plans you know and there's something about just like who knows like it can be anything that that the the space tends to just pump up and then projects that have a very clear map of what they're trying to do actually end up getting uh sort of price suppressed relative to these other projects that pump for that and that i find to be a strange dynamic that i don't love about the space now we haven't figured out how to price things in like if you are making a movie if you are making a show what does that mean you're worth it it's hard to know um but this did feel like you fit into that broader uh challenge there's also all these there's been these like rumors like it's part of fluff world it's part of yoga it seems like all of that is is it was probably the biggest one and people were running with it for a while maybe some people still think i i don't think it's at all affiliated just seems very unlikely yeah just to me but who knows um the fluff world one i think fluff world or the team behind fluff world they have their own goblin project and it's like an entirely different thing and i think people just confused the two i heard someone say they thought beeple was behind this and and it's just it's crazy the the rumors but um the reality is we don't know uh much at if at all i think the hugo one i just it just doesn't seem right to me the the i agree i don't think some of the traits are like they have like uh there's like a trait dissing azuki it's like um it's someone's wearing a shirt and it's got like tendes funks zanks azuki and that's just like that's one of the treats and then there's a mcdonald's hat as a treat and it's like yuga would not you'd put a mcdonald's hat on a anyway or a nasa suit um yeah i agree i agree i don't think it's them uh okay let's talk we've got we've got we got a lot of the agenda today we've got oddities i went to v con was sad you weren't there but it would be great yeah i'll see you at nftnyc let's do oddities uh this is another one that i'd love to have you walk me through as a non-moon birds holder tears i uh you know there's a lot of pain associated with tracking what the moon bird's ecosystem is doing so uh so tell me tell me what's going on with oddities yeah so oddities is it was basically a free airdrop to anyone who had a nested moon bird so nesting is basically like staking without staking yeah it doesn't actually leave your wallet but um they want to reward people who the basic idea i think behind it was they want to reward people who have held their um moon bird for longer and i think kevin's analogy was like you know if someone bought a bought a just for ape drop they got the same amount of rewards as someone who held from day one and so anyway um they said if you're in advance of of oddities they were teasing it around like just an image of it and they said airdrop coming if you're nesting so people knew that they could get it and and most people had their uh moon birds nested and then they just airdropped these um what are they they're like pellets pellets yeah like and and oddities i think are bird vomit or is sort of what i'm i'm yeah which is is insane that it's so valuable but um prior to the the airdrop you know kevin was talking about how this is a an artist that's like everyone knows the artist and et et cetera and then afterwards it uh revealed the artist as gremplin who was just a super og prolific artist in the space of the crypto project um nouns down one of one art yeah instrumental announced owl also an advocate of cc zero by the bite big advocate cryptos was like the the first big cc well i guess it was that and blit maps i feel like where the map was uh first but cryptos i think is the one that had the biggest narrative around it um nouns maybe i can't remember if nouns were cc0 at launch or they decided to be that way later on anyway i think they oh i don't remember either i was going to say they voted later but that was also blip maps voted later yeah so i'm now conflating them all yeah uh anyway so uh everyone gotta drop these these pellets they're been hovering around three eighth floor pretty much consistently since the drop i think they were like four and a bit for a little while but sat at three uh and then they said reveal is july sometime which is ages away uh in the nft space and so we don't know too much about it other than they're going to be a sort of distinct offshoot from moon birds and this was not part of the original road map uh it was not really planned i believe what happened was gremplin approached kevin proof team room bird's team uh and said hey you know i have an idea you know can we do this thing and they were like sure and then they did it and and now gremlin is is involved with it and they're just running it and then they have their original plans for moon birds running in tandem um yeah that's about what i what i know of it i saw an interesting post uh i think it's dado who is lovely on twitter and it was basically making the point that cool cats genesis they're down to three eth cool cats jennifer i mean the tweet i'll just read it out it says would you rather have a genesis cool cats nft third generation al vomit or fourth generation digital land making the point that moon bird oddities is you know i guess he's calling it third generation owl vomit and then the other deeds you know the other side universe uh hugo labs versus are also about three eth um a piece and so he's saying like cool cats is the same price as the the oddities and the and the other side and like you know he's obviously it's a very leading question the way he's phrased this he's saying you should want cool cats i am i feel like i'm the only person on earth who seems to be as fascinated by the cool cats thing like they they're at three eth they were like once considered such blue chip i feel like they're just like i think i've used this terminal like the ugly stepsister of nfts now like they just like fell into oblivion and i'm so confused by the fact that there's not more conversation around it or am i just missing that conversation uh oh yeah i mean i think there's some conversation but it's not a massive topic it's they've just sort of like slowly faded from just relevancy which is um obviously sad and and they were just such like they were considered the blue chip it was bought apes it was punk sport apes cool and then the third position was like cool cats gutter cats and then cool cats sort of broke away and like sort of had that really high floor for a while um had great plans great branding around the family friendliness and et cetera et cetera they're doing a lot of cool stuff and then i think sort of whether they did this or not but the community certainly thinks that they sort of went all in on this cooltopia idea this game is layer 2 the cool pets the milk token and almost however you look at it that has been sort of a disaster like uh i don't want to call it a failure because the whole market is down and who knows where it's going to go from here and they have shipped a product and people do say the game is fun but in terms of like timeline it was meant to be in like end of january i think and there was delay after delay up delay issue after issue um and then i think people just kind of got fed up with tracking it and staying on top of it so that and then when the game did finally get released it had been so much so so long so far along that there was so many other things happening in the market that it just didn't capture the attention as it would have back then um and i mean i still and they also did some i think again i'm not 100 sure some crazy thing like two months ago where they sort of increased the secondary market royalties to on the collection just to sort of increase revenue and they're like well you know to fund the game development et cetera et cetera um and they got a lot of backlash a because community hates when people projects do that but b it was like well you didn't even ship a great project and now you want to increase royalties that just seems backwards um oh and they had the whole drama about the ceo quitting or they brought a ceo on and then they left or something and then yeah the ceo left and now they're looking for a new one yeah i i so let me ask you i mean i take this question seriously if i'm sure you have all three of these things but i know you do right but if you you know weren't zenica with all of your ethan fancy nfts and things like on the merits which would you rather have a cool cat an oddity or uh an other deed lamp piece of land uh i've actually been asked this question like four times this week just because i'm like a lot of people are wondering this um in my discord and stuff uh and i and i say um when i'm not dying is um oddity that that's just my pick it's close they're all i think still great projects um and having exposure to the yuga ecosystem is fantastic but it's one of a hundred thousand seem to be two hundred thousand people lots of land and and that to me seems just i mean supply and demand is just crazy um and yeah it's which i've now ranted about several times on this podcast but um and then so okay let's say cool cats and oddities it's it's almost like cool cats uh on the way down clearly and they've fallen a lot the attention is not on them and it's going to take it's really difficult to bring the attention back onto an existing project um short of massive announcements and collaborations versus sort of a just recently launched project an upcoming project they have the reveal still to come and it's just like this year has been kind of all about proof moon birds and oddities the grails project everything that they're doing is like really executing on a high level and even in the bear market both the proof pass and moon birds have sort of been i think holding up better than any other project um percentage-wise and it's exposure to that ecosystem in some way it's not like it's not an official well i don't know where it sits in like tier levels um but it's certainly very closely affiliated with with the whole thing and to me again i'm extraordinary i can't speak today extremely slash extraordinarily bullish on kevin rose and proof and moon birds in that whole ecosystem so ann gremlin is such an og artist so oddity is my pick yeah i think i agree i you know and part of it is that i have a cool pet which i've talked about before i still haven't figured out i just haven't taken the time to figure out how to hatch the thing so it's still just an egg which is part of the problem is it just feels a little bit i don't know if it's their fault or my fault right like that i don't know how to make my cool egg a cool pet or whatever you know um but so i'm a little bit in that ecosystem already so i i want to be in the kevin rose ecosystem and i'd also go probably oddity um let me ask you this because i've been somewhat bullish on cool cats ability to at least have another pump in them or something um and part of that has been on the basis of seeing like pudgy penguins come back to life right yeah but how much do you think i'm curious if almost like what happened with pudgy penguins was this like fast fall from grace where you had this community that was still really active holding the bag upset and feeling like oh my god this is you know i just lost a bunch of money and it crashed really fast and whatever and so there was all this eagerness for it to come back to life and the community to rally around it where cool cats just sort of had this slow descent of probably many of the original holders kind of selling off as things weren't happening so you don't have this community desperate for a rebound and therefore they may not have the same like the community may not have the same hunger for a resurgence what do you think of that theory yeah i mean i think it's a good theory and i would say for most projects we probably hold up true cool cats i would say probably are an exception because of just how popular they were how strong the community was and still is like i'm i don't want to dismiss the community sure there still is a strong community and they're doing a lot of cool things um and i i really like i said before how difficult it is for a project to turn around and get the attention back on them they really need a big announcement and thing cool cats is certainly the project that can do that like they have such an identifiable brand klon the artist is just a wonderful person and just yeah really passionate about the project and um you know i think i've had a lot of sort of criticism over the last few months talking about how they shouldn't have done the game and and they had such a perfect family-friendly brand why aren't there cool cat branded shirts in in target kmart whatever shops why aren't there um you know just whatever um events or tv shows comics that are family-friendly educating people about nfts via the cool cat ip and i think they have valuable ip still if they do something with it put a good team together launch something that is can can really go mainstream i think that can and probably will rally a big push at some point yeah okay all right remain bullish uh on a cool cat's resurgence someday uh somebody doesn't hold a cat but holds a uh an egg i mentioned this in the podcast before they hired like a really top-tier recruiting firm to find them a ceo like the if coca-cola is looking to find a ceo like this is who coca-cola looks to from like a recruiting firm perspective so like you know they're taking themselves seriously which i think is great living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to

metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 um okay let's talk vikon i don't know i don't have like a great hot take here it's funny it was it was awesome and i feel like all the probably the stuff you've been seeing out of it has been like really bullish and positive yeah um it's funny i went from permissionless which was the bankless block works more defy centered conference in palm beach to minneapolis to vcon so i went straight from one to the other so and i was moderating panels like basically every day for for both of these and in some cases like multiple panels a day so i basically just like spent that week like moderating things and then like prepping to moderate things and and um in some ways moderating panels i found like even required more legwork it felt like than interviews for a couple reasons one interviews are like one-on-ones and so i'm like researching one person it's pre-recorded so if something goes poorly you can redo the panels are live and it would be three or four people and so i like to do a lot of research so i'm researching like three or four people to really get a sense of them and then trying to think how do i make a 40 minutes or in some cases 25 minutes for a panel how do i make sure each person gets to talk enough like you can't go too deep with any of them anyways for this is not supposed to be a cardi event session it was lovely i feel so grateful to have got to do all this but it's also saying like i really didn't experience either conference that much yeah um i spent most of my time at vcon kind of behind the scenes which was fun because you got to see a lot of cool people i got to see like snoop when he arrived and he snoop dogg arrived like i would hope and expect snoop dogg to arrive which is like an entourage of people and somebody's bumping like music like some like rap song just like rolls up tall as [ __ ] in like like a leopard print like thing and just like it's just like everything you could want snoop dogg to be in real life just like actually chilling um and you know some other kind of big celebrities were there you got eva longoria huda katan who i got to interview that episode came out yesterday she's incredible she runs a multi-billion dollar beauty brand and uh just is such a genuine nft fan like you can tell she like actually just loves this stuff so cool um but and you know it was in this big it was in the i guess the viking stadium uh so massive stadium just really good vibes and energy i got to do some some events at night but i tweeted about this being an introvert like it really was i was like i did the panels i prepped for the panels i did like some level of schmoozing and then i was just like oh my god i need to just go wrap myself in a blanket and stare at a wall for the next like five years you know so um i you know i hope i'm not disappointing people without any more hot takes but uh it looked awesome it was great yeah it was great it looked like and talking to people it seems like it was the most well-run fun event for nfts that most people had been to that i've spoken to and that's that's huge it was incredibly well executed and i will say as from like a speaker perspective you know they they paid for all of our travel our hotels it was like you know a car came and picked us up from wherever we needed to took us to the airports you know drove us back like from uh uh you know being sort of a part of the event perspective i felt so taken care of like i haven't had that for any other conference i'm always playing with my own travel paying for my hotels whatever and so um you know that that level of detail kind of shows in in the end product i think if just really well handled uh you can tell i mean it's obvious because gary has been to thousands of conferences and so he he knows what it's like being the speaker and and just i'm sure knows what makes a good experience and yeah he's he's fantastic and yeah yeah and one of the big takeaways i don't know if this has been part of the chatter but but he or like you know on the final day he announced with snoop that they're collabing and that anybody who still holds a vcon ticket is going to get access to that collaboration so it's that he i think he's constantly trying to show people what's possible within the nft space and you know he's made he's said on a number of occasions ticketing being this this big opportunity for it if you happen to be at the world series game and your tickets an nft and you can now resell that you're in a world series game where something big happens and it has value down the line exactly i think he's doing that he's forcing that here by saying hey yeah we're gonna have a long tail for anybody who has these tickets and um yeah so he you know he is obviously very bullish on the gary ecosystem yeah i've been hoping that that might happen but um yeah i was also a bit bummed because i gave my ticket away and then i was like you know because i wasn't going to attend and i missed the opportunity to sell it at like one and a half eight or whatever and it got down to point one point two i was like i'm not gonna sell it to i'm just gonna give it to someone who needs it and then this news happened and like the floor price went back up to almost anything i was like huh damn yeah but then i think it came back back down a lot it's down to like point four now i i that was like one of those golden moments where like i sold the top i so i had two tickets and i sold one of them for two eth like literally the top of the top and then um and then still have one so which is great so i get to i'm gonna take advantage of this whatever the snoop news is um okay i want to talk about chimpers i want to talk about fx hash did you want to say something that that was something you had sort of flagged as just being exciting happening in the world of nfts um talk us through the fx hash explain to people what this is for anybody who maybe isn't familiar so fx hash is it's basically a platform where artists can really sell generative art and collectors can buy generative art it's similar to similar art blocks except um i mean in that it's a platform that releases generative art but there are two at least two massive differences the first is it's not on ethereum it's on the taizos blockchain which uh you know has pros and cons a lot of the pros are transaction fees are basically zero it's way more environmentally friendly and so a lot of artists and collectors appreciate it for those two facts um cons might be it's it's there's a little skepticism about how relevant it's gonna be in five ten fifty years and all that kind of stuff and the other big difference is there's zero curation so art blocks you have to apply um and then they have three different sort of um collections the curated playground and factory and depending on on what you're trying to release and how how your application goes you'll be eligible into one of those three basically or one of the two um and it's very difficult to get say curated art blocks but even factory um you know a lot of people apply not that people many people get through whereas fx hash anyone can release anything and it's sort of it's this interesting it allows for this really interesting mechanic of like price discovery because in art blocks they're sort of the platform them saying hey we've we've curated these artists and these collections we think that they're valuable or different or innovative and and the community and then there's sort of like a limited supply like a lot of people said our blog said oversupply and that was a big issue prices come crashing down ethics hash has infinite supply there's just constantly hundreds thousands tens of thousands of new pieces of art dropping every single day and then it's sort of like the community gets to dig through find the gems follow the artists see what they release see if that artist has released 50 collections already and maybe that dilutes the value because of the supply or maybe you know they're all amazing collections and the collection size is the difference so sometimes without blocks what happens is that uh an artist might say they get an opportunity to release there but they might not know if they can ever release their again and then they try and release like an addition that's like a thousand minutes or 500 minutes obviously because they can capitalize and get more money and it might be their only opportunity in fx hash you get artists releasing collections that have like 20 minutes 50 minutes 10 minutes 100 minutes all the time and it's just at least a different type of generative art curation and collection um anyway that's sort of what it is and it's just been blowing up last really last six months but especially the last one to two months and uh sort of prices are going like 10x 100x 1000x in some instances yeah i mean we're seeing this broadly i think these we have other l1s that are uh doing well right now in the bear market i think for the first time magic eden which is the solana marketplace exceeded open c for daily volume of transactions it feels like this bear market is bringing some energy to some of these other layer ones who have lower gas fees you know just a different value proposition if i'm not mistaken i cannot buy i was trying to buy some fx hash pieces and i couldn't get on the taizos chain i think in the united states or maybe it's just the state of new york new york has very restrictive crypto laws and when i was trying to get like a tasos wallet and and and buy tasos it was not available to me so y'all can correct me if i'm wrong but i'm um i'm certain you're wrong about the united st yeah i would find that sure yeah i'm in new york and not allowed to buy tasers from exchanges now that was november of 2021 i don't know i think that's i don't know if that's changed but i last year was trying to get on fx hash and i i couldn't basically entertain i think if you use like a vpn and you can hide your you know you can basically hide your location i mean it's illegal at that point but i think there are people who do that but um maybe you could use a bridge like instead of buying off an exchange buy from someone or have someone send you tez it seems like crazy to be illegal to own a cryptocurrency yeah i think it's buying yeah we must get us just banned by new york the state of new york new york is very restrictive it's so wild i mean even ice i am i stake a little bit of youth on i think celsius or usdc i don't know what i stick on something else and i if i'm not mistaken i basically if i ever wanted to like get my yield off of that i'd have to drive into new jersey and then i could take my yield out that's so crazy it's same with like sports betting like for a while sport betting you couldn't do in new york but you could do it in jersey and so we would like go to jersey zach would bet on games i mean it's very strange um very stupid oh my gosh i can't believe how much more we have to talk about uh and how limited we have time wise uh okay chimpers i'm gonna go through this was there anything else you wanted to say on fx hash blowing up people should check it out people should people should check it out um and i'll plug zen academy because within there we have the fx-channel and and there's a lot of great shadow in there so oh actually no let me plug the fxrc discord that's just a better place yeah yeah go learn yeah great um okay chimpers is a project that i feel like has been one of these ones that sort of surged over the last couple of weeks and and um i i started digging into it it's interesting you know i feel like to the point of things stabilizing it feels like when you have projects that were previously unknown or like new projects sort of coming up that's a good sign that people are feeling a little bit confident again and things are stabilizing because there was a little touch and go there for a little while where it felt like nobody was going to buy a new project what blew my mind about chimpers and i think i messaged you this was i realized the chimpers genesis collection had like has like a 35 eighth floor and i was like how i didn't know anything about it did you know about this project before did you know i've heard about it but yeah i i'd heard about it and i'd seen like the art and it really appealed to me i never dug deep because just too many projects uh but i knew it existed say six months ago so i missed it when it first came out but i was slightly aware of it but just yeah yeah so what what struck me is like oh my god a 35 floor i think at various points it's been over 40 and i was like how did i kind of miss this thing i don't tend to be like a um pixel art girl you know so that's part of it is it just like doesn't appeal to me as an artistic style but i recognize its value um here's what i realized there's a hundred of these genesis jumps or something 111 a tiny supply i think there's been three sales total like if you look at open c so it's i think it's this case of very few holders who just don't list or they just list at these very high prices and you've had basically three sales for over 30 ether and three sales total in the life cycle of the project so it's a little bit misleading um i think it's a little bit hard to know what the quote-unquote true market price of it is yeah if you wanted to liquidate today what would someone pay you for it correct yeah unclear um though i think with this new so then and this shippers project i think is like 5555 something like that again a lower than 10k supply i think partly it might be doing well right now we're getting some attention right now is because it has that similar to moonbirds aesthetic um and the artist is also a nouns dow artist in some capacity like has contributed to nouns down some in some ways so i mean it's an anonymous artist which an anonymous team tempers is the is the lead of the project um but i will say he he does provide like more information about himself that's verifiable uh on the chimpers website so he he would fall in that category like okay bears i was like felt like azuki to me i was like anonymous and i like really i can listen to his twitter spaces with you but i really don't feel like i can verify information uh tempers chimpers felt felt i felt a little bit more comfortable with um so anyway i wanted to flag that project it's collection's doing reasonably well and it was just a case of like dig dig a little bit deeper if you see these really high floor prices um sometimes there's there's more to the story than than what you see do you think you'll buy in any any other uh uh chimpers i have one so i was on the mint list to mint and that was an interesting thing as well um you just get put on these things i assume right they're just like we just want you to know sometimes i do sometimes i don't um this time i was fortunate enough to because we ran a giveaway for zen academy and then they said we'll add you to the list as well and it's like okay i appreciate that um and i mean i get put on these lists and i get free nfts but i never sell them because i i think we spoke about this once i got sent a fan to bear i think um as just as a total gift just like hey you know we want to send you we expect nothing went up like 70th and i was like i was tempted so i was like it feels weird to sell something that i just got sent free and anyway um obviously very grateful to have all of this stuff uh so yeah but the mint price 0.07 i think a 0.08 and immediately they were trading for like four eighth so a lot of people were sort of giving them props saying they could have easily had a mint price of 0.5 or one either or did a dodge auction but they wanted to keep it sort of accessible and sort of you know really um affordable for new collectors and i think that's just something to be highlighted and commended really yeah yeah it talented it seems like a talented team they uh again you get a vibe it's got that 90s like video game feel to it and very nostalgic you know yeah it's very nostalgic and and the artist is obviously talented and um and very in the space so uh okay other projects i wanted to talk about star trek nfts this is another case where i was like look beyond the curtain there's more to the story than meets the eye have you been tracking the star trek nfts at all no not really i remember hearing about rica the marketplace ages ago but i haven't really been following what uh i mean yeah so they'd be big news right star trek nft should be big yeah they launched with recur i interviewed uh zach brush actually who's the one of the ceos and founders of recur at permissionless um and they put out this big press release that was like you know we sold out in five minutes or seven minutes or whatever but they they they had several tears to the to the drop they had admiral ships which was like the the highest tier and some of this information john my my good friend john rodgers who feeds me all the all the juicy tidbits he really tracked this down so and there was 5000 of those that were these admiral ship level that's what sold out in minutes but you had this the second tier that was like captain ships that was they had 15 000 of those and i think only like 3 000 sold okay and then you even had an overflow tier that had like an extra 2000 that was like an overflow tier which i think all of this was set up for the press release right they put out a big press release after saying they sold out in a minute so clearly they were sort of trying to gear everything towards the press release and if they had sold out everything they would have been like we even sold out our overflow you know supply but here's the even uh i think more interesting piece or the takeaway on this so the the that that admiral ship tier was was basically you had to have a recur like a recur pass to mint at that level so it's people who had who are clearly like very nft native because they would have bought a recur pass when recur launched which was pre even announcing a star trek um anything and so it seemed like really don't have a lot of star trek fans that got into this you know and here's the other thing that i think there's a couple learnings i'm gonna flag for folks but i think this is something that again is sort of coming from from john he said first of all you know some people who are at like the star trek convention there's some star trek convention that happened recently where they sort of announced this partnership there was very little buzz among any like kind of the trekkie community um and then also the all of like the really good ships that are from like the original star trek were in that admiralty tier where you needed the recur pass so it seemed like maybe it was a strategy to get trekkies to like buy into the recur pass but the but the end result was basically that like the general fans that were gonna buy into this like captain ship level like it was all the kind of side ships that are on like the spin-off shows i don't know i'm not a truckee i don't know how to say this but um but i think the learning i think i've you hear this from founders a lot it's just making sure that every tier and all of the rarities are cool and desirable and that what can happen sometimes you have this there's too much of a stratification between like the the upper tranches are really sick and then like the floor ones kind of suck and then people go and like look at your collection and opens your or wherever it like it it looks shitty um and i feel like that's maybe a takeaway that the record team should have here or the you know the star trek team or whatever because it seems like they really struggled to sell out those kind of second tier ones because it really aren't the ships that the fans would want and then it also feels a little bit like they didn't optimize this for bringing new people into nfts they sort of optimized it for for the recur fans who are maybe already in nfts so um it's a shame um i know like just the opportunity that you use a star trek ip you could just do so much incredible stuff and i'm sure they will in the future but yeah i'm sure they will too i think it also like you know i don't want to give them too much of a hard time like i i think i think it's also early i mean batman had the same thing so i actually i missed this but the back the batman did a bat cows i guess this paramount did like an nft called bat cows where it was like the batman like faces or something and they i think had a supply of like 100 000 200 000 they had a really big supply and they sold out like 10 000 of them um and it was a timed thing so like after the window closed that's it that's all there will ever be and i've been talking about this with john rogers he has his thoughts as to why it didn't sell out and the ways they maybe could have made it better and on and on and i think it's more of a it's more about like the macro like i think we are just a little bit early for some of these like beloved brands the star trek people are gamer people who probably are like skeptical and hate nfts right and there's there was you know only so much that the team could do to really lure them in and and i say this because with the bat cows i i missed this but they had actually linked in me i saw this well after the fact like asking to do a twitter space with me to like talk about what they were trying to do and i watched some other interviews with them where they're like there is utility tied to this they're giving people tours of studios and like by and large i think they they're actually really trying with the bat cowl to do it well um you know and they still didn't mint out and i i really do think it's just still quite early for a lot of these traditional fandoms to be um to be getting getting on board and i think maybe that's the the reality no i agree totally yeah so i do feel for them i do think in this case there were some some shortcomings that could have been improved upon but and hopefully will in the future love death and robots sorry last thing i'll say on this you know kind of corporate franchises entering is i think doing something very cool i don't know if you've tracked what they're doing qr codes right yeah they have this show on netflix and they're hiding qr codes within episodes of the show within social media on the show and you scan the qr code you pay the gas fee and you commit one of their nfts they're doing nine for each of the nine episodes that does feel kind of novel integrated again like it's gonna be on netflix you're gonna you know hold up to your tv or whatever and get it get an nft so um i think that's cool yeah and they're free i believe i think it's just gas i think they are yeah yeah it's free plus gas so okay as we as we run out of time here parallel paths much more parallel announced they're launching their next pack in june huxley chapter four is coming should we do huxley you interviewed ben morrow i did um i'm just looking through the seth green stuff like that sounds fascinating and i don't know much about it so oh [ __ ] man we need to do it two hours ago this is gonna be crazy okay yeah sorry i'm cursing so much too there's it's fine um yeah and then there's the new open c there's jenkins of la um i don't know maybe some of the stuff we can save for next week like the open sea thing i think okay they actually launched a new ui like today like within the last couple hours but there's that's something we can talk about next week as well okay we'll do we'll do open c well we're not on next week you want to come on next week we'll do two recurring moment of zenith goes back to back yeah yeah we'll we can find out i'll be in dubai but uh i can find a time yeah i'll just come to dubai we'll just do it in person that's great no problem um all right we'll we'll talk offline about it okay uh i'll give my seth green take real a as fast as possible john rogers this is i get i literally i have no original thought john rogers gives me all the thoughts um okay seth green actor was was going to launch a show and i i guess probably still is but that like prominently featured his board ape he planned to release the trailer for this show at vcon a week before i think he still did release the trailer of econ but like a week before all this goes down or v con goes down basically and he announces all this his board ape gets stolen he gets you know caught in one of these fishing scams he loses four nfts including his board ape that's supposed to star in this show and now he's like well what the heck like i have this entire show built around this ape that i no longer technically have ownership rights to and it's been this like funny saga playing out on twitter where like seth announced it's been hacked somebody stoles it so somebody has stolen it he censors tweeting at the account like dark water 80 i don't know whatever he's tweeting the account that he thinks has the thing he's not getting any reply he starts to be like i have lots of years of experience in like intellectual property like i will sue this will be an interesting like watermark case around like stolen assets basically like you know yeah you know whatever and then and then buzzfeed of all places tracks down tracks down the holder and apparently like their the twitter account that had been everyone was tweeting at is like not an active one that he really uses and he he kind of uses like a secondary thing and and he basically like thief is like some australian surgeon he's like just you know like he lives in australia he's just like a dude and he's like oh yeah i didn't really really know that this was all going on when i bought the ape it wasn't flagged as suspicious or stolen so i just like bought this a put it in the wallet went on doing my surgery thing and like have only now woken like realize that anything was even happening so like sure i'm open to a conversation with seth green you know like whatever like put them in touch um okay take away here and this is where i think we're entering we'll enter this new future if seth had licensed this ape to his production company he could proceed with the show no problem because that license would have to be honored even if he sold the ape and this is this really interesting new world a new paradigm we're entering and i interviewed feature.io who is building out this licensing platform that coinbase is using to cast apes in their show as we're starting to enter this like kind of traditional hollywood world of like you know you could have somebody like cast their world of women in like a porn film and then try and sell it to somebody and like you know like i just think it's really interesting once we start to get into this world of setting up media deals for your nft but then the nft fundamentally being an asset that can be sold or stolen or whatever so the moral here is like would have been interesting to see like you know seth could have licensed it he would have prevented a lot of headache i mean there would be a headache and he'd still be fighting to get it back but at least like the future of his project wouldn't be in jeopardy in the same way and that's really been a learning for me of understanding how traditional hollywood works i was like john is this are there are there comparables to this in the real world he's like all the time you can have a project and you've created you've signed a deal for a film project for example with a costume designer and then if you sell the rights to that script or to the project the new owner inherits that deal with that costume director and if they want to end it they have to buy them out in some capacity like you know you don't get to just sell the project and then get yourself out of a deal that's been signed with that project so he's saying that the same will hold true um in the nft world and uh that we're going to enter this new era where there's a lot more of that going on the second you want to do a project with your nft make a license of some sort happen um so that you can prevent these kinds of things but then and then my next iteration of that is like it'll be fascinating to see if you start to have people do like weird deals that people don't want and that will impact the value of an you know again your world of women is now in like some weird porn thing and like the next holder is entitled to know that and anyway just it's it's lots of wild wild yeah it's fascinating honestly it's like new frontiers basically all over the place and yeah it's going to be an interesting uh just a thousand years ahead of us but let's say the next ten years gonna be fascinating yeah and this will happen like you will have a major project where like one of the characters is involved in like some never like you know like thing that a future holder would not want it involved in um and and i think it'll be really interesting to see how that plays out for the project as a whole right that's obviously the concern with a cc zero it's the concern with you know these really expansive rights projects well i think it's awesome and i think it opens all these new frontiers i think there are um long-term brand risks that are associated with that i'm we're doing a cco panel cc zero panel yeah you're gonna be on it we're just jimmy i'll shout him out we're trying to jimmy's wild man schedule is what we're trying to coordinate around um so we're we're going to debate it because jimmy's a little bit anti-cc0 you're pretty pro we got dc investor who's pro and then i think we're bringing in the former general counsel from lucasfilm to to kind of take her to be with jimmy yeah and so i think that'll be i think it'll be a really good panel yeah that'll be awesome okay that's my seth green take and where the world is going thanks for
