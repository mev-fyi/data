welcome to layer zero layer 0 is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto Community has their own story to tell this cyberpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and always has been today on layer zero I'm talking to Amin solimani and I've said his name on the bankless podcast a number of times before he's been on the bank list podcast a number of times before he helped meme moloch into existence in 2018 and 2019 he's the creator of moloch Dao one of the first Dows to come out of ethereum after the Dao and he makes this joke about how he made moloch Dao with you know many purposes one of them being to help the ethereum community get over what he calls pts Dao as in PTSD over the 2016 dial that caused the ethereum classic hard Fork so we we talk about moloch coordination Dows and what Dows can do for the landscape of both ethereum when it comes to coordination but also for the broader world and and really why ethereum is just coordination tools all the way down but then we get into some broader subjects such as uh he's his recent fight against the Federal Reserve and how the Federal Reserve has this relationship with uh the broader world that is unsavory and and how we as a people need to resist what is going on with this Federal Reserve uh and I mean has always been a very big patterned thinker a big philosophical person who can see the biggest patterns that the world has put in front of us and sees them for what they are and he's a he's a pretty controversial guy uh he he's pretty sharp around the edges he's definitely not afraid of uh putting his foot down and and making people be very uncomfortable so I actually do not recommend that you listen to this episode with kids in the car or you know young ones who aren't ready for very mature subjects um but I I even though I mean definitely has his controversies he's a hero of mine through and through for the way that he thinks things and what he thinks about and the lessons that he brings to the table because they're very emblematic of this particular podcast why I call it layer zero it's because he gets down to the bottom of things uh in a very fast uh sometimes crude but effective way so I hope you enjoyed this episode with Amin solimani and we'll get to that conversation right after we talk to some of these fantastic

mean how's it going great uh thanks for having me it's quite The Eccentric background you've got there yeah had to fit the Unicorn into the picture is that is that a chair that you're on I uh yes this is a nice little pink throney chair thing we'll get into all of that and more but for for listeners who came in perhaps in 2021 or or beyond the most recent cohort of crypto listeners content consumers uh they might not be as familiar with you as I once was when I first got into this space uh can you explain your perch in the ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem what would you say that you do here foreign yeah so I'm the CEO of spank chain which was the first uh one of the first attempts to bring the benefits of crypto to the adult community uh so from that perch I get to sort of um you know it's like a Libertarian Viewpoint how to make things useful for everyday people uh you know not so much like uh the grander things too but uh yeah um that stuff's more about like helping sex workers uh you know use ethereum tools to keep their money safe um and and so forth uh sell nfts and um but we we do some other things too uh we made the first L2 uh spank live so that was a fun opportunity to learn about you know putting l2s in production four years ago a lot of lessons learned that we've been able to use now uh four years later when it's like finally time uh for layer twos um I try to focus on the types of things that people aren't uh and like where the blind spots were too so it started Malik Dalek back in the day uh ethereum was very utopian and I was uh concerned that our utopianism uh wasn't going to like um you know be very scalable or sustainable forever so yeah yeah go into that a little bit more uh if you're one of the things that brought me into ethereum is just how optimistic and perhaps utopian is the right word everyone is it's like it's infectious like everyone's really generally happy and accepting uh but but I think perhaps somewhere to our our own like naiveness naivete like when you come into His ethereum and you see like the culture here what do you see yeah I saw a lot of like well-wishing sort of people right it's like um we prided ourselves for years about being a very welcoming Community about being very friendly uh and it led to the ethereum community getting hacked in sort of predictable ways uh by people who were like oh you know uh upfront like very friendly but then had sort of their own intentions and goals uh that were maybe not aligned with the ethereum community and so a lot of the Kumbaya culture um isn't very um design like well designed around adversarial thinking and things like that and so um you know the idea of like Malik uh was very appealing to me uh because it described these sort of like game theoretic traps uh where you have to make some sacrifice of something you value because everybody else does and like ethereum doesn't exist in a vacuum uh it would be nice if it did but like it's still subject to the competitive forces that drive everything else and so if we want our values of you know uh pro-social and uh you know positive sum to expand to the rest of the world we sort of have to compete to protect them and to advance them against other things that might try to out-compete them that don't have those values and I saw a lot of people taking this idea for granted that ethereum was just like the best it was going to dominate forever and it was just going to win because we're the good guys uh and like in my experience that's like not how anything works um it's like nice when the good guys win but it's like typically because they're more powerful than the bad guys uh it's not because they like are nicer than the bad guys like they're I mean I don't know you can make the case that like they could coordinate better uh but like uh yeah that's getting sort of deeper into the subject um it's having watched and you being a leader for me in this space with just like how you think in your writing uh it seems very appropriate that you are the person to be beating this drum of adversarial thinking of this guy who's like doing this Ico Spang chain that really just like throws people off and we're just like supposedly doing this very professional thing of trying to build a platform for payment channels but what do we do with that thing oh we we apply it to like making sex workers lives like easier uh and then like it you have this like era value that's very like I kind of find like ethereum aligned in that uh we're here to move the needle of humanity but we're not going to take ourselves too seriously while we do it uh and and so like well this started off as like you know what what am I going to do with this Payments Technology I'm going to go like straight into sex work in like 2017. and then like that kind of also I think also relates to how you interface with like the broader ethereum Community was like oh everyone is you know in this like growing the pie mentality but I'm gonna be like the hardliner that enforces like adversarial thinking and thinking of everyone as an enemy because all of you people aren't doing that that's kind of how I like quickly and and quickly and roughly summarize your activity in the space does that resonate with you yeah absolutely um it was uh it was basically a reaction to the prevailing utopianism that uh drove me to embrace the Malik Meme and feel compelled to share it um because I like it's not like to be clear like I like the utopianism right I like the aspirational nature of ethereum I like the optimism uh I think uh it's important to sprinkle it with a dose of realism um and like also there's other communities where like the slaying Malik meme wouldn't have worked out uh because they don't care so like you know maybe in other communities that are less Mission oriented and more mercenary you know oriented uh you know they don't care about slaying Malik they're like wait yeah I can trade my values for competitive Advantage [ __ ] yeah that sounds great let's worship Mala can do that right uh is there a point to this whole blockchain stuff that Beyond getting ourselves rich I don't know uh but like who cares you know um but like that's not what you feel in ethereum what you feel is like we are advancing something that matters right uh and you know I just I also care about that goal uh and I wanted to help Advance it how I could uh and that also you know meant acknowledging that like it's not always going to be you know sunshine and Roses like sometimes it's you know not going to be great like we actually have to make sacrifices um and if we want to you know keep advancing these values and we have to fight for it uh we have to out compete the rest of the world and so the Paradox of Malik uh that that I talk about sometimes is that like you sometimes you you we talk about slaying Malik but like the Paradox is that in order to get the power to do so we like sometimes have to worship at his altar right uh like if we didn't at all uh strengthen ourselves or become competitive uh then you know we just ought to lose right so uh there's like some Middle Ground between and this is why it's a paradox it's like it doesn't fit you know very cleanly you're like I just want uh us to be the good guys forever you know uh but it's like um no it's like if you have this like value thing you want to preserve protect Advance you have to like compete for it fight for it you know do all the things that you'd normally do you just have to also preserve it uh because that's the core thing that you're trying to do so uh yeah I don't know if all that means we'll have to actually like explain this like moloch meme this is a meme that bankless has been just like it's the banner that we kind of live under but again we haven't really talked about it in 2021 2022 nearly as much as we did uh in earlier times but maybe we could actually explain the moloch meme by um giving a history of its relationship with ethereum uh which uh is an intimate part of like your own story with ethereum so maybe we can go back to where the molach meme was really just getting incepted into ethereum culture for the first time because you were really leading that charge could you take us back back in time and start the story there yeah Malik means a couple things so I read the blog post meditations on Malik by slate star codex um Scott Alexander it's his rationalist blog post and it describes the you know rationalist God of coordination failure put a word on an anxiety I've had my whole life which is like why can't we all get along why can't we have nice things and it's like you know because people and you know in these competitive situations they have something that they can sacrifice uh that they value in order to get an edge and the end results is everybody does it and so like you end up in these sort of um you know unfortunate equilibriums where you know as a country we want to spend money on guns and bombs and play it or I'm sorry we want to spend money on Healthcare education and infrastructure but we end up spending it on guns and bombs and planes uh because we like can't coordinate with everyone else to disarm at the same time uh and if even if we did coordinate with everyone else on the planet to disarm then like whoever is the last person with all the guns you know takes everybody else over and then the world reflects their values which is like secretly amass a bunch of weapons uh and so like the whole disarmament like wasn't very effective right uh and Malik is used to is like a shorthand to describe these like coordination failures where like if we could all just work together uh and had some mechanism to do that that would be great and maybe we could reach a better equilibrium but because we don't we have to like compete and fight uh and and we're trapped in this like less good equilibrium and the story of how it relates to ethereum is that I also discovered ethereum in like the same week discovered Malik and then uh try to bring these ideas because I realized that ethereum was a platform for building coordination technology so like if you're in one of these unfortunate equilibrium you want to get to the better equilibrium how do you do it well you need to come up with some game to coordinate with everybody else uh in order to you know Advance this sort of better coordination station so uh the tools for doing things like that are what ethereum is all about in my opinion and so I was like how do I get people to feel this thing that I feel right now I'm going to call this down Malik Dao hopefully it'll get all these people to read this blog post uh and we're like several years Downstream from that uh and now there's like comic books and like uh more literature and mimetics that are being developed around the Malik meme uh and it's turned into a sort of rallying cry for the ethereum community uh to coordinate around like what is you know our own mission what is our goal uh and it's helped you know crystallize it's like well what do we do here right uh we build coordination tools uh it's not about you know like my country my faith you know my whatever it's like about building things that allow us to like progress past the like coordination systems that we can even imagine today you know uh like countries are great but they have borders you know uh outside of the Border like you're not really our friend uh so it like has a scalability limit to how far it can you know coordinate people uh same with faith you know Faith have Heretics and non-believers uh and that so they run into limits on uh coordination and so the idea is like what if what you know the the big idea for things like ethereum is like well you know how do we do better uh like what if we took like country and faith and like other types of coordinate you know group uh non-profit corporation like these are our starting points of coordination technology and so the way that we you know slay Malik is we improve on coordination technology itself uh and that's uh that's a powerful thing because I I think a lot of a lot like you know we're used to being raised in this like us versus that mentality uh everybody is and so like trying to uh identify the traps like of the US you know it's like us for stem is kind of a psyop uh so or like trying to figure out like what what exactly is the uh like why is it us for stem in this specific way like how do we unlock you know more coordination value out of humanity um and when we started making Dows like there were three Dows right uh moleculars like it's like down number four uh so we've had a great opportunity to like sound like complete you know uh really out there uh like you know uh uh Heretics or or uh you know nutcases or whatever we're like there's yeah there's gonna be ten thousand doubts like when we're on down number three uh this is like stuff that we used to say with like Eva and Peter and James Young and all the people who were like early moloked out because we could see the the coordination potential um that we we know we we could see about to be unlocked where like people are gonna flip when they figure out Dows right um it's like and it's been [ __ ] um 2018-19 yeah yeah we're like building it in 2018 being like Oh my God this is gonna be so much fun like people are gonna be so excited you know uh and there's like 10 doubs by the end of the year yeah 2019 it was like me and Peter in telegram groups just like starting another Dao every like couple weeks like marketing down there was like a a Richie it was like a dow for drinking you know uh events it's like the kickback guys made it um there was there was all sorts of dabs we made the Yang Dao just to put pay some kids in Colorado to like put up flyers and like pay the you know deep fake memes for Andrew Yang so between 2019 and now like 2022 at East Denver I like let you know helped Andrew Yang get inside the event uh because he was like stuck outside the event I like went to you were talking to him because you were talking about Dows uh and about his Lobby three Dow it was like a special event and I was like this is sweet I want to go to Andrew Yang's event I helped start yangdao uh let's see where he's gotten in three years so we just roll up you know I'm like stuck outside in Denver and there's a dude in front of me wearing a suit like who the [ __ ] goes to eat Denver wearing a suit uh and the event organizers like wouldn't let him in uh and I look over and it's like Andrew Yang like apparently running for president isn't enough you know uh to get in to eat there turns out he's like giving somebody his badge or something so I was able to you know give him my Batch get him in uh and gave a great talk with you guys on stage so um yeah it feels pretty cool to see all of that stuff happen uh and then people like research Malik you know they're like oh look like this doubt it's like cool to have uh you know put that like medic brick in this like what you know immutable wall uh and uh see that you know pay dividends in terms of uh recruiting people to uh be aligned with the original Mission we were trying to help people frame and understand that was a long run I had a lot of caffeine things no that was great listening to all that just to make it extremely extremely explicit as to the connections being made here but you said ethereum is a platform to build coordination tools and then and then you went through the history of ethereum as it goes from three to thirty thousand Dows like extrapolate Beyond 2020 to where we are today where everyone you can spin up a doubt about a constitution if you so choose but just like can you just connect the dots on all of these things about ethereum as coordination tools daos and moloch yeah so like Malik Dao you know was uh one of the first Dao's uh the the first one blew up right it was called the Dao uh and it's why we have ethereum classic and hard fork and da da and we had pts now and so we made molok Dow to be very simple uh and to just like fund grants with eth and do very little else um but uh between like uh the the you know marked out itself was a a whole ordeal like we're onboarding people with etherscan uh at East Denver you know I was like manually typing in zeros uh is very early um in in the whole process like now there's you know Dow tools for basically spinning up everything and uh there's a lot more flexibility um and it took a lot of people just grinding for years uh we we made molok Dao uh like as a non-profit just to do the grants for with eth right so so it didn't have any of the other features uh the original design for like my investment Dao Malik Ventures is like closest to like what is being released just now with like Malik version three um so that we the version one was like just grants uh just you know deposit couldn't do any other tokens didn't have any proposal types couldn't change the governance couldn't do anything right and that was uh to help address the security issues you know around launching these things because the last one had blown up and stuff um and so um it was what we really needed to get over what you just called our pts Dao of just like okay let's eliminate all complexity and do one thing and one thing only which is agree to coordinate as to where to send ether and so all other all much surface area was just like Stripped Away because we as a community still when you said the word Dao people would Flinch because we you know almost blew up ethereum yeah so we needed this like yeah don't do that sounds scary why would you do that did you see what happened to the other guys who did that they got blown up dude we're like okay relax like we'll just do it the dumb way the simple way we won't do anything complicated and then people you know other people would be like we got this great feature idea for your doubt and we'd be like that's a great idea We're not gonna do it uh talk to me in a year and so we had to like run a grand style for like just a year and it turned out to be like the right thing to do um to advance you know the coordination culture to have more people who done Dows and like I I I I have this uh mental model of progress uh maybe it's more relevant for like open source stuff but uh you know I I see progress is a series of motivational equilibrium like I don't actually have to solve everything myself uh I just have to push the ball you know push the State of Affairs to like the next motivational equilibria where there's like more people more motivated to solve all the problems uh and I feel like that's kind of what we accomplished um with Malik V1 just grants you know ran it for a year got you know to hustle basically like 20 people for 100 each early on raise a couple mil got EF consensus vitalik Jolie been put in a couple Mill made some grants tornado you know probably the most important um a bunch of other grants around eth2 you know helped give the first grant to like the thing that is now protocol Guild uh back in its Inception um you know did all that but like uh also helped meme Dao's you know like help people recover from pts Dao uh helped educate people about how to Dow like what does it mean there's proposals there's you know grace period you can exit like popularize the The Rage Quit um as a way of embedding minority protections into your Dao so that you know uh participants can leave with their share of assets at any time and like it took years for these Concepts and and like to proliferate and percolate in the you know ecosystem until now there's like lots of dows you know there's investment Dows there's like uh protocol Dows there's non-profits there's Social Clubs um and they they run using you know different types of systems some are multi-six I'm like a dab Boomer at this point so I'm like all right you know that's a multi-sig get off my lawn um but yeah uh like people started coordinating right like all of these are examples of coordination um with Malik Dao we raise money from like I don't know 25s 30 some people in like 10 12 something different countries with no paperwork uh nobody signed anything it would have been a lot harder to do the same type of thing in like your you know meat space uh you know you're I I talk about these things as like your jurisdictional stack right so like uh in order to do the thing which Molotov did which is like allow you to pool money with a group of people but also like vote on proposals and uh if you you know at any time don't want to spend your money anymore pull your money out without asking anyone is like impossible to do in Meet space because you have to like set up event count hire lawyers come bylaws and then you have like several people you know to do every process you're like oh we would like to collect signatures on a vote on this thing oh okay you have to like go through some software Carta you know it like uh you know some like management thing um to like collect signatures and authenticate people uh and you have to do that every time you want to you know spend money on anything uh and then like if somebody wants to leave they have to like ask for permission and then like you have to go through their lawyer to go through the banker and like send a wire and like any of those steps could like fail for whatever reason or get held up or frozen or you know censored uh and like the uh you know the reason that people trusted the molecular smart contracts was because they knew that they could push a button and the smart contract would release their money they didn't have to talk to anybody there's no like jurisdictional stack of things that can fail and that unlocks a lot of value that overhead that isn't there now makes it so that it's viable to create a group like this to solve a problem that would otherwise have been you know not worth making a group like this to solve and so like when I'm talking about unlocking coordination potential like that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about it's like specifically the coordination overhead is a number and it gets smaller right across all of the participants needing to verify that other people have done stuff that the treasury is accurate like these are all you know trust things that allow us to trust each other more quickly and allow groups to scale trust more quickly and and execute their goals more easily so uh yeah this is like stuff nothing has changed right uh between 2018 2019 and now uh like like some more code has been written uh to make these things easier but really what's happening is stories like I was I remember interviewing uh a coindesk reporter in 20 uh last year at em con I just got back from em con uh in Denver so that's the metacartel conference so they did mcon 2 this year last year they did mccon won and I talked to this journalist and they asked me like what the limiting factor was of for like growth and you know more people thinking it's a good idea and I I said that like the code is mostly there uh the limiting factor is stories people need to see the narratives develop people need to see the story of somebody doing a Dao being successful you know raising money for some cause and then being able to imagine themselves as part of that story uh in their own way and until that happens you can't recruit people because they don't have any examples of how to work with it you know the framework they're like okay you have a dialogue what do I do right and so it's really important I think to push narratives forward uh and so with with Malik Dao you know that the story was an East Dev didn't feel like going through the EF for Grants uh made his own doubt for Grants and like uh started funding things to advance the ecosystem and like eventually got other people you know including the EF to buy in and like operated his non-profit you know using this technology with a community of people that were into it and like Protected Their Own you know minority rights uh you can too you know like um it was basically a non-starter to like consider using things like Dows for uh you know and like non-profits and stuff and so we had an example of us doing that in a successful way so a lot of times it's you know you just got to go first uh one of the elements of why this works so well you touched on it and I want to double down on it is this like free ability to exit as an individual uh and it's truly something that only is is possible because of private keys because of you know really the invention of being able to custody your own funds and have people ask you for permission rather than you being the person to ask for permission can you just okay let's double down on that why why is that such a fundamental part about like why all of this coordination stuff works in the first place yeah this is a great great question uh custodying funds is great uh because it means you don't have to ask people for permission to use your money um just very high level like custodying funds is one of the core things that blockchain's specifically cryptocurrencies are about right like even if defy and stuff doesn't you know where it's like you don't want to have to like call your bank to send a wire and they're like no right it's just basically like that you never want that outcome uh and like the Bitcoin Network you know so long as it remains censorship resistant we'll never say no to you uh ethereum network will never say no to you um and then we can like piggyback off of this like custody property to do other cool and useful things right so like one of the the you know differences between something like Malik Dao and something like a non-profit with a bank account is that you have custody of your funds uh this is also different if like you use the multi-sig right um you know the The Operators the signers of the multi-segger custody you know custodians of the funds right but molecular had this very specific unique uh new property called The Rage Quit and that allowed you to maintain custody and sovereignty of your funds even while you pooled it with other people uh and so that's that's an important thing because it turns your like donation to this non-profit into more like a pledge a revocable pledge and so you can choose to exit you know if a proposal isn't going the way you wanted you voted no the rest of the you know Dow is like well we really just do want to spend money on this and like if you don't like it so be it you can be like well okay fine you know I accept that you guys are still going to fund this I disagree I don't want to do this anymore I'm taking my money I don't want it to go for this cause and I'm rage quitting I'm exiting with my prorator share of the remaining funds and so uh you know I'm I'm out right and and I had custody of my money I didn't need to ask them for permission to do that but it does also change this game theory uh if you've heard about you know the voice and exit uh like custodial systems have no exit right uh you can have a voice uh you can you know complain or ask for help or permission uh but at the end of the day unless you can exit uh you're sort of Trapped uh and then it's you can be coerced uh you can uh be forced to do things with your money that you do not consent to um and so uh being able to have custody over your money even while it's at no doubt even while you pulled it with other people even while we can submit proposals and decide how to spend it together but also retaining that ability to you know exit whenever you want super important because it makes it a lot easier to join in the first place I would I basically willing to join any molecular because if it has a ridge quit I'm like well you know what's the Worst That Could Happen uh they submit a proposal I don't like it and I leave um so yeah the cost of joining any Dow is as close to zero as it's basically a gas fee and so in theory there's some special Landscapes you know of like oh I joined no I have to leave to talk to people but exactly it opens up the landscape right and so like the the joining like a non-profit has overhead right so how many non-profits can one person really manage their their relationship with in their lives probably a single digit number probably even on the average person no more than like two um but like in with dowels like your participation in Dallas is really as many discords as you feel compelled to like pay attention to basically yeah and how does this change the relationship of like the broader org with its individual members because now like this is all about putting power into the hands of the individual right like the individuals always have well maybe they don't have the most power but you don't have organizations don't have power over the individual if there is that Rage Quit mechanism so how does that change like the nature of the organization when that is the new equilibrium it makes it uh much more likely that the decisions of the organization will reflect the values of the individual members um you you sort of get this like all proposals are consensual implicitly because everybody has the opportunity to leave uh if they disagree with any proposal so the game theory of it works out that like the organization is not incentivized to pass any proposals that they think will make a lot of the people leave uh because even if I can make this proposal pass like if you guys all leave then you know I'm stuck paying for it I might end up being like paying more for it right so to the extent that I want to share the costs of things with you it's to my uh it would behoove me to make sure that like we're spending the money on things that like generally benefit everybody um and if there's any imbalance uh even perceived imbalance uh then the people have the opportunity you know to rage quit and make that known uh and that disincentive you know uh provides a feedback mechanism for the group um maybe the group just doubles down because now there's less uh you know outside like like conflict um within the group but also that's a good outcome for the group for the remaining members it's like we can actually build alignment over time by shedding some of the members who might it be less aligned as we go and so um I think I think it it's actually a good system for both you know the individual goals and the goals for of the group ZK sync is an ethereum layer 2 Network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge Roll-Ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but crypto killer apps need ZK sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge Roll-Ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of cryptoeconomics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof Foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zksync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on Twitter too at zksync rocketpool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eth in rocketpool and get R eth in return allowing you to stake your eat and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocket pool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16 e to get started you're getting an extra 15 staking Commission on the pooled Eid that uses your node to stake you'll also get RPL token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pull Network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum outs you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there lens protocol is an open source Tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking stations that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps Bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the Google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3social and we can like do a quick compare and contrast of like other social systems right where like say say there's a Dao uh maybe let's like take um uh the Constitution down just because that's kind of the big one that everyone knows about that's the most modern and say like the Constitution Dao leadership voted to pay themselves half the money in the treasury and that's like eight of them uh and say this vote actually goes through well then there's the rage quit mechanism that all these people can rage quit before they they their half their money gets paid to the leadership right which makes this vote not even like feasible in the first place to ever do but like we can compare this with like I don't know maybe a nation state where the leadership of a nation-state since they're the ones that control the military they can just say hey all all gold is now illegal you must pay it to us and we now own all the gold it's it's harder for these individuals to exit because like you know it's one thing to exit from a dow by processing a transaction on ethereum to get your money back but it's another thing to like process the exit from a nation state where you have your home and your family and your life uh and your culture and so like this thing is and then they just took your goal and then yeah right and so like I mean they were you know doing an Apple Store oranges comparison here but like this is the difference between what is a systems that are free to exit and systems that have a high cost to exit it's like high cost to exit systems allow for opportunity to like Bully you around that's right yeah the first question you know people ask is like uh when you try to get them into this type of thing it's like how do I leave and you know the the concern is like I don't want to be bullied by the other members like I don't want my funds to go to stuff that I don't want uh so I either have to trust the other members or you know trust that I can leave trust the mechanism and like when you can trust the mechanism you know uh it's a lot easier to spin these things up and start making grants and see it you know see how they go without as much overhead without as much risk uh without as much opportunity for coercion there's a line that I go back and forth with uh Kevin owaki and I believe also you is that like you don't actually kill moloch you don't actually like magically solve all coordination failure but you can make that make moloch Retreat right can you help us draw this connection between like all right well we didn't exactly you know buy you know the state of Dallas in 2022 it's not like we've really solved coordination failure we kind of just made a bunch of ponzis now we're in the fair market but uh oops but but also like uh we have created a new system where moloch Retreats right okay can you just explain like going where where we have like this new coordination platform which is ethereum now we have this new coordination primitive which is Dao's how is moloch less deadly as a result of this um I think I think the cool thing maybe this is like a frustrating thing but uh I started saying this more recently is that like I think it captures this concept fairly well uh slaying Malik is an infinite game uh and like what that means to me is that like you know uh looming behind the rotting corpse of the most recently slain Malik is like uh shadowy or deadly or Malik you know waiting to strike right level two we'll walk level three and and so it's like this endless series of boss fights you know uh and like we can just keep going uh and like see what happens and it's like still worth playing this game because it still seems worth you know advancing coordination because like that's what it I don't I think that's like the what it means to be human uh like what the hell else yeah uh like the opposite of that is just like winning some you know uh intermittent zero-sum game um so so yeah I mean we did all this stuff uh now we have to sort of like the way I see it now is like we have we have Dao veterans now right so like last year it was like freshman year activity Fair activity Expo you know you show up to college there's booths everywhere you want to be in every Club you sign up for 10. you you know you make it to the end of the semester and like you're lucky if you're still showing up to like three or four you know maybe maybe less um and then this year is like sophomore year right everybody's like okay we know how last year went uh we will sign up for a couple clubs we will you know stick with them and we will like you know make sure it's useful and not like too much to handle and blah blah blah and by junior year you're like leading clubs you know you're you have like a leadership position and I see everybody going through the same sort of progression that we did which is like we start out we have no idea what we're doing uh we hope we're doing useful stuff uh you know uh and then like after a while we like figure it out it's like oh like you know flat organizations are kind of hard or like oh like this isn't just like a corporation on a blockchain like you know people who come from both sort of sides or having you know sort of trouble and like are learning to like build structures within the context of dows and like figure out what processes work how to do compensation right and so there's like cultural knowledge being built up in you know a thousand different groups at the same time about how to do all of this stuff and that is what is going to Anchor the next generation of Dow contributors and people right so like in the same way that everybody who more or less joined molec Dalek went on to start some kind of doubt right Peter started a bunch of doubts Cooper started a bunch of doubts Ryan you know started bankless uh he was in a long time you know um so a lot of the people who have now come into Dao's as contributors uh as tourists uh get to learn and and figure out what's going on that oh you know it's not all just like these Dow guys haven't figured everything out right like we haven't just solved coordination uh but we we have like discovered you know useful tools uh coordinating better and like you know you can look at the amount of money raised or the you know number of these groups that have formed and like the excitement around them all as indicators that like we're making progress uh we're doing something right and like the things that will you know interest me more is like next Generation right so like uh uh right now we have like Pluto chocolate you know plutocracy like for basically everything like token vote um italic writes about this you know in collusion resistance that we need more you know identifiable systems so that we can vote with people uh have some amount of democracy in addition to having all of the you know plutocracy that we have um like nobody has really done that well like optimism is trying they have their like two-tiered you know governance system that's pretty cool to see uh I think we'll see more structures form uh some might even be like more centralized and like have explicit like CEO type or like hegemen type uh and and I think that like if you zoom out like all the things that we're building Dows for right now are like toys and prototypes uh like the cool things is like when you know when is the United Nation on chain right uh it's like that's like our sort of like terminal you know like when are when are like International agreements on chain like I started reading for fun uh about the ancient Dows uh like the Greek city-state agreements uh that that they made the Peloponnesian league and the like Delian League these are the Athenian and spartan-led daus uh that they used to coordinate ancient Greece and they have like interesting policies like spark Sparta ran theirs differently than how Athens ran theirs like Sparta is like we're the hedgemen we're gonna have a deal with every city-state and like you signed a deal with us we might not even like really tell anybody else the terms but like uh you agreed to have the same enemies and allies that we do is the sort of foundation of all all of these um and then the Athenian version uh there's a little bit more uh uh Democratic they have like a council you know within Athens that they like vote on proposals for and then like if those proposals pass they like go to like the the greater council with all the other city-states uh and then you know they try to pass them there and like Athens would often abstain and like it's interesting things about how how they manage them um and I I think that's like where this is going uh right like we don't uh like maybe we aren't paying attention to it as much um but like like if it's not going there like I'll be really surprised uh because the stuff is so useful that it will naturally find a home in like the most high stakes uh you know environments eventually once once we've built these narratives and once we've done this infrastructure work and all that and really what you're talking about is like ethereum is like this like neutral Middle Ground between nation states or between like the largest coordinating entities in the world is that is that the image that should be in listeners heads yeah uh global settlement layer coordination platform for Humanity you know these kinds of things like when we say that you know we kind of mean yeah it'll like also settle your crypto punks you know and and like that stuff but like like the goal you know like why do we care about censorship resistant right it's like why do we care about neutrality like the reason we care about these things is because we're trying to build a system that doesn't give specific advantages to one nation state or you know religious group or whatever right um and it it you know just sort of runs on math and does math things and like uh can operate you know a virtual machine and settle contracts but like doesn't care too much about contents of those contracts and so forth right um and that's sort of what you need to allow for like I I don't know if I talked about this with you but like maybe we like when I watch Vikings and like the ancient Game Theory between Kings is like they just have these hostage trades with their children right it's like you know uh ancient like coordination in that era was like I will make you you know the way to make our Behavior more mutually predictable to each other is to deposit our children into a two of two multi-sig uh such that we both need to work together to unlock the children and if we fail they die it's like what like everyone just went along with that because that was like the best system that had ever existed to that point it's like Savage right but it worked and it's like you're just talking about like all right like you've got a daughter I've got a son we're gonna put them in the same room they're gonna have babies and we're gonna stop hating each other is that what that's what you're talking about yo I'm talking about like you know I give you my son to raise and like you give me your daughter to raise oh but like a lot of times they did also do uh right like like marriage contracts was like down the road and it was like We'll raise your daughter for a time well you raise it you know and then or they'll both be in our place for three years in your place for three you know uh and then it doesn't serve each other yes and like if you could coordinate better like you might survive better because like you would out coordinate the other guys who like couldn't put their sons in a multi-sig uh and therefore had a smaller Army right it like sounds dumb to say like that but like that's that's like that's like how things worked right that was like the people were like yeah right like the you know whatever like and like if you didn't put your kids in a multi-sig you're like bro this Alliance is suspect our kids are not in multi-syncs together there's nothing there's nothing in mind here yeah basically and so like the question for things like ethereum is like can we do this without being Savages like can we put eth into a two or two multisig uh but can we make eth neutral enough you know that like people trust it uh enough to work as this like you know Bearer or Bond like neutrally enforced by like the system based on some you know contract so like in the future maybe peace treaties uh or alliances or non-aggression pacts uh would be seen as suspect if they don't have an on-chain bond in a neutral currency right right right and so like my head has gone to like sweet we are definitely beyond the barbaric era of like using children as collateral so like we've we're now in democracies but actually we have like nuclear missiles pointed at every single corner of the globe and like people forget about that when they just are going about their like day-to-day basis but like you know using children as collateral definitely barbaric but if that's barbaric and we're using that as like a facetious example of like how to force coordination upon warring tribes what the hell is this like push button nuclear Armageddon that we have like how is that not just barbarism to the nth degree and that's because like this physical nation-state world is based on like physical rules of who's more powerful than the name neighbors and you already gave the example of just like you know we can't really just globally uh demilitarize because that just leaves the most brutal military as the one that's left standing but that's because it's that's the physical world right like an ethereum and Bitcoin there are no there is no stick there are only only carrots to incentivize coordination uh because you know Bitcoin incentivizes coordination by paying you Bitcoins to mine it right ethereum incentivizes uh security by like locking up your ether and then it will punish you if you like try and attack the blockchain and then Dallas as as we've we've said Dows are like so long as there's a rage quit mechanism built into them and that's kind of like table Stakes for Dows uh that like there's no stick in the system there's only opt-in incentives and so like I don't know how we get all Global like tribes to coordinate with ethereum but whatever it is it has to be by definition like an opt-in carrot-based system that doesn't because they don't have sticks or the ethereum doesn't give you a stick because it's stuck inside of the internet yeah at the protocol level ethereum doesn't have sticks uh it only gives out carrots you could think of like a stick as like slashing but like that's a you know you can opt out of that you don't have to stake right yeah you opt into the slashing you don't have to opt out of this lashing if if there is like a war treasury uh as part of the protocol fund you know uh then maybe ethereum could have a stick uh the the United States started without a stick too uh in some sense uh because it it started not collecting taxes um like at the federal level didn't have a federal tax it only added that later on um I don't think it's likely that ethereum adds protocol you know level funding uh I think it's even less likely that if we have it it goes towards uh funding sticks um but yeah that's what you would need to do so yeah it doesn't seem likely um right the the uh US dollar is a protocol with a stick uh really big stick you know it doesn't even really speak softly anymore right right uh yeah we like to um like blow up like the the whole like dollar uh demand you know propping it up Petra dollar thing is kind of weird um I went on a bunch of rants about this after the tornado stuff because I was angry uh and people were like talking about how tornado was like the bad guys and how like you know crimes are bad and it's like I agree that crimes are bad uh there's just like Nuance there uh um because like a lot of things that were crimes like aren't crimes anymore or we like look back at them and we're like really ashamed of them being crimes and you know we like don't do the thing where we like reward the entrepreneurs uh for their like taking on the risk of like breaking those crimes uh or laws or whatever and in order to like normalize and make progress for the rest of it like I order marijuana in a store I pay taxes it's FDA approved to make sure it's like very high concentration and there's like people still in jail for you know having small amounts of it like years ago uh a lot of times in the dollar bubble we're like we're the good guys uh because like we you know we're America but like we also do questionable things to uh enforce dollar demand like blow up a rock to enforce the petrol dollar you know steal everybody's gold stop you know doing dollar redemptions and then I'm getting the chronology a little bit out of order here but sure and it's just uh it's a long list so yeah it's not just the US it's like every country sort of does this thing uh so this is this is maybe a segue into Rye uh like my other project rise a fork of maker Dao you know trying to um try to see if we can make stable coins without explicit pegs to the dollar uh and so it is Peg to like a dollar denominated number but it's allowed to float uh and Rye has been great so far because of what it's been able to teach us uh where like you know what we're doing on ethereum like we we want to like we we want to believe that like the systems that we're building are like improvements over the status quo right um Bitcoin gets to say that like because of 21 million you know they're transparent and you know it's not uh inflationary uh you know and the inflation doesn't look benefit as specific cartel right ethereum gets to make similar statements not quite as hard on the currency uh side but like you know we we um take some Liberties because we we uh have the utility of the uh smart contract platform and so we optimize for making that as useful as possible um but we haven't like you know like solve money uh and money is like the scam that like every country runs on its citizens uh and we have like the privilege in the United States of like not having it be as bad as most countries uh where the inflation is like pretty bad uh and like often you know increases unexpectedly uh and like we don't you can't like ask Central Bankers how to operate a central bank like right now uh because the way that they do it is so like bastardized from like how it in theory should be done uh because they just have to like manage their like most of them didn't come up with the scheme they're just like inherited some Ponzi that they're trying to keep alive for as long as possible uh and that's like what they're judged you know on their job uh and and so like with ethereum uh with with things like die the original idea such an awesomely like reductive way of explaining what the FED does is just like prop up the Ponzi and good good feds promote the longevity of the Ponzi yeah yeah um I'll come back to that point but uh yeah we we haven't like we haven't like gotten past the dollar right like we have our usdc we're like yeah we're D5 you know we had our die it was backed by eth at first we're like yeah you know we've decentralized Finance but like it's still mostly dollars right and so we want to look at it and we want to be like well how do we get away from dollars and there's a couple ways right there's one which is like well back it with something else right you can you can have dollar denominated instrument but that doesn't come with you know the like the usdc block lists for example if like you use die or something you know um or or even like tracks um but but uh with with die it was like originally it was like well let's back it by Ether and then you know the collateral can't be frozen but then they back it with usdc and then you're like okay well [ __ ] uh now what uh and so that's why with Rye it's backed only with eth um but it's still like dollar denominated you know so it's still somewhat subject to the esoteric policies of the you know Federal Reserve it just like can float you know around it uh I mean you install or denominated in the sense that like if I ask you the price of Rye yeah it's a dollar and like the interest rate in dollar terms right right right yeah yeah so um and then uh like you know it started 3.14 it's like floated down to I think it's like 2.85 now um and so it it has a negative interest rate uh fairly consistently uh since the crash to incentivize people to deposit East to help rob you know holders uh or borrowers get out if they need to that's what the elevated right some on the market tells the system to do automatically we don't have to have meetings about this we just let the controller run sets the rates automatically so this kind of thing is nice because what Rye is it's like sort of a Central Bank in a box you know and like you can like operate your little thing on the blockchain your toy first principles develops you know Central Bank thing and then you can use it and then look at theirs and be like how the [ __ ] did you get there uh like what what series of you know what like what monstrosity have you wrought uh like like you guys like if you try to explain you know how you get to the fed and like make her doubt you know like starting from something like maker now you're like okay so first you have to rug pull the collateral right uh you you really you know Nixon wants to drop bombs on Vietnam uh you told everybody that the dollars were packed to Gold including all the foreign countries that you promised that you would redeem uh so we'd lie to everybody uh we really want to bomb Vietnam so we print a bunch of dollars bomb numb but now there's more dollars same amount of gold you know uh France comes calling with their Battleship maybe someone else but uh hello important yeah Fort Knox like give us the gold and then Nixon's like Public Announcement uh in order to defend the Integrity of the US dollar we are ending redemptions right he did that because he heard that Charles dugall the third or somebody sent the battleship to go get the gold and so the battleship is on the way to go get the gold and Nixon was like I'm closing the window because you guys can make it in time sorry yeah because we're close right we're close for business yeah right uh and then basically everybody scrambled people started selling their dollars and then uh the US came up with the petrodollar scheme uh and so this was like the let's like pump the Ponzi on the demand side you know let's find our like pool too uh and and so their pool two is in Saudi Arabia uh and they deals with the Saudis and you know the other oil producing Nations to uh sell them sell oil exclusively for dollars and they give you know discounts uh to allow the Saudis to reinvest in bonds and stocks and whatever and they get you know military bases and f-15s you know and so forth um and so we did this uh to prop up the dollar uh in the face of you know the and so then it's like the reason I bring all of this up is because like you need all this context in order to have a moral conversation uh about the dollar uh because without all that it's just like dollar good uh you know uh alternatives to Dollar bad you know and it's just like oh my God uh like let's go down the list and like you know you like the reason I like to bring this up with Americans is because there's there's sort of like two places that you get to you know when you when you start thinking this through you're like okay either we're like full real politic like [ __ ] yeah America you know World War One World War II back-to-back Champs right like um right dollar Ponzi forever right like it's the best Ponzi ever like we're winning right like that's the mentality you know like imperialism we're the best at it right uh versus the other which is like uh acknowledging the dollar as like a cost and your like moral balance sheet uh because you have to like occasionally go blow up a rock because Saddam is selling you know oil for euros and we don't like that we want to set an example and you know uh like maybe like the the US Empire is like a good thing you know good thing like generally for the world like in in terms of our ability to combat China our ability to thwart Russia like if the US wasn't as powerful Ukraine would have a much harder time possibly also be Russia right now right uh and so like it's a good thing that the U.S has the strength to fight off these like you know uh despotic Invaders and authoritarian Communists and you know these types of things um and and but like then like at least you've put the like dollar Ponzi thing into like a moral cut you know you're like ah the the cost of doing this is like we have to do this stuff in order to you know be able to and then and like you know at least that's like a more reasonable conversation you can have out of that because then you can be like well what happens when the US stops being like a good policeman internationally or something right like maybe that this isn't uh you know able to be propped up um uh like you know it's not morally uh worth it uh or something um but you're but you're what you're saying is that at least you are having to consider the worth of it as in at least we are not just dumbly saying dollar good we were actually doing like a cost benefit analysis on this thing yeah and like there's other things you know around this too where it's like the dollar being strong in the sense that like post 1970s Petro dollar dollar as the world Reserve currency uh hollowed out a lot of American manufacturing and like middle class jobs and ship them over overseas because uh you know that's uh like the currency valuations with more favorable for that and so like the us became a net exporter of dollars and so the entire financier class made a killing uh and everybody else does a manufacturing class took the L and I actually remember explicitly asking Lynn Alden if the triffin Dilemma what we're talking about here the the fact that the dollar is the global Reserve currency was that the main main source main reason why Donald Trump got elected and she was like yes I do believe that that's why that happened because Donald Trump ran on that platform of manufacturing in Pennsylvania like all the all these high manufacturing uh states that flipped red and elected Donald Trump they lost all their manufacturing jobs because we just started exporting dollars for free because we were printing them and then you know the it's like that that Domino meme you know down the line because of because we have to export our dollars because of the Petro dollar like we lose all of our internal manufacturing jobs and then then we elect Donald Trump because we're aggrieved yes 100 uh yeah uh the these are like the things that are like Downstream of the like you know currency like scams and and you know the the discontents of the the currency manipulation and like that's the decision that the US made as an empire was like we're gonna switch to being like a financial thing you know we're gonna just export dollars and play with money um and then and then it becomes really important to prop up demand for the dollar right right uh and like the only real collateral we have because there's so much dollars is dollar denominated debt just real bad yeah right right there's a story that I like to tell uh and this is about Thomas Jefferson and slavery um and like the reason I tell this story uh is because like when we think about this we like we think about this as like a problem that like you know it's almost intractable right uh like like you couldn't go protest this right um like uh like um okay A lot of times when I talk to people they they seem to think that like working inside the system is like the best option for making change right and that like almost every problem you can like you know solve eventually by working inside the system and I like to bring up like the American South and slavery and Civil War um Thomas Jefferson uh the guy who uh you know wrote like all men are created equal he also came up with this like really fascinating Financial instrument uh slave collateralized debt he basically made maker doubt for your slaves uh so he rolled up to a bank was like yo I've got all these slaves I need money can I use the slaves as collateral and get cash and the bank was like ha interesting idea we're down and like Fast Forward 50 60 years the entire South was like using huge amounts of loans uh like backed by slave uh collateral and so like uh like this is basically a slave Ponzi that went out of control like they were yield farming like literally you know yield farming right and that you'd like Leverage up right oh I got some money I mean buy more slaves let me get more debt you know um the slaves to to get more money to get more slaves to put more slaves as collateral and Cycles it back up the the slave population of uh West Virginia I think was like 60 and uh maybe it's like South Carolina it was 60 and like Virginia was like 40 so the slave populations had grown a lot um and like every Founding Father like the banks were trading these uh contracts like Fast Forward 56 years as if they're like mortgage-backed Securities today like they bundle you know like slip you know and so it's basically this like Bank enforce Ponzi at that point uh right because it's not like the banks are gonna let you off the hook right the banks aren't just going to allow you to Jubilee right uh so this is one of those cases where it's like even if the political will existed even if the moral will existed within that context within the South it didn't matter because the economic reality was that you couldn't get everybody to pay back their debt at the same time uh in order to like release their slaves uh and and not only that they were like terrified of their slaves like because of how you know poorly they've been treating them they're like this is why they made the clan and stuff after us to continue terrorizing them uh you know as like a first strike um but uh every founding father died uh knowing that this war the Civil War was inevitable uh because there is no way within the system uh to get out of that slave debt Ponzi right uh if you're a person in the south and you're like hey guys I think this is a bad idea we should stop doing this you don't get very far uh everybody sort of has to be opposed to you uh even if they don't like even if they agree with you uh like you know they they can't uh help you uh like like Malik has gone too far right right and so like yeah is a is a financial crisis the only path out is a financial crisis where the collateral the slaves are liberated at gunpoint you know uh like that's the only way out of that system like it's it you know it it can't stop itself right and and so like the mental model like is you know that comes out of that is like sometimes Wars have to be fought to end ponzis right you know oh [ __ ] I think I think I see where this is going you might see where this is going uh because then it's like huh do we as Americans have the political and moral will to end the dollar Ponzi within the United States uh because if we don't then like we should expect that people will try to end it for us and that's going to look like war and we probably deserve that war you know because it's not like we were gonna do it ourselves right that's like an awkward conclusion to come to uh as a good guy yeah okay so what what is this metaphor here so like there's a ton of debt out there and we have been hunting dollars to pay for like you know cheap Chinese goods and paying for cheap Philip you know Philippine labor like who are the who are the who are the like the if we've been printing this dollar and like who are the who are the people that really want the system to end so everybody that isn't the United States that has to use the dollars like uh uh like doesn't benefit from their own senior age as much as they could right uh like to the extent that like we go you know blow up a rock or something we sort of like you know like to the extent that the dollar is the dominant Reserve currency like we have uh exorbitant privilege with our senior age our printing uh has a much larger market to absorb uh you know our printing uh and so we're sort of taking that value from every other country uh you know uh that would otherwise be benefiting from their own senior age uh in an increased capacity um but of course it also you know it's it's more about the Strategic Rivals right like Russia and China uh want to you know they're promoting transacting using the ren maybe and the Russian currencies um so yeah uh like people also say like there's no alternative like what else would you do right um and I think that's like like the thing that you else would like the other thing you would do is like not invade a rock to prop up the dollar you know like uh you would just allow the dollar to like not lose value uh yeah you just like be okay with some you know probably uh serious loss in purchasing power which would look like you know High inflation for a while um but at the end of it you know like like a fair system has America extracting as much value from the global market as it has actually earned with you know its contribution to the market not uh like over and above its contribution to the market because it's extracting you know a rent for basically the rest of the world using dollars as the currency uh and the American you know Financial system so like the the allowing the dollar to inflate if we hadn't invaded Iraq sounds like okay we'll throw up the flag and just we won't let this Ponzi perpetuate but instead we chose the path where we kicked the can down the road because we want the Ponzi to perpetuate as long as possible so this is the thing that's weird right it's like why did we invade a rock you know like like this is what we were saying about voting and coercion and like democracy and it's like you know I didn't vote to invade Iraq uh everybody who was in favor of invading Iraq lied about it they said there were weapons of mass destruction they printed it in the New York Times we believed it they said like I remember I was 10 I saw I listened to this on the news every day weapons of mass destruction for years and years and nothing happened right so like who you know it's like maybe right the Russian people didn't invade vote to invade Ukraine Putin decided to you know invade Ukraine right maybe the American people didn't vote to invade Iraq but like the pattern of maintaining the dollar dominance uh you know as managed by the Federal Reserve is why we invaded Iraq how is that different than me as a U.S citizen be being controlled by the Federal Reserve dictatorship you know uh if if like if that is the pattern of war in this country then like you know like like it's not like you know somebody actually threatened America like that was all lies it was like they threatened the dollar Ponzi and so we blew them up right right right so like that makes me feel like I'm living in a Fed dictatorship right and then this has been the question I've been waiting kind of like circling around like the the the Jerry Britto unrelated to all this conversation Jerry Britto and I talked to him about like the tornado cash thing which was one Department out of the global the the larger United States government one Department the treasury banned tornado cash like it had nothing to do with the FDA it had nothing to do with like Congress it was just like one part of this broader machine and so he said he said the United States is not a monolith it was just this one and part of this broader system that did this one thing but then if you like Zoom all the way out and kind of get a little bit more you know uh satellite view of like the whole entire incentive structure of the broader American System yes the US government is not a monolith it is a modular set of inter interwoven agencies and representatives but at a incentive level you can talk about the nation-state both the United States nation state Other Nation States as a holistic system and it works out like most of the time as in if you assume agency by a nation-state you can kind of predict what it's going to do as a whole and that is weird to me that you can do that but it works pretty damn well a lot of time one of my favorite models for this is like uh some like Democratic processes I I model by being like okay they react too late and then they overreact uh so like if if that's like all you knew about the United States you could like model our coveted response pretty well you know uh we're just gonna pretend like it's not a problem and then we're gonna shut everything down right it's like you can often do that and that's like typically our control system as like humans like when we think of like oh you know we like global warming right foreign and then we're going to overreact and then it's going to be like austerity measures for everyone right so it's like it's pretty common like this like it's uh like you you can model things using like just get like what kind of control system is this like what is what is the feedback you know response to uh things that come up and like yeah that helps you predict it so holistically like tribes organizations governments they're not a monolith they're independent Parts but they kind of have like agency right like there's the uh who wrote who wrote um the Leviathan Thomas Hobbs Leviathan where like it's actually like all the interdependent parts are part of this like larger creature and it's it's like the United States has agency because it has its own wants and desires and like desire to live and it's really the dollar that I think is like one of the main things that needs to have value because as soon as a dollar goes to zero the United States falls apart and so it's like the dollar that's keeping things together so it's like the dollar has its own like demand to live desire to live and it creates this incentive structure out of that demand um so how does that how does that relate to the the Democracy ignores it and then um and then overreacts how does those how do those things relate um sure so like let me let me try to apply that theory right it's like um Maybe like we don't see the like egregiousness of the US dollar uh right now like as Citizens within the country so we ignore it right um in the same way that like it takes a while for us to like decide that slavery is worth fighting a war over right it has to like grow big enough and oppressive enough um and so like maybe one day you know uh uh we realize that like the way we're managing the dollar is like not great um also uh I just want to like pull apart a couple things right not liking the dollar and like not liking America are somewhat different um like you could be a dollar Ponzi minimalist right and be like we should not be you know have this Reserve currency that we like try to prop up demand for artificially and like still like America and like be a US citizen and like be a patriot even in fact I think it's patriotic to want a future for the US that is separate from the dollar Ponzi that we're fighting Wars to maintain I think a better use of America's people uh uh you know armed for like is like not throwing you know to help prop up the dollar Ponzi but what do I know right um but like maybe you know in the future it could be that we like overreact right and then we or like no country can operate the reserve currency you know and we like uh we we go all in on uh neutral Reserve currencies or something and like we we start propping up Bitcoin or ethereum uh as like collateral um that's like one uh or it's like the the you know we ignore BTC and eth for so long and then we overreact by like Banning them completely right um they're they're both like outcomes that I think are you know possible for for the government uh the the idea is to try and come up with systems that anticipate you know um problems and like can work to overcome them well the problem is that it's hard to get people to coordinate around doing that when it's like uh not immediately apparent then that's that that's a problem right so uh the the hope for things like ethereum is that they can actually solve these Global coordination problems like why are we fighting over like the world is on fire you know like uh we have a global climate crisis right like things are only going to get more scarce Supply chains are only going to break down on their own like we could spend our you know effort to uh try to solve some of these problems you know put our heads together figure out how to clean water clean air you know Restore store things but instead we're like fighting over Ukraine right it's like uh maybe one day there's like a you know radicalist environmentalist League or something uh and they like have their own uh you know proposals to like boycott things or like protest things or you know there's a bunch of people like sitting in the forest in Germany and they like wouldn't get down from the trees so like they couldn't cut them down uh that was pretty cool you know think like things like that or uh get you know throwing wrenches in the way of people destroying the environment although that's not great either because now you know we're like everybody's dependent on Russian gas and the reality is that like that's you know fueling the war in Ukraine now it's like so even sometimes when you try to get away from these things they still come back and so to to tie a bow on this conversation how does ethereum fix all this uh ethereum fixes all this by inspiring people to try and think about how ethereum fixes all this and step one obviously uh motivational equilibrium uh but but I I I mean that like half jokingly and I like I actually mean that uh seriously too like there is now like things like Vita Dao uh that's doing like longevity research on the blockchain where they have like nfts as like IP and you can invest in that and help fund you know longevity things that you want um like okay it's gonna sound this is gonna sound weird um so like every Empire is basically a joiner die Ponzi uh like one of the funny uh contracts uh that like Athens you know as part of the Delian League made I think it was a Isle of Lesbos and this is pretty funny uh maybe it was another one but like like the reason Lesbos like lesbian it's like they basically like showed up to this island and were like you guys can join the League or we'll kill you all uh and they're like we will not join the League and they're like [ __ ] it uh you know we're gonna climb the walls kill all the men sell everybody to slavery and like uh solve the women to slavery uh and like Lesbos has no more men that's why it's Lesbos um but like you know uh what happens when somebody puts a joiner die Ponzi on chain hmm like what if the Joiner Die ponzian Chain is like more efficient than uh the way Empires work like the the thing that citizenship sells you uh like like in the in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs of citizenship the base level is deterrence right like I agree to be a citizen of the United States because like if I go somewhere and somebody hurts me like you know they'll maybe get hurt worse right I like it means something to me I feel safe and protected you know domestically and abroad right uh and so like your your main like service your main offer as a nation state is deterrence so like when I think of Coca-Cola you know I see like sugar water when I think of a nation state I think of like an assassination Guild with a public goods Department right you're like like imagine trying to operate a nation-state without an assassination Guild you know uh like you're gonna have a really hard time doing any deterrence you mean you mean a monopoly on violence that's that's another way of uh describing it that's why that's how we've described it on Bank list before yeah Monopoly online yeah yeah so yeah it's it's like um it's just like one of those things like if if like I could see you know uh citizenship being disrupted for example uh if somebody can offer deterrence as a service more cheaply right uh if I join something and like now I know that you know I'm protected in this way like yeah I'll maybe pay for it a little extra or something but um you know like that's the number one reason and it's like maybe you don't need to operate this like massive expensive infrastructure in order to like operate it you know deterrent in 2022 like maybe it's a lot cheaper uh now I don't think we're gonna see any of that anytime soon uh I don't think we're gonna see like Joiner die ponzis where people are like you know you it's option but like uh I'm kind of afraid of it um because like the you know like when we talk about beating Molly we talk about like these coordination systems like what if we unleash you know an even better coordination system right something something like you know religion which I'm like sort of diametrically opposed opposed to given you know my upbringing uh you know sort of had Islamic fundamentals father who fought a lot um but it's like religion's like what you get when you solve Malik for your system right like uh I want the males to not infight over the women uh and so we're gonna make a bunch of rules to like manage our conflict internally uh and now like we're a really you know how like highly coordinated and like more trusting society and that gives us the opportunity to like go take everyone else over and impose our you know God Ponzi on them and like the way we do things on them and so it's like you know from the inside looking in you're like oh man how do I solve this problem of like these monkeys just like fighting over you know reading rights and like resources yeah yeah and like [ __ ] killing each other over this [ __ ] like the [ __ ] animals you know and then uh and then you make some like crazy rule book and you kill everybody who doesn't uh enforce it and then you end up with this like God Ponzi the last two thousand years laughs uh and and so I think uh I think maybe there's like positive ponzis uh that like we should be optimistic for uh that it's like you know join and Thrive or something like uh live in that live Fonzie right right right right and like that's uh that's what we should be trying to help promote um is like I agree to like I don't know like I agree to not pay taxes would be funny uh like as a commitment device you know uh I'm not advocating for that I think paying tax is important I just think like if you end up at the point that you're like okay the government's just blowing [ __ ] up and like not saving the world like we need to be saving the world uh government like I'm now boycott you know like right um like being able to coordinate you know activism boycotts uh movements um to to try and make our systems more accurately reflect our values instead of like our systems just being ponzis that sustain themselves indefinitely even when they are opposed to our values is like uh the idea maybe more things need a rage quit you know it's like every system that like starts out useful and it like ends up scam everything it's like exists on a spectrum of like useful and scam right and like the beginning of this life it's like useful the end of its life scam that's why we need that you know the destructive creativity uh to burn down some of these like scams that have outlived their usefulness in 2022 uh saying well I mean I hope uh I hope people's imaginations have been expanded to uh what it is we're actually doing here uh why things are ponzis all the way down and how it's also just coordination so thank you for telling me uh helping me tell this very creative
