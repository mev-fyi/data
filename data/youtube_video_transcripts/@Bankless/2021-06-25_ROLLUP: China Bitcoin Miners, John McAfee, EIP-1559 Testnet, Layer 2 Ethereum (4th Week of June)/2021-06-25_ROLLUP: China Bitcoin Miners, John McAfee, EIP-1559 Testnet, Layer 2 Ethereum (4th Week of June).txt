[Music] thankless nation welcome to this friday's episode of the bankless weekly roll up once again for the second time this week we have a special episode because our fearless leader ryan sean adams is out on vacation and so we have brought in a substitute teacher anthony cesano the second time that he stepped in for ryan uh and anthony welcome to the bankless weekly rollup thanks for helping us go through the news man hey david thanks for having me again you know i'm ryan keeps slacking off i have to keep making up for for it so uh you know i'm always happy to do that yeah yeah well right ryan does a ton of the leg work behind the uh behind the scenes and so uh happy to get a new face in on the show and while ryan deserves a a well-deserved vacation or slacking off one of the two things all right bankless nation i'm sure this isn't your first weekly roll up so you know what to do get out your coffee because we are going to be moving through a bunch of topics really quickly first we're stopping at the market what happened in the last week in the market releases what got released news what happened in the news cycle some eco system takes who had good opinions in the last week of crypto and then finally we will finish off with what david and anthony are excited about and the cherry on top after that the meme of the week anthony you ready to get going here let's do it it's been an exciting week but guys first before we get into the show we got to talk about ledger and how you kind of need one have you been just fooling around in d5 doing yield farming and all that other stuff and you've been doing it on your metamask and your hot wallet if you've been using a hot wallet you have to get a ledger hardware wallet and the ledger hardware wallet only becomes more and more useful as ledger integrates more and more defy apps and the most recent defy app that they've integrated is paraswap and so you can now use paraswap directly from the ledger live software which is the the software you can download on your computer it's extremely friendly to all of the all of your friends that you're trying to get into crypto send them get them a ledger first and foremost and then send them to the ledger live app which is a very safe environment to be in crypto while also being your own bank if you are unfamiliar with what pair swap is it is a dex aggregator that combs the world and landscape of dexes and make sure that you get your the best optimized trade whenever you swap your crypto assets and now you can use it inside of your ledger so check out the link in the show notes if you want to download the ledger live app and also get a ledger hardware wallet which like i said if you don't have a hardware wallet you're playing it risky so protect yourself with a ledger and just start using the ledger live app all right bitcoin at the price of thirty four thousand three hundred dollars anthony got any opinions as the ads to the trajectory or price action that we've seen in the last week with bitcoin not not really not any strong opinions it's just been uh weak uh price wise for a little bit you know i tried to to bounce up a bit after falling under 30k again and you know i think everyone's just holding their breath and seeing if it's going to maintain that because i feel like at this point in time not just with bitcoin but with everything people are just kind of like too scared to open long positions at right now because they're like okay if i can buy it back in cheaper there's no rush really right now um but yeah who knows what's gonna happen from here it's really uh everyone that i follow that's either a trader or investor whatever no one really knows what's gonna happen in the short term i think it's the most confused i've seen in the market in a very long time yeah confused definitely really seems to be the word of choice for the last week what do you think about this head and shoulders formation that people traders are really talking about where the shoulder the left shoulder is in january february of 2021 and now we are establishing that right shoulder and then the high range between 50 and 60 000 was the head what do you think about this head and shoulders formation yeah i've been watching it it seems like something that the bears really really want to play out because that would mean that btc would go to around 20k or even below 20k which would be obviously like the buying opportunity of a lifetime on bitcoin or at least what people will consider to be the buying opportunity of a lifetime but it still has time to invalidate i mean it has to get back over 40k uh it seems like to and and stay there like it tried to do that a little while ago and then it just failed um but yeah i think this is this is quite scary if it plays out uh because just based on technicals if it does play out properly yeah it'll be going to the old all-time high uh to test it again and you know that's always scary uh i there's a lot of precedent there to say that going underneath the old all-time high is just not something that bitcoin does when it comes down but at the same time you know who knows right this has been a weird bull market so maybe it's going to be a weird bear market if we go into that yes again that's an interesting way to put it i i my opinion here is that so many people have their eyes on the head and shoulders that it's it can't play out too many people are watching it and so it's it's a crowded trade if it is a trade at all let's move to ether price ether price currently hanging at around nineteen hundred and seventy dollars it's been flirting above two thousand dollars uh recently uh yesterday and the day before it got up to i think as high as two hundred and or two thousand and forty dollars uh and it's struggling to keep its head above that with that two thousand dollar mark but um doing a pretty good job of it uh again right now falling below nine uh nineteen thousand and seventy dollars anthony any opinions on at the eth price yeah i mean i think it feels like it's just following bitcoin at this point in time uh it doesn't seem like kind of like head and shoulders pattern underneath or anything like that or any kind of like i guess obvious technical patterns but i feel like bitcoin led the the way down and it's kind of like leading the the strength now in the market and if bitcoin seems strong then it's going to seem strong but yeah i just it's just limbo again like the eighth i guess the eighth price is even more confusing than the bitcoin price because it's just not acting on its own it's waiting for a for a signal from bitcoin which is waiting for a signal from whoever to kind of go um and to go back up basically yeah absolutely uh i think in a confused market uh everyone is kind of waiting for for bitcoin to make its first move right it reminds me of that meme from um uh forrest gump where all the runners are running behind forests and everyone's waiting to see what forest will do next uh and so i think if when we are going to finally get some clarity as to what this direction of the market is it's gonna probably come from bitcoin first um everyone's looking at the biggest whale in the room here and of course um bitcoin is still it's still king still number one that's why we always start with bitcoin price but if any other asset happens to uh surpass bitcoin in uh total market cap we will lead with that one first um speaking of the most recent and the most likely candidate is perhaps ether so let's talk about the btc ratio currently at .057 which historically still high again still high versus bitcoin uh coming off the highs that we touched just above 0.08 when it was the flipping mania uh anthony is are you seeing strength or weakness in the eth btc ratio again uh it's i i think this is related to what bitcoin's doing so i think if bitcoin starts going up and trying to confirm some bullish continuation the ratio is just going to fall because everyone's going to be piling into a bitcoin trade and i feel like ebtc does really well during bullish momentum um but during kind of like bearish momentum it seems to either just trend down slowly get stuck in kind of limbo um i'm i'm eyeing that 0.055 level that it tested last time but uh you know it could go lower than that it just depends on if bitcoin starts sucking up uh all the air again and uh sorry sucking in all the air out of the room again uh we can see this drop further so generally i don't know people that kind of trade btc they more trade sentiment around btc and eat which is which gets reflected in this chart so it's a very messy chart that's for sure and let's go to the d5 pulse index which i have to admit defeat on my .013 bottom call we are at point zero one two which is meaningfully below point zero one three and it's been a week without trying to regain it uh i thought it put up a valiant effort uh but uh i guess we are just going lower than than what i thought however i i still think that this is a good buying opportunity for dpi uh this it's just approaching lower lower lows and lower lows and the the fundamentals behind a lot of these c5 tokens are only getting stronger especially when we talk about price to sales ratio and and uh the cash flow as as a price of earnings and comparing that to traditional valuations and traditional metrics uh really really cheap defy tokens in my opinion anthony got any opinions here i mean it's a little bit surprising how weak the fire has been against 8th in particular uh this is you know it's pretty much like i think it's at an all-time low or something like that or lower than it's going to last low there we can see in the chart um you know we could i guess talk about uh dpis performance in general and like d5's performance for for hours but i think the one thing that uh caught a lot of people off guard was the fact that they thought during like the mania people were going to pile into default tokens when in reality they piled into like dog tokens and scams and like retail never came for d5 at least ethereum d5 i mean you could there's other quote-unquote d5 out there that um you know it is kind of falls into that category because they market themselves as such but i just really think that that the retail investors didn't come and we don't have enough institutional and and traditional investors in this space to really care about price to sales price to earnings you have to move the needle there but at the same time each is just like such an amazing showing point of an asset for the firm ecosystem i mean if you own defi like ethereum default tokens you own eight like that already is enough signal to me because like you know d5 is a broad kind of thing and if i own eighth it doesn't necessarily mean i own any kind of like specific defy token i might own some of them but it's not like everyone owns the same like me and you would own different kind of default tokens or we might have some overlap but generally we both own ether so that that shelling point of an asset i think is incredibly important i think that's why it's so so hard to outperform each in over the long run yeah as we know eth is ultra sound money and so that's that's always why we kind of look at this dpi versus eth ratio because to me the dpi dollar number is only only tells so much of a story right um the d5 and ultrasound money i think orbit around each other they it's really the ratio between the magnitude of these two things i think is really the signal versus the noise and i mean we're all pretty convinced that over the long term both defy tokens and ether going up in dollar terms anyway so why don't we get ahead of that conversation and just start comparing these things to each other we are currently standing at 51 billion dollars locked in d5 again coming out the highs i used to be at 90 billion but 50 billion dollars 50 billion dollars is still a pretty high number not setting any new flow floors i would say uh staying above the the 50 billion markers is pretty cool anthony any opinions here yeah i mean the dollar value locked is just going to follow um the prices obviously so as prices come down especially of eighth that dollar value is going to fall so i mean yeah yeah basically like i i feel like it's it's completely natural um and you know if you zoom out to like all on that chart the growth is still like incredible uh absolutely incredible right even over um yeah it really does look like it really does look exactly like the heating chart which is which is pretty funny but i think i think yeah generally like obviously if 8 is going down then that number is going to be going down um you know at this point in time because eighth is the prim you know premier collateral the pristine collateral that everyone uses within these systems um and you know that that that's why it's tied i think ave coming in still at number one with the most value locked at in 15 dominance according to d5 pulse ave and d5 pulse report different numbers locked if you go to the ave page they report a different number and so i'm wondering i'm wondering where that discrepancy is is counted from uh something new that we might be revisiting a lot on the bankless weekly rollups is this new website called layer2bl2beat.com and this is kind of similar to d5 pulse in that it compares the amount of value deposited onto different layer twos and interestingly it's decided to not include polygon here which i guess because polygon isn't a true layer two i guess they are are drawing that line there um i personally consider polygon a layer two just because any scaling solution i think that's politically aligned with the theorem at the very least as a layer two that's a subject for perhaps a different day um but uh loopering coming in at number one with 120 million locked uh followed up by zk swap with 70 million and dydx with 43 million we got optimism in there we got hermes in there we got uh zk sink and uh uh let's see what's what's the other one um arbitrary as well uh with a you know just a relatively low number of sixty six thousand dollars in arbitrary but i think that these numbers are going up and to the right and it's gonna happen pretty damn fast yeah i think i think you can look at what happened with polygon even even if polygon isn't included here i think you can look at what happened there and kind of like extrapolate that out to what's going to happen with things like optimism arbitrarily you know evm compatible zk sync and things like that like once you have the platform live and the apps on there the users come very very quickly as we've seen because liquidity is so easy to move and as long as you have the correct infrastructure tools and the correct kind of plumbing in there you can get users across so yeah i think this this is kind of noise right now because the layer 2 ethereum ecosystem is still so so early um you know and and a lot of these things aren't even live in a public fashion hopefully arbitram goes live very soon um and optimism obviously you know said that said they'd be going live in july i think they still might hit that but uh and then you know the other ones are coming later so i feel like in the next six months this is going to look very very different and the top projects will probably be uh the the kind of like generalized platforms because loopering is amazing but loopering isn't a general generalized platform right it's just its own ecosystem uh so it probably can never be as big as the generalized ones but that's not what they're going for so that's fine uh same with things like diy dx and and zk swap and all that sort of stuff so yeah i think it's really cool that this site exists and i can't wait to to see what it looks like in six months time do you have an opinion as to why dydx builds on its own layer 2 or or rather instead of just picking out something like arbitrary or optimism that has more generalizability and and perhaps a more diverse ecosystem in the future yeah you get i guess you get more control build like building out your own thing it's like it's kind of like this theory that like every app should have its own chain so to speak so app specific blockchain and that's kind of like the cosmos uh model i guess and unless to a lesser extent maybe the polkadot model but um you know i think for them they just wanted to like be laser focused on their own products and not have like the noise of of of anything else um in the background there they they also rebuilt i believe dydx in cairo in starkware's programming language they didn't build it in solidity and they're using starkwear's new virtual machine uh stock os or something like that the operating system there so yeah i think it's just like a different kind of um uh uh a model it's like the loop ring model so to speak but they want to create their own ecosystem they want to be laser focused on their own product they don't want to have anyone in there you know crowding out them out or whatever but they still want to live on ethereum and they still want to inherit ethereum security so yeah and i think there was a podcast done i can't remember where it was what it was done i don't know if it was done on bank or somewhere else where uh dydx and stock were on there they were talking about like their philosophy through this and how they didn't mind having to so yeah yeah okay but then yeah they didn't mind having to rebuild uh the thing from scratch because i only took like six months and now they have like a fully you know um scalable roll up so to speak using some some of the best technology in the space so yeah i don't i i think it's just like a different model at the end of the day totally yeah and if you guys want to check out the anthony that or the podcast that anthony's talking about that was a state of the nation with dydx and starkware you can find that on the youtube here is something new that happened this last week over a hundred thousand ether 200 million dollars was staked into ethereum 2.0 in a single day uh anthony do you know who who did this yeah it was me uh i didn't want to die i didn't want to dox myself till today but uh yeah no you know what it's funny because like uh on bitfinex at around 1700 to 1800 when eighth was falling through there was a massive massive whale buying up eight like i think they bought over a hundred thousand each and i don't know if that sam whale is the one that put this into staking but this is a lot of aid going into staking i mean the confidence that that this signals about eighth like because this went in directly it didn't go in through some custodian it didn't go in through uh lighter or anything it went directly into the deposit contract which means this is locked until the merge so this person is essentially saying i don't want to sell this eid until at least the merged um so yeah it's a huge photo of confidence it's really great to see i i believe like every bit of east going into staking um direct staking not through like a third party let you exit whenever you want um is a vote of confidence for the future of ethereum and and you know this is just a huge like hundred thousand eighth i mean the dollar value on that right now is what like two is it two billion dollars 200. sorry 200 million not not billion that is that is a massive amount of money going in um so yeah really really cool to see this i'm not sure who it is like there's only a very few people who can afford that that amount of ethan who would actually buy that amount of eight maybe it was already someone that was already a whale i'd have to do some on-chain analysis but i haven't looked at it too closely yet that would be insanely cool if we got a story out about somebody who bought the dip and then just immediately just yeted it into the deposit contract that would be really really cool the other the other indicator you said a vote of confidence it to me it's just like obvi there's provable data of on-chain bulls like only bulls are in the deposit contract only bulls are people that have are buying ethan and putting it there because like like you said it's people that don't care about the price of ether they are they are holders until the end of time right um staking is nice because it intrinsically rewards bullishness uh people we talked on the bank list a weekly roll up a few weeks ago about people that had fears that you know when the merge finally happens if there's going to be a bunch of eth coming to the secondary market to dump because uh a lot of eth that got to place a place into the deposit contract got placed between like 300 and and 1 000 ether and so people might want to take some profits but my response to that is if you are depositing ether into the the deposit contract you are intrinsically an ethboll and so you actually are the person that is most inclined to not sell your ether and so we'll see how that plays out when the merge actually decides to come around and and i think it depends on what price uh what price is at that point in time as well and also uh for those who don't know there's actually a withdrawal queue like not everyone can withdraw at once i think a max 900 validators can get out a day which is 900 times 32 whatever that is um can get out a day so that's the max amount of selling pressure if you assume that they're all going to sell that we would have uh so you know when you think about that i just i don't know i i'm with you i feel like staking your eat is like a sign of bullishness and i feel like most of that eighth is just gonna stay in there forever i really don't believe uh that it's just gonna become like the merger is gonna go through the withdrawals are gonna be enabled and everyone's going to rush to the exits to sell i just i don't see that happening totally agreed another sign that this bull market is not over is a16dz launches a new 2.2 billion dollar crypto venture fund which means 2.2 dollars of investment is coming into this industry that is the largest uh fund that i have ever seen ever by a long shot uh i i think that's what this article is about is it's actually saying like yeah this is the largest fun out of crypto uh so congratulations to a16z well deserved part of that brand of power that you guys got there uh anthony any comments here yeah this this is definitely the largest fund it's it's uh their third fund so they've got two other ones that they've already deployed uh and i think the the most exciting thing about these funds is that they have to deploy um you know unless all the limited partners or lp's they're called one or their money back uh which you know a lot of the time they don't uh these funds have to be deployed which means that there's a lot of money coming into i think a lot of it will go into the private markets but they uh a16z still does otc deals with uh with projects i mean i think they did one recently with solana uh so this money is going to make its way into the ecosystem for sure regardless if it's a private deal or or a public deal or whatever um but this just means that anyone who wants to get funding i mean it's not just a16z either there are so many funds out there who recently raised money off the back of the bull market where people kind of foamed in like i think when people look at funds they think oh they're sophisticated they don't foam a win no man they're humans they foam away in just like everyone else um so so there's this money here just like for builders and we've seen some mega razors recently like uh stock wet 75 or 80 million or something diy decks at like 60 million so these teams are going to be able to build through any kind of bear market if we go into for some reason another two two year bear these teams are fine and there's more capital to raise you know series a's or series b's or seeds or whatever from these funds so this is incredibly bullish i think um for the builders space especially and for the fact that you know during the bear market there were not not that many funds in the 2018-2019 bear market and not many things were getting getting uh kind of funding now i mean there's billions just waiting to be deployed which is which is really exciting yeah there's a very strong conversation in 2018 and 2019 as to like yo how do we fund our industry ethereum really had that problem and and seeing these numbers come into funds like a16z and and like you said a16c it's the biggest by now so congratulations to them but there are so many that are also very large uh and so like guys we got we got fuel in the tank if anything bad happens uh for the long term with crypto prices ban tag out of the urine team posted this chart that i thought was pretty interesting where it compares and contrasts the revenue generated by the urine protocol versus some uh tradify some traditional finance correlates like betterment wealth threatened blackrock and interestingly it also compares it as a revenue per employee basis and so urine made 123 million dollars in revenue and compared to betterment which made 50 and wealthfront that made 30 million dollars in revenue but interestingly revenue per employee urine made 5.86 million dollars per employee and betterment just made .17 and wealthfront made 0.13 million dollars per employee ryan sean adams if he was here he would say exactly what i'm about to say right now but d5 protocols don't have much costs they are protocols they are autonomous software on ethereum once they work they work in ethereum and ethereum security is what actually is the thing that is costly to maintain and that is that's that's a whole separate consensus mechanism that's that's proof of work and proof of stake and ultrasound money and all that once that is taken care of defy apps are free to maintain and so all that's needed for things like urine or uniswap is just a little bit of continued development from a relatively small team which makes them some of the most efficient um capital generating entities that we have ever seen in this world i i wrote about a bit about this in in the delegate newsletter the other day where i basically said that it's just absolutely incredible the uh the flattening of costs here across d5 protocols with their um centralized counterparts i guess you could call them uh you know you went through the the table here i think it's funny because you can look at the the number here for year and 21 team members there's also the community as well i think the difference between these kind of like betterments wealthfronts or whatever and yearn is that yearn has a core team that does you know the core development but then they also have a massive community betterment and wealthfront don't have any organic communities from what i've seen or even blackrock right there they're just like their community is their company so to speak um whereas you can be a young community member or a you know wi-fi token holder and have absolutely nothing to do with the core development and on top of that there's a lot of other protocols out there that are essentially done and don't need uh stewarding or don't need kind of like i guess like continued building you know uni swap's a perfect example here where v2 is still going strong v3 is out there but v2 is very strong and there is no development on v2 because you can't you can't do anything on v2 because the contracts are immutable it's completely decentralized governance doesn't have any control over v2 um so essentially it's done it's zero employees and it's still making revenue uh for the protocol and the lps and things like that so i i think uh this is just going to be a massive kind of thing going forward where as i was saying before there's not enough sophisticated investors in this space yet to care about this stuff but going forward there will be and they'll be like you know how is this possible like this this protocol is doing um this you know price of show they have like such low costs um you know their growth prospects are insane why is this token only trading at x and x market cap and i i think that is going to be a massive shift here because at the end of the day yearn wants to be like similar to something like blackrock or betterment and wealthfront and they're already doing more revenue than betterment in wealthfront um with way less team members and and and and also with way higher growth prospects too so yeah i don't know i just feel like the market can't just stay really dumb forever no that i'm i'm with you 100 brother like so to some degree i'm on my bearish days i'll be confused i'd be like well some of these apps aren't actually throwing off cash some of these like governance tokens do people actually want governance tokens are they really what we say they are but at the end of the day when i put my bullish hat back on it's like all that all that people have to do is make the association right all that all that people have to do is believe that it makes sense to buy these things because they generate revenue for the protocol and maybe maybe they're not throwing off cash into your pocket maybe there's just a lot of traffic controlling of value by these governance tokens but all people have to do is believe that they are generating the numbers because a lot of these uh typical equities they don't pay dividends either and so to some degree it's very much a belief systems like do these tokens have control over the value that they say that they have and there's a lot of value that these defy apps are controlling and so at some point i do think there's just going to be like a herd mentalities like oh yeah these tokens are really valuable let's buy them all right on the same vein of protocols with cash flow and fees alpha femoral is one of the few protocols that actually does put cash in your pocket as a token holder so and uh alpha more v2 has already generated almost 700 thousand dollars in protocol fees in just about one month annualized total fees collected by all half of hamura products v1 v2 and on binance marching will be 13.85 million dollars if that was annualized over a year uh which puts alpha hemorrha you know decently up the the charts of revenue generating cash flowing assets in d5 yeah i mean i think this is really cool uh that alpha's already like kind of like that big and returning things to token holders but at the same time i have a little bit of a maybe a different view here where i actually believe that token holders shouldn't be getting anything at this point in the life cycle of these products it's too early all the money and all the revenue that's being generated should be reinvested back into growing the protocol uh that's a lot of money that can be reinvested into building and i i really i don't okay i don't really think that uh token holders should be getting like a dividend what and not even a year after alpha finance as a launch for example and you know you see this play out a lot in the traditional kind of finance system or the traditional any any kind of company system where dividends or or maybe a public a company won't even go public for a long time and they won't pay dividends for a uh for for a long time there as well so and they just reinvest i mean amazon does it still they reinvest all their profits into growing amazon and the amazon stock price hasn't suffered at all like it's you know um so i think i have a bit of a different uh opinion there but i i think it's still cool to be paying out to token holders but maybe it's just a bit too early to be doing so and i don't know about alpha finance specifically i know some protocols do both where they take uh money for their treasury and they take and they pay out some to stakers to act as like an insurance backstop which i think is cool if there's actually like a productivity being done here where staking tokens gives you access to like revenue of the system but it also means that your tokens are at risk if you're part of like some insurance pool or you have to act as like a backstop for the protocol whatever so i think that that that's a better model but just straight paying people for staking you know and and not giving and then not taking on any risk i think is too early and probably not the best model going forward let's actually camp on this point here because i want to parse this apart um i agree with you in the sense that there's certain laws about finance just are exist no matter what and you know young upstarting protocols shouldn't be paying out dividends because they need that cash flow for themselves at the same time i think it would be really important if like the dfi ecosystem planted a flag and be like no we are not a because there's a critique of the legacy financial markets that all of these non-dividend paying stocks are really just a greater fools analysis like or greater fools like valuation theories like oh i'm going to buy apple stock why am i buying apple stock it doesn't pay me any money but i'm going to buy it so i can sell it to somebody else at a higher price later which is greater fools like uh like argument for why you think that's uh apple does stock buybacks too i guess that's another thing it's like it's like the wi-fi model right where essentially you you would uh um buy it because you you know they're gonna buy it back and it doesn't matter if they're not gonna burn it or whatever um they're still buying it back which adds by pressure but i get what you're saying like there is definitely a faith-based or greater full element if you want to call it to a lot of these things but yeah sorry go on well so we have the option to pay dividends to token holders which is one option we can buy back and and and kind of make or dials the buy back and burn uh wi-fi is buy back and put it in the treasury wi-fi is and urine is also buying back eath and putting eth on the treasury and so these are three different ways to like add value to your protocol dividends um buybacks and then ethan and stablecoins put that on the treasury and i actually think buying uh dye or or uscc or ethan putting that on on the treasury and inside the protocol which is governed by token holders is actually a nice compromise because that allows the protocol to still tap into the revenue that they're generating but it allows for the governance tokens to govern over what is a growing mountain of cash and so that's a pretty direct way to add value to the token yeah yeah i think so definitely monthly average borrowing volume on ave has just gone up through the roof and so in june 2021 we are already past where we were in may uh eve despite the decreasing uh crypto asset prices borrowing volume continued to continue to skyrocket with ave uh it's probably going to breach 10 billion dollars in the next couple days which is absolutely crazy so tip of the house has not stopped growing since day one yeah yeah i mean i would be curious to see which assets people are borrowing here because obviously in when the market's bullies people borrow stable coins to go long on things but are people borrowing like eighth or bt or wrapped bitcoin or whatever to short it right now um you know i i i'd be very curious to see where this borrowing volume is coming from actually yeah uh shout out to whoever put this uh truck together uh token terminal maybe maybe you can answer that question uh and then the last section in the markets before we get to releases kathy wood bought the dip arc invest purchases 1 million gbt btc shares so those are the the uh the uh trusts out of grayscale uh not only is bitcoin in a dip but the grayscale btg btc has had a discount to it uh and so kathy wood wanted to take advantage of that discount by buying a bunch of gbtc so discounted bitcoin with a discounted uh asset wrapper around bitcoin so kathy woods thinks that this is a really good deal and then also the conversation of etfs comes up because as soon as grayscale has inc they've communicated their intentions to turn gptc into an etf as soon as they can and as soon as that happens uh the the discount on gptc just immediately gets eliminated and this thing will immediately trade on par with the assets under management and so if that happens anytime soon this will all be a good trade anthony any thoughts here yeah i mean the trade really is you're hoping that the discount goes away um and you know you bet you were able to buy kind of like uh bitcoin at a steep discount here and then and then obviously sell it later on but uh yeah i guess uh it's the risky play uh for sure and i've seen charts that a lot of these gbtc is see kind of things are unlocking over the next month where bitcoin basically becomes liquid and these kind of people can close the arb so maybe that's why she did it because she is betting on that um that kind of like spread being closed due to the unlocks uh so we'll see we'll see what happens there but the thing is is that if bitcoin goes below the discount that um gptc was at like if spot bitcoin goes below it then it becomes like a really bad trade so it's it's definitely risky but i mean kathy wood from arc obviously knows what she's doing so i'd be very curious to see how this plays out for her all right guys we are going to get into releases there's a lot of hot stuff that came out in the last week but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com all right guys we are back with releases first release is another deployment on to arbitrom future swap future swap v3 going to arbitrom uh anthony i know you like arbitrary got any opinions on future swap and arbitrage i think the most exciting thing about this is that future swap is not deploying to layer one they're only deploying to arbitram as layer two and i think this is actually going to be what happens going forward where teams aren't going to necessarily deploy to layer one because there will be no point because we're expecting users to just go to layer 2 and that'll be the kind of user layer so why would you even deploy to layer one unless you know you're you're like protocol that that can can take advantage of layer one in terms of like liquidity uh pools and things like that and just building liquidity there but i think generally a lot of projects are just going to go for the layer to approach uh now when when launching their maybe new versions or kind of like a new product i've seen like a few of them uh recently where they say we're launching natively on optimism or we're launching natively on this layer too because they really don't see the point to launching on layer one because they have to launch on layer two anyway and i've been speaking a lot about this on the refuel on on my daily kind of youtube videos that i do where i'm saying that it the reason why i don't believe in like a multi-chain future like a multi-chain future where like 20 30 40 different trends exist is because the overhead is is intense there for for adapt developers because developers don't want to have to maintain like 20 different instantiations of their app like it's too hard to do that uh you have to kind of like monitor the the different kind of like parameters on each chain you'd have to upgrade it on each chain whenever you do an upgrade or change anything governance would have to govern like 20 different kind of instantiations so i i believe that we're going to only have a handful of them so i think that that handful will obviously include ethereum layer twos and maybe there's some other chains that get get some kind of traction here but uh yeah going forward i i think more and more teams are just gonna natively uh launch on layer two or just like completely migrate to layer two i think synthetics is actually not gonna be on layer one once their layer two migration is complete uh they wanna get off layer one completely so that is the future of ethereum for sure i believe yeah and i think it's really a interesting sign of already some level of maturity on these l2s very early indications of this because people are just choosing to not even bother with the l1 anymore which kind of leaves the l1 to what it's really supposed to do which is really just traffic our assets and our value between other l2s um some interesting piece of ethereum trivia for you guys future swap was actually the first i believe the first governance token in their beta and so if you came and used future swap which is a perpetual exchange protocol uh they would actually give the their beta users their governance token and this was before comp liquidity mining was even introduced uh and this is actually what turned dan heller's elders attention into governance tokens and liquidity mining because they the future swap had so much success in their beta that they had to shut it down because they were too nervous because it was an unaudited contract and like i think 200 million dollars got needed into this unaudited contract because people wanted to farm the governance tokens before we even called it farming and governance tokens uh and so like sound familiar like unknotted contracts eating 200 million dollars fun little piece of ethereum trivia right there all right guys another deployment on an l2 is the graph is now working with optimism on their main mainnet launch to help scale ethereum the graph the way that i use uh the metaphor i use to help explain the graph it's like chain link but reversed so chain link wants to bring outside data to ethereum the graph wants to bring ethereum data to the outside and allows you to consume and output ethereum data and it looks like they are going to work with optimism to do the same thing for optimism anthony any thoughts here yeah every layer two and you know layer one chain needs this supporting infrastructure so there's actually like a core set that um that i consider to be supporting infrastructure and that is something like infuria and alchemy which are node infrastructure providers the graph which is middleware as you said it brings data inside ethereum to outside of ethereum people will use the graph without even knowing it because it sits in the background of pretty much every d flat front end that you use uh especially things like zapper they they use the graph from the background there um you know this chain link which for oracles there's uh you know there's block explorers like the scan like block explorer and if you if you if people have been paying attention arbitrary optimism are basically on neck and neck in terms of integrations right now and i believe polygon also has has all of this support and i think this is the reason why optimism was delayed back in march they didn't have any of this infrastructure in place which means that that developers couldn't even do anything on the layer two and that's why i believe that arbitram went a little bit a different kind of route here and said okay well we're gonna have a developer mainnet we're gonna get all this supporting infrastructure in place and live and then we're gonna launch to the public because there's no point launching to the public if you don't have this infrastructure because you want to give them the same experience that they have on layer one just with cheaper fees and you can't do that without this infrastructure so this is really really positive um but i expect obviously um all the layer twos to kind of have this supporting infrastructure before they launch in any kind of like big way to users right yeah so all the people that are interesting to get on layer twos and see when is it coming when is it coming when is it coming like yo guys developers gotta go first like they gotta actually build the stuff that we all want to use all right moving on into more raises uh risk harbor debuts on main net with a round of funding risk harbor looks like a competitor to nexus mutual for on chain smart contract protocol insurance so if your smart contract it has a bug or an exploit you could buy protection from harbor and so not only are they launching their application but they're also announcing their 3.25 million dollar seed round led by pantera capital and framework ventures um uh and additional support from coinbase ventures a digital currency group bain capital neiman capital uh anthony do you know anything about risk harbor these guys are new to me yeah they're new to me as well i hadn't heard about them until uh until this phrase i think they were in stealth so that's why but uh essentially yeah i mean this is just another kind of i guess insurance protocol out there uh like nexus mutual and uh insurance and i think like cover protocol there's a bunch of them out there right now but that's a strong list of investors that they have there and and i think that um you know the fact that they're already live on mainnet is really really cool uh i i'm you know you can get i think if you scroll down a bit it shows which apps they already support i think all the popular default apps uh yeah curve urine rv compound uni swap um you know and their apps ready ready to be used and it's really beautiful i like i like the interface and everything like that so yeah i mean we definitely need more insurance kind of like protocols uh than not but the the thing about insurance protocols and i was talking to a friend about this yesterday they need to be battle tested um you know before i trust one of these protocols um i i need to see that they are completely battle tested and i need to see that they uh i actually pay out on claims i like if they don't pay out the claims and they're not really much of a good insurance protocol so i think nexus mutual is still obviously the leader here but good to see more competition hitting the market um and i saw you highlighted that pomp invested in this and i saw this too and i was like what a what what a what a you know what what a laugh because i mean for those who don't know pomp has been like you know crapping all over ethereum-based d5 and now he's investing in it i mean it's like money talks right yeah absolutely and interestingly enough when he tweeted out that he was investing in risk harbor he used defy but did not use ethereum uh and so uh i i'd like to see pomp spin that narrative but also naval rovicon also on the list of investors naval that's pretty cool so really strong uh backing here so maybe d5s be about to become a lot less risky if you buy insurance maybe the insurance ecosystem is is you know getting it's definitely getting another player so maybe that part of the industry is going to build out a little bit uh yield protocol also got some money excited to announce the close of our series a uh series a funding led by paradigm and also to share some new details up to version two of yield so there has been some money being thrown around uh and paradigm this is not the first uh uh or paradigm has led a bunch of rounds in the last few weeks and so they are dishing out the cash anthony any thoughts here yeah i mean a 10 million dollar series a is pretty pretty positive i think uh the yield team has been around for a little while now doing kind of fixed rate things uh fixed rate borrowing i think they had something for for maker dow deployed as well uh but it's cool to see that their v2 is coming soon and yeah this is a good list of investors they have uh paradigm is the leader and then they have a like framework uh um people know variant and d5 alliance and a bunch of others there so yeah really really cool to see this last but definitely not least visa and paypal join blockchain capital in their new fund which is 300 million dollars i guess this week is just funds of deploying capital and raising more money week uh congratulations spencer bogart that's the guy pictured here and also blockchain capital for getting visa and paypal on board for blockchain capital and again 300 million dollars about to be deployed into this industry uh that that's a lot of money and this is like the third time we've been talking about this on this weekly roll up at some point i'm like yo guys can you like buy some eth can you like pump the east price a little bit like come on come on yeah yeah and i think that's a funny thing to think about it's just like you know a lot of these funds aren't going to be buying eth directly they're going to be investing in like private rounds and things like that but i think just generally more money coming into this ecosystem is good for the entire ecosystem i really don't think that uh you know it it'd be very hard to measure what affect uh the the fact that the money goes into you know if private rounds versus eighth has and like if that might have gone into eight would have actually done stuff because at the end of the day these these kind of like i guess private rounds like seed series a's are done on the apps that build on ethereum and those apps are what add a lot of value to ethereum so it should still flow to eth um generally but this goes back to like the fat protocol thesis and stuff like that so it's a much deeper discussion but still i think any money coming into this ecosystem is fine uh but i mean okay actually i should qualify that by saying that not just any money i think that the dumb retail money that comes in and buys dog coins is actually pretty poisonous for the short to medium term because it means a lot of money exits the ecosystem and it means a lot of people get wrecked so i i think money going into like just you know the builders like funding builders like actual builders is is the the right approach here totally yeah retail should i mean there needs to be legitimate things to invest in if we want retail to be smart and come into this industry and at some point we need vcs to like fund and like be intentional about where this money goes and so um that's what i see happening here uh for those that really want to follow along with the ave ecosystem ave grants dow ave grants on twitter announces ave news a recap of the latest updates and happenings in the ave ecosystem apparently ave is so big that it needs its own newsletter to keep up with what's going on in ave yeah yeah i was actually looking at this the other day i'm like wow uh this is incredible to put the newsletter together would have taken a few hours because there was so many uh kind of things in there but yeah the fact that just one app on ethereum yes it's probably the biggest app on ethereum right now but just the fact that this one has so much to report on each week is is incredible and i mean i love it and i love that this was launched by the arbeit grants dow like by the aveda and the other token holders and just coming together to to do this it's it's really really cool yeah um and this kind of feels a similar vibe to perhaps like an investor newsletter right you know hey like if you are an ave token holder you know who do you think reads the yave newsletter is probably ave token holders and so the ave newsletter is probably saying hey token holders here's what we're up to and so at some point it's just good investor relations to have a newsletter like this and can definitely replace some of the very slow quarterly reports that we would get from from tradfy uh not uh specifically crypto related but brave browser which uh has it's a very crypto forward and a browser used by crypto people because it kind of shares some of the ethos of crypto and also has a basic attention token to pay for payments um it's a great brave browser now has a search engine uh so now rivaling google and bing in the search engine game and i think the reason why i wanted to talk about this even though it's not really super crypto focused uh is that other than the fact that crypto people love brave browser is that all of the values in ethos is being baked into brave browser of the crypto industry and now the brave browser is venturing off into more competitive territories with a search engine and so i'm rooting for them like let's change the game with with the values and ethos of our industry let's change the game of some web 2 technologies anthony any opinions here i i think this is cool but it's also like a very uphill battle i mean there's duckduckgo that's been trying to go uh have a go at google for a while it's been growing and and everything but it's still dwarfed by google i mean google at this point is like a monopoly in the search engine kind of arena i don't know if any free market competition can actually take down google and you know i mean maybe in the very long term something could happen here uh but like taking any market share away from google i guess is like a positive but still they have such a stranglehold on on search and search is their their only product really i mean google has other products but search makes i think um more than 90 or even higher than that of their revenue so search really is their core product and they've been refining that for like 20 years and they have their own algorithms i mean i i'm not saying that people shouldn't compete but like i i i'm curious to see where this goes because there's already been other attempts like bing and stuff like that not even bing has put much of a dent in google and bing is supported by microsoft which obviously makes it the default search engine on all of their um windows operating systems and it's still not competing with google because google i mean it was a verb right like um it's like just google that right um or maybe i'm not using the word right there but like just just google that google it yeah yeah yeah just just just just google it right like it's not like just search it on the web it's just google it totally totally all right moving on coinbase enters the japanese market after completing registrations with a financial watchdog i didn't actually know coinbase wasn't in japan but now it is uh so cool coinbase released in japan anthony any thoughts here from all i know about japan is that their financial or system or generally like their investing kind of like system there is very quiet if you look at japan's stock index it only recently got back to its all-time high after like 30 or 40 years or something like that um and generally i don't think uh for some reason japan is just not very um uh very good with financial markets like their financial markets are very quiet not very speculative i don't know how much they do with crypto but yeah i mean there's a japanese community i i and we obviously um we went to um devcon in osaka uh and all that sort of stuff but yeah it's just uh it's fi i didn't know that it wasn't there yet so that just speaks to the fact they're very slow on their financial markets it seems yeah maybe to some degree that just stagnation in the japanese financial markets just made the financial industry really unexciting and allowed people to just like work in slow motion i guess the last release that we've got this week is coming out of bankless my favorite podcast introducing a new show me and my new co-host michael wong doing the top signal show which is going to be all about entertainment and comedy some gags some bits some jokes uh anthony you are actually going to be one of our very first guests along with a defy dad and kevin owaki coming to a show new you near you tuesday night so everyone mark it on your calendars this coming tuesday evening is when we will be live streaming uh top signal the very first episode uh we got some we got a cool agenda lined up for you anthony it's gonna be it's gonna be a fun time you ready for it yeah i'm really excited for this and yeah i mean as you said you have an agenda lineup but i haven't seen it yet uh but i think it's gonna be really fun you talked me about this for a little while that project that you guys are working on um and yeah i'm excited i'm excited for this it's uh i think you know it's funny because like a lot of the the stuff that like we all do like um you know the roll-ups the refuels the weekly recaps on ether and stuff there's not much comedy sprinkled in right it just focuses on like the news and the fundamental stuff it's like work i think it's work to listen to yeah really like it's it's part of that arena whereas like a lot of crypto really is memes and comedy and jokes and like all of crypto twitter is just one giant post so uh you know uh capturing that in kind of like a a kind of like podcast video form i think it's gonna be really fun i i hope it works out hopefully we are as funny as i think that we are uh we [Laughter] right getting into news eip1559 live on the robson test net uh and so one step closer to getting eip live on the ethereum main net not quite here yet but we've got some pretty interesting infrastructure already going live here's tim baco saying we have a block took a little bit longer than expected but london is live on robston and then we have this new watchtheburn.com website which is only pointing towards robson because it's only on testnet right now but i think this is going to be a website that we are going to revisit as a community quite often because we all are going to enjoy watching ether burn and so watchtheburn.com is going to be a website to watch ether get burned it's a little bit slow to load right now but i promise it works it does sometimes for me as well anthony any thoughts about eip1559 live on robson uh yeah i mean it's obviously super exciting to see that it's finally live on a public test net here um you know girly comes next in a week uh and then like another week after that will be rinkaby and then we'll get a main net date i think sooner rather than later um so yeah i mean yeah you can see here on the site like how much each has been burned but it's funny because i i saw that um there's like a lot of transaction spam happening right now in robston to test one five five nine so it's like you know trying to to break it because essentially this is what testnets are for we wanna see if we can break the mechanisms and you know that's why 88 000 each has been burned in like two days um you know specifically yeah robson eats exactly i should mention that it's not really so don't go get your hopes up guys it's not really but um one day one day yeah one day yes yeah exactly this is total fees so one day we're gonna have like total fees be like a million eight burn it's gonna be really cool to see that that um play out so yeah exciting developments here yeah not only is the test net testing out how much ease can we burn but the content producers are testing out how much eath burn can we talk about so we're in test mode mode left and right all right moving on uh this is a tweet out of fearless leader ryan sean adams goes seriously venmo nice job on the eth description revolutionizing the way we borrow lend and trade value with each other over the internet all without the need for banks uh yeah this is not something that you see often i think when you see like you know web 2 and trad phi companies try and explain ethereum they usually don't get it right but venmo got it right uh anthony have you seen this description before it's absolutely absolutely fantastic i i haven't seen it and that is a really really great way to put it i think um you know very simple as well like uh for for like i guess normies you can call them to understand right not doesn't use our like typical crypto defy jargon it just says you know this is what you can do with it this is the value and you know here you go the apps built on the ethereum blockchain aren't like your other apps some allow some of them allow you to lend and borrow and exchange crypto without going through a bank to interact with these apps you need to make transactions on the ethereum blockchain each transaction requires uh fees paid in eth and then it has a section as to what makes ethereum so interesting uh they really got this one right and and like i said uh this is not something that you usually people don't get things right about ethereum usually people just miss left and right but nice job nice job by crypto team over at venmo uh anthony i'm sure you heard about this one this was a little bit unfortunate but staking company sues fire blocks which is a custodian with a lawsuit over the private keys lost to after they lost 75 million dollars in each so there was a staking as a service company which was using this fire blocks as a custodian to custody their staked eth and fire blocks lost the private keys whoops uh and so that's a little bit unfortunate uh if any of the listeners had their eth inside of uh the staking as a service company uh i'm sorry that you lost your eighth hopefully the settlement works out for you for the rest of us uh ether just got a little bit more scarce yeah yeah this is like i mean there wasn't just this there was also uh so this was steakhound there was also shared steak uh recently that kind of uh lost some eath as well um but this just speaks to the fact that what we have all been trying to drum home with people is that if you can if you are able to if you have that 32 um minimum stake on your own like for for your own sake don't don't go through a third party provider like i mean not to say that all third-party providers are bad you know there's some of them that have like insurance and things like that like exchanges and and all that sort of stuff but um you know you're always giving up control over your private key uh by by staking with kind of one of these third party providers at this point in time i think post merge you'll be able to like do some kind of like delegation where you keep the private key and then you give your signing key to a third party but even then like this third party could sign uh something that goes against the protocol rules and get you slashed or whatever so at the end of the day like i always advocate for solo staking um if you have the 32e if you don't uh and you need to kind of like stick with the provider i would suggest to centralize things like rocketpool um i don't think rocketpool's live just yet but yeah yeah yeah i suggest that kind of stuff um but then if you if you have to go through like more of a centralized provider i suggest something like lido because at least they take your eighth and like distribute it among different staking providers and you also get like st8 which which is a representation of that eighth and you can do things with that in d5 um i i i typically stay clear of like just centralized exchanges like especially the binances of the world i would never ever stake through binance um uh but like coinbase i guess is the is the is is another option but again if you're able to stake on your own yeah there's a reason why the ethereum the ethereum 2.0 has taken such a long time to get out the door and that's because developers and the ethereum researchers worked really really hard to make it easy for us to stake at home so we should take advantage of the fact that they put all of that blood sweat and tears into making ethereum accessible and allowing you to provide security to ethereum from the comfort of your own home and this also speaks to the difficulty of just private key management but also the the steakhound's claim against fireblocks and why they're trying they're going after them and trying to sue them is that they just claim negligence uh a quote in the article says in a short in short a series of errors by firebox caused the loss of two of the keys that are part of a three of four signatures this is a multi-sig for the shards that form the withdrawal key fire blocks did not generate their private keys in a production environment and did not include the private keys required to decrypt their two key chairs in the up and lost both the keys uh kind of a big whoopsie all right let's go ahead and move on here to scooby druples if you guys watched the bankless weekly roll up last week we talked about the uh i don't even know what to call it a bug in the alchemics al ethevault that allowed people to deposit eth borrow al-eth from alcoholics and then also withdraw their collateral and and so people got to borrow free eth from the protocol and so they have asked people hey can you give it back and almost 50 percent of the eath has been returned and so crypto gucci says uh shout out to crypto gucci uh did you receive free eth ali's from the alchemics contract bug alcamix is air dropping alkix and the alcx token the the governance token for alchemics in the equivalent amount of eath or al eth that you received and they've generated this special page on their website uh to go and return that each and a decent amount of eath has actually been returned which is which is just overall like well good good for the protocol because we need to to clear that debt but also a very interesting indicator of the uh holisticness of the alcoholics community scooby troopers on twitter says i have a feeling people who return their al eth or eth to alcamix will be in several lists that goes to benefit them for a long time a crypto verifiable good person list because no one's forcing them to return this money they can just keep it if they wanted to but yet they are returning it because they are good people anthony any thoughts here yeah i mean it's really cool to see that basically what half of it has been returned so far just under half of it i think has been returned so far which is awesome and yeah i mean i think that this is like the best bug that could have happened it's not i mean it's not a huge bike and even if like not all the funds get returned there's other ways to kind of i guess uh recapitalize the system here so yeah really really cool to see this and i think you know if you were part of this and you got some bonus eats just return it i mean really at the end of the day we're all good stewards within ethereum we should definitely do this but i i i kind of get it like for some people if they receive like all this eid say they got like 50 bonus eight back that could be like life changing for them i i get it i really do get it but at the same time it's not yours technically right it is the protocols and you should definitely be could you do it here and return it if you if you're if you um kind of like suffered from this i guess and what scoopy is trying to say and i kind of agree with or at least i think people should consider that like if you if you have an account an ethereum address that got ether or l.e that shouldn't have and you return it that account is now verifiably a good person and i think a lot of um it's it's beneficial to have a good footprint in d5 right and so if you use uniswap if you uh if you've done a bunch of things you got a ton of airdrops from just being a defy participant and i think doing this and returning your ether stamps your ethereum address as somebody somebody is ethereum address that people want to just include as a reward because they want you to use their protocol because you are provably a good person this is just good surface area to have and so it might work out in the long term to actually return the ether because you want to show to the ethereum community that you did something that you didn't have to do and you're a good person yeah yeah exactly all right moving on to uh reddit is now selling three ethereum nfts reddit is already a very much an ethereum aligned platform but they are selling three nfts of its mascots new uh which uh i've always enjoyed the reddit alien i always kind of thought he was a a cute little character uh and now if you want to you can buy snoo the nft anthony you're gonna buy in these nfts uh probably no i don't think i'm gonna be able to afford these for starters i feel like they're going to get bit up a lot but yeah i mean reddit has been doing a lot of things in ethereum they did their scaling challenge a while ago they've done the moons and and things like community point system uh yeah it's just cool to see them doing like nfts uh now i think these are going to be very very valuable in the long run uh because of the fact that these will be the first nfts that reddit does um and i'm sure they'll do more going down the line so yeah cool to see them just jumping into that arena there yeah i've always been optimistic that reddit can really be a use case for ethereum just because they they have their their community reward points right like what happens if we can like we and the our eth trader community had their uh donut token experiment i think there's a lot of potential with tokenized communities and reddit to really become aligned and so like reddit might be one of the biggest and most then largest communities that are non-ethereum native that come onto ethereum and start using ethereum in order to just better their own community and so if that does happen that actually would indicate a lot of value in these nfts because the nft focus community on reddit would and the fact that reddit uses ethereum would bestow more even more value on the first nfts that reddit even made yep yep totally moving on to bitcoin stuff anthony's favorite section uh we got some crazy bitcoin news out of china this week where uh it has now been basically confirmed to be based off the exodus of cash flow that china is straight up mining are banning all bitcoin miners not banning bitcoin but mine banning bitcoin miners and so nick carter tweeted out uh or wrote an article actually that i thought was uh pretty pretty interesting where he goes go west bitcoin unpacking the great hash rate migration and he says that by now it should be clear that the hash rate migration out of china is real miners are leaving china for good as of april of 2020 an estimated 65 percent of bitcoin hash rate was domiciled in china and with confirmed bans across that uh across the country he says that figure will be far lower in the 12 months from now and he says the precise magnitude and schedule of the westward move is currently unknown there's a lot of conversations going around about how this is actually going to be really good for bitcoin uh tm this is good for bitcoin uh but a like i said btc the asset not banned in china and this actually does a decent amount of improving the decentralization of bitcoin's hash rate because so much of it was in china now it's going anywhere else and so maybe that makes u.s regulators more comfortable with bitcoin who knows and also china's generally been the dirtiest uh hash rate source for bitcoin and so any hash rate migration out of china is likely going into greener and greener pastures anthony any opinions about the btc hatch rate out of migration out of china yeah i mean this is probably the main reason why the crypto markets have been so weak i think is just like all of this coming out of china um it's definitely like it's funny because at first whenever you hear china doing something with bitcoin you don't believe it because it's like the boy who cried wolf right they always did this over the years but yeah i mean as nick says this is very very real our miners are leaving china in a very big way and that's going to cause short-term disruption at the end of the day and you know i mean it's funny because i have different opinions on on proof of work and bitcoin but i think that objectively speaking miners moving out of china is a good thing regardless of your views on proof of work and mining whatever china has always been kind of like that centralizing uh vector for bitcoin mining but at the same time it's as you said it's also been a wasteful kind of miner too so if it can move towards more greener kind of energy sources then uh that's that's good for i guess like the industry as a whole as well there's also conversations that china is doing this in order to prepare to really push their chinese central bank digital currency which is confusing to me because if you really were doing that why wouldn't you also ban bitcoin and to some degree i'm a little bit confused with china's strategy here because china as somebody that wants to disrupt the us dollar and the power of the u.s might actually be more interested in aligning with bitcoin than rejecting it and so now we are can be definitely just confirmed that china has no interest in putting bitcoin on the balance sheet otherwise it would have been subsidizing bitcoin miners not banning them uh and so the china bitcoin story is going to be a a long one it's going to unfold for for years and years to come so we will be following it out of the daily huddle micro sailor micro strategy now owns over a hundred thousand uh bitcoins with new purchase he is by far the largest single holder of bitcoin i'm pretty sure that's true uh and now over the hundred thousand dollar or a hundred thousand bitcoin mark uh anthony is is this crazy or what uh what's your take here i mean first of all i think tim draper or the winklevoss twins or eric voorhees may own more btc than he does here um i know tim draper owns a lot of btc um he bought them a while ago but yeah i mean this obviously sale is one of the largest single holders now uh and and and i mean it's i guess it's not just tim it's micro strategy that's that's kind of holding it it's him um but yeah yeah i mean technically yes but um i think it's funny because he bought these at like 37k or the 8k or something like that um a couple weeks ago and i think he's average buy price uh yeah it's it i think it's yeah the average buying price is 26 000. so if it goes below 26 000 he's under water on on all of it um and he's not very much above water right now but i think he's such a bitcoin ball like uh and you know bitcoin maximus whatever you want to call him that he's going to go down with the ship at the end of the day he's just going to keep buying as much as he can in any way that he can and he's not going to he's just going to buy whenever he doesn't care which seems to be the case here so he's not trying to buy the dips or whatever he's just trying to buy as much bitcoin as possible but i was seeing some chatter about this being like a pretty big negative that having one kind of like person especially someone who's pretty volatile like i don't know people have seen but sailor seems to be pretty volatile as a person having him own so much of the supply and having that as like an overhang where people say well this guy owns so much of it what's stopping him just dumping it whenever he wants to and like putting huge downward pressure on the price um so there's that concern i don't know if that's a huge concern like i feel like at this point seller has pretty much signaled that you know he's not going to sell this bitcoin at these prices maybe he sells it much much higher than where it is now um but he's definitely not selling around here so yeah i guess net positive i guess for the ecosystem in terms of like price movement uh but it'll probably play out over the longer term no yeah i i agree there it would be really nice if sailor had a an ally kind of going after trying to compete for these bitcoins rather than it just being him he really does seem to be trying to like brute force bitcoin price to go up he's like i'll do it myself damn it yeah pretty much yeah all right i'm gonna burn through this one real quick new york city will become a bitcoin center says the city mayoral lead candidate eric adams uh which actually surprised me when i read this headline i was ready to have that be andrew yang turns out andre yang isn't the city's memorial lead candidate i'm no i don't know i'm not in new york but either way it seems like new york is getting a bitcoin focused mayor so that's pretty cool uh a few more things um john mcafee found dead in his prison cell uh after he was about to be extradited to the united states for those that aren't familiar john mcafee was extremely active in crypto in 2017 he's been much less active this time around some nefarious activity i would say definitely some pump and dumps and there's been a conversation that he has been on the run trying to escape the irs for not paying taxes and so he kind of had this like very questionable last three years of his life and unfortunately he was found dead in a prison cell in catalan anthony uh what are your takes here yeah i would say it's a lot longer than three years that he's been a controversial kind of colorful figure he's uh he's been very eccentric um but uh yeah i mean essentially like the amount of conspiracy theories that we're going to be hearing about about his death here are going to go on for a very long time because he put out tweets saying you know if i die in prison um and don't i i didn't get uh i got ep steined essentially right like i didn't kill myself it was someone else ran this event in his tweets yeah yeah exactly so and people are gonna be like okay well did he kill himself or did he get killed like i don't know i just feel like people are gonna you know tell those stories for years to come but i mean a sad life to uh sorry i said a sad end to a bit of a sad life i think i mean he projected as if he was like very happy and things like that but it did seem like he had some mental problems um you know generally so yeah i guess like always sad but um you know i guess that that we probably we won't be hearing from him anymore in the crypto ecosystem yeah uh i i i he to me he's a mixed bag he's had some really good takes and really interesting like content and like one-liners that have come out it's like oh wow that's really profound and then he is like provably a part of like a paid pump and dump scheme at the same time yeah yeah very controversial yeah definitely all right anthony i'm gonna burn us through some of these so we can save some time here but goldman sachs begins trading on jpmorgan's repo blockchain network and if i'm not mistaken jp morgan's blockchain network is a fork of ethereum called quorum that is a private version of ethereum so not doing some overnight repo trading um and so not one step away from actually using something that looks and feels exactly like ethereum the federal reserve bank of boston announced its collaboration with mit to research digital currencies ryan and i we stopped reporting on the western world uh development into the world of digital currencies because it's just a conversations about people having conversations about digital currencies like oh yeah we're researching into it we're looking into it once again china is moving full steam ahead with its digital yuan actually putting that into production and the west is continuing to research nice job guys i guess uh jpmorgan survey says 49 of institutional investors agree cryptocurrency is rap poison as warren buffett said is a fad but the important thing is is actually more people said that crypto is here to stay than what is probably rat poison squared and so there is a flipping of sorts of people at bestowing legitimacy onto this industry so that is pretty cool south african brothers disappear along with 3.6 billion dollars in bitcoin from an exit scam on an exchange uh exchanges are a honeypot of assets this is why we defy if it's not your if it's not your private keys it's not your coins and this has always been in my mind one of the biggest weaknesses of bitcoin is because if you want to buy or sell it you've got to give it to an exchange and gives a custody of your bitcoin and that ultimately becomes a honeypot of of of interested exploits and attackers and so this is why we defy mlb is a new ftx partner ftx exchange they also bought the rights to put their name on the miami heat basketball uh arena in in miami uh and now they are the official cryptocurrency exchange partner of may the mlb anthony i know you don't know what the mlb is it's major league baseball i know i know what the mlb is you know this feels very dot-com error to me where like all these companies flush with cash they're just doing these random sponsorships but i guess yeah it is what it is yeah well sam bankman freed he's going to put the ftx name on every single arena that he can it sounds like all right guys we got some really interesting takes coming at you right after we talk for a moment about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible balancer is d5's most powerful

defy hacks since 2020 has notices the transition from ethereum to binance smart chains i'm going to blow that up here but you can see all of these yellow highlighted projects are ethereum and this is a chronological list of hacks and all of a sudden it goes from ethereum to basically only binance marching and so that's just interesting all the hacks and exploits are happening on finance marching it kind of just makes you feel that like binance is kind of just living in ethereum's wake right like ethereum had its defy summer and then binance had its defy winter and now all of the hacks on ethereum kind of got solved and now binance is still dealing with them anthony any opinions here yeah i mean i think it's just like a culture of uh people actually you know on ethereum building apps on ethereum uh you know they're taking more care with it but also the fact that when you so maybe i should say that like it's got to do with the lower fees i think like when you have like such low fees to deploy anything for users to kind of like um play in then you're going to get more scams i think this is actually going to happen on layer 2 if i'm being honest where these generalized layer 2s are going to have so much space available available for people we're going to get so many users on there and there's going to be a lot of rug pulls and scams i i think so and that's going to be interesting to see how the layer 2s deal with that because a lot of the layer 2s like arbitrary and optimism they're going to be centralized from the start because they're going to have like upgrade keys and admin keys are they going to interfere with this like are they going to actually kind of like uh return funds to users or like um kick people off the off the lair too i i think if they did that i'd be very disappointed to be honest because um that goes against like the spirit of what these systems are but it's gonna be interesting it's very interesting to see like where these rug pulls i guess migrate to over time yeah totally absolutely uh maybe we start to see new um new colors in there for the different ethereum version two uh uh layer two excuse me um this is a a take from greg depricio who used to work at the maker foundation and this was a conversation that we had about how dows are going to operate and he he says in my uh my more complex opinion after having some some conversations with me on twitter is that dao scale in a bell curve where the x-axis is the inverse of efficiency so as you go higher up you actually get a less efficient and he says that dows are great with only a few members and they are horrible at a size of a standard organization and also a new paradigm in big numbers and the he also says the caveat is that it's exponentially difficult to get over the hump so what greg is saying is that dows or online organizations are really really good with maybe just a handful of people maybe 5 to 15 to 20 people and as soon as you get to maybe 50 100 150 people efficiency actually gets really really terrible but then maybe when you get into maybe the 500s or thousands or tens of thousands maybe we actually get some of that efficiency back just because there's so many little worker bees anthony you have any opinions on this take i mean i completely agree with that but i would also say that this can can still apply to like traditional companies because if if anyone's ever worked in a big corporate company you'll know that the efficiency is like very very low in those companies uh as compared to a startup i think that's just the nature of uh just scaling people and scaling like the social kind of layer in general it's just very hard once you get past a certain point to keep everything cohesive and to keep everyone kind of like informed and managed correctly but i think yeah dow's definitely you could call it like a lean down a dow with like 20 or less members like core members that are all kind of like stewarding the protocol along um and they have they like take inputs in it's kind of like the core developers of ethereum right where they take inputs in from the community they consider things they kind of like use that kind of social consensus and things like that uh so yeah i mean i totally agree here that that dows with 150 members as being like core members is not going to scale very well and in that same vein the next take we got is coming out of mark baylin who says from an end user perspective it isn't how do i launch a dow it's how do i make money with my friends online as easily as possible endows are just the best solution i thought this was a really succinct and powerful statement anthony any thoughts here yeah i mean i think mark puts it really well yeah that's definitely the feeling that i've been getting it's like you know like you can basically get together with anyone around the world whether it be your friends or anyone else launch a dow and launch products within that down make money some way and and kind of like sustain yourself which i think is really really cool do you think that we need a rebrand for dalles from daos to do's i always thought that perhaps we should just call these things digital organizations because a decentralized autonomous organization really meant something completely differently and in my opinion it's actually just straight up the wrong label it's i mean uh good luck good luck changing uh this is like the layer two debate right this is this layer two is it's not a layer two people are gonna use the language that is easiest to use the path of least resistance so even if dao is technically incorrect people are going to use that so i i i don't think it's worth trying to fight that fair enough i remember trying to make op fi or open finance a thing yeah that took we tried to do that in the early days of deep fight as well we didn't succeed so yeah and that if we couldn't do it then like it's already it's probably already too late for dallas but yeah we you me eric connor we tried to meme op fi or open finance into existence and we just got absolute absolutely obliterated just took a big fat l on that one another take that we had that i thought was pretty interesting was from greg eisenberg and he says where the world is going i'd rather trust a blockchain over a government i'd rather trust a smart contract over a terms of service i'd rather trust a community over a company who we trust is changing fast i thought this was really profound any thoughts here i i think so too and i think the funny thing is is that we don't actually have to trust these things they're trustless and we trust them because they're trustless if if that makes sense where we trust a uh smart contract ever in terms of service because we can see a smart contract is programmed and is immutable on ethereum like if it's coded that way to be immutable like i can trust that unisop v2 is going to run as programmed because i know that those contracts are immutable um and you know i'd rather trust the community over a company well yeah i mean the community has different kind of like um allegiances and incentives for your friends to someone yeah exactly exactly as a yeah as opposed to someone working in a company so yeah i think the fact that we can trust these things because they are trustless is like a new paradigm maybe i shouldn't use that term so loudly no sorry market don't don't listen to me no i specifically try and use the phrase new paradigm as frequently as possible specifically to get over that hump it's like no i want to use that word i want to say paradigm here's something that i thought was pretty cool anthony right before i we started recording this i went to twitter and realized that you can actually search emojis in twitter and specifically with people and so here are all the people let me zoom out a little bit here are all of the people that have the bat and then the speaker emojis in their names on twitter the list just goes and goes and goes and i think it's over like 300 or 400 twitter accounts that have uh zoom isn't really capturing my scrolling but i am scrolling through these people here um and it i it could be it's literally a countless number uh and so there's a lot of people with twitter accounts that have the bat emoji and the speaker symbol in their name of course what does that mean ultra sound money it's kind of ethereum's first big like twitter like banner we've never really had a twitter banner before but it seems to be the bat and then speaker emojis anthony i'm pretty sure you have the baton speaker emoji on your twitter account right yeah yeah i mean it's it's a movement right like it's the ultrasound money movement and people are just signaling their kind of like i guess allegiance or bullishness to the movement so i it's really cool that you can do this i hadn't i mean i see people with with the emojis in their name and everything but i didn't know it was this many people and this is hilarious to me because this is exactly why there are some contrarians out there right now who are saying that oh the only reason people care about one five five nine is because of the fee burning um and i was wondering you know where are they getting this narrative from and it's i think it's because of this ultrasound money meme which i think i mean i think these people are wrong the contrarians are wrong but i i just didn't realize like how far this meme had gone it's it's it's everywhere which is really really cool i i wish zoom was capturing how much i'm scrolling right now a lot better so go to my tweet it's linked in the show notes go to my tweet and do it for yourself scroll down i haven't stopped i'm still going i'm still going like it's it it's endless it's an endless pit of people that have just the ultrasound money logos in their names on twitter and so if you have a twitter account and you haven't added ultrasound money to your twitter name like get with it guys like that's what we do you should do you should do you should do a search for how many bitcoiners have the lightning emoji in their name still oh god no i don't want to do this that used to be a big thing where a lot of them had it but then they removed it when lightning adoption kind of like didn't go anywhere all right guys we got the meme of the week coming up next but before we get there of course we got to talk about what we are excited about anthony what are you excited about so this might be a little bit kind of i don't know if it's off topic but like a little bit different uh where i'm actually really excited about different narratives within the crypto ecosystem being challenged and now what i mean by this is that let's take an example narrative out of the bitcoiner camp that said that they always said you know china would never mess with bitcoin because that would mean that they're giving more political power or more power to the us in in the bitcoin kind of arena so to speak but i think that narrative is being challenged right now because as you said they're not banning bitcoin but they are really getting rid of most of the bitcoin activity in their country by getting rid of miners so that narrative is being challenged in a really big way i believe there are other narratives out there that are getting challenged um and then i have been getting challenged over time like people saying oh eth can never accrue value or d5 is going to outperform eighth well no we've seen that eight is acquiring a lot of value d5 is not outperforming eighth and you know on top of that we have so many other just narratives over time that are have are being challenged at this point in time and i think you know the people saying oh the flipping can never happen well you know i i think it can like yes the eptc ratio has come down a lot but i think it's still higher than what it was like a lot higher than what it was at the lows um and i believe it's still going to go higher and and i think that there's narratives around oh you know um ethereum is never going to ship the ship the merge which i think is is going to is going to go away so you know just generally this thing of like people coming up with stories and narratives and perpetuating them and then just always being wrong and these narratives being challenged and the more they get challenged and the more that these people are wrong the more skeptical people are of the new narratives that these same people come up with so i'm just excited to see the ships there because i think narratives rule this space and i think ethereum has been the uh has taken the brunt of the really crappy narratives over the years and it's really kind of like suffered from that but i think going forward ethereum has very strong narratives to play off of and i think it's going to get like it's going to be even better and be viewed better by the community because of that yeah totally um the image that comes to mind is of the euthanasia roller coaster which we talked about for um for tokens that fork tokens that four can fork more tokens and fork more tokens but uh i think what's going on with what you're saying is that like well if you're on the wrong side of the narrative like each new flood narrative or or narrative uh against something that continues to be right each new narrative becomes less and less more powerful over time uh and and so at some point these narratives just straight up expire and i totally think you're right i do think that the death of anti-ethereum narratives comes at the merge uh which that will be one of the of all the great benefits that the merge will bring that will be one of them for sure is like just putting to death that like ethereum 2.0 is never going to ship yeah definitely a big one there um but yeah i mean what are you excited about david well okay so one of the things i was excited about it was that bat speaker emoji so i accidentally put that out of the wrong order and so we actually already talked about that was what i was so excited about is like there's an apparently an infinity number of people with the bat emoji in their in their twitter handle but i'm also excited about top signal and i know you're excited about it because you're going to be on the first show and so i'm i'm ready to to try and take my hand and make some new content that isn't uh all the content that bankless listeners are used to listening to and trying to delve into something new uh and so uh like i said earlier uh tuesday evening is gonna be the first show for top signal and so i'm i hope i hope we're funny i hope we're funny yeah that's the thing like humor is like pretty subjective right um and you know i i guess like doing it for the first time as well it might be a little bit uh a little bit funny but i i think i think it's going to be good i'm excited for it as well absolutely i i hope it's good anthony are you ready to uh see the meme of the week let's do it let's get into it all right this meme came from jim bianco who we actually just had on the bankless podcast on monday it was a fantastic podcast i guess this isn't really a meme it's just a comic but whatever uh and so we have a what is looking like a corporate looking individual talking to his corporate other little board members and he says instead of risking anything new let's play it safe by continuing our slow decline into obsolescence anthony what do you think about that joke i saw her and he was referencing kind of no cloners here so people who are like i guess anti-crypto and i think that this is really funny because this i i believe this um this comic probably talks about technology and how a lot of different companies fail to embrace new technology and get disrupted and you know 10 years down the line they're like what happened like why is our company worth nothing now it's like well because you failed to embrace new technology and i think the same thing plays out with crypto definitely yeah i'm reminded of uh the red queen metaphor from alice in wonderland where in order to stay in the same place you have to be running forwards and so if you are not changing you are actually falling behind anthony can't thank you enough for coming in and stepping in ryan's very big shoes with the bankless weekly rollup but
