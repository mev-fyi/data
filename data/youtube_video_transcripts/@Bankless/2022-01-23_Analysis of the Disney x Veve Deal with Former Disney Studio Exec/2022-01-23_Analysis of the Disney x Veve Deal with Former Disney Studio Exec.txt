hello everyone welcome to an overpriced jpegs first this is an overpriced jpegs mini episode that is not a part of our regularly scheduled programming but i wanted to answer the number one question that i received after my interview with john rogers came out last week so i asked john to hop back on zoom with me and do a quick 10 15 minute recording session to talk about the vv disney deal so uh i say all of this in part to say if the video quality is a little worse on this episode if the audio quality is a little worse on this episode that's because this was not something we were intending to do just now but i thought it was something that folks might appreciate and would enjoy and so i threw a little something together so again apologize apologies for the audio or video quality but you weren't gonna get anything at all so you know just be grateful that you're getting these answers in the first place and uh thank you of course as always for listening and to the amazing bankless team who makes this whole thing possible all right here's my little second part of a conversation with former disney exec john rogers [Music] i am back with john rogers our guest from last week who spoke with us at length about intellectual property and its intersection with the blockchain john for anybody who listened to that last episode will know he ran i.p management for disney for many years and really built out that department for them so spent his career or at least a good chunk of it looking at intellectual property how do you develop it how do you maintain it how do you grow it smart over time and now he works in blockchain so he's the perfect conduit for us to explore ip in the world of web 3. but at the aftermath in the aftermath of our interview uh last week and we got a very positive feedback on the conversation people loved hearing you john so i'm excited you're back but there was one question that we got over and over again which is why didn't we address the fact that disney is already into nfts via their nft collection on the platform vv i didn't bring it up because i don't know how to pronounce it so uh i just wanted to stay far away from that topic um i i you know jokes aside i don't know how to pronounce it i think it's vv though it looks like that's what they're encouraging people to say so we brought you back on to talk a little bit about that i know you have some strong feelings here and uh also to to talk to folks about sort of the broader context give some broader context into this disney vb deal so with that john i was hoping you could just kick us off with by sort of describing what what vd is for any folks who maybe don't know yep so vv is a digital collectibles marketplace similar to what you might think of like dapper labs or recurve which is just starting up or candy which is in the sports space it's a digital collectibles marketplace on the layer two of ethereum so they've built on top of immutable x and which is built on top of starkx which is a zk-based roll-up scaling solution what all you really need to know about it is it's a layer 2 marketplace on ethereum and what's important here is that vivi has pursued multiple licensing and promotional agreements with many of the kind of key studio licensors uh that are out there and so i didn't discuss obviously being a part of disney but there was a whole number there's a whole bunch of big ip that you recognize that have done deals yeah it looks like they started with comics really and so describe specifically what they're doing with disney they're doing two things the first is they're doing a licensing agreement with marvel on the comics book side and they're doing some licensing of the court we call the core characters think mickey mouse minnie mouse daffy duck and so on they've also done a promotional agreement with disney or what they called their golden moments collection which was a promotional program to support disney plus now the reason why i didn't get into this in our previous conversation is i felt it was a little bit out of scope for kind of the big idea of disney on the blockchain and it also opens up a big rabbit hole of going down what is promotions versus licensing versus publishing which could be its own show and now it's its own show now we have this mini to dive into it so yeah i think let's let's do that first i i know you're not inspired to say the least by by this deal explain to folks why and and the three kind of key terms here i think for folks to understand is publishing licensing and promotional let me say this and tell me if this is right john they're those are basically the three kinds of engagement with the blockchain that you can see brands and intellectual properties from the web 2 world having with web3 right they cannot they can enter into promotional agreements licensing agreements or publishing agreements and what disney has done with vv is the is the promotional and the licensing so talk about why you don't like this and what this what this means yeah so the promotional program the way to think of it is think of like mcdonald's happy meals when your child wants to get the latest um pixar happy meal toy you go to mcdonald's and you buy a happy meal and the way that works is it's a quid pro quo i'm gonna give you this for that so what disney is giving is the rights to make a toy a very cheap toy that's sold inside happy meals and what mcdonald's gets is a chance to use a very powerful intellectual property to market and bring consumers into the stores so it's six i was like mom please i have to go i have to get arielle she's you've got an ariel whatever happened and my daughter's six years old so she's right at peak happy meal happy meal age um so that's a little bit bitter about happy meals anyhow so but also what distinguishes them is that they tend to run for very short limited periods of time i don't like this deal that they've done with vv because it feels like they're very disney's very first step into blockchain the superlative of first is very valuable and important think back to the people option at christie's earlier last year part of that price of 65 million was built around the superlative the first nfts sold at christie's these were the very first nfts of mickey mouse and star wars characters sold on the blockchain and they're essentially happy meals someone at disney screwed up by making this deal they were pushing a schlocky and i'll be very honest it's a schlocky promotion that was meant to push disney plus subscriptions and no one ever thought about what was that superlative value of the first disney mickey mouse nft and in my opinion they left millions of dollars millions of dollars of value on the table and what i would say is for anyone who collected these golden moments nfts um hold them or huddle them i guess as the kids say nowadays hold them because disney's mistake is going to be a huge value gain for you in the long term that's not financial advice by the way but hold those because when the mainstream disney collectors start coming into the space they're going to be looking for those first mickey mouse nfts and they happen to have been these golden moments projects now is there a risk though so because of the way this deal was structured where vv doesn't obviously own mickey mouse they licensed the ability to use the mickey mouse likeness essentially right for an nft is that essentially what that was like the risk to the people who bought those is potentially that you know disney can come along and being the actual owner of mickey mouse like undercut or in some other way potentially devalue these licensed product nfts is that a risk i guess is more the question it would be a risk in that they could come out and license them so not promotional but license them to other partners long term so there could be a thousand different variations of mickey mouse as nfts and there will probably will be or disney could publish do their own releases of them now these golden moments will be the only statuettes that they've designed that look but still it's a it's a limited program that's one of the trademarks of a promotional program it's a very limited run program that in this case was meant to push disney plus subscriptions and how do you know this by the way if you look at the website which is still a public as of today you can go to the website and look down below to the terms and conditions go below the small print to the ultra small print and you'll find all the details that this was a promotional partnership in a promotional program not a kind of bigger long-term initiative but that still doesn't mean that the nft buyers didn't get value out of it they probably certainly did so we've covered off that what what really makes a promotional program what it is is that it's for a short defined period of time um it's a quid pro quo basically you're trying to get something from each other um it's very much a marketing driven initiative what a licensing program is is that it's more of a revenue driven initiative that goes in potentially for years it runs just perpetually and what you're doing is you're paying a fee for the intellectual property so in this case think that um a licensee is going to pay about 10 is kind of the internal number it's variable but 10 for discussion purposes so if you go to target you buy a 50 mickey and mouse watch five dollars of that's going to go to disney that's sort of how licensing works and these programs run from a long time this is the more common way for these marketplaces to do partnerships with the studios in the market nft marketplaces and the reason why is that it's a way to come in and get going it's a good way to scale quickly with some great intellectual property we're seeing this already autographed tom brady's company did a deal with lionsgate and their first product was saw the horror franchise nifty's has done a deal with warner brothers and they did the space jam movie and matrix currently so they're kind of on their way recur which is a new startup which i don't think has gotten going yet but it's about to and they did a deal with viacom so all the viacom uh multi-brand kind of properties like star trek and so on um so these marketplaces are doing licensing deals now it's a good way for the marketplaces to go studios long term is probably not the best place for them because it's not really first of all they're giving away a lot of value to the marketplaces it's low risk which is good for them but i see these as dipping the toe in the water kind of projects so what is your advice to big brands entering the space facing this set of choices promotional licensing publishing what do they need to do my advice my advice would be to think about the publishing side publishing is the real big opportunity that's the massive opportunity and what that be my publishing is this is disney launching their own nft marketplace launching their own collectibles program their own pfp program their own one of one unique pieces of art program rather than going through a thir a third party like say a dapper labs or a nifties or a promotional program like they did with golden moments that is the big picture opportunity and my worry is is that a lot of these studios are going to take the easy way out they're going to take the licensing is very much a kind of a low-risk business for studios it's like present give a license to a license or or a licensee and let them sell it you earn ten percent on it so it's very low risk but it's also low return the bigger opportunity long term for these studios is this publishing where it's big return but it's also bigger risk and so the millions of dollars that you see disney having left on the table does that come from the fact that the way this deal was vivi paid disney some amount of money to license it and that's all the money that disney will ever see off of that nft whereas vv has now published to your point the first iteration of mickey mouse on the blockchain and resales of that or if that goes to millions of dollars i'm not familiar with what vb's like platform resale royalty structure is but presumably the gains off of those mickey mouses forevermore will disney won't see a scent of that whereas if they'd published it themselves they would that would be ongoing for them i do believe disney's gonna i do believe disney gets revenue from the resales of these so i do believe they're gonna share that so it makes it a little bit unique but the challenge is that this the value if they had published the first mickey mouse nft themselves would have been far greater they would have recouped far greater revenue than just a couple thousand disney plus subscriptions now i get the position that disney was in which is at the beginning of the pandemic when this program was probably put in place that they were desperate to push disney plus as kind of a way to help keep the company going during the downtime of the pandemic so i understand their strategically difficult position they were in but i don't think they fully understood the value that they were giving away when they when they did that deal and just to be clear i don't know if we we spelled this out fully but folks who bought one of these disney licensed vv nfts golden moments got with it a disney subscription a disney plus subscription so that that's where that promotional piece comes in yeah one of the things actually i'd say the quid pro quo so promotional programs are very much a quid pro quo i give you this for that so what disney got was and um vv gave several thousand disney plus subscriptions out to anyone that bought it nft so disney got a sudden boost in nf in disney plus subscriptions and what vivi got was the right to make nfts with that core intellectual property so the upshot of this folks is we didn't mention it on the last podcast because we were we had disney's best interest in mind and we didn't want to blow up their spot on what a bad deal they signed no no i'm kidding um i just didn't think to ask about it and uh and john felt it was out of scope because we were talking about something that was so big picture and this in the scheme of things kind of minor promotional deal that disney signed with vv is is not something to really herald as you're having a conversation about the potential of intellectual property and web 3 and the blockchain because it's actually an example of what not to do according to john rogers who i trust far more than the person at disney who made the deal exactly um yeah so i so somehow the deal got made they did it um so the collectors did uh they could they come away they're going to come away with a great product and they're going to be very happy in a couple of years if they hold those products [Music] below [Music] [Applause] [Music]
