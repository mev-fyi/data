and but there's also some like really future thinking stuff uh so for example upgrading to post Quantum cryptography and even beyond that there's something that kind of only opened up in the last few weeks not only should we defend against quantum computers but we can harness them to make consensus even more robust welcome bankless Nation to the Sci-Fi roadmap to ethereum you know about eip4844 you know about proposer Builder separation but you probably didn't know that the ethereum roadmap does not stop at these things it continues each component of the ethereum roadmap has deeper Frontiers than what you may be familiar with 4844 PBS these are just the first stops on a longer track of ethereum's sci-fi roadmap in this episode we're going to explore these deeper Frontiers to ethereum with Justin Drake and Tim Baco the two individuals who can probably see the furthest along the ethereum frontier out of anyone we're going to learn about what is statelessness and how it's helping ethereum make the furthest reaches of the internet even more trustless how ethereum is going to absorb ZK Tech at the layer 1 level how VCS are subsidizing ethereum's layer 1 research and development efforts what is an enshrined rollup and how is it different from all the other Roll-Ups that we're familiar with and why does Justin Drake want it so bad how all of this stuff is leading to ethereum needing fewer and fewer honest actors to work trustlessly and what does Quantum Computing have to do with the ethereum roadmap and no it's not just that it breaks ecdsa signatures and what are trustless men pools who do they protect all of these things that I just mentioned are just the tips of the iceberg you're going to learn so much in this episode so much that you're going to need to put your gigabrain hat on or else your brain might explode but first a message from our friends and sponsors over at stator seder is a liquid staking service provider you know what these are but the unique thing about stator is that it only requires four ether for you to run a stator staking ether node so you deposit for ether 28 other people's ether come in to your node so they they can stake with you and then you charge them 15 so you get extra yield for staking ether because stator the stator protocol only requires four eth there's a link in the show notes if this has you peaked so you can get started staking with stator I hope you enjoyed this episode with Tim Baker and Justin Drake this is the Sci-Fi roadmap to ethereum and we're going to get to it as soon as we talk to some of these

ECC and this is one of the the very rare opportunities where I can get everyone here on a couch together we're going to talk about the future of ethereum to me ECC is even though it's in the middle of July it's in the middle of the year it still kind of feels like one revolution around the conference circuit at the very least it was the first conference post covid and this is the 30cc post covet uh so two years and ethereum has grown up a lot since then we've had proof of stake now actually shipped so that is in the rear view mirror layer twos are no longer a hypothetical they are here I remember last year ECC it was the year of the zke evm and this year seems to be the year of the zkevm mainnet uh a lot of a lot of things have actually come to pass but there's still a lot of things to look forward to and so I'm hoping this conversation can guide me and and the bankless listeners all the bankless nation what is the future of ethereum what is there left to do and so Justin maybe maybe I'll start with you at a highest level at the highest level how can you how would you place ethereum in time in its development roadmap maybe a percent completion or like left to be done how would you describe where ethereum is in what it wants to become right so I think the the initial vision of of italic of having you know this this base layer which is secure and and scalable so we have the proof of stake and and the sharding is actually coming coming to fruition but one of the things that's kind of surprised me as a researcher is that we we seem to discover something new every two or three years and so the design space expands but that's kind of exciting right because there's more potential um so on the one hand I want to say that where I don't know 75 80 of the weight there in terms of completion of the initial Vision but the vision has grown in scope and so maybe we're only 50 of the way there would you resonate with that Tim yeah and I think one thing to maybe add to this is um a lot of the new things that are coming tend to be related to like protocol adjacent uh phenomenon so like Mev is obviously a huge one layer twos is it or a huge one so like if you think strictly from like ethereum L1 as like a you know system um yeah I think we're getting there right there's some quality of life thing so for example account abstraction uh encrypted mempools um like these are things that we didn't necessarily realize that we needed at the very beginning um and but there's also some like really future thinking stuff uh so for example upgrading to post Quantum cryptography and even beyond that there's something that kind of only opened up in the last few weeks not only should we defend against quantum computers but we can harness them to make consensus even more robust I think hopefully in this conversation if I guide this conversation correctly we'll start with some of the short-term concrete stuff there are short-term things that are being worked on right now probably the bank location is pretty familiar with things like 4844 PBS the short-term things that are that are going to be included into the ethereum protocol you know short in in ethereum time frames a soon TM uh and then there's some like stuff that's also being worked on that you know our middle term stuff and then there's some very long-term stuff maybe I'll put Quantum Computing in there uh I don't know if Z King the entire ethereum is still a topic of conversation but I want to open up that box and so like short-term midterm long terms like and long term is like the Sci-Fi stuff um so I think that's how this conversation is going to go and maybe towards the end of this we'll just summarize everything and talk about in that fullness of time ethereum the version of ethereum that will eventually the trajectory strong will get there what does that look like uh but let's start with the short-term stuff like what would you say is the immediate priority that the devs are focused on the most in the short term pour it for four okay and I think beyond that so um the next upgrade is called Den there's 4844 it's the main feature that's part of it there's also a couple other things that we're adding um so on the execution layer one thing that's notable is uh deactivating self-destruct so this is something we've talked about doing for for years and it might be the first time we actually deactivate the feature on ethereum um trying to think I don't think there's another case where we've done it um I mean with the activated proof of work that was a big one but like something that like smart contracts and what not depend on um so basically preparing this entire upgrade um another cool thing that's uh being delivered with this upgrade is exposing uh the beacon State Route in the evm so this means that the execution layer will be able to make like proofs and commitments about what happens on the beacon chain um and it'll help things like make staking pools more trustless um so generally yeah this upgrade is what devs are working on right now and so this is 444 is is the big one of course and this is what we call dank sharding Pro is it this is proto-dink shortage yeah so the middle step between full dank sharding uh and we already have layer twos on ethereum they're totally operational but this is what I would put under the roll-up Centric roadmap for ethereum as in we are making ethereum the protocol is making Roll-Ups a first-class citizen can we unpack that Nuance a little bit what does it mean for Roll-Ups to be a first class Citizen and how does that change what ethereum is for with with proto-dink charting maybe I can start with pro league charting and you can talk about longer term like making Roll-Ups the first class citizen but yeah just to unpacked Deng sharding so when you make a transaction on Layer Two today um the layer two bundles your transaction then a bunch of other people's transactions and posts the data for that back on layer one um and this is why layer twos are kind of cheaper so computation on ethereum is expensive but storage is cheaper so layer twos basically say we're gonna do all the computation enough chain put the data the raw data from that computation back on ethereum L1 and if you know there's a fraud or if you want to reconstruct the state on a ZK roll up then you can take that raw data and like run through all the computation but only if you if you have to and this is kind of the trick that that makes layer twos keep a lot of the security assumption because the data is on ethereum um but also be cheaper because you're not running every transaction um so today when you make an L2 transaction something like 90 to 99 of the cost is actually posting that data back on ethereum L1 I'm and the reason why that cost is expensive is L1 stores that data forever um but that said layer twos don't actually need that data to be stored Forever on ethereum layer one because you know with optimistic rollups we have the seven day exit window so this means that you know after seven days no matter what the data is somebody could have like done something exited all their funds so what we're doing with parental dank sharding is we're adding can think of it as temporary data storage on ethereum layer one um so that this way because the data is only stored for a couple weeks um we can charge much less for it and this will reduce the cost of their two transactions because now um instead of paying for storage forever they're just paying for storage for a couple weeks and then Justin if you want to finish this conversation be like what does that mean for a theory in the protocol so we have layer twos that have cheap data very cheap data that uh that you know lowers the gas fees makes them faster uh but again the roll-up Centric roadmap of ethereum why are we prioritizing Layer Two so much and how does that what does that mean for the protocol right so I'd say that ethereum is prioritizing the friendliness to build rollups on ethereum because you know putting posting this data is is the main is the main bottleneck um but and I guess one of the consequences here is that we're going to be able to scale the number of users and if you're maybe from 10 million to 100 million or maybe even hundreds of millions um and one of the things that I expect in the short term is we're introducing this whole new resource which won't be like fully consumed at the very beginning and so we might see Dynamics similar to what Arjun did a few years ago where basically the the the fees was so low that they subsidized the fee so it's possible that for a period of time maybe six to 12 months we're going to be able to use roll apps completely for free and there's going to be this kind of this temporary subsidy almost that could act as a bootstrapping mechanism um I guess one of the things that I've been thinking of in in the long term is how can we really uh have ethereum native rollups and we we call those enshrined rollups and um what we're gonna do in the long term is actually get an enshrine roll up one instance by snockifying the evm so if you take the evm today as it is every validator has to verify every single transaction but once we've snogified it all the validators need to do is just verify this one snog per block and so it automatically becomes a roll up so the mainnet becomes a roll up ah okay what does that mean for the other Roll-Ups that also already exist [Music] um so what I expect will happen is that there will be kind of a nice complement complementarity because the the enshrined roll apps will have Best in Class security but on but on the other hand and one of the things that they enjoy is access to social consensus so if for whatever reason there's a bug in the evm then you know we're gonna go and fix it whereas if there's a bug in one of this one of the rollups I know arbitrim then kind of their problem and so the way that the the non-uh and shine Roll-Ups fix issues is with governance and so really we don't need this this governance token and so this in a way makes it more secure because governance not it's a way for flexibility but it's also an attack mechanism is this so if we're snarkifying the evm and we're getting similar properties to what you would get from a rollup you can bundle up many many transactions and have them uh have them go through much cheaper gas costs and much easier computation what does that comp is that competitive with the current layer 2 landscape so the the layer 2 landscape I don't think will compete with and try and roll ups for a few reasons one is on cost so you can do certain things um with you know application layer roll ups that you can't really do with an enshrine world one of the things for example is batching so if you are willing to settle let's say once every 10 minutes you can take these bigger batches of data and then you have more efficient compression think of it as when you're zipping a file you have better compression if you have more data to work with um another thing that you can do with the non-line Roll-Ups is you can be very opinionated in terms of where the cash flows go for example optimism they can decide to fund public goods but we you know with the entrival labs the only real public good that we can find is economic security and economic bandwidth um and then another thing that you can do with the application layer roll ups is that you can have whatever virtual machine you want um you don't have to stick with DVM and so there's going to be a lot of advantages there um and then maybe some other benefits could include services like pre-confirmations it's relatively difficult to do pre-confirmations with an enshrine rollup but that's something that the application of Roblox can do where is this on the theoretical idea to EIP on the roadmap Spectrum so um getting to one base Roll Up is actually only the beginning but it's it's like 90 of the work and the reason is that we have to do the really heavy engineering to have these snog proofs for every single block but then there's this really cool thing that we can do which is maybe only 10 of the work where we can expose as an opcode the verification of a snog proof for the VM and so that means that anyone can deploy an enshrined rollup add the application layer so it's it basically opens up the possibilities you have as many copies of the ethereum layer 1 evm as we want all with the exact same properties as the firm layer 1. when will that happen my guess is that we're talking five to ten years but okay so did we accidentally skip into the mid to long term road map of ethereum yes okay but I'll caveat is that the access the development of snarks has always surprised me in the positive way and so it could only be you know three four years okay essentially okay and so like I think what a little bit with what you're saying is in between the difference between and then shine and try and roll up and the roll-up landscape that we know today the optimism arbitrum you know ZK saying all these players it's actually different use cases differently they're you they're similar in engineering but will be expressed differently by how and why they will be used and so perhaps they're unlocking new use cases so not necessarily competitive more just like a new landscape they have way more flexibility right you can think of them as like well they are effectively smart contracts From ethereum's perspective right like so they can do anything even more than what a smart contract on L1 can do but they're not bounded by like the the capabilities of L1 and also the rate of change of L1 so it takes way more time you know to add a new OP code to ethereum L1 versus if say optimism wanted to add an opco that's not on L1 they can do it like much quicker than we can is it the idea of an enshrined roll-up like optimism arbitrum zika sing polygon everyone takes an opinion by default like everyone is an opinionated application of Technology maybe the enshrined roll-up is the least opinionated type of roll-up that we can get and because it's inherent ties to the ethereum layer one it also expresses itself differently right there's basically only one way of building and then try and roll up which is to take DVM as it is and just notify it end of story um you you know you you can't be opinionated like um like doing an airdrop for example um you also I'm also big disadvantages of the intran rollups is that they won't have the first move Advantage by a long shot you know by five to ten years and so you know a lot of the network effects might already be established so that the shrine rollers maybe won't add that much value when they do come okay and then again who is between the spectrum of theoretical idea to actually getting implemented into into ethereum like who is working on this how where is this in development how early are we on this on this particular subject right so ironically um it's to a very large extent the application layer roll ups they're doing the development because the whole snock uh you know Tech stack is is basically moving is it being subsidized almost like by VC money billions of it it's accelerating it and we'll just be able to to reap the fruits okay beautiful okay so waiting for is it specifically the ZK Roll-Ups that are doing this engineering or is it optimism and arbitrum too it's mostly the the zkrops okay so that technology we're going to be able to we're just we're just letting the ZK Roll-Ups build and deploy test the actual computation test the technology and then when it's time when it's ready to be like hey we can we can unbundle that technology apply it to the ethereum with the layer ones narcify the ZK the the evm does this make wait does this make the evma ZK evm is that what this is yeah exactly and one of the consequences is that you know the meme will be you don't need to be a validated on your Raspberry Pi you can be a validator on your smartwatch ah can you elaborate on that what does that mean right so one of the the you know the the big computational expenses of being a validator right now is you need to run a gaffe node and you need to verify every single transaction and whatnot and that's that's very expensive when you have a ZK VM just verify your snock takes a millisecond your Smartwatch can do that so it doesn't need my SmartWatch doesn't need that much computational power you won't need much computational power to be an ethereum validator can you talk maybe about today how um like the proving and verification time um works on L2 and why having high powered sequencers you know makes this more viable there than um eventually have like what do we need to go from like a couple high-powered sequencers on L2 producing and verifying these proofs to like every validator and every node and like client on L1 and be able to do it you know within 12 seconds ah right okay so like one of the the big difficulties right now is basically the the latency of producing the proof so what happens is that there's only settlement let's say every 10 minutes or every hour and the proving process is done on these huge like machines that are rented on AWS and the proving is not very decentralized and is very high latency what's going to happen is that we have this technology called um called folding and so we're going to be able to take this big computation break it down into small pieces and um kind of maybe potentially give these small tasks to different low powered provers and they can all collaborate trustlessly to make the proof and one of the reasons why we're going to be able to reduce the latency dramatically is because because we won't be working on these big uh chunks so we'll we may be able to prove like one transaction at a time and so the the ultimate latency will just be of one transaction but actually maybe it will only be the latency of one opcode so you break everything down into opcodes and then you kind of stream the op codes through so you're taking the computation and making it into bite-sized chunks that can fit for more into a stream yeah and this is this sounds a lot like the the Nova technology that you and I were talking about zuzalo is that what this is yes exactly okay there's a bankless episode for that it's on YouTube and then another aspect of this will be a hardware acceleration okay you wanna you wanna unpack that a little bit yeah okay so we we got it down to just proving One op code and that might take I don't know half a second but once you have Hardware acceleration it might only take five milliseconds why what does that unlock if we're cutting off basically half of a second how what does that unlock um or is it just cool yeah I mean one of the complications I guess uh is uh so one of the things that unlocks is is decentralization uh in the sense that we might go from uh you know just one prover which is distributed to a thousand redundant improvers and they potentially these proofers can be at home so you know you at home you'll have this little box which is the the size of a shoe box and you'll be able to single-handedly prove that ethereum uh transactions are all valid and produce a stock and if we have a thousand people doing that at home um and 99 999 of them go offline and you're the only one that's online if firm you can keep on running and so this is this property which is called strong liveness where you only need one single person to be online and honest for the for the ethereum to keep on running and um you know it's a bit like the the the the ceremony the trusted the the the setup yeah so we just need one person to be honest and you know at the minimum we want 100 people but you know we feel much more comfortable with a thousand people and we feel even more comfortable with our 100 000 people which is what we have right now um and I think having a thousand or maybe a few thousand people around the world just like we have thousands of people running ethereum nodes around the world um is going to be you know more than enough redundancy okay I'm going to do something as I'm going to do something a little ambitious which is connect the dots from everything we started to where we just finished and see how much I just retained I think I can do this so um here here's here we go so we have this roll up Centric roadmap of ethereum uh the optimistic Roll-Ups are are well on their way the ZK Roll-Ups are the kind of the newest Frontier ultimate the optimistic we're also kind of competing on governance the ZK Roll-Ups are the technology that we've been focusing on so far in this conversation as the ZK wolves have matured uh and again that we have 4844 which is going to like take off the brakes for a lot of these things which is how we entered this conversation the ZK Roll-Ups like ZK sync and polygon ZK Tech as well is contributing to the ZK technology that if the ethereum layer one will be able to extract the kernels of that technology uh and apply it to the layer one and we are going to take the evm which is how ethereum goes from block block to block with execution transactions and we're going to turn that into a ZK evm and with further adaptations in cryptography this Nova thing again there's another bankless episode for that what you combine that with the zkevm and you kind of like Shard computation and so the zke Evo going from the ethereum layer one evm to a ethereum layer 1zkevm makes process like proving blocks very very simple and easy for the individual and then we can take that a step further and we can take all of that proving and Char that out to many many thousands of of people and so more people can participate in the proving of ethereum and the significance of this is that what we are doing is we are requiring fewer and fewer honest actors to make the ethereum protocol work and actors also can be devices too and so the the which devices can actually participate in making ethereum function honestly that barrier becomes so low and so like right now there's a big there's always a conversations like how do how could ethereum be stopped and at this point in time too many devices have enough computational power to make ethereum so decentralized that the answer of like how do you stop ethereum is a similar question to like how do you stop water from flowing Downstream that was my summary of this how was that perfect nice okay uh okay so that was 4844 uh how what where did 4844 fit into that conversation because we started there but does that really uh pertain to the ZK evming of the layer one or is that more kind of adjacent Downstream of similar Technologies I think 4844 is kind of the initial motivation that got so many entrepreneurs and so much VC money to flow in to really push this technology development forward um but yeah there's we're going to reap the benefits as a community by having scaling in the short term like initially we were thinking of having you know these these enshrined roll ups you know so called phase two in the roadmap much earlier on and it would be done by ragtag teams of developers that are not very well funded there's not that many of them and we would have never made it so this was the correct strategic move to kind of open up kind of slightly more of a commercial space I guess um but you know we're gonna go back full circle and eventually we will have these like maximally incredibly neutral and try and roll ups uh that have the exact same security properties as a family one okay so with this conversation I was trying to go uh short middle long term with ethereum road map and it sounds like we did that specifically with roll up technology so we covered that vertical right so let's do that again with uh the next thing that I think is also in the short term roadmap which is PBS proposer Builder separation um so if you've been if you're a long time bank assistant you know what PBS is but maybe we can start from the beginning and what is in the short term for PBS and then how does it extend into the future right um so one of the things that I expect in in in in the short term is this concept of Mev rebates and uh optimal execution so right now when you make a transaction on ethereum it goes to this public mempool and basically you have like sharks eating at whatever flash is available around that transaction and it means that you don't have optimal execution so for example if you want to buy a token on uniswap you just don't get the optimal price you get you lose a few percent you get bitten along the way right and so there's this concept of an encrypted mempool which gives you a rebate so instead of publishing your transaction publicly you publish it to this encrypted mempool and the way that the rebate mechanism works is that you have so-called Searchers these shocks that actually turn from bad guys to good guys so they try and identify all the Flesh and then they'll tell you okay here's all the flash um you know and they'll basically pay you to put them to to to get the flash so you you they say hey here are your vulnerabilities here is where you are being an inefficient actor in your transaction here's where you're going to get arbitraged yes here's all your fleshy belly that you have exposed I will pay you money to eat your belly yeah I'll I'll give you back all your flesh except for a little bit definitely I'm taking a little bit so the struct turns into a piranha and you're like you have one little nibble and that's all you get right exactly and the reason why they only take a little bit is because it's a competitive market the Searchers are competing against each other to retire as much flesh as possible to the user piranhas are known to be cannibals all right I actually don't know if that's known but I think it's a good metaphor um so yeah that that's kind of in in the short term I mean in a way it's it's almost before PBS it's like user facing and it's gonna happen in the wallets one of the downsides today of this approach is that we don't really have the technology to make it trustless and so what's happening is we have 10 different companies that are each offering the centralized trusted encrypted mempool um and this who are these companies so there's flashbots there's block native there's blocks route there's you know many many others um and so this actually makes it difficult for the wallets so for example coinbase wallet uh and metamask like they don't know which one to connect to and so really the users are not reaping the benefits only the very Advanced users who know that they need to point their RPC endpoints to some other uh encrypted mempool get the benefits and really most users are unsophisticated they're not going to change the obviously endpoint and so what we need right now in the short term is a standardization effort in order to to get everyone on the same page and then there's also going to be a technology phase where we'll be able to have a trustless or at least a trust minimize encrypted mempool and the way that I see it is as a progression of Technology we have centralized uh encrypting mempools the next step is sgx trusted hardware and this is what flashbots is working on with suav the step after that is threshold encrypted mempools where you're trusting a committee of you know semi-trusted um and entities to kind of decrypt the transactions after they've been confirmed and then there's kind of the the end game which is delay encryption where you're not trusting anyone you're only using pure cryptography and physics and the way it works is that you encrypt your transaction and then Through Time um the the comp the the transaction automatic automatically decrypts itself after a few seconds and you can't accelerate the the the the the decryption um you know because of the laws of physics okay uh going back to the same question of where are we on this between theoretical cool sci-fi idea and EIP that gets put into ethereum where are we on this landscape right um I've I've so to like I think tomorrow after tomorrow there's going to be this this this event and this dinner around the standardization tomorrow is July 18th for the day of the day of recording so I think what's going what's going to happen is some of the big wallet operators are going to come together with the Searcher uh community and say okay here we need we need to come to standards because the users are not making use of that um and uh instead of an EIP is probably going to be an ERC okay there's going to be some sort of community standard that's outside of consensus um that's gonna that's gonna emerge yeah okay so how it remind me again how this fits into the PBS conversation um I guess it's it's related to to Mev it's it's before the builders actually it's actually at the the Searcher and user level uh but the the reason why I mentioned it is that it's it's the main thing that's coming in the short term okay uh to find short term for me um next within the next five months next 12 months okay yeah and but PBS is PBS coming inside of 12 months so we already have um a form of PBS called nav boost right um which is like off chain PBS off chain PBS yes um and PBS if you had asked me a few weeks ago I was very very scared because it was kind of this monster update very similar to the merge let's just keep growing and growing in in scope but actually in the last few days we realized that most of that can just go away and there's this kind of this core epbs that we can incrementally um upgrade over time so that would be kind of a medium term thing let's say two to three years where we deploy core BBS and then all the adjacent things like uh inclusion list for example okay are you a metamask user well

encryption and so I'll throw him in underhand he's like okay but I can talk about ZK snarking that or or I can talk about encrypting that so that's PBS in 4844 um I feel like we've covered those pretty pretty well well one one big thing around PBS is kind of the the end game which is Mev burn ah okay okay let's let's go there let's go there because Justin you had a talk yesterday about Mev burn and of course we had that fantastic Bank this episode uh yeah place place Us in history around me V burn like where where is that coming and when is that coming right so one of the dependencies of having to burn is in trying PBS and inclusion list is actually a requirement and the reason is that Mev burn is very opinionated it says that we will only include on ethereum the most valuable blocks and nothing else and so it the most valuable blocks as defined by the free market because the free market is the thing that comes to ethereum and says I will pay this much money for this block exactly so the free market determines what is the most valuable bug but that has a Downs well it has actually upsides with sensitive resistance but it also has a downside which is now that there's a very clear price that you can pay to actually censor transactions and if you just keep on paying this price which is very very high but nonetheless it's a possibility you can just keep on censoring this this transaction so if you're willing to pay let's say you know one if per block or 10 years per block you can just sensor transactions indefinitely and we're burning that ether we're burning that ether so for a very very high price of burning a lot of ether you are allowed to censor transactions exactly yes and but we don't like that and so we I know I know I know I know we like ether burn but we don't like censorship we'll take censorship right resistance over ether burn okay so there's some individuals out there some stakers for example vitalik who just doesn't run any V boost he says okay I'm just going to build like dumb blocks that are not optimal but at least we have sensitive resistance and so every once in a while um you know your vitalik will be building the block and then if if it so happens that the sensor transactions vitalik will include them but we don't want to be relying on altruism we want you know it to be incentive compatible and inclusionless makes it intensive compatible it's basically a way to get sensor transactions on chain to fourth time on chain without having to pay any pen any Financial penalty so you get both the optimal block that the market gives you and you get sensorship resistance and again where is this in the roadmap so I would say you know four or five years because you first we need Epps and then we also need inclusion list and then finally am if you burn Tim I just want to throw to you like thoughts and Reflections around like the holistic conversation that we've been having I mean I don't think I have anything to add on Mev burn and um and ZK zking a DVM and l2s I think the other big part um is the whole stateless bucket um yeah I don't know if you want to go there now but yeah so that's probably the other big um incentive incompatibility in ethereum now so um we have uh so just for background for the listeners the ethereum state is all the addresses all the contracts all the data and the contracts um and it's it's the size of ethereum right but just the current currency so it's your balance at this block not your balance you know a year ago um so everyone's balance everyone's nfts all the unit swap pools all that stuff um the working memory of ethereum yeah yeah basically you can think of it as like the ram of ethereum um and and the problem is that writing to the state is like a one-time cost uh you know you pay to do this but then like nodes need to literally sort this forever uh histories there's things you can do you can just literally not store it and just verify that you know at this point the history was correct and literally delete it um but the state you need to know because it's like I need to know that your balance in this account is like this many um ideally um we would like to bound this in a way so that as ethereum grows as there's more users um it doesn't become like unmanageable to keep everyone's balances and so the idea with stateless is to move to a world where the average node does not store the entire state only like high-powered Builders have to store them and when they produce a block they produce a proof of the state changes um that sort of only gives you you know the the changes that happen in this block and you can verify that like this is actually correct and you know no protocol rules were broken the challenge with getting there is um today we store all the ethereum data in a tree called the Merkel Patricia tree it sort of looks like a Christmas tree so it's like very like long and narrow and so making your proof you sort of have to go from the top all the way down and those are like big proofs to gossip over the network so what we'd like to do is move ethereum's tree from looking like a Christmas tree they're looking more like a bush which is like wide and short and then the proofs become just again from the top to the bottom like much smaller um and so this is probably one of the next big things we'll be working on um after uh this this then upgrade is transitioning the tree like the database structure of ethereum from one to the other so that we can eventually have the nodes not store all the state so to put this in terms of computational resources um right now you need a Raspberry Pi for the computation but you also need this pretty large hard drive you need about a terabyte or two and so statelessness is a way to remove the the the hard drive and you can think of it as being an intermediary step to full ZK VM it's kind of halfway through where you remove the Raspberry Pi itself and then now you just replace it with a with a smartwatch so the understanding some of the connections here I think these things start to weave together um but we started with talking about uh with the roll-up Centric roadmap and how that turned into the ZK evm on layer one and then try and Roll-Ups and that's with ZK technology which is cryptography uh then the next thing that we talked about is encrypted mentors right which is also cryptography and then now we're talking about stateless clients which is like pruning a lot of data with cryptography it seems to be like and Justin there's a line that that you said once upon a time that really stuck with me I think it's on your very first podcast episode that we did which is if you can't do something with cryptography do it with crypto economics but if you can do it with cryptography do it with cryptography exactly and it seems like these all of these three tracks of ethereum's roadmap seems to be very very heavily focused on cryptography exactly I mean in all three cases we're starting with kind of the the economic side of things and then we kind of incrementally upgrade with cryptography if you take the evm you know we just went through the economic way of I guess everyone needs to pay the cost of doing the verification and then we we remove that that kind of this this distrust assumption that you know an honest majority is all agreeing on the state and and um the same with the encrypted mempools we're starting with totally centralized encrypting mempools and then we make them trustless um yeah it that is that that is the theme um and one one of the amazing things I didn't even realize it was possible and so a few weeks ago um we can completely solve safety of blockchains with cryptography so there's two things that consensus traditionally solve is safety and liveness um and one of the aspects of safety is this thing where you can revert finality so right now today we have this notion of economic finality it's a very very strong notion which says that if you have two inconsistent finalized checkpoints meaning you had a checkpoint that was finalized and then it got kind of reverted and you got another Financial checkpoint one further the validators will get slashed so this is one third of all state eth will be burnt which is you know billions of dollars yeah something like you know 13 billion dollars um and so it probably won't happen but it turns out that with pure cryptography you can have perfect finality which is impossible with the laws of physics and cryptography and the the key unlock was quantum mechanics which was a big surprise to me because for the last five years you know we've been doing research on defending against quantum computers but now we can actually leverage their power their very unique properties to be constructive about it and the key primitive that I'm looking at right now is called One Shot signatures which was discovered in 2020 there was this amazing paper which kind of pretty much went unnoticed for three years um but it solves finality it gives us perfect finality another consequence is that we can reduce the threshold for finality from 66 percent to 51 it solves trustless delegation meaning that we can have protocols like Lido and Rocket pool that have no trust whatsoever in operators that don't need any any collateral and it you know it potentially also solves restaking um it it also gives us this notion of quantum money which is a way to do um the lightning Network without routing so one of the big complications the route the the lightning network is that you need to find this route of channels between the sender and the recipient and more often than not there's just going to not be enough liquidity in those channels whereas with Quantum money you can you just need one hop and you don't need um these these these channels with liquidity um and then kind of another kind of crazy application is um is proof of location where because you have these keys that are uncloneable you you can prove to the world that you're in a specific geographical location using uh latency and the speed of light um so the the way that one shot signatures so what they are is basically a way to have a private key which can only sign a single message and then it destroys itself how does it work sorry just and it must it is a Quantum Innovation this is quantum Computing that we're talking about yes it's a Quantum Innovation and there's two Key properties of of quantum mechanics that that we're leveraging here the first one is no cloning so the your your secret key is a unknown superposition of states and you can prove that it's uncleanable so you can't have two copies of it and then the second property of content mechanics is the destructivity of measurement once you measure the private key which you need to do the signing it collapses the states effectively destroying it meaning that you can't sign a second message so Quantum the word Quantum it starts to get like people will probably perceive that be like it's so far out there that it's so abstract but this is not a this is not a research and development problem anymore this is just like we just have to build it correct like we it's a known quantity no it's very much r d but we know it's possible right it's not like theoretical we have a possibility result and now you know confidence shoots up to actually do the r d okay right right right right okay that's that's what I mean it's like this is a sure thing we know that it works we know that it works this way now we just have to build it exactly we know it's possible in theory now we can just go ahead and and try and build in practice and you know in the very very long term maybe 30 40 years we can have One-Shot signatures at the layer one but the cool thing is that these things can provide a ton of value outside of consensus and we don't need you know many Quantum questions we just need one right because now we have this one entity that you know we can delegate to and we know for sure that they're not going to rug us and so they're kind of this trustless Quantum entity and so the just again a single shot signature like uh there's that old Call of Duty game one One in the Chamber you have one bullet in the chamber as soon as you fire it it's all you got like oh you throw it away yes and so they're like disposable addresses that only have one signature and I think what you're saying is that the assurances that you get from one single address only being able to sign one transaction once or one signature once provide like opens up a world of new use cases that provides a lot of trustlessness exactly now traditionally you could do these one shot signatures with trusted Hardware but that kind of sucks you want to do it with pure cryptography and for a very long time I didn't think it was possible but it is cool okay uh okay again on the theme of uh ethereum has a lot of cryptography in its roadmap um there's one thing I want to touch on that that I want to go back to talking about statelessness um when we have stateless ethereum how does that change how ethereum is expressed like from the end users like what does it meaningfully do to ethereum like what can we unlock with at I want to make sure I round out that conversation so the biggest uh I guess if you think of the end users the person sent in the transaction hopefully nothing okay so if you're using you know a wallet sending a transaction hopefully nothing changes and that's good in terms of just ux um if you're writing a node the idea is that the amount of disk space that you need doesn't grow to Infinity um and if you think of it like you know through the economics angle this is like the last broken thing on ethereum in a way where you pay once and then you get to like be on everyone's hard drive forever um so this allows kind of the economics to match this where like we can decide that only the block Builders need to keep the full State you can keep a copy so you know say that you have all these like balances and you know all these contracts that you're in you could have your own like local copy of just like David's stuff or just Justin stuff um but you don't impose that cost on everyone um and so that means that like yeah running your node you know that you're never going to need like a terabyte of Ram or a terabyte of like uh or an ever-growing amount of storage just to keep up with not even the chain history but what's on the network today I think a big theme of the ethereum roadmap has always been about sustainability like how do we make this thing sustainable and that's been about like hey let's go from proof of work to proof of State because proof of stake is more efficient it makes the system more sustainable and the whole state growth side of ethereum is this conversation like I remember throughout 2017 through 2020 we were all bullied by the bitcoiners because they said that we could never run ethereum node and that our state growth or the ethereum node would run to too many terabytes turns out that never happened but also we had the solution always in the back pocket which was statelessness and so what you're saying Tim is like when you make a transaction that is data that goes onto the ethereum blockchain that grows the size of the ethereum blockchain and I have to pay one gas fee and then every note across the the world has to download my data and store it forever and so that is not sustainable because it's one cost for one person once and then it's also a one cost for every node operator now until the end of time like it's just unbalanced exactly yeah and so this makes this more sustainable because of statelessness you can prune the blockchain and still have complete trustlessness and it's not even when you say the blockchain just to be clear it's not like the past history the past blogs it's like you David can prune everyone except yourself right but then if you get a block if I make a transaction in the block there's just a little proof attached that says hey Tim actually had you know the one East that he spends or the one you know nft that he sold right um yeah I love how this is all cryptography based one theme about cryptography that I think if listeners aren't familiar with we should 100 pull out is that it shifts power to the individual it fundamentally makes individuals have the same amount of capabilities as large-scale institutions and so while we're talking like wow it's cool that all of these themes that we're talking about on the ethereum robap is like here's what we can do with cryptography I bet if we ran back this conversation we could do it again through the lens of and this is how it benefits the individual this is how it protects the individual and elevates the individual to be a first-class citizen no matter what their resources are that's my intuition here right and one of the few things that doesn't use cryptography is the the monetary policy and the word sustainability here is just so important and kind of you mentioned Bitcoin is kind of ironic because that monetary policy is just not sustainable because it doesn't provide this guaranteed security and so the way that I see the the kind of game for the monetary policy of ethereum is kind of this this two phase components that are summarized as sustainability on the one hand we have minimal viable issuance which means that we have also perhaps maximally sustainable issuance um sure right because it's not unnecessarily dilutive and it gives us the security that we need and then on the other hand we kind of have the maximum viable burn so whatever economic value that is being provided on on ethereum we get to capture it um as a community and it started with eip1559 where we basically the network is able to capture congestion fees the next step is Mev burn where we can capture the value from contention basically transactions contending to be at the very top of the block and then the final the final thing is restaking yield which will it turns out we can also burn and so in a way the the minimum viable issuance we've reached the end game with with the proof of stake and the merge but the burn we actually only in you know one of three phases okay so the the the economics of ethereum is going to stay the same as a meme like we've gotten there like we were at the mentally sustainable issuance um but maximally maximally sustainable issuance or yeah but we get to improve upon it across many more vectors to make it even better right exactly specifically on the the value capture part of Justin Tim this has been a great exploration into this sci-fi future of ethereum so thank you for helping me navigate I think I learned a ton and I'm sure the bankless nation has as well actually yeah thanks Mercy uh merci uh if there's any information or or people like where should people point to if they want to learn more Twitter uh it depends how much you want to earn so if you just want some updates uh Twitter's probably a good place if you actually want to work on this the ethereum r d Discord is a great place eth research is as well um just show up there in one of the threads and then yeah you'll get to work with Justin yeah you can reach me on Twitter I have open DMS and more often than not I'll reply to questions um but there's a bold commitment one thing that I I I do enjoy as well is just random people telling me Oh hey I've heard about this One-Shot signatures and actually I just had you know lunch with someone who came came to me and so if you are interested in this cool technology do do reach me out all right we will put all their Twitters in the show now spanklist Nation you guys know the deal crypto is risky ethereum is risky defies risky probably cryptography might be the less risky thing that we do but also perhaps not I don't know you can lose what you put in we are headed west as the frontier and it's not for everyone but we're glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you
