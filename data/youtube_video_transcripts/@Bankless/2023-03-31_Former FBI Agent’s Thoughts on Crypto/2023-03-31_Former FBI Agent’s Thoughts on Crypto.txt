when I look at the world of crypto I see good stuff I'm optimistic about crypto when you look at crypto like what do you see all the bad sides unfortunately do you really yeah because the world I live in we started a cyber security company called naxo and we do a lot of like crypto recovery we are being contacted 10 15 times a day of people being defrauded out of their crypto I like crypto I'm a technologist I I like things moving forward but I'm faced with victims every single day and it makes me sad because you know cyber criminals are opportunistic they're gonna find the cracks they're just like water they're going to seek into the lowest tracks and they're going to exploit it for themselves
