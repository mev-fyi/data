what do you think 2022 is going to bring for us is this going to be a big year for the ownership economy it is going to be another banner year for the creator economy i mean i think every year that is the case because the creator economy is just on a terror and in general i think the backdrop of this is that there's a generational shift in how people are thinking about work and how they want to earn income and more people are gravitating towards being able to be autonomous and independent and doing the things that they want to do more flexibly and that's driving huge adoption of the creator economy across the board and so i don't think we're gonna see any slowdown in that because that is an underlying human motivation that is prevalent all around the world
