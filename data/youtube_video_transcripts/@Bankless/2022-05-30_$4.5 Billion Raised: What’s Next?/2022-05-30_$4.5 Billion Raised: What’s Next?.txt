a16z just raised its fourth fund this may be the largest crypto fund that at least i've ever seen maybe the you know biggest yet 4.5 billion dollars what are you gonna do with that money and what are you looking for we're gonna do what we always do which is venture investing mostly early stage so we've earmarked a billion and a half or seed stage and then three billion for venture in history there was always kind of this one magical period of a couple years when a whole bunch of really great stuff happened mobile that was so snap instagram uber venmo all started between 2009 and 11. that 2009-11 window was sort of this golden period where there's huge influx of entrepreneurs and people had kind of figured out some of the cool things you could do with mobile apps and you had the funding and you had all these kind of ingredients come together and i think my belief we'll see if i'm right i believe we are in that period now with web3 and this is going to be a magical next couple of years and so because of that we decided to go big raise our biggest fund hire a bunch of people and just go all in
