what do you think of approaches like like rari is that interesting for ave or is that kind of counter to uh to the premise of what the ave protocol is trying to do no i think it's it's quite fascinating what they're doing and i i really appreciate it because essentially governance minimization is an important topic and it's something where many protocols can actually function without governance for example protocol like uni swap could function without governance but you know the governance can actually manage the treasury and there's a bunch of things that actually get all the all those community members together so it makes sense there as well in terms of the permissions listing for example you could basically create logic based on permissionless listing but for example you could find it with let's say token economics uh different kinds of staking my kind of like a challenge with the the permissionless listing is that how do we ensure that kind of like a uh right people are using that but that's also kind of like a ux uh question
