[Music] all right hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is truly an extra special one i am here live at vcon with the one and only buddha katan uh so excited to be here and we are going to dive right in because huda is generous enough to be giving me her time during this very busy day she's speaking later today with eva longoria for those who don't know which many of you probably do huda is the founder of a multi-billion dollar beauty brand huda beauty she was named one of the top 10 most influential people in beauty by forbes she's been named one of the most 25 most influential people on the internet according to time um and she's now super into nfts and bringing her audience along with it right thank you so much so thank you i want to start somewhere really specific when it comes to women and nfts which is sort of this broader conversation around women in any space where it's like an early adopter space right i think it's so interesting looking at your career you started vlogging early you've obviously dominated the social media game well why do you think i i assume you think of yourself as an early adopter you certainly have been yeah what do you think has drawn you towards being an early adopter like where did that come from i mean i think a lot of times as women um we are afraid to fail you know especially in spaces where we may not feel like it's our place um and sometimes we're even told that we're going to fail you know and i think that there's a little bit of an element of that fear that sometimes holds us back and we have to kind of get rid of that you know um when i first started playing in the nft space i did get into it because my husband you know if he hadn't pushed me i do think there were certain elements in my life at that period of time that pushed me but i think i still wouldn't have had the confidence you know and so i think women out there we need to start pushing each other um i actually had the opportunity to sit with somebody um who was in the investment world she was another woman very prominent in the best world and she said something to me about her beauty she was like oh it'd be great if you started if you open stocks you know you ipo'd and you know you could get all the women to tell their husbands to buy the stocks and i think that pissed me off so bad that was in november last year that i was like excuse me so we as women are expected to now do everything work do all those things but not to manage our own finances yeah so it's like you know and i think there's always that element of like you know as women we're expected to go so far but then to stay in our lane you know even when i started my brand it was like okay you do all the the you know the cute hobby stuff the fun stuff and then you hand the business work over to you know this man and he will take care of it for you and there was an element of that that was very real but then there's also like you know who who is telling us that and then why are we believing that you know and so having to push through that ceiling that you know breaking through that is really important for us we have to do that a couple things i want to touch on there you said your husband got into nfts and i think i read your sister had pushed you to get up to start a blog absolutely i think there is this like tendency for women to feel like we need to be invited into into spaces to take part in them is that that i mean that was i was a woman looking out for a woman though that's right you know do what you're doing absolutely when my when my sister first pushed me she was like we need to start lashes and i remember saying i'm not a business person i am a beauty person like that's like i'm just going to start blogging i'm going to be like you know like in my blog that's where i'm going to be my sister told me to start my blog also told me to start the lashes so it was like two years later she was pushing me to something new and i was like no no i'm not a business person like that's that's so complicated and it's so funny because i didn't realize how much of a natural nat i had on business it's actually crazy you know so clearly we are telling ourselves stories that are just total  do you know what i mean so whatever it is like we're telling ourselves stories that are total utter  when did the shift happen for you where you start to be like oh no i am a businesswoman and holy i'm good you know what's so funny is when i started i'm sorry when i when i started sitting with um with a lot of you know professional people and i knew things that you know they didn't know sometimes like it's like i think if we are plugged into our communities they have all the answers to everything and sometimes if you are a part of that community you also know better than anybody like you don't need to do consumer research and you know social listening you should but you if you are part of that community you are the community you know it you know what i mean it's like it's not any like it's like okay i genuinely want this so i know my community's gonna want it and i think there's an element of being that that we need to like you know um you know feel i feel like we always have this limitation like you can only be one side of this per like this you know person with who you are but we're not we're complicated we're multifaceted so why am i only one version of this person why can't i be all of who i am which may be you know a badass who loves to spend time wearing makeup but also a boss like why can't i do both of those things you know so maybe sometimes a nice person yeah you mentioned the confidence piece and i'm wondering how if the beauty piece dovetails for this with you like i think uh more confident people are more likely to be an early adopter somewhere right because it's a risk inherently and if you're confident you can take those risks right and as women you know i think we're we're trained to have a lot of our confidence come from our sense of beauty absolutely explicitly do you think about that with your brand and beauty as a as in service of confidence for women like i know that's something you you talk a lot about yeah so i would love to hear you express some of that i talk about that because i didn't realize that i was so you know like reliant on the mask that we put on you know sometimes we put this this makeup on and we think it becomes like who we are we don't realize you know who we are outside of that and um i had some i've been lucky enough to like where the brand has become kind of a catalyst for me to go through myself journey my own like self-development and when i started to discover i mean i don't want to go too far into like some things around the brand but we had a moment where i had to do a photo shoot and i was like i was like i'm going to do this photo shoot we were launching skincare i was like i want to do without makeup i want to do without the photoshop you know i really want to expose who i am like if the products work that's what i want to do and i remember feeling so exposed at that moment so insecure because you're right so some of your confidence a lot of your confidence as a woman comes from the way you look and it was it was such a a pinnacle moment for me because i had to like look at who i was who that person was in the photo and i'd say wait a second you mean to tell me all the work this woman has done she doesn't deserve to feel loved you're willing like what are you telling me right now you know and that moment really turned things around and i realized that yes the makeup you know it is a part of who i am it's an element of like me putting on a version of who i can be but it's always the same person yeah you know i mean and i think we sometimes underestimate that we it's like we need the lipstick we need the foundation we need that for confidence but you know like the value comes from you the person putting it on not the makeup itself you know what i mean yeah also in the context of this again early adopter conversation and then i'll move on from there is because i don't think men necessarily understand this or in general don't understand yeah the amount of bandwidth that gets consumed for women right thinking about how we look oh my god being able to adopt yourself so much work like it's so much work and mental energy to be an early adopter to be on discord to understand nfts and then we're simultaneously being like hundreds but i look thin enough do i look curvy enough does my face look like okay is my outfit okay absolutely and i think that's like part of the opportunity it's like we're already doing so much else in our damn brains it's like the exhaustion that goes into all of these things and it's like and then you're going to space you know the urge of early adoption my guys go into it knowing that they're going to fail and they're gonna have to figure it out women go into it thinking that like i cannot fail if i do i shouldn't have been here in the first place so it's like we do need we do have a mindset shift that we need to have because we waste so much energy on the makeup on the beauty all those things which we should start to use like in a different way like so actually i started this thing so during covid i stopped loving makeup you know i stopped loving makeup the world was going to i couldn't i couldn't be in love with makeup i was like i'm really feeling the world right now i'm feeling the pain my team was like you got to talk about these products i was like i'm not talking about it it hurt our business but i refuse to talk about it i just couldn't i'm going to bring myself to but during i also stopped loving like i was like wait a second so i stopped loving makeup but i also feel like i lost the element of who i was so i started to fall in love with makeup all over again you know i was like i'm not putting makeup on for the gram anymore i'm doing it for me and i started listening to audiobooks at the same time i call it my grow and glow moment in the morning it's the best thing ever i start off with podcasting audiobooks every morning yeah i love your makeup on at the same time it's your you time you feel amazing and you're nourishing your brain and you feel good so it's a way to multitask i feel like as when we have to multitask yeah so it like you know it takes you so much further so and then as you enrich the more you learn the more you feel okay about taking the risks and you know being early adopting you know

can get into web3 starts in that all of this is also about identity which is so central to like it totally makes sense to me that you're into this for a whole bunch of reasons community stuff maybe talk about a little bit but like you know somebody who's been at the forefront and like deeply immersed in really identity right like how we present ourselves to the world both in makeup also on social media personal brand identity yeah like what are some of the lessons you feel like you've learned there or insights you've gained there that can help inform nfts metaverse digital identity thoughts on that oh my god so many thoughts um and i remember when uh you know i think people still as we all know right as as people with an nft space like we understand the value of an nft and what it does for our identity but people still don't really necessarily understand that you know and i think that it's it's so complex like our identities themselves are so complex and you know it's really hard to put it into a jpeg it really is hard yeah but you know it's not for me like one thing or one project i get really involved like i love to see i love to learn about the founders and i feel like when there's a founder that can get behind i think that kind of adds to the project as well um you know i want to be into the mission i want to be into the purpose i want to feel like i'm a part of that project so you know i know there's like there's a concept of like the jpeg itself the image itself you know is kind of a visual identity or a visual representation of who you are there's also like you know a lot of people like the the fancy projects like i like themselves you like it yeah you've got a board yeah you know um but i also love you collabs like i think they're to me like they're the apple of of the nft space i really think they are you know like they're just like when we when we at hood of beauty eventually do launch at nft which we're planning on saying that it loud oh my god that's a big moment when we do do one i i think v friends has like i think gary and yugo labs are like they have they have been trailblazers for like between the utility space between the way they do air drops like just so many amazing things that i feel like you know i want to look to them when we do one and create something that provides value provides utility provides the identity you know so you get that whole trifecta of like value to the to the person who's holding it well obviously you know i'll try and push you a probe a little bit more on that but you know you've done community so well i think it's interesting to hear you say like you know oh my team was mad i wouldn't talk about makeup it was hurting our business but i think i would be curious if you think that in the long term actually that's why you have a loyal community because they trust your authenticity yeah absolutely absolutely and and sort of so how did that early community start you talked about you started with with fake lashes yeah what was like the origin of the community you've developed and built this relationship with it's funny because the origin is kind of the same as it still is today you know like when we started in 2010 it was all about like kind of exposing the truth behind photo shoots like i found it so fascinating to see these like models pinned up and everything behind them was like clipped and they were like they weren't so perfect it was like the front was like a facade in the behind with something else and so as i got into it as i was a makeup artist that's what i wanted to talk about so that everybody could know that they could do what they wanted like whatever it was they they were able to have it nothing to me within beauty was inaccessible it was told to me or to whoever that you were like either a part of this or get to buy something to be a part of it so i really wanted to break down that stereotype and as we developed as a brand as i started to go through my self-love journey my you know my development journey it was even more important to me that we broke down those stereotypes so yeah i do talk a lot about that same stuff that i was before but now it gets really deep yeah it gets really deep what i hear you saying though there that's interesting to me is that i think you're a bit of a contrarian you know it's 100 me that this is what you should see yeah so i'm gonna show you the thing over here i'm a rebel but that and but that's the early adopter thing too and yeah something to talk to like about women for women who i think are trained more like you know think this way do this thing like to kind of almost practice being a contrarian absolutely everyone's saying xyz let me intentionally think right or whatever i think it's up to each person like if you want to be in the space early you're gonna have to push yourself yeah you know if you don't want to be in a space and you want you don't want to take risks which you know everybody's their own thing like you know nobody has to do what you what you know we're telling them to do everybody has to do what they're comfortable with they can be a contrarian exactly but you know you need to be able to push yourself a little bit the reality is none of t space you're going to win some you're going to lose some you just have to be comfortable with that like we've invested in some projects made a ton we've invested in some lost everything you know people only talk about the ones they make a lot of money on um you know my husband we don't really talk about them at all we just like you know we have our wallet you know but um but i think you got to be a little comfortable with taking risks and losing you we cannot be uncomfortable with failure like we really have to get comfortable failure and it's a bear market now so you have a lot of people are there are there projects you're looking at now in the bear market or just projects you're loving in general you obviously mentioned garyvee yeah i just met the doodle one of the doodle founders i my husband are doodlers oh yeah we're doodlers so i was gonna mention doodles i think it's interesting as we talk about digital identity because right now it is kind of stagnant right like it's this one picture but i think doodle is pushing the boundary oh my god wrapped you're suddenly going to be able to actually signal more with your entities not like you want to cut in they're releasing something soon the duplicator the duplicator what they about i know i don't know what that's about i think well i have theories on it but i hear them afterwards yeah i think it's really cool i mean i think i think they are pushing the boundaries in more dynamic forms absolutely of kind of it's experiential yeah which is really cool and for me doodles are one that is like mass appealing like it doesn't matter who you are where you're from it has mass appeal my daughter loves doodles oh that's perfect yeah she drew a doodle she it was somebody asked school asked her what did your mom and dad do she drew my husband with a doodle and a bitcoin and then she drew me with a world of woman and a bitcoin yeah okay i'll do a couple final questions and then i just want to you know again try and get as much out of here the future the future of nfc like word vomit everything that's why i love podcasting because like when you're in a studio on like cnbc you're like very careful on that of course in person yeah podcast nobody goes everything yeah um best decision you feel like you've made as a businesswoman right in your business um definitely taking a risk on myself you know i think a lot of us sometimes we you know we think that we have to have experts in there we have to have like professionals in there and i think definitely taking a risk on myself and being really scrappy when we started our lashes like it was scrappy i must swear right oh hell yeah okay it was scrappy as like we got so scrappy um i bought six thousand dollars for my sister to start the lashes that was it the packaging that you see right now is still the selfie that i took i took a selfie didn't have any money for a photo took a selfie didn't have money for a logo asked my friend to create a firm for me um actually funny story my sister married my friends my friend's brother just now oh wow so yeah we could i couldn't pay her then paid a few years later like when i say scrappy like i think a lot of times we want everything to be polished and perfect i started with like the bare basics did what i need to do um wasn't professional and some of those things we still use and so i think taking a chance of myself just like believing that if i was just you know literally super gluing things together and i could like somehow present it in a professional form eventually it was going to be something and it didn't work you know what when did you make the leap from that to your lashes releasing to foreign just connect that tissue briefly if you can i mean it it looks like it happened briefly but it didn't it definitely took many years no i'm sure i'm saying give me the brief version now since we're running running on time for you so in a nutshell i mean social media was really like a catalyst for us you know like when being an early adopter it was yeah it was an early adopter and you know so funny is i was a blogger at the time and i was blogging giving out free information and all the other makeup artists are like what are you doing you're gonna be out of a job and i was like maybe but i also think i am going to work on my image marketing and at first i didn't do anything but i remember like a year two years into it um i had actually gotten pregnant and um i had like the royal family now but i'd be reaching out to me to do their makeup and i started charged i was able to charge a lot more because i was doing very little and they were really amazing and they helped me fund the business essentially you know it was it was just like it was marketing it was all i was like how did you find me they're like that's amazing you know what i mean yeah and i think we're seeing this shift i mean the creator economy it's a whole another topic to get into that i think it is interesting to see how that's evolving right you start with bloggers who couldn't really monetize you know what monetizing directly and now you can directly engage with an audience but you're often still working for another brand or showing somebody else's products and now moving into a space where we can creators can start to directly monetize i think this fourth wave is like come here yeah and communities co-creating 100 with 100 folks so speak to that and and i'm hoping that you can maybe that's in line on what you're thinking for definitely is a huge shift you know it's funny because we've only been able to go so far you know like with every single place like within time we kind of hit a wall and it takes time for the change to kind of go into place you know like when we when i was first blogging like nobody would pay me money everybody was like yeah yeah we know you sell products out but we don't really know like how like we don't have budget for you yeah you know nobody's putting a budget aside for a blogger then when i launched my lashes it was like holy this person is to be taken seriously we like you know we sold out in sephora like it was it was happening so quick so each time that shift happens there are people who like a lot of the bigger companies are late adopters which is why we as people the more that we like just like break  like you know just like do like move together and break really fast just trying things this is the way that we create shifts you know so we kind of do have to depend on each other the bigger companies are not going to figure it out they're too afraid of risk they're like they're stuck in their ways sometimes they're just not agile enough you know and so that's why we kind of have to like you know work with the smaller companies or work with people who are willing to take those risks and just like you know it's really just about around having fun yeah it really is and that's why these moments of trend is opportunity where you can start to take on the legacy institutions you can launch a career you need to be careful there too though right okay that's the time tell me why like right because you it's kind of like a shift you move from like you know up having fun everybody's like oh yeah i want a part of that and then it starts to get professional and the fun goes away and then people are like oh well now you're like everyone else and i have choices when it comes to everyone else so it's like it's really important that's why i love meeting the doodle founders they were just like they were so like okay we want to be really careful they're 100 on right now and they were just talking about like just like you know like  up doing what doesn't make sense financially mm-hmm but doing things that make sense for your community it reminded me a lot of the hood of beauty days all the days and i was like ah i want to go back home and buy a lot of doodles right now yeah you know what i mean i think i think jordan i i interviewed jordan on the show oh my god they're incredible right they're gonna do something big i totally agree

you know about pushback from your community there's a lot of i think a lot of misinformation about nfts out there um how do you try to tackle that as you've sort of talked about or how have you tackled it as we've talked more about this it is a little hard because a lot of people still have a bad connotation with none of these you know there still is a little bit of fear that it's a gimmick it's a sham you know it's a scam it's something that like only rich people make money on you know that's just not true that couldn't be further from the truth you know my own philosophy is that nfts will be i mean it's not my philosophy we will all have nfts every single one of us will have our own nft every single one of us will buy nfts you know like for me i don't understand why like even small mom and pop shops don't have their own nft so i keep trying to tell everybody like we need to get an nft like bathroom you could do it you could do this you could do that you know the reality is it is the future you know so um you know it's something that i i really like i love so much what was your question no no yeah i mean i think that that i imagine your answer is sort of educating your audience on the very fact that pushback you have you've gotten pushed back so far as you've talked about nfts i mean my community is very like they're very like savvy into starting their own businesses it's so funny i did uh my actual investors did like the survey where they wanted to find out a little bit about our investor about our followers and they found out that most of them were women who wanted to start their own businesses that's why they're following us they were like looking up to us on how to start it was crazy that was so cool it was something like 65 it was so interesting you were like i didn't feel like a business woman back in the day and now literally people are following you really because you're wild wild wow and so no but it's wild like it's literally why what we see of ourselves and what we actually are to the world it's just like it's so crazy and so um you know my community actually does when i know more they're actually begging me for more information and at some point when i like the beginning of the year i was so like i was so frustrated with the whole story about like women not being into the space enough i'm doing it slowly you know i don't want to be too aggressive i don't want people to feel like they have to buy nfts for me it's about just providing information i do share things here and there i'm very cognizant of showing um you know so i buy into projects but i don't necessarily want to talk about them you know like my wallet is public you know like i have a very public wallet i have obviously some private wallets too but my wallet is public so you know for me it's just like i don't want to i don't want to push my community to something i know they're really hungry about it but i just want to get an information right now yeah that's fantastic you have a timeline you're taking it slow but are you starting to put together this year okay i hope next year but it would be the 10 year anniversary of hood of beauty so it'd be sweet wow if we could do it if we could do it it'd be amazing congratulations awesome well okay last question is advice you talked about small amount of pop shops and i've talked about this in the podcast before too how can they do things you're like i have all these ideas you can do this you can do that any ideas you want to share specifically around that you've had oh my god so many like for me i just feel like if the only problem is that getting people to be able to get into the community like to get into the nft space right that's our only limitation right now is not everybody understands how to open a wallet how to start a wallet how to open a meta mask and to get their you know their their uh their ledger although there's there's still a limitation there so that's kind of like the issue that we run into so like you know we need to figure out how to make that easier for people but um but i do believe that you know there are some people who do know so like i would love for instance an in and out nft with like a secret menu and like not having to wait in line and then like like you know what i mean like i'm like we need something or like even like the place where i do all my botox and fillers i'm like you should do an nft and have like a monthly like you get free for one of the people who have your nfc get like a free like full-on whatever they want to get done like i just feel like it's an experience to take your community a little bit deeper so what are you what do you want to do for your community you have a lot of thoughts on what i want to do for my community like you know things just for them nobody else yeah not not even accessible any other way you know so i think that's really where it's going to be instagram just announced or just integrated started starting to roll out integrating nfts right it's really interesting to think about how creators now can own their audiences in ways they previously couldn't crazy you know you have if your your nft is integrated into instagram you can do special things for your instagram audience there but then if they own your nft you can do it for them on twitter anything is portable in a new way right are you starting to think about that at all it's interesting because like there's still an element of like you know that's still web too right yeah and there's still like this limitation there right so like i love that instagram and twitter are trying to play more into the space and to allow us to be more you know flexible and own more of what our community does but we're still that's still wet too mm-hmm do you mean so i don't know like if are they going to make a shift into web 3 are they going to allow us to have more control because we're still limited you know by the platforms themselves i think brand activism will be interesting to kind of track in this new world you're talking about like what different brands can do even small businesses like hey i want to speak to the i want to you know i want to speak to women in business communities let me partner with all of huda's nft holders oh my god i'm nike let me you know give an experience then do something i think there's the efficiency and what unlocks from like a partnership perspective is so exciting and so interesting the experiences that are going to happen when we get that right are going to be like mind blowing you know i've heard that i've been hearing a little bit about so many experiences that are going to be at nfc nyc and it's like wow like people are really you know there's like the more we get into the space the more it's going to be experiential you know we're just we're at the beginning i know we all like it's so funny because i always feel like i was so late you know i know that's not late but there's an element where you hear stories about people who got crypto punks in 2017 and you know so i mean gary was really early into crypto pub so you hear all these stories you're like damn i'm so late but we're so early oh my god you know so early i mean when you look at like the tech it's just a clunky experience it's clunky oh my god what i like to say though and i do like from you know financial advice not financial advice perspective but i do think sometimes i worry people can play it we are so early that doesn't mean the prices are early yeah this will be the last point it's like you know we definitely have seen a bit of a bubble in speculation around a lot of projects that aren't aren't gonna be worth anything right right so don't conflate it being early from a tech perspective and they're being so much it's gonna evolve with this is an undervalued right you know asset kind of look into it um it's a bit weird because like you know and i do believe this like even with cryptocurrency right like i always tell my husband you don't always buy things this is maybe not good financial advice maybe not good financial advice but if you are sensitive to this which i very much am you know i don't always go into projects that aren't necessarily the best with utility the best with certain aspects sometimes i buy hype because i know like if it's about to be like hyped up and emotional like there's a motion behind it i can make money off that flip if if i want to flip now that's only if you know how to fly yes i am not usually comfortable flipping but sometimes i get a hunch like i remember um what was a dogecoin i was like dogecoin i'm sorry for anybody who i'm sorry i love their but like i remember right before it took off i was like you know what like i don't think this is a necessarily like the best point but i know it's gonna make a lot of money so i was like we gotta like i was like put a thousand dollars i think we put two ten thousand dollars into it that turned into like six hundred thousand dollars literally in a week you know and i sold it because i was like you know yeah i wasn't planning on keeping it if you have a talent which you obviously do but having a pulse of culture yeah like that's always such a powerful thing and you know you're now able to monetize that in a way that you really couldn't previously right i don't always have it but when i have it i trust it you know great and it's paid off quite literally um this was such a pleasure thank you so much for everything you're doing you haven't spoken
