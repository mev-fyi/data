2032 10 years from now is signing with ethereum is maximally successful what kind of impact will it have on the world now that users control their own identifier or have ways of doing it I think wallets get to the point where Key Management is a complete Breeze not worrying about like oh no did I write those 12 words somewhere wallets have created such great experiences around like recovery never worrying about a large company pulling the rug on them or having a data breach and instead are just worrying about new features that are dropping to make the apps and services that much more better we're not constantly in this world of fear of oh no is something going to happen to my data forgot about that account five years ago and now that app or service is shut down or their data is now posted on the dark web somewhere I think it's less on that and more about what app am I going to be using today that's offering me so much value and social value and if I don't like it within 10 seconds I can move over to the next platform and the experience is nearly the same and these platforms are just purely competing on services and what they could offer the user more focused on benefiting users than being extractive from the user
