[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david i know you love this episode did you love it as much as i think you do absolutely we have a common enemy in moloch and we need a nation to to help slay him right and so we brought amin soleimani and kevin owaki two individual moloch slayers to come onto the bankless pod to talk about what moloch is and why we are trying to slay him and what is different this time now that we have ethereum and all the tools in the ethereum tool belt to help slay moloch so that's what this episode is all about and i'm pretty passionate about getting this message into as many years as possible well i'm i'm passionate about it too because i think that um you have correctly identified in your past writings and as have others as have you know many in this kind of moloch slang tribe that moloch is really i mean he's the god of coordination failure is really the biggest problem that humanity faces and maybe the the only problem so if we are going to have an enemy as the bankless nation it should definitely be moloch yeah i really like that phrase i think we can we can all label some problems that we have in our lives and i think if you keep on pulling back the layers every single problem that we have moloch is at the end of it right so to some degree moloch is problems right and and to some degree it's also the the most relevant problem that we could ever face but i think he's specifically rearing his head lately right like 2020 is a year of of many different crises and i think it's pretty easy to connect every single crisis that we have be it the lack of our ability to coordinate around coronavirus or the lack of like the the polar opposite ends of the united states to be able to coordinate in politics facebook is tearing us apart from our communities and making us believe different things you know at the end of the day like i feel like 2020 especially is the year that moloch is rearing its head and we need more help to slay this beast because he is he's approaching from all sides yeah he's he's really a common enemy for all of us you know i think also what you're saying is once you see moloch in things once you see human coordination failures like you see them anywhere everywhere you begin to be able to identify the root of uh so many things that seem like they're individual caused or human caused and they're really systemic flaws they're they're problems with kind of the you know the game theory or the the coordination traps that we all fall into so it um there's actually hope i think here um and particularly at the end of the episode where we talk about humanity some of humanity's big problems once you can identify what the problem actually is you can also start to plan a solution and a way to create this sword that can actually attack and slay the coordination problems and propel humanity into the future so this is um this is definitely a very hopeful uh hopeful episode and i think ethereum at the core and bitcoin and crypto and everything that that we talk about uh every week on bankless it's a hopeful technology i mean that's that's why we're here yeah it's the technology that makes me optimistic every single morning when i wake up it's like oh thank god you know the world's on fire there's smoke outside my window but at least ethereum is here right at least i have this this common group of people where we can all collaborate and coordinate as to what the problems actually are because like you said we can't solve the problems unless we can identify them and moloch is the problem of all problems right and and we are all here to help to help slay moloch if you guys are confused perhaps as to why ryan and i are saying this moloch word or or who molock is or what this moloch thing is all about there's a lot of other content available for context and we we start to talk about that what that context is in the very beginnings of the episode but there's going to be plenty of resources also in the show notes to get you up to speed as well and we discuss some of that context right at the beginning of this episode so let's just go ahead and get right into it but first we're going to talk about some of our fantastic sponsors that really enable us to slay moloch from so many different angles wiring is defy's first self-building project on ethereum focused on producing products for those who are interested in earning yield in defy why iron's various products are all built to suit each individual investor's preferred level of risk from various vault strategies that leverage defy tokens to the safer urn system which relies on stable coins vaults are aggressive yield farming robots each with a unique strategy that is designed to maximize the yield of the deposited asset why iron employs some of the most informed developers in d5 to keep the vault strategies updated with the various yield farming opportunities on ethereum for customers who are more risk adverse the iron's earned product may be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment iron is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the wire system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wiring it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that wire has to offer at why earn dot finance that's y e a r n dot finance bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people unpackaging their beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store alright everyone draw your swords because it's time to slay moloch [Music] amin kevin welcome to the bankless pod today i hope to inspire a bunch of people to join in a long journey of slaying moloch and i think you two individuals are perhaps the best inspiration for encouraging people to go on this journey so amin welcome to bankless thank you for having me kevin also thank you for coming on this journey as well thanks for having me excited for the conversation i mean back in 2018 2019 uh it was the bear market gang right at that point in time the people that had came in through 2017 to join in you know the ethereum fun times of getting rich quick had then therefore left right and so the the 2018 2019 bear market crew were the people that were left behind that you know kind of by definition were interested and incentivized for ethereum to fulfill the vision that we all wanted it to but it wasn't there yet and you gathered everyone around to hear about the story of moloch let's start there i mean what is moloch why are we talking about the canaanite god of child sacrifice maluk i like to say is why we can't have nice things malik is a it's a pattern that helps us make sense of the world um and so when when we want to build you know societies want to build schools and hospitals and infrastructure but instead build guns and bombs and planes it's because they can't effectively coordinate together to disarm and that's because the dominant strategy is to get everyone else to disarm and then secretly keep your weapons and that is molok and so malik defines these like prisoners dilemmas that lead to uh unfortunate equilibriums that either the players want like can't uh get out of or they don't know enough about it or they just can't coordinate enough to to change the equilibrium and it was encoded uh very nicely in a rationalist blog post called meditations on malloc and so the idea behind malak dao was largely to try and bring some of the teachings of meditations on malik to the ethereum community and in order to understand what happens essentially when coordination breaks down and what what is ultimately at stake uh with ethereum yeah i mean i think that meditation's on malloc is a super inspiring blog post and uh the problem with it is that it's 25 pages long and so i have to admit that in 2018 when people were passing it along and they sent it to me i opened it up and read a couple paragraphs and i was like i'll come back to this later but i i think that one of the cool things about what you're doing david here is making the 25-page blog post into something that can be consumed in a few minutes with the bankless podcast and consumed in other venues and it's a super important message so would encourage people to read the post itself but if you can't the bankless material and some of the material that we're putting out here will be also a good summary that is absolutely the goal of what we're trying to do here today so i just want to reiterate one of some of the things that amin was saying where he said it's these prisoners dilemmas that result in these coordination failures right and at the heart of every single instance of coordination failure is the basic principle of the prisoner's dilemma where you have two rational actors who if they knew what's best for themselves they would both choose to coordinate with each other but because each one has their own individual incentives they end up both defecting from each other which ultimately creates worse outcomes for both and in the meditations on moloch blog post there's this very short two paragraphs which i think really illustrate what we're really talking about here so i'm going to read that out loud and then we will go from there so imagine the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered it's easy to imagine such a state imagine a country with two rules first every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks second if anyone fails to follow a rule including this one or speaks out against it or fails to enforce it all citizens must unite to kill that person suppose these rules were well enforced enough and established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced so therefore you shock yourself for 8 hours a day because you know if you don't everyone else will kill you because if they don't everyone else will kill them and so on every single citizen hates the system but for a lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures from a god's eye view we can optimize this system too everyone agrees to stop doing this all at once but no one within the system is able to affect the transition without great risk to themselves that's the end of the passage what we are seeing with moloch is that you can take this basic principle and apply it to any sort of you know rationally bad outcome such as war for example and apply a moloch principle to it so the project that i work on in the space is called git coin and it's a place that you can get coins if you're a software engineer and the specific mission that we set out to solve back in 2017 when we started the project was to create economic incentives for open source software uh open source software creates 400 billion dollars per year in economic value uh that was a study that was done in 2010 so before blockchain but the people who are working on open source software are just working on nights and weekends and not able to pay their mortgage by working on open source software and that is a coordination failure in that our digital infrastructure goes underfunded that git coin is setting out to solve so i think that uh that's another tangible example of from a god's eye view a system that is is sub-optimal but the individual actors have no incentive to maintain open source and so we can't really increment our our way out of it molok dao is similar to git coin in the sense that it was designed to help solve these collective action funding problems uh where there would be something that we would all benefit from if we could only all fund it together but because not enough people are funding things together then none of it gets funded uh and so get coin has acted as this like great uh signal to attract a lot of uh projects that are up and coming in the space and can receive broad community support molok dao and metacartel dao also helped to solve some of this by allowing people to pool money and spend it together and the the reality of ethereum is that you know it sort of takes this kind of collective action because we don't have any inflation mechanisms we don't have any sort of taxes or any of the the normal mechanisms through which public goods are funded uh and so we we sort of had to roll our own um the the malloc situation is that like of course it would benefit everybody on ethereum if like we had a little bit more money to pay for devs but like it's you know too difficult for any actor to like try to put that into place into ethereum uh because you know of the coordination effort that it would take to like convince everybody to accept block rewards for devs and figure out how to govern it and da da that like we've you know started off by just completely going around that and using voluntary donations from uh you know people who are aligned with the long-term success of the platform yeah these public goods have this this uh this problem called the free rider problem which is that public goods like open source software are non-excludable and non-rivalrous which just means that when you create a public good like open source it benefits everyone so why does anyone have an incentive to give back their rational economic incentive if you look at it narrowly is to just free ride on the system and the cool thing about ethereum is that it introduces this transparent economic coordination layer where the rules can't change on you so it's a transparent economic layer where the rules can't change on you and so that allows a project like moloch molok dao to to to basically create collective action based off of ethereum and and as i understand it the game theory of of multial is that i am going to fund project x but only if a hundred other people in molok dao also fund it so it gets over that free rider problem of of why should i be the only person that that funds this and get coin grants uses this thing called quadratic funding which gets over the free rider problem by providing a matching bonus for every single contribution that goes over to bitcoin grants but the cool thing is that that we now have ethereum and those are just two instantiations of coordination games that can be played on the ethereum network in order to support public goods and i think that git coin and molok are both early examples of coordination games that solve public goods problems but i hope to see hundreds more coordination games built on top of ethereum and i think that that's how we're going to build the momentum to slay molok david absolutely and and the end goal of this conversation is to talk about the strengths of ethereum as a technology as a platform for why it is particularly well suited to aiding coordination among humans right in in a in an adversarial environment but first before before we get there i kind of want to go through some historical and first principles conversations of moloch right i mean before this episode we were talking uh in in twitter dms about um how groups coordinate and how uh the status quo emerges based off of uh coordinating groups right and you said uh that as the status quo of the world right like the whole entire world changes it's because uh groups tend to coordinate better than whatever the status quo is when we think about at a very high level the systems that govern our reality right like uh the coordination mechanisms uh you know you could go super high level and and start with like time uh but if you you know like without time things would be a lot harder to do together uh and then you you can go a level down and and you know have like names uh of people and like conventions around naming you could go a level down and then be like you know what what story are we all participating in right and it's like the nation state story uh and and this has actually not always been the case right because before there were nation states there was you know uh empires and before there were empires there was like feudalism and uh you know then back to empires and so forth um and and the interesting thing is simply that you know whatever system dominates whatever coordination mechanism dominates like had to have out-competed all of the previous coordination mechanisms so like there was a point at which you know feudalism was harder to maintain than it was to compete against uh and there will probably be a point that like maintaining a nation nation state is harder than uh competing against it uh and the role of any coordination platform is is sort of to enable these kinds of uh you know transitions as facilitated by technology and the bet is that the people who are able to most effectively use these coordination platforms are going to be the ones that out compete uh over time so i wrote this article way back when that kind of instantiated the metaphor of the bankless nation in and it was just a kind of an iteration of this where i claim that we started with i mean in the article i said we go even further back than religion but i use religion as like this first example of a coordination substrate a coordination tool where you know somebody on one side of a continent could coordinate with somebody on another side of the continent if these two other people ever met because they understood that they both uh used the same story the same coordination tool of like christianity or or you know insert your religion here right and so religion first and foremost was a coordination tool and the reason why court religion was successful was it allowed coordination across a wide variety of people right and what you're saying i mean is that you know religions were useful and and maybe they're still useful to some degree for coordination but eventually that the nation-state came and that turned out to be a much more scalable infrastructure much more scalable scaffolding for people to coordinate with and so you know for for better or for worse for for more more morality or less morality it doesn't really matter the morals or ethics of these coordination tools it's just that one of these systems can coordinate better than the other and therefore that new system comes to dominate and becomes the new status quo uh yeah that's right um malik is ultimately about like what thing you're willing to sacrifice to get ahead uh and like the reality is that anytime you know a group can sacrifice something to get ahead they do it and that's what drives these sort of equilibrium and and so like uh you know if i can sacrifice my morality uh for some sort of advantage then like i'm likely to do that uh if i can uh sacrifice you know my belief in the nation-state for some sort of advantage then i might do that uh the issue is like you know that these opportunities uh don't present themselves there's no way for a bunch of people in like a country for example to uh coordinate against all nations at the same time uh the interesting thing with uh you know network-based monies like bitcoin and ethereum and and others is that you know for the first time like anywhere you are in the world you can be on the same team and that's a really powerful uh you know state of affairs um and and i just i can't i i would expect that to continue to um to uh propagate because uh the ease of recruiting and the ease of um winning people over and uh you know could see that nation states which are bound geographically are going to have a hard time keeping up can we go back to i guess um talking about like coordination failure like so so um i remember reading the the blog post you guys referenced a while ago um but it's not i it might not be immediately obvious to everyone why human coordination is so hard right so like why do we have to invent all of these things all of these technologies do you consider like you know you know money and nation state is sort of a social technology to help us coordinate why why is it just so hard is it because we're all kind of greedy and evil or is there something more pernicious here i mean i think it's it's it's a it's a question of what you're optimizing for um and and to me these the the reason why coordination is hard is because we're all arbitraging between different incentive gradients that were that we're all climbing so we're all optimizing for different things um and ryan if you and i were to be put in a game together like an economic game in which i could cheat in which i could defect and get some gain for myself and you would pay pay the cost of that i could externalize the cost to you then you and i would have to have pretty high trust in order to both play the game and not do that to each other because there's an incentive gradient that i'm climbing that uh that basically you're you're not on and and so i think that there's a question of are our incentives aligned and are our individual incentives aligned with each other and are they in aligned with the broader group and what is the cost to to to create create value for yourself relative to others and do we trust each other to do what's best for the group as opposed to all go our own separate ways i think trust is what it comes down to so that's fine kevin because you and i you know we're friends and i trust you right so uh it's not a not a big deal i i would trust that you wouldn't cheat but maybe somebody that i don't know that doesn't have a reputation as uh as esteemed as yours kevin is that sort of where the the trust breaks down when it gets outside of kind of your social circle and your reputational knowledge circle yeah so i mean the way i think about it is that like if it in and bear with me but if you go back far enough in time the way humanity organized has changed a lot and i think of the main epochs of human organization as being the hunter-gatherer age in which we gathered around in small bands hunting game and sharing it with each other then the agricultural age in which humanity in went through a stepwise increase in complexity which transcended and included the hunter-gatherer sort of epoch and we all settled on lands and started farming and there were towns in which you had to interact with more and more people and then the industrial age where you can move to new york city and there would be eight million people in your local area that you would have to coordinate with through city government as david noted that the nation-state is prominent during the industrial age and now we're in the information age where we've all been thrown on twitter together and we're all from different parts of the world don't trust each other partially because it's hard to build trust in 280 characters but partially because we've never been in this online first environment with people of different backgrounds or and all sorts of uh different priors about the world and so for me it's a question of dunbar's number back in the hunter-gatherer age you could trust everyone around you because that's how human society had evolved but if you pay it forward to the information age in which we're all regularly interacting with in some way 8 million 8 billion strangers then dunbar's number our ability to trust the rest of humanity has not caught up with our ability to communicate with the rest of humanity and so that's what's so powerful about ethereum for me and gives me so much hope about the ethereum space is that we can build trust into our systems by putting them on top of this transparent economic substrate that cannot change the rules on you so i think it's all about trust in the number of people you are interacting with are they inside your dunbar's number or are they not so for people who haven't heard of dunbar's number that's kind of like a like an upper cognitive limit on the amount of people that you can trust right mm-hmm exactly well how how what is that number something like 150 180 it's 150. i think it is basically you have like your kin which is five people you have your inner circle which can be 10 or 15. and then like the outermost ring is around 50 or 150. so and the the story of humanity right is finding newer and improved mechanisms to scale up dunbar's number right and so and and uh for what it's worth like dunbar's number is also different for every single species right because it's totally dependent on brain size and in brain capacity right so you know the the reason why dunbar's number for humans is 150 is because that's about the number of relationships that you can hold in memory so like it's not just your relationships with you know your friend joe but it's also joe's relationship with joe's friend fred and your relationship with fred and the intersection between all of these things right and and when david when you say when you say relationship david like uh you could kind of boil that down to trust right yes exactly it's kind of like this mental picture that i have of you and your reputation and like a relationship is whether if i do this like i know i can trust david to do this right right so initial societies scaled up to about 150 people because that's how much trust that you could have in memory right and in hunter-gatherer societies when it started to uh get larger than 150 we would start to see these hunter-gatherer societies split into two and because trusk wasn't able to scale that far so in order to solve that problem the society of greater than 150 people split into two societies of like you know 70 yeah and then i think that you know this is where a steve jobs quote comes to mind for me he he used to say technology is a bicycle for the mind so if you think of someone who's running you can use a bite a bicycle to go faster and so technology is a bicycle for the mind and so as technology advances we're not going to be able to increase the cognitive limit of how many relationships you can hold in your head but we can augment the mind's ability to have working relationships with all of these people by hopefully using technology in a way that increases trust in and doesn't erode it yeah so like to bring this to the bitcoin example like what git coin accomplishes is making you feel like you're part of something even though you're playing by yourself so like i donate to a bunch of stuff but like i rest assured that you know my donation's going to be matched and i'm playing as part of this game and i can use my signaling to get other people uh to also donate and so it's really like bolsters the the individual action uh by connecting it to the larger hole molok dao does something similar because you can vote on something but you know it'll it'll only uh it either passes or fails and if it passes everybody's spending money on it um and the reason that you feel confident you know putting your money down with a bunch of strangers on the internet is because you know you can take it out at any time and those rules uh like kevin said can't be changed on you kevin i'm really happy you brought up that steve jobs quote uh technology is a bicycle for the mind because the first instance that we saw a society start to exceed dunbar's number and stay as one whole society was when the ancient sumerians were invented writing right and as people may know writing the first iteration of writing was just a ledger right it was a list of numbers next to like a list of nouns right and like numbers next to some animals merchandise names or dates right and so what people were doing at this time were tracking the ownership of items right they were making ledgers which i think is actually fascinating because that's kind of the industry that we are in now right like you know distributed blockchain networks are distributed ledgers right and so the first piece of technology that scaled dunbar's number was the piece of technology that allowed for people to manage and come to consensus as to who owned what and i thought i think that's absolutely fascinating yeah i think it's fascinating because it's like it's it's both a i guess a ledger so it's something numerical but it's also like a very early primitive property rights system which is is super reminiscent of what we're effectively building and working on with like bitcoin and ethereum these are property right system these are ledgers that keep track of you know who owns what bitcoin and which tokens are owned by what etherdress basically so it's kind of the same thing only in in digital form i mean offline you you said a line which has really resonated with me which uh you said crypto you think is valuable because it coordinates people better than previous mechanisms right so uh something you said earlier in this podcast was that you know if if you're on the internet and you ascribe to this game of bitcoin and ethereum you are opting into a system that is outside the nation state that you can trust that you know many many other people who are in their own separate nation states can all opt into right and so and i think what you were alluding to is that like the market cap of these coins you know as volatile as they are still comes from the fact that people believe that these systems can coordinate people better than better than previous mechanisms yeah um it ends up being like the olympics of belief uh so let me like every country puts forth their you know best contestants uh in the olympics and they all they all do battle but imagine if it's like instead of you know athletes like belief in their monetary system right like uh at the end of the day we are trust like we have options to trust people uh and they are you know the stewards of our financial systems the central bankers and and so forth um or we we can opt out and like the really cool thing about bitcoin is that you can go home and you can just sit there and believe as hard as you can in bitcoin and you will actually make a tangible difference uh in the sense that like your belief uh is what gives bitcoin value and and if everybody went home and believed really hard in bitcoin uh as a store of value then it would win immediately um and and that that is interesting uh because it it it it points out you know how how much of these things are are just based on belief and with ethereum it's a little harder it's not so much enough to believe in ethereum we also have to build uh useful stuff on it to get people to use it uh and then believe in it when you say believe i mean you you mean uh believe but also they have to take some action right it's like you you believe in by virtue of your belief you hold or you buy more right yeah you believe you talk about it you right so you go from this position of not having any belief in bitcoin too len like being like this thing is inevitable it's the future right you turn into essentially an agent uh of the system right and and it's it's important to realize like the extent to which everybody is uh implicitly an agent of like the financial system if they're not in crypto right like if you have your you know 401k in us dollars you've got you know your your pension is on its way like you're going to want to preserve the us dollar you are in some sense a staker of u.s dollars if you if you hold any usd denominated debt uh that you expect to receive all right um so uh like you know in some sense uh these two systems are coordinating against each other right like i like the crypto game is playing against everybody who has a a you know 401k um like if crypto works it's going to be much better for the people that hold crypto than for the people who hold uh you know fiat currencies um and so the game ends up being recruiting the best and brightest from those people and like the brain drain that's sort of happening is uh an indicator that that is continuing to go swimmingly and you're gonna see you know the the best minds of finance eventually defect to something like bitcoin uh and largely crypto because bitcoin is a molec technology it allows anybody at any of these institutions to defect and uh hold up a flag of bitcoin and that will uh that will be what changes it it won't be that you know bitcoin takes on all of these institutions at the same time it's the things like banks uh allowing custody will then turn banks into uh willing participants of the bitcoin economy to drive it drive fees from custodying it trading and so forth and like that will then integrate you know bitcoin into the economy i expect the same thing to happen with ethereum uh but more on the the financial side not so much just like the holding not only does it give the option to defect and you know opt out of your your dollars and opt into these crypto assets which i think you know maybe perhaps all four of us here have done this right in the sense that i'm gonna go ahead and guess that all four of us hold more crypto assets than we do dollars and and the the fact that uh you know so many people just use dollars on a day-to-day basis right like their employer pays them in dollars to direct a deposit to their bank account and then they hold their dollars in their bank account and then like this scales up to the entire population of the united states and then even beyond that because of that's true we give the power to we or reason to exist to this thing called the federal reserve right and the federal reserve is this super powerful you know agency that has you know a ton of control over the has a ton of uh you know puppet strings over over all of our lives and the reason why that has power in the first place is because we're all using the dollar right except the the amazing thing about the ecosystems of bitcoin and ethereum is that you know as soon as a few people start to defect and adopt the values that we see in bitcoin and ethereum there's an incentive to get other people to also defect and when those people then are convinced to defect then it turns into this grand recruit recruiting arm right and so as platforms bitcoin and ethereum have the probably the world's best like free marketing division there is so much free marketing that people like me and ryan as content producers people like eric and anthony with their ether podcasts anyone that produces content like uh peter mccormick with what bitcoin did podcast like he doesn't he doesn't get paid by bitcoin bitcoin doesn't pay him ethereum doesn't pay us but we do it for free because of the incentive to defect from the system because if this financial system works out you know we're going we believe that we're going to do pretty well for ourselves that's that's exactly right um it's one of the the news stories i've been waiting on for a while is like who's going to be the first central banker to defect right uh and announce that they are holding bitcoin reserves right the incentive to do so is very high uh because you don't want to be the last one to adopt bitcoin uh you you guarantee yourself upside pretty much if you if you are the first one uh to you know announce that you're holding bitcoin because then you benefit from the price appreciation of everybody else trying to do that so i i actually think it's like largely inevitable um and you see with uh getting pretty close with like iran for example being easier on uh bitcoin miners and like kazakhstan also like being easier on bitcoin miners um because they know that's you know how to generate anonymous bitcoins um so i i i think it's actually already happening um and and you know that sort of excites me and scares the out of me at the same time well so i i tweeted out yesterday just to questions like do you think crypto is on a collision course with the nation state and uh the majority of people uh on that twitter poll uh said yes right it's like so he here is a wrench that could be thrown in the gear as a mean is the nation state does have a monopoly on violence right so they can through legal tender laws say hey if you don't accept our coin uh our us dollars or if you choose to hold bitcoin then that is now a legal offense and we can put you in a cage uh or we could take away some of your rights or we could fine you or tax you or all of these things um how does that play into the to the game theory that that you were talking about is that's why i think a lot of people we had ben hunt on the podcast and he basically said um yeah i like this bankless idea but you guys are wrong to go try to take on money because money is the nation states and they're not going to give that up what do you think about that argument um i think the world gets weird really fast sometimes uh and it's important to keep that in mind and it's uh so i think everything is going after the nation state in you know this century it's not just crypto it's it's like bleeding out from you know a lot of different inefficiencies um the financial stuff is just one side of it what i would say to that is that all nation states sort of compete right so like if one nation state cracks down on on crypto for example and others leave the opportunity open then you could see a migration there right it's really hard to stamp it out entirely and like the more that some nations try to fight it it just means that like the us might be the last to adopt right there's there's less of an incentive to adopt a game resetting technology like crypto uh for the incumbent uh where there's more incentive from the competitors who might you know let the chips fall where they may and and see a slight you know increase in their standing as a result um by by piling on and that's and that's sort of why i think it's inevitable um because you know even if the united states does nothing about it like everyone else eventually will and i'm curious just to follow up on that if you when you say it's inevitable what kind of time range you thinking like is this something that inevitably happens in the next decade or is this like you're just talking in your lifetime you'll see it i think decade uh just because of how fast things get faster right like every time every year or two years you know that we go through a crypto market cycle like 10 times as many people or hold crypto and have uh are talking about it um and so like right now we're staying around the one percent mark right if we do it again it goes to ten percent like that's you know more than like that that's that's that's quite a number of people at that point uh and and so like in terms of motivated uh participants like i could see it um being uh like growing exponentially and that being a hard thing to clamp down on like also i think money is just gonna be private and there's nothing anybody can do about it uh so like good luck just because like the stuff around you know anonymous like zk snarks magic is going to proliferate everywhere it's going to be on every chain and every token is going to have a way to become anonymized well it's funny it's funny though like so we see a little bit of maybe we we've always talked about the nation state being the final boss and like routinely popping its head around and this year at least in the u.s now the 2020 tax returns when you're filing your taxes they're asking the question do you hold or in the last year have you uh traded or done anything transferred paid with any crypto you have to check a box yes or no which is which is kind of interesting right so like it does feel like there is going to be some kind of a clash um but you're saying i mean that privacy technologies might give i guess the um uh the uh the strength to the the individual who maybe you know doesn't need to disclose that disclose that yeah it's really about cost benefit right like eventually you're going to be sending as a country like a lot of money trying to tax people who really don't want to be taxed and like driving them all away and you know the the anonymity is it's like it's just gonna be uh i think insurmountable um so uh and and i don't i don't think like crypto is gonna go quietly uh either right like bitcoin has a lot of fanatics uh i would be surprised if the people who were driving much of the fight against like bitcoin were you know personally at least somewhat scared uh just because like i don't know what bitcoiners will do uh they're they're kind of crazy like if somebody threatens to shut down bitcoin like you know uh they all like post pictures on their twitter with guns like were they just playing like was it just the larp um or like will it will they actually die for bitcoin you know uh it remains to be seen because these are political platforms right there are politics baked into the code of any crypto economic platform like like bitcoin and ethereum right and and we've seen that the bitcoin tends to attract the more conservative uh more libertarian types and and ethereum i don't know what it attracts but i feel like it attracts maybe a greater audience but overall uh there are still like values of how things should be baked into these systems right and one of the things that i'm i'm always interested in following is that you know before before we had crypto we never really would we wouldn't even bother to have this conversation of defecting from the nation state because where we would go after that we we wouldn't have anything to talk about right but now now we actually have some quote unquote like destination of when we defect we actually can like say well what what do what do we mean by this well we can say like well i plan to host my my personal capital my personal value on this non-sovereign you know financial platform called bitcoin or ethereum right and so prior to this when the you know the effective tax rate for the average u.s citizen is 34 or something that's 34 of your capital as incentive to defect into these other systems right and you know everyone should pay their taxes but if there's this system that makes it easier for people to you know hide their wealth or have gone from taxes you can bet that some people are going to take that incentive to defect from from the you know the united states nation state right uh and and not only that but we we can compare you know the defy infrastructure you know swapping one currency for another paying a friend like you know why sending funds from one address to another is just straight up better right so not only is there the incentive to defect but these things are straight up just more useful and and so like i i'm i'm just absolutely fascinated with future conflict between like the united states or the nation state that's trying to like grasp for straws to retain people's allegiance to it versus this new platform that you know is as great as we know it to be hey guys we're going to pause the conversation and talk about some of the fantastic sponsors that help sharpen the sword that will hopefully slay moloch one day your ethereum address is a bankless bank account but here's the problem it doesn't have a human readable name it's represented by this long hexadecimal string that no one can read unstoppable domains has the solution to that problem it provides a domain name for your ethereum address so instead of telling someone to send you funds to xerox e3ba blah blah blah you can tell them to send funds to yourname.crypto a domain name for your ethereum address at unstoppabledomains.com you can search for blockchain domains like this and find tools to easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs you can even have unstoppable domains help you manage your dot crypto or dot eth or even zill domain name addresses at their unstoppable domains manager websites have domain names.com.org your bankless bank account on ethereum should have a domain name too so go to unstoppabledomains.com register a domain name for your ethereum address now unstoppabledomains.com one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up block folio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do is zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zappa reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswap forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available d5 platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed yeah i mean i think one of the things that is interesting to me about this is that when i talk to libertarians they really my whole thing is that i want to see fund public goods funded including an open source clean air uh clean water stuff like that and when i talk to libertarians it seems like they're really concerned about how taxation is theft and we we can kind of get into this this sort of zero-sum thinking in which like hippies like me who like public sort or public public goods and clean air and stuff are zero-sum pitted against the libertarians who are just like i don't want to pay any taxes and in the old world i i think that we see i see some wiggle room here because in the old world the mechanism for funding public goods was by paying your taxes and then the government will take care of it and and now in the information age if we can come up with new ways of funding public goods of making sure that the climate doesn't worm uh that our infrastructure is still funded but without coercive taxation then i think that that's a really exciting uniting point for humanity and people who have particularly in the past been been opposed on different parts of the ideological spectrum i understand why libertarians say tax chases theft you can assemble the argument from first principles you can also assemble the argument from first principles that without uh money that's that's going to some to public goods then we're going to create a hellscape on earth and so i think that being able to meet in the middle by creating funding public goods funding mechanisms that don't involve the nation state and don't involve taxation coercive taxation is is really where i see the future going and that's where it gets really super interesting for me and that's how we fight molok in the information age yeah i'd love to uh like i kind of wish we could run the experiment of take all the libertarians in america throw them in one place and like let them figure it out with no benefit from anybody else or like existing public good they're just gonna invent a way to like tax themselves to pay for things right or like all complain about public goods not being fun like oh the goddamn pothole like you know it's like who's fixing this and it's like well nobody because nobody wants to pay for anything uh right and and i think i think like part of the uh the severity of like the taxationist theft sentiment comes from like not being able to opt out right like all the land is claimed on earth there's nowhere i can go where they won't tax me uh and and so it sort of feels like being uh you know free range human on a tax farm right uh where like the the ideal would be like if we could run this experiment we had land and we we could set up our own governance structures and like you know try stuff but the reality is like that you know how do you where do you even start like how do you get the land how do you get the permits or whatever there's a lot of paperwork involved and and so it's hard to run like uh meet space governance experiments yeah it seems to me it seems to me the libertarians are rejecting that right like they can't opt out and so that the tax system is coercive but they're they're also rejecting something that i think like all of us would reject whether we're libertarian or not and that's like the corruption that like we find when um public goods go to politicians and politicians excuse me are the only ones that have a choice and the ability to to um to spend those goods right like it's the idea of a very small group uh at the like the the power table here getting to decide where to spend everyone else's money and the kind of the nepotism and corruption that goes along with that i should mention that a little piece of ethereum history is that about 15 months ago uh i was involved in a group of people who put forward a proposal to fund public goods and ethereum with block rewards funding and uh i've got some scar if this was a video i would show you my scars from that from that proposal but basically we kind of like learned that you can't put public goods funding into the base layer of ethereum because of the capture problem how do you fund public goods from an ongoing emission from the base layer with without proof of work without proving that that that was spent in a way that's productive for the network and and how do you prove that it's not going to be captured by uh the like the core developers becoming an oligarchy or something like that and so i think we learned a lot in about that problem of of capture in the block rewards funding thing and the ethereum space moves so fast that was 15 months ago but it feels like forever ago and now i don't think anyone's talking about public or block rewards funding at least for ethereum anymore because of that capture problem and i think that's something that we should probably avoid in most crypto networks so kevin if i recall that proposal came out kind of uh close to the same time that moloch uh came out moloch dow at least and so this was like another answer to the problem of of moloch which is like free rider problem that we talked about earlier lack of public goods funding it's basically an idea a proposal to the community to take a portion of um ether emissions right so essentially issuance uh or like monetary policy inflation if you will and have that go to a fund to go pay for things and like so what happened for people who weren't there weren't paying attention kevin so this was kind of floated by the community what happened to it yeah so um i mean i think that basically we put forward this proposal to insert some sort of funding good uh public goods mechanism eip 1890 if anyone wants to look up the historical artifact which is no longer being debated and basically there's three parts to the proposal uh the first part was do you agree that that open source software is important the second part was you agree that our open source infrastructure in ethereum is underfunded and at the time there's a bunch of debates about eth1x being underfunded um and then the third the third the third part of the proposal was what we're doing right now isn't working and we need block rewards funding so there's sort of like a descending order of of arguments and and in a progressive a a progressive argument towards building a a case for doing block rewards funding and i like i'm guilty i authored the proposal so uh you know i no longer think that there should be block rewards funding in ethereum but i did put for that proposal to stimulate conversation there was about two weeks of positive conversation and then i think people started turning against it uh and and i think that they turned against it because of the capture problem i think uh you know the argument came from a good place yet you know if we give up point two percent of our money we can have a hundred percent better uh ethereum world and i think the actual proposal was inflation at the time was four percent and we should have ten percent of that inflation so point four percent go to core devs and that my argument was give up point four percent and have a hundred percent better world um but what ended up happening was like i think it was like aragon came out of nowhere and like tried to capture it or something like that i forget who who it was and then and then people revolted against it of of the people that revolted against it i think amin was one of them so i would hand it off to him to kind of tell the rest of the story yeah i initially supported it i was like this seems good the ethereum foundation has you know not a lot of money is it like a hundred dollars like uh if eath foundation runs out of money that's real bad uh who's gonna keep funding ethereum like let's make sure that we have enough money to like make this thing work um but uh you know like kevin said uh two weeks in a whole bunch of groups came out and everybody made the same argument as to why they are the most qualified to handle the money uh myself included and you know we sort of eventually realized this was going to devolve into some sort of quagmire uh and that it wasn't like we couldn't bootstrap trust fast enough into any sort of party um and like i was proposing we compromised and just give all the money to the ef and let them do it because they've been doing it and you know some of the people who are trying to get it to happen we're also like trying to make the money not go to the ethereum foundation and it seemed that like combining the two things of like let's get a bunch of money from block rewards and two like bootstrap trust into an entirely new organization to do this uh where we're just sort of doomed um even like like giving the money to the ef is like hard enough um just because it it alters the social contract of like you know the ethereum issuance plan it's like minimum viable subsidy for security right like that's and and and it really is about who makes the decision who makes the calls and like what accountability mechanisms are there and you have to essentially bootstrap trust in that whole thing uh before it even launches and like at you know ethereum 3 4 or whatever it was 2018 so f for four years in like that was just a non-starter uh like maybe one day if we have a lot more experience and like you know dowser a thing and like people are have proven that they know how to manage this like it'll work but also if the ef just if eth goes up enough that like funding can continue then might be fine or if get coin just keeps you know growing then who knows uh it's it's it's gonna say it's it's interesting that you say like we need we learned we needed to bootstrap trust a little bit and in the sort of ashes of the block reward funding proposal we started to see molok really really take off and you know bitcoin grants i think took off at like a slower a slower pace was more of like a slower burn but i think that we are starting to sort of like bootstrap these coordination mechanisms for how you can distribute money to public goods but without creating a plutocracy and and we're doing it in more of a contained way not not at the base layer of the ethereum protocol and i think that that's a super positive positive step it's opt-in right yeah part of part of the important thing for us is it's like people were throwing out dow ideas for managing the funds and it's like at that time we had zero successful dows on ethereum yeah and so that that also means like as a community none of us know how to dow and like none of us at that time like really knew how to get coin and so part of this is like us learning how to be good stewards and like maybe one day if we're good enough at this then we can have an easier time bootstrapping trust you know after five five years of running bitcoin it'll be like oh yeah kevin that guy you know like maybe maybe they can spend the money well right and and to keep this conversation grounded like the reason why we're talking about this debate with public uh with block rewards funding going to ethereum public goods is the reason why um we all kind of rallied against it ultimately was that we were all very aware of the presence of moloch's power right we were all uh wary that you know having 10 of the block rewards which you know usually should in in a typical case goes to securing the ethereum blockchain is then uh you know allocated towards some people that we should trust right and so it's it's not unlike an inflation tax which bitcoiners are very you know uh they rally against the the inflation tax to you know the nth degree but then when we have this you know inflation uh or you know block rewards funding that goes to some trusted individuals well then we kind of start to uh grow into the same problem of the nation state where like there are taxes on the the constituency of a nation-state and then there's politics as to what we should do with those taxes yeah and the core devs become like the government employees that you can't fire right exactly yeah and and so it kind of devolves what ethereum could be into what a system closer to what we already have right and the whole point of ethereum is to be this like politically free neutral coordination layer and and and that's where i kind of see the power of of git coin where we can still maybe at the end of the day git coin still receives a comparable amount of value over time but the difference of it being a coercive tax with politics involved versus funding by by the many in a market in a free market way i think is is why uh ethereum is going to uh succeed versus a an ethereum with a 10 tax wouldn't i mean i i think that we should note here that like we pay the miners to secure the network right we're inflating the currency with attacks now but the difference between what we do with the miners and what software developers do is that there is proof of work for securing the ethereum network and i can prove that i secured the ethereum network with software development i don't know if the pr i submitted this morning is going to pass travis i don't know if it's going to get deployed into production and when it gets into deployed in production i don't know if anyone's going to give a crap and so there's is no proof of work for something as abstract as software development or community engagement there's tons of different public goods and so really what you need to do is create some sort of verifiability that that's that this is something that people actually care about and then you can start to avoid avoid capture um and i think the elegant thing about quadratic funding we don't have to go into quadratic funding on this call you should listen to the last bankless podcast about about quadratic funding is that you can sort of prove that people actually care about specific items of work because they're donating their own money to to that to that work and and so i think that it's all about creating verifiable ways of proving that public goods are actually valuable to a broad set of people as opposed to um you know the oligarchy problem so um i just i just think that like david if we're gonna talk about the inflation and taxation we should just note that like the miners are already like we're already paying we're already paying for the security of the network which is a public good in itself yeah there's this term like that vitalik um used in a post earlier this year called credible neutrality and i think that speaks to what you're talking about kevin right the difference with the sort of the minor payment through block rewards is it's credibly neutral like like everyone knows the rules and uh we know what the distribution's going to be like and there's no perception of unfairness right whereas it gets very squishy when you're you know funding a a dow that allocates to to various parties based on um deliverables that are very hard to quantify right exactly and and i think that like it's important that we figure out how to solve these problems if we're going to slay molech you know just take it back to the episode title uh molecules coordination failure and i think this is where the technology we should know where our predecessors failed uh if we're going to move forward in in creating this sword that can that can slay molok absolutely and i think when we compare what git coin is which is this wing or arm of ethereum that attempts to fund public goods and every time it's successful it's it's uh you know killing moloch by the death of a thousand cuts but versus its predecessor which is you know taxes and which are coercive which a lot of people get unhappy about and then there's the politics around where the taxes go which is its own mess as we've seen during the the times of funny printer go burr and so i kind of want to turn the conversation to why why are we optimistic that ethereum as a coordination layer is more equipped to slay moloch like what about ethereum allows us to uh you know have a have a better chance at slaying this god of you know coordination failure two things uh one of the interesting things about america is that it originally also didn't have any sort of central government and and taxes uh and they they managed to win the revolutionary war without any of that but in the aftermath uh several notable like founding fathers felt it prudent that they create uh a strong central government that was able to tax and uh hold like have troops uh and that served to defend them against the invasion uh and future wars with england um so it's it's actually up in the air in my mind about whether ethereum eventually adopts some sort of like inflationary dev uh issuance and it it'll ultimately be determined by like market reality and competitive forces like the willingness to uh the inclination not to have any inflationary dev funding is a product of not having survival pressure but if ethereum finds itself under attack uh or is likely to be out competed by you know something like polka dot which has you know dev issuance built in from the get-go uh and is you know under like should we should bet that it's gonna have a large treasury then like we'll have to think about that it's like do we want the ethereum that uh doesn't have enough money to pay for the things that are going to give polka dot an advantage for example or do we want the ethereum that's going to compete and it might be an advantage to ethereum to not have that uh dev issuance because it can potentially move faster and get you know more social scalability from not having the uh the politics around deciding that but it also could you know work to its disadvantage if the the money ends up being spent on useful things that then uh ethereum can't do um so the yeah that that's the first point um the second point is like why ethereum as a coordination platform and it's to me because you can build these amazing structures that last forever and iterate on them for very cheap and run all sorts of experiments and decentralize governance uh and do it and do it quickly and so like in my case you know uh we launched molok dao as the non-profit right and then that raised a couple million dollars uh gave out you know half a million dollars in grants over the last couple years and then more recently this february uh we launched uh molok dao version 2 which powers the lao and venture dao and both of those are investment clubs that have portfolios of tokens and are essentially on-chain uh organizations where they are both uh i think uh delaware either llc's or c-corps i think llc's but they both defer the llc both uh of both defers to the code uh and it says that you know whatever the code says that you have is what you have and that is interesting because what it means is that instead of taking these sort of templates of coordination structures like you know llc c-corp uh whatever like we can actually program our own and so the design space is vast and that's that's only like one aspect that's like coordination infra itself that's that's defining rules of organizations which now we can do in code instead of in in legalese as a much more advanced jurisdictional stack to play with um but the but you know that's only part of the story because like things like maker dow dye uh any any of these new money systems things like rye uh these are all also coordination tools and they're all tools for builders who want to uh work together to build this sort of decentralized finance ecosystem and the bet for ethereum is betting that you know the group of people who get off on building coordination tools are the group of people that will eventually define what coordination looks like in the 21st century yeah so why is ethereum going to help solve this problem why is it different this time i mean i think it's it's important to note that like in the moloch sort of stories malik is an eternal beast coordination failure is like a feature of the universe and i think that it can it like maybe our best our best bet is to is to set malloc back a hundred years for the next epoch of humanity and but that's still a noble goal you know like i have i have kids i would like for them to live in a world with clean air and clean water and free from the influence of moloch um and what gives me hope that we're going to do that with ethereum is as i said on the top a transparent economic substrate where the rules can't change on you so it's got immutability it's got transparency but it also is super accessible so anyone with an internet connection now has access to this programmable internet of money and to me that's really exciting because it means that anyone the poor in the many can run economic experiments and be able to trust each other not just the rich and the few which is the financial system that we inherited from the boomers so i'm really hopeful that people will build more experience experiences on ethereum that help solve coordination problems because of its features of being transparent immutable and and super accessible and i think that that's going to be the reason why it's going to set us forward in in helping to solve these coordination problems so kevin how do we go from you know this internet persistently available smart contract platform with immutability to clean air and clean water like how do we connect those dots i think we pump more hackers into the space we enable them with the tools you know we we sell pickaxes to the to the gold miners we bring more developers in we launch a thousand we let a thousand experiments blossom in this market cycle and we pick the best ones and we pump money into them so i mean one of the things that we're doing with git coin is that you know we're famous for i guess bitcoin grants now and that's an early in in instance of quadratic funding but we're not stopping there and we're also realizing that we can't do it all ourselves so actually at week two of october which i guess it's october 1st right now we're going to be launching a hackathon with radical exchange it's going to be the the quadratic all the things hackathon and we're going to be giving talks on quadratic funding quadratic voting and other public goods funding mechanisms and just trying to enable as many developers as we can to create new experiments because our mission is open source and it's a big enough problem to solve open source sustainability i think that there's a ton of other coordination problems that we need to start making making headway headway into and and and and i want to note here real quick that we've proven that quadratic funding can go outside of just the just the ethereum space so um we actually when coronavirus hit we ran a quadratic funding experiment in in downtown boulder called downtown stimulus and we raised about 40 k for six downtown businesses that were really struggling from the coronavirus by employing quadratic funding on main street with with credit cards so that's an instance in which an idea took root in the ethereum space but then went mainstream because it was able to test itself and prove itself in ethereum but then make the jump to an early adopter sort of more mainstream audience so i think it's about prototyping as many ideas as possible and probably killing the ones that don't work and then doubling down on the ones that do work and bringing them to more of a mainstream audience is is sort of i think the order of operations in order to build an information age institution for funding public goods when we had van spencer on the podcast to talk about like the bowl case for defy he he he expressed his thesis that d5 the reason why defy will be incredibly powerful is because it is a developer's sandbox for finance which is not something the world has ever have had before ever there is no experimental layer for financial products except for what we now know as ethereum the cost of innovation and the cost of iteration right is just so low that any any individual from any corner of the world can start to build something on ethereum and maybe that thing that they built turns into something that can start to do something good for the public right and we saw that we saw this with uniswap right like uniswap isn't funding public goods but it itself is a self-funding public good and we can start from there and build out and as a result of this low cost of of innovation and progress we have yams and yams just took the governance module from compound rebasing from ample fourth the synthetic staking contract uh the wire and treasury and then it created yams it didn't really do anything else other than to stitch those things together and now yams is adding one percent of its rebase to get coin grants funding the git coin system right and so i i think what gives me optimism is that you know there's the the rate of development and progress in ethereum is i think's going to be so far beyond anything we've ever seen before and when we couple this with the fact that well i believe that the average individual is good right like 97 of the people when they wake up in the morning they they need to take care of themselves and then anything after that they just do good things right and and maybe they what we ascribe as good is up to our own uh perceptions but very few people wake up in the morning and like looked out to the world and say like how can i you know how can i commit evil right how can i do bad no one wakes up and thinks that so understanding that the average person is a good person and they have good intentions and then we combine that with a governance sandbox layer that is ethereum which can iterate and improve faster than we've ever seen before that's why i think ethereum can can be the thing that that kills moloch by the death of a thousand experiments yeah i think the thing that really really excites me is that i see this at east denver at youth global events and get coin hackathons that hackers can walk in the door and do a git clone on a git repository on a piece of software that in the old world would have cost 50 million dollars and 100 developers to make over the course of three years and so it's really exciting to just like have open source software and because of this attribute of composability just be able to copy like compound and inhabit at the start of a weekend when when you're hacking something and so there's there's this network effect of ethereum where there's all these different primitives whether they're compound uniswap uh you know quadratic funding things like that where you can just like your bags are packed every time you go to a hackathon and you can just mix and match them these money legos together and one of the money legos that i know that david you're really excited about so hope it's okay if i turn the conversation there for a second is this idea of minor extracted value this idea that in the mempool you can auction off the rights to order transactions in the ethereum network and that can be worth multi-million millions of dollars and we could send you could use that money to to fund public goods and so i know that there's a couple groups out there that are working on mev optimism is the one that i'm most optimistic pun intended about and and so it's it's this composability and this addition of this composable element of minor extracted value that i think is is really exciting to me about how we're going to slay molok so this conversation so far has been um about of course slaying molech and a lot of the examples we've used have been more economic examples financial examples even the examples you gave the mean uh about kind of the the the lao and moloch dal the these have a parallel in the nation state right like an llc or like a capital pool would be sort of like a like a bank account but when people think about like at least our generation we think about the big molec problems facing us in the next you know 50 to 75 years these are big things these are things like nuclear proliferation right that's still a problem hasn't gone away uh things like global warming um like all sorts of massive macro challenges that our generations uh are are going to face in the future does ethereum have a solution for them is like is there a coordination answer in something like ethereum to those big macro problems that literally are possible extinction events for for humanity let me start with you and me uh that's a great question um my instinctive answer is well there's only one way to find out um i i think it's like important to not discount uh leadership uh in this regard so like i remember when i was getting ready to launch malikdow a lot of people were like you know you could use this for all sorts of things like non-profits and ngos and da-da-da and it's like yes uh then you know they're like well do you want to make a platform for doing lots of things and it's like no i want to do one thing and i want to make it work so that we can show people how to do it uh and i think i think ethereum will solve or provide solutions to many of these like bigger problems but it's going to look small uh when it starts um so just like being able to make a credible commitment to something in the future for example if i'm like i'm gonna put down you know a hundred thousand dollars and if i fail to you know work out at least twice a month for or twice a week for the next like you know month or whatever i'm gonna burn it uh and i'm gonna set that up with an oracle right like that might be a gimmick in order to get me to like move my ass however uh you could imagine that there's like a un created oracle that like determines you know the outcome of you know china or some major countries like we will not proliferate and if you catch us then we're gonna burn all of this money right here right and and implement the lock in such a way that it doesn't rely on any sort of bank or institution uh but it relies on the entire network to enforce and like that is an interesting type of thing um same with like defense pacts right like when you start like as a as an individual you probably don't think too often about like you know i will come to your aid if you are under attack uh by an aggressor but like that's how lots of these defense packs are structured and it'd be interesting to see like even you know what like a peer-to-peer version of that looks like uh what what is a big like group of people who all individually decide to like protect each other even you know that that that might be like a gimmicky thing like oh look it's a gang or something but then like scaled up that's like oh that's actually like countries alliances uh are recorded and you know ingrained in in this chain so that everybody can see um and and so like you know it seems crazy to think about that kind of thing now but like somebody you know has to do it like we have to conceive and then experiment and do these sort of small scale contain things so that like when the time comes for any of that to happen we're not just like you know uh still at square one we've like oh yes we've tried this we've you know run a bunch of smaller scale things and like here are the results and here's what we learned uh to get people to be more comfortable right like for example boulder was never going to be the first user of git coin you know they need to see get coin working uh in order to then feel comfortable trying something like that themselves yeah that's a good point like some of the stuff that you're saying might sound sort of uh incredible to people like you know even far-fetched of entire countries putting peace treaties and that sort of thing on ethereum but the difference is many of the other coordination mechanisms available to humanity are all like based in nation states right so like you know law and order of a particular uh nation state the u.s the banking system of a nation-state but something like ethereum something like bitcoin these are like extra national protocols these are not controlled by a singular nation-state so maybe some of those ideas are not so far-fetched but i guess same question to you kevin what do you think these these big macro problems do you think they could be solved by ethereum's coordination mechanisms i hope so i think that the financial substrate of the world is is definitely one of the primary use cases of of ethereum but you're already sort of seeing these you're already sort of seeing groups of corporations that don't maybe necessarily trust each other putting supply chains onto the blockchain and just using the fact that you've got a cryptographic proof that product x had y state at z time i think is is an interesting primitive like we're basically using the ledger for a non-financial reason and so you could see how that would be scaled towards like well it sounds outlandish to say but something as as important as as a nuclear non-polar pluriferation uh packed and you know it's hard to see in a world that's becoming more nationalist than globalist right now how we get to work where people want to coordinate and actually do that but at least the technology is becoming available to do it so i don't know i wrestle with this problem a lot and i hope that we can solve it but in ethereum seems like the best bet but the honest answer ryan is that i'm not really sure so ryan just asked the question how does ethereum solve climate change and nuclear proliferation and maybe the the listener is you know skeptical of like well ethereum's never going to do that like that's that's crazy i'm gonna i'm gonna double down on something even more crazy than that um there's this thing called the fermi paradox where and the fermi paradox is using the drake equation and the drake equation is collecting data about the surrounding solar systems and planets and possible possible earth-like planets that we probably probabilistically know exist from the data that we have from looking at our universe right and so according to the drake equation there should be a pretty decent probability of earth-like planets that can support life uh in our realm and not only enough of these planets but there should be enough of these types of planets that probabilistically there should be life and on at least a few of these so basically what you get out of the drake equation is that it's probably pretty likely that there's life at least according to the math that we can deduce and so the the fermi paradox comes from the fact that like well knowing that there is a the a large possibility of earth-like planets in our relative uh part of the universe why haven't we seen any aliens right and that's that's an interesting paradox like if there are so many uh planets that could support life why don't we see other why don't we see life out there and out of the fermi paradox is birth the great filter theory which uh the great filter theory says that at some point there are these filters that stops life from coming about right like maybe life is really hard to uh to birth in the first place and so maybe humanity's actually already passed that filter maybe the filter is ahead of us and we're yet to run into it and maybe that filter is uh you know at some point the the inhabitants of the planet consume all the all the energy of that planet and creates global warming and dies from global warming i contend that the great filter is just an inevitable set of filters over and over and over again that is moloch instantiated in some particular different way right or where moloch is the reason why we haven't seen aliens because if we understand game theory you know game the prisoner's dilemma is something that should be found in every single corner of the universe right and so maybe we don't see other aliens because they also have succumb to moloch maybe we don't see other aliens because they weren't able to coordinate maybe they didn't invent ethereum maybe they didn't invent you know distributed computational uh blockchain coordination layers is this is this too crazy or do you guys think about this too it's very real that everybody else including us and other timelines like blow ourselves up before we get to any sort of inter-galactic space travel we've we've probably we've probably almost ended our own species a couple times uh there's no guarantee that we'll make it so yeah it seems seems real to me yeah i would agree i think that you know it's it's really amazing to kind of learn about the great filter and to to think about you know what is it going to take for humanity to proliferate in the 21st 22nd and 23rd century to think on a century time scale instead of a daily time scale and you know we are kind of on spaceship earth and we we really get one shot at at least until we it sounds like spreading to mars into other planets would be pretty hellish from what i've read about it but it seems like it's achievable until we do that we're kind of like all in on on planet earth and and there are these global problems that are developing around i would say you know the ones that i worry about with respect to the great filter are climate change uh nuclear war fake news um the poisoning of our information environment and um and yeah i mean i would i would agree with i mean and with you david that you know there's alternate timelines where we've probably already blown ourselves up and there's probably timelines where we don't make it but i do think that there's statistically a timeline in which we do make it and and i think that when i when i when i think about what we're doing with the ethereum space and with public goods it's about it's about pushing us towards the timeline where humanity does make it i don't care how many lambos you have in a world in which there's nuclear war or really bad climate change you can't enjoy your private goods without your public goods and it's about sort of reminding people of the plurality of those values and that that we're all in this together to some extent and and that's that's hopefully how we'll survive and thrive into the 23rd century i mean if we do make it it will be because we somehow uh got a rain on moloch and like it got past all of these coordination failures that like exist like land mines basically in our world today um so i i guess what i mean what does that look like um if if we are able to circumvent these these massive problems um what's it going to take is it going to take just some technology like ethereum or like what do we as individuals how do we play a role in the development or support of slaying malloc how do we become moloch slayers ourselves just think about what you're willing to sacrifice to get what you want uh you you sort of you know uh i think kevin said this earlier like we we can slay molok but malik is sort of this like universal you know deity right malik isn't going anywhere malick just simply rewards those who are willing to sacrifice something for some coordination advantage and uh it ends up that like you know today uh you can promote like ethereum is sort of a coordination platform and in that sense it is a way of uh like worshiping molok right it's it's it's it's both uh at the same time we need to like improve our own ability to coordinate by increasing our power increasing our technology um but at the same time like know that the end game is out coordinating everybody who wants to shut this down uh and that's like the thing to to keep in mind i mean you've said that a couple times like you have to be willing to sacrifice something to moloch what do you mean by that like so what what do i have to sacrifice in order to solve global warming like your us citizenship you know like there are different there are different things like it maybe it's the case that uh you know every government in the world goes quietly right like if i had my way uh if i was the dictator of the earth which you know wouldn't be good for anybody um i i would like take all the money uh for the guns and bombs and planes uh and try to give it to the people making space rockets and medicine and like you know stop bailing out cruise lines and start investing in masks right uh the problem is that like i can't get there uh and and then it's it's a question of like uh if i had the power to achieve that maybe i could but like i would have to i don't know murder a thousand people or something right uh and and so really it's like uh if i have the power and i'm not willing to murder the thousand people to claim it then like you know i'm not willing to do what is necessary in order to win and it's it's not always about murdering people right it's also like you know uh work really hard every day uh like um stuff like that right and and and so sacrifice comes in in all the ways but like that's like you might there might be a time where we're like okay uh the u.s has you know declared war on on this technology or like you know major countries have declared war on this technology like how do we respond right and so then it's a question of like how much do you value uh what we are building right like what are you prepared to lose and if the group that you know values this stuff highly is prepared to respond and overcome then like it'll work um so so just give an example of something that's like uh would require some amount of sacrifice because it would be extra legal uh but could be a useful like coordination thing in order to help society depending on who you ask um like if you ask me uh every other country except the us did the mask thing right right um everybody enforced lockdown or you know got masks everywhere everybody wore them there wasn't a whole lot of talk and they've been clubbing in in uh taiwan for months right so uh the like the problem in the us is that we all couldn't coordinate to like wear masks for 10 weeks straight in order to beat this thing um and so like one design for a thing that i thought of on ethereum let's call it mask dao would be to identify and dox and shame uh the non-maskers and it would have three phases the first phase is you take a picture of somebody who is not wearing a mask in a public place where they are you know clearly putting somebody else at risk it's not like on the beach by themselves uh then you tag them so like you you either uh put their you know personal information name or address or you know this is the extra legal part because you got to like follow them home or something image search i don't recommend this i'm just saying this will design for a thing so uh then you know they have their name and then it sort of goes to some you know dao committee uh they vote they say yes this person was was being bad and so then then they get uh shame they get everybody who is uh you know confirmed to be like an anti-massacre is then put on a wall of shame a big website you can search for people and see if they're on this list and the idea is like this is you know the reason the u.s economy cannot open is because of these individuals who like can't be you know bothered to to wear masks um and like we as all the rest of the people want to remember who who did it uh so that we can we can you know shame them and the only way you get your name off of the wall of shame is you like pay a hundred dollar bounty to the mask dow uh and then they'll they'll remove you and use the funds for more uh anti-mask uh you know and so forth um and and and so this is the type of thing that's like you know do i even want to do this because like i'm going to open pandora's box like this is going to be used for all sorts of other things next thing comes out is like anybody who you know didn't go to a blm uh protest is like shamed right uh white silence is violent so it's like you know the technology behind this in the abstract is like you can scale up shaming as a social structure um where where like you know today the way you do it now is like you just tweet the picture and like hope everybody else figures it out this would be like you know institutionalized shame uh and also also self-propagating right because the fines people pay basically you go back to the dow yeah exactly it's like you know like you could unleash a plague of something like this um and and like that kind of thing scares me uh because i i'm not particularly into into shame but like at the same time uh like i i can see that and sort of marvel at the power that something like that could have uh because you know that that's the type of thing that you know could make a difference in like if we were compelled like people in ethereum like could start stuff like that and those are like coordination infrastructure it's ultimately games uh that compel behavior i think one interesting thing you touched on there i mean is that public health is a public good and i don't know if a lot of us i think we all took it for granted before before covid um i i think that the game that you that you sort of designed there is is super interesting um and i want to put it in the framework of of ryan asked the question of how do how do we think about slaying molok in our everyday life and there's this framework that i discovered from yancey strickler the founder of kickstarter he's a proponent of this thing called bentoism and and basically the idea here is that most people are making decisions for optimizing for now me for what's good for me right now so if i'm not wearing a mask then i'm doing it because it's it's inconvenient um for now me to wear a mask but really people should be thinking about a bento box of incentives um i should also be thinking about future me when i'm not wearing a mask and the fact that future me is gonna be stuck in bed for a month uh with coronavirus if i if i don't wear a mask i should be thinking about now us which is the risk that my decisions spread to other people and then also future us so you can picture sort of like a bento box of different incentives now me future me now us and future us and what i think is elegant about the dow that that uh that amin designed right there is that it arbitrages the incentives it creates a coordination mechanism through which now me and future future future me now us and future us can all be coordinated towards a specific outcome and i agree that there's problematic there's there's problems there if the dow gets too much power if the dow is optimizing for a future or a value set that that people don't care about but just a practical tip for the listeners bentoism is a really great way to think about decisions every day that you make and and how you can slay molech a little bit a little bit every day one just thought on this is um given what you're just both of you just talking about i i think there was a time we thought that ethereum scalability was limited by transactions per second or all of these other things and to some extent it is but in another extent it's it's more limited by the creative mechanisms that mechanism builders and game builders as you guys were saying actually are able to bring to ethereum i remember in in 2018 there was a time where we thought like oh dexes will never work on ethereum unless it has i don't know 500 transactions per second right um that's what like xerox taught us and all of the early order book exchanges and here comes a better mechanism in uniswap with an automated market maker right it just kind of solves the problem and scales without having to have a large number of transactions per second why just a better mechanism it does seem like that is what we need we need builders of coordination mechanisms to slay moloch on ethereum i mean i really like the the topic of kovid and its valence to moloch because it's just such a great example of our abilities our human ability of lack of coordination right and to me what what the covid uh pandemic has really illustrated is that you know we often forget this but humanity is just like seven degrees of separation away from each other right like we are all seven degrees of separation between between us and you know the the patient zero in wuhan china right uh and and so it's a stark reminder of how close we all are as a species right and and how important it is for us to be able to coordinate in times of crisis and as we've as we've marched through the 2020 year it's been marked by all these different issues but they all seem to be coordination failures that they're at their core right like the united states government failed to really coordinate the the control of the pandemic and you know even the world at large didn't really do such a great job with controlling the pandemic and that's how the pandemic got out and we also have the this crisis of fake news and tribalism largely uh created out of the incentives of facebook and silicon valley's social media algorithms which are polarizing our country into into two very opposite ends of the spectrum where in times where we needed coordination our nation is now the most polarized and uncoordinated it's ever been and i i think the the if we call 2020 a year of crisis because it's you know got seven different mini crisis in it it's really just one single event of poor coordination and i think that's why i'm so interested in creating this episode with you guys and why i'm so thankful with you guys coming on and talking about moloch is because really the the substrate of it all is can we figure out how to coordinate humanity how do we coordinate so we can solve these problems whatever problems arise and so amin and kevin thank you for coming on the banquo's pod and helping us slay moloch together yep thanks for having me thanks for having us i hope we can pull it off um just just add that uh you're absolutely right and it's uh like ethereum is actually at its inflection point right now um where we are seeing this sort of exponential growth in the capacity of ethereum devs to build novel novel systems and that comes from this composability network effect where we've built all these lego pieces like the the cost of building a novel system on ethereum drops 10 times every year if you look at something like maker dow it took them like two years to build single collateral die because they had to have you know an auction mechanism uh a bunch of market mechanisms like a governance system and if you look at uh and none of those were external dependencies uh but if you look at you know the new systems coming online today it's a lot of uh modules that use other project systems like you were saying you know they use compounds governance and synthetic staking stuff like that and so the cost drops and the possibilities expand so we're actually only getting started um this is this is just the beginning uh the next five years is going to probably like the next year we'll have as much as the entire you know time thus far and then the year after that we'll have as much as the entire time up till that point uh so i'm i'm you know super optimistic on on building on eath and evm in general david you when you were sharing the idea for this podcast with me talked about this idea of how do we create this sword this magic sword that can slay the demon moloch and i kind of like i mean as a video game or someone who played zelda a lot as a kid it's like the idea of like getting the master sword and and i really feel like we're at this point in ethereum's history where we can start to pull that sword from the stone like it's actually actually a possible thing that that we have that we have the tools and we have the momentum the meme is there the technology is there and so i'm really excited to see what happens in the next in the next market cycle and i'm i'm hopeful that a lot of people will become economically better off and move into a new better economic system from out of this which is private good but i i just remind people that you you can't have private good without public good your lambo is not worth anything if the sky is on fire and if you're in california or colorado right now the sky is on fire uh and i want to breathe clean air again and and along with private good comes public good and i and i really hope that we're on track to to solve some of these civilization scale problems because the world is literally on the line when when we're when we're working on this so excited to be to be trying to slay molok with all of you and i'm looking forward to the episode that we do in a couple years in which we uh see whether or not we pulled it off and and we followed the journey fantastic guys thanks again ethereum as the sword that slays moloch we are making progress amin kevin thanks for joining us for our listeners actions and resources so uh meditations on moloch is the blog that sort of started it all blog post it's a 25 minute read uh but it is well worth the read you can find that in the show notes um second thing is read david's recent piece slayer of moloch that is on the bankless newsletter we'll include a link as well and if you haven't already get involved in what kevin is doing with git coin uh the grants um this funding round is is just ending tomorrow as i talk about this but you can give at any time and there are some interesting events coming up with radical exchange that will include in the show notes as well um also check out the latest on what moloch dao is doing it's a dow that spawned probably dozens of other dows and maybe hundreds and thousands into the future so a lot going on a lot of follow-ups here as always risks and disclaimers everything we talked about is of course risky if you choose to deploy put your capital on ethereum that's risky crypto is risky so is defy this is not financial advice you could lose what you put in but moloch might eat it this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad that you're with us slaying moloch thanks a lot [Music]
