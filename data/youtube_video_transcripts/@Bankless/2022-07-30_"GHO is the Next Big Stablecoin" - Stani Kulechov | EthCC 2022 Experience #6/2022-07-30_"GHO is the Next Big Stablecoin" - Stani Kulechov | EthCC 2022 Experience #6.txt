welcome back bank of this nation to the east cc experience we are almost done in this series of episodes on this particular episode we are talking with stani from ave uh who is also pioneering the world of the web 3 social media revolution starting's always such a tree i always see him whenever i'm going into that neck of the woods the europe london france side of things he's always around there and he's such a treat in addition to of course talking about ave we also talk about the ghost stable coin brand new decentralized stable coin out of ave but also just get a temp check of the app layer of ethereum and the just the vibes around the crypto space so i'm quite sure you're going to enjoy this conversation with stani from ave for these episodes we would usually do our pre-recorded ads but since they're so short we're doing a speedrun of these ads and so here that is one of the big themes of each cc week was the launch of the zk evm three different teams all launched their test net and while everyone is trying to claim who was first we can confidently say that zk sync has been focused on the zk evm for the longest the golden end game of the zk evm has been the vision of zk sync since the beginning and during each cc week they launched their 100 days to main net plan which is now already down to 93 days so if you're gonna join the zk evm wars make sure you post about it on lens the first decentralized social networking graph in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto but on lens we say not your keys not your content own your own social media handle choose your own algorithm and mint your profile using the secret code word in the show notes and something that's likely going to be talked about on lens is of course the ethereum merge and the merge is why you should be staking your eth with rocketpool it's a decentralized ethereum validator network where you deposit eth and get your reth in return and then you can take that r eth into d5 and if you run a node you can let other people deposit their ether into your node and you earn 15 of their staking commission as payment for your node operating services and then maybe you want to take your r eth over to arbitrary for all of your d5 things arbitrary is where you have to be with over 35 000 contracts deployed and one million unique addresses arbitrary is leading the way into the age of roll ups you know how i know those numbers because i watched arbitrary's talk at ecc which you should definitely also watch but not before you're done watching this video first but in order to get your money over to arbitrum so you can buy your res natively then you should use juno because juno is the fastest bridge from your checking account to an ethereum layer two a checking account to an ethereum layer two is absolutely crazy and it just takes minutes juno is your cryptochecking account for the crypto era but when you're doing all of these things make sure that it's on a privacyfirst browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web 3 wallet and it puts the user first the web 3 way and so i hope you use all of these sponsors on your quest for going bank lists and now i bring you stani from ave hey sony how's it going man very good dave thanks for coming yeah where are we we're in paris for etc yeah now are you excited about that i am super excited yeah it's a bear market a lot of people and full of builders full of builders it's of course both a build market and a bear market at the same time but before we go into what we're doing in the build market i want to kind of recap with you the bull market what are like the big lessons that you learned in the 2021 bull market um well bull markets are nice because like they get a lot of traction uh in the sense that we have more and more audience and visibility into the space but i think some some things we learn uh quite heavily is that uh during bull market there's a lot of um things happening at the same time uh and we call it kind of like a noise and essentially a lot of projects that come out uh we have we spend less time on actually looking into the fundamentals and understanding how it actually um how the how the protocol or product affects the ecosystem what are the fundamentals and also validate those ideas and i think that's something that always gets like less attention during a bull market and i think that's what we learned recently that like we despite of the market conditions like we need to build very sound systems especially in decentralized finance so let's go through some of the things that we know are valid things that maybe we didn't really totally get right in the bull market but we know that they're going to stick around so like nfts for the most part like there are definitely some parts of nfts that like are definitely going to stick a lot of them kind of drifted apart yeah and there there's like other parts without there's there's the whole like deep 2.0 part of the bull market and what are the things in the bull market that uh we experimented with that we need to iterate on in the bear market that we know are going to be things in the future well i think it's quite a lot of uh also relates to the governance so we we have uh very interesting uh i would say like d5 communities now forming and governing some of the major uh protocols so so the the governance game is still going on so i think that's not over yet so we will see a lot of innovation and iteration there in terms of these interest finance i think we um as its device open ecosystem we see a lot of innovation coming in um and the kind of like a d500 movement was was uh interesting idea of like getting more innovation uh but a lot of these ideas should be kind of like validated more uh within the community before they're actually accessible for a wider wi-fi uh community so i think the the um uh the the part that we uh did really uh well also is that we saw more builders coming in and trying to solve different kinds of uh things you know we're working on uh under collateral sloanes for example we uh we see a lot of things being built already the v5 primitives that exist might be let's say the rv protocol or some other protocol and the compassibility and i think one important thing is that many of the new users that are coming into this space they are actually also onboarding two um these layer twos that are actually um enable lower cross course cost transactioning uh but are still inheriting the security from ethereum and i think that's gonna be like the path where we have to also focus upon what would you say because you're a veteran of the 2018 to 2020 bear market how would you say this bear market feels different i think uh in the previous bear market um there was a lot of ideas and um i would say like team is excited to build new things a lot of things that were good on the paper weren't actually good in the execution or even uh valued at well and didn't have necessarily a product or protocol market fit now in the current situation we actually built a lot of things during the bear market so we built a very extensive decentralized finance ecosystem there are protocols that are very resilient battle tested and they work uh very well so we have like a very good infrastructure we have a better oracle infrastructure at the moment we have a lot of communities dows that are governing different protocols for example and uh most importantly some of these protocols are earning treasury so they have actually cash flow to allocate to different grants and and further development of that particular ecosystem so we actually have sustainability now so i think a lot of things has been built um so there is value and markets usually don't correlate the value or the culture that we are uh building in the space and so when we put all of these pieces together in this current bear market like we're there's the idea that we're not just going to like magically wait out this bear market we need to build our way out of this bear market so when we take that frame of mind what do we need to get done in this bear market to turn this into another bull market like what do we need to build i think we we have built very exciting uh like a financial ecosystem within webtree and and i think we're going to see more and more innovation so we're going to see more smarter solutions um build as well i'm personally also excited about the the non-financial use cases and this is something that also vitalik has been talking about in the space and and and what it allows is that we can actually onboard more people into the uh web3 ecosystem without thinking of the financial path because as long as you have to actually buy uh certain assets to participate in governance or uh pay for transaction fees um you always buy yourself into the uh ecosystem but if you can actually create a path where maybe your first thing that um then your first interaction with a blockchain is maybe minting a uh decentralized social media profile and following other profiles in the space or um you know participating in communities without actually having that financial part we we unlock the the blockchain uh to masses in a way where they don't have to think about finance and less speculation will happen as well in my opinion because uh you think about blockchain as utility so that was a definitely a big theme in this last bull market where you would buy your way into a dow and you would have like access to the dow tokens or you would buy your your monkey picture jpeg and all of a sudden you're part of that community but what you're saying is that if we're going to get out of this bear market we need to figure out ways to reach out to people that don't require capital that don't require money so that they can be onboarded onto this into this ecosystem because that the whole like money aspect uh well it definitely triggered the whole mania of 2021 it also like turned a lot of people outside of crypto off because of how like financial it was so you're saying that during this this bear market 2022 bear market uh we're going to need to find ways to onboard people into our ecosystem that they don't have to buy their way in they still get to participate they still get to do like crypto fun things but it doesn't necessarily require capital to get on board is that what you're saying exactly and and the idea here is that you create an economy where um you might have financial protocols and use cases and a lot of those non-financial use cases and that way you get more people into the ecosystem and and and those users that are not are using are not using the financial uh protocols they will be the future users of them so essentially especially when they create this kind of like an on-chain footprint that could be used for example deciding for builders builders can build products where they can show that which applications or protocols you should actually use and what risk appetite might fit you based on your web 3 social footprint and i think that's very valuable because that brings more users into the uh defy ecosystem and empowers more people yeah and when we when it's free to onboard i would imagine the sheer numbers of people well more than 10x versus what it would be if like we had to have we had to charge to onboard right exactly so we'll be able to onboard so many more people and just like as a result of that so many more people will be proximate to like the defy apps and maybe maybe they go to like uniswap to go from euros to dollars rather than i don't know like their local bank perhaps yeah and i think that's a um interesting kind of like a vision because uh we already build an amazing uh financial infrastructure so now we have to just build those other parts and and those are the things that actually get people here as well because like not everyone might necessarily be super interested about um finance in general but everyone uses finance one way or another and being able already to be onboarded into the web3 ecosystem by let's say by by dallas that doesn't require you to actually buy yourself in by creating a let's say lens profile and posting on web3 social media or some other similar kind of like a use case um what we created is a uh ecosystem of of potential users and and essentially uh if you're already a website user and you're using those other parts naturally you will choose decentralized finance because obviously it has benefits and we saw with centralized finance like how important dfi is right certainly certainly uh so what are these non-financial use cases that are going to to bring people in do you have any uh thoughts as to which how what do these things look like i personally have few ideas i i definitely believe in the idea of um communicating with peers uh on on chain um in a way where you can retain data that's interesting um but free social is interesting uh music is is quite interesting there's a project called stem style which is focusing on actually uh onboarding creative integratives into the space and and essentially creating uh different kinds of bits and and and sounds and and music and and also have this kind of like a remix component there um so you have this this kind of like a content music composibility as well um but these are just examples like you can actually build like anything on chain and you don't need to actually use the whole own chain ecosystem even the infrastructure even if you are building something on layer 2 so you could essentially build a protocol that is unchained but actually the data is stored on ipfs rv or or or something else so there's sort of opportunities and how you actually build things so we're living in a very very good times for builders going a few years back it was so hard to even build uh on on ethereum for example because of the less of information available and the technology wasn't that right so this is like the golden times to build and so there when it comes to lens profile or lens protocol excuse me uh where you this is like your on-chain social graph i think this unlocks just like not only is is lens protocol like a single application but it's actually a platform for many other applications what's going on in the world of building on top of lens what kind of activity are you seeing there there's certain kind of activities so we've seen uh especially because we have done a lot of hackathons we've seen uh teams building very base layer for example we have lancer that is essentially a front end that shows all the content that is in in the lens protocol and you can essentially post follow comments uh a mirror mirror is kind of like a retweeting but essentially with monetization in mind so if you amplify someone else's content you essentially can get also uh mirroring fees from that creator um but but also we have lenstube which is some some something similar to youtube there are very base layer but we've seen interesting things like tea party which uh essentially uh uses soulbound tokens to reward on interactions that you have on the lens protocol which is very fascinating use case for salt band tokens and and the lens protocol stem styles stem cell is essentially building something where you actually have all those stems and music and sound as essentially nfts and posts in the lens protocol and focusing on the music audience and more and more of the applications we've seen being built they're focusing on actually uh one very important thing which is the experience layer because we if you want to win the web 3 social uh kind of like a game um and given that how big the web 2 social media companies are we actually need to build a better uh user experience and also we at ave we're uh with our lens team we're building a um our own uh application as well and kind of like showing how far you can take the uh experience for the users and what what kind of interesting things you can do with on-chain uh data as well and on chain profiles one thing that i've noticed being built and just is overall capturing a ton of attention in this space is like this data stack this decentralized data stack that is at the back end for so much of this technology so like lens protocol i think is a very surface area level where i think these are talking about nfts that are social graphs on polygon but there's also so many other aspects of this data stack you have things like r-weave which i believe lens tube puts all of the video data onto rwe for example and there's also like file point for example and there's also ceramic network and then there's just a bunch of like data stacks and the disco is at the also like the user interface for all of these things just you have any thoughts about this like coming data stack and really what can it unlock for the next next run of crypto that's one of my favorite things to think about because the lens protocol itself is agnostic how you store data so with lens protocol you can create a on-chain infrastructure so the protocol is modulized you can build modules for example how to follow other profiles and maybe to follow some profile you might need to have a membership into the for example bankless dao and have a specific nft then you could go over that part but then you have the other part which is the off chain part so you can with the protocol essentially decide where to store and i'm most excited about the middle layer which is being built so there is obviously there is a graph which is building a kind of like a decentralized data layer uh and the lens team built the lens api which is going to get decentralized in the future more but essentially was built to bootstrap the development on the lens protocol and it indexes all the data that you have on lens um and also kind of like a bit beyond that um and it makes it easier to interact with that data so essentially to build an application you don't need to uh be a victory builder you can use the traditional format of apis that you have used to and i think that that layer is going to build further because our goal is to open and create like an open algorithm platform where data engineers can come actually and create different kinds of ml algorithms and provide those different services to the users and and the applications can reflect which of those algorithms are useful for the users and it becomes like a distribution channel so if you build a module that has interesting logics the application might use it if you build an interesting algorithm uh which is transparent uh for example it might get traction on those application layers so it it unlocks this idea of like why we're actually stuck with one algorithm in in twitter for example or in tektek why we cannot open the systems to all of the users and let them basically decide with their feed or their choice what algorithms they want to use and which ones serve them the most and that's what the lens protocol middle layer is trying to solve and how important is this whole data stack towards the non-financial use case of crypto very important because uh with the victory footprint actually we can get different kinds of data in terms of like what's your interaction in the um ecosystem so we can see for example what might be the dallas you're super excited about uh what nfts you might be interested in collecting uh which which uh protocols you are using and and how you interact with the lens protocol and on top of that like the users can always uh choose that um how much they actually want to keep things private or or or what not so you have this kind of like a ecosystem of um value that can actually be used uh within the the uh uh data layers as well and we for example in in the uh onboarding phase now it's it's a closed beta uh the the protocol but we have been allowed listing different uh communities for example if you hold particular nft you can actually claim your lens profile if you have if you were a member of the bank list dow you can actually also claim your profile and and went one community at a time based on their own chain data and then there's a component of of chain data as well so we uh data is a spectrum and identity is a spectrum and part of it is on chain and off chain and being able to use all of that uh through the api it's very valuable uh for the users i know we've been we've been talking a lot about the non-financial use cases of crypto but i want to also make sure we talk about uh this brand new stable coin out of ave uh can you give us like a speed run of tldr of this new stablecoin definitely so the boy the the way the ave protocol and the other markets work is that you simply supply different kinds of collaterals into the other protocol for example uh eats and then you're earning interest on that it and typically when you need liquidity you usually borrow one of the stable coins that the ave protocol has so the market is very diverse there is a lot of optionality uh so what we're doing is essentially um we're adding a ability to mint a stable coin which is the go and meaning that it's going to be the first stable coin which is over collateralized um but also at the same time you can earn yield uh on your collaterals that you're supplying into the other protocol and you don't need to basically create a separate uh world for each and every single asset but you can use your whole portfolio to get the borrowing power and an indigo stable coin and if you are the holder of sdk ave which is basically staked ave and you are backstopping the risk of the protocol you can mint it as as a discount so essentially it's a way of of um getting liquidity from other more and brings more optionality and the other stable coins that are listed in the protocol they're not disappearing anywhere uh it just makes the whole market more diverse and it's part of our kind of like a bigger vision where we want to see that stable coin uh going into uh l2s uh for example you should be able to um supply and borrow the stable point also in let's say optimism and arbitrary and we believe that uh we have we have a lot of potential for stable coins to become the the actual internet money uh but also solving payment problems in real life so for example today argentina is a good example where you have inflation that is doubling all the time and disable coin users usage is increasing beyond that but essentially most of the transactions between crypto users are happening in centralized exchanges so from one binance account to another um and we want to change that we want to ensure that these transactions can happen actually on layer 2 and we want to see more uh developers building payments applications on top so we want to kind of like push a bit forward the organic adoption of stable coins uh beyond the current like the ecosystem well stani with the destruction of c5 lenders and the blowing up of ust uh and also just like the very negative um uh like uh attitude that outside crypto outsiders have towards crypto because of the financial use cases what i see you doing is building out the social use cases of crypto the web3 social which is very much needed in the world of facebook and instagram uh building out brand new stable coins that are backed by tried and true protocols uh and also just kind of like changing the game when it comes to like d5 and social use cases so i'm super bullish on everything you're doing so thank you for contributing all of that to the space thank you so much for having me here and and giving the opportunity to talk to you cheers thank you [Music] you
