hello everyone today is article day i recently just put out this new article in the banquets newsletter titled a digital cultural revolution and uh it's something that uh just kind of it wrote it it felt like it wrote itself uh and i'm pretty happy i'm pretty happy about the way that it's landed and so we're going to read it today on the bankless youtube so here we go a digital cultural revolution the cryptocurrency revolution is typically viewed as a revolution in money and technology a crypto economic system promises in to usher in a new age of unbridled value transfer and value expression via the improvements in both scarce financial assets and technological mediums for leveraging these assets together technology and money compose much of what makes society society when these things change we change everything much of what defines a society is mediated by the technological tools that we have available to create cultural expression the cryptocurrency revolution is a revolution in money and technology but the legacy of crypto will instead be a renaissance in human culture summary this article is on the longer side so here is a roadmap and a tl dr the culture that is found in the world of crypto is unique and offers a strong tailwind towards the growth of this industry the vibra the vibrancy of cryptoculture offers a compelling environment to the younger generations who are struggling to find their place in the world the social institutions that are supposed to be vehicles of wealth generation are actually only generating wealth for the older generations that captured them younger generations are not benefiting from these institutions the institutions have rejected them so in turn they reject institutions this is creating a societal crisis that is causing younger generations to be pessimistic about their future and they are succumbing to massive compromises in their well-being compromises that their parents never had to make new social institutions are being constructed in the realm of crypto and these new social institutions are particularly suited to the needs and wants of younger generations nfts and tokens at large offer opportunities for people to create rather than just labor tokens are tools for the monetization of one's own labor and enable those who can use them to route around entrenched institutions and establish intermediaries and generate a self-sovereign livelihood ethereum is well suited to enable the creation of infinite digital cultures and these cultures have an economic as these cultures have an economic foundation to stand on that the legacy world was not offering to them a cultural revolution is upon us and it will be powered by crypto much thanks to amin soleimani and chris burniske for their invaluable council for the formation of this article and also thanks to the members of the bankless nation who provided critical feedback to make this making this article more digestible and coherent cryptoculture the world of cryptocurrency has cultivated its own unique culture values and communication styles there are esoteric terminology slang memes and the people are well versed in their ability to express these things through purely digital means the crypto economic foundations that make up this industry bitcoin and ethereum are responsible for creating the environment from which cryptoculture has been established the specific flavor of cultural expression found in cryptoculture is directly downstream of the code that produces bitcoin and ethereum the values that are baked into these cryptoeconomic systems extend outward from the code itself and into the community and the art that we share and value there is a relationship between the nature of the cryptography that underpins these systems and the resultant communities that come to surround them value a collective agreement if something has value it's because humans collectively agree it does value is true because humans make it so it's a myth maintained by the social layer shared by the collective value is intangible yet it is a powerful unifying force of everyone that shares the myth because all humans know all others believe in the same story value becomes self-fulfilling value the monetary worth of something the importance or usefulness of something a fair return of or equivalent or equivalent in goods or services values a person's principles or standards of behavior one's judgment of what is important in life the assets that human humans value are determined by our values the market value of our financial assets is derived from our values created by the ethic that we live by the true power behind the cryptocurrency revolution is its ability to eliminate the is ought gap between what humans value and humans value with crypto humans have the tools to become more closely aligned with how we desire to be the net result of crypto is the production of new cultural expression vehicles that enable humans to express their values with fidelity this is critically important and perhaps the prime reason as to why this industry is so massively revolutionary humanity is perpetually on a mission to discover ways to express what it sees as good and crypto offers a platform to make this process more efficient effective and accurate most humans are good and want to do good things for the world most humans wake up with the intention of helping society in whatever ways they can while still making ends meet and living a comfortable life our ability to achieve good represents a results our ability to achieve good results depends on the systems that humans use to organize and coordinate not all organizational systems are equally capable of enabling humans to successfully achieve the desired results of being good certain environments and human organizational schemes enable the expression more good than others environments flushed with resources make it easier to reduce suffering into spread wealth which is good but there's variability in how humans manage to organize inside the environment they find themselves in it's one thing if there are ample resources but being able to distribute these resources in good ways requires organizational scaffolding that enables it organizational schemes as discussed in a bankless nation humans have organized and then reorganized themselves under different schemes across time and these organizational schemes tend to be more and more socially scalable see steve jobs said technology is a bicycle for the mind implying that innovations in technology enable the brain to achieve more with less effort extrapolating that from the single human brain to the collective human hive mind new and improved organizational schemes feudalism religion the state democracy the internet crypto are enabled by innovations in social coordination technology our ability to organize and focus our energies is mediated by the technology that we have at our disposal crypto offers a new social scaffolding that allows us to better distribute our valuable resources in ways that are better aligned with our human values learned helplessness learned helplessness is a term coined by martin seligman a pioneer of the positive psychology movement learned helplessness is a condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed it is thought to be one of the underlying causes of depression learned helplessness is related to the concept of self-efficacy the individual's belief in their ability to achieve goals learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation learned helplessness in society societal institutions are entrenched wealth isn't circulating attempts to climb the social ladder and achieve the american dream are thwarted millennials are the first generation in history to believe that they are going to be worse off than their parents home ownership in young people is down inflation adjusted income is down debt is up both in student loans and credit cards young persons positive beliefs about the future are at all time lows millennials and zoomers are the two current generations in which positive beliefs about the future are critically important these two generations need to be positive about the future as it's the primary source of motivation to get out of bed in the morning and work towards achieving goals young adults need to believe that they have the power to positively impact their own lives and the lives of people around them via their own agency and self-actualization if they don't learn that these things are possible now then these generations may become stuck in a state of learned helplessness if you believe that the future is going to be worse building motivation to expend the energy to try and build a better future will be difficult if you don't believe that you have the ability to direct your own future personal future for positive outcomes then why even bother to try just keep your head down go to your nine to five come home and watch netflix at least netflix is only twelve dollars a month if you meal prep and you don't eat too much avocado toast you may even be able to pay off your credit card meanwhile millennials and zoomer memes about depression excuse me meanwhile millennial and zoomer memes about depression suicide and loneliness are relentless on instagram and reddit if a meme catches traction it's because many other people relate to it internet memes are a way for young people to express their emotions and offer a way to funnel their depression and pessimism into a creative outlet we should take notice that a common way to establish commonality and express oneself with internet strangers is with memes about depression suicide and loneliness while these are intended to be a light-hearted jest they are also the product in the environment that millennials and zoomers find themselves in society is in a state of learned helplessness and it's because our institutions are rigid fixed and designed to protect entrenched players and protect the status quo here's some memes that i have discovered throughout my journeys trying to find the best memes to put in here why is being alive so expensive i'm not even having a good time wow how did you get so ripped every time i want to die i do one push-up the earth is dying but at least we are dying faster hey want to go out tonight sure let me check if i have the energy oops well that's no good i guess i'll just borrow energy from tomorrow uh-oh tomorrow is empty too ooh well that can't be good not all of these can be read out loud unhelpful institutions the institutions that were erected after the great depression and world war ii produced one of the most progressive periods of human history the 1950s to 2008 was one of the greatest periods of economic prosperity and technological advancement humanity has ever had but just like everything else in this universe institutions age what was originally built to benefit all of society now only works for a small part of society older generations were able to enjoy the best years of these newly established institutions and they latched on to them and never let them go rather than passing the torch to younger generations and allowing the institutions of the 21st century to adapt evolve and be inclusive of further generations instead older generations captured these 21st century institutions and sucked them dry the older generations are still steering the ship of wealth and are declining to pass control down the line the last five presidents of the united states have been baby boomers the united states has been led by a baby boomer since 1992 that is my person my personal entire lifespan research leadership or the direction that we focus our energies into society research and development is a baby boomer-led movement at the same time the student debt is reaching critical levels university administration is inflated and leadership decisions are made by boomers a headline from washington post baby boomers are what's wrong with america's economy they chewed up resources ran up the debt and escaped responsibility why are so many of the world's top jobs still held by grumpy old men baby boomers are still clinging on to global level levels levers of power this one is the distribution of presidents and academic leaders the people that are leading how we teach our young people they're all boomers it takes roughly the lifespan of one long human life for a social institution to be birthed mature and then age and become decrepit and senile the generation that happens to be in their prime working years during the era in which institutions are at their best latch onto these institutions and capture all the value that they create by happenstance the generation that was positioned to take advantage of the prime years of these institutions use this era of prosperity and wealth to further expand these institutions to their maximal degree as these generations believe that these institutions are good obviously they believe these institutions are good because of how much value and wealth that these institutions created from the relevant generations these new institute institutions are wealth generating machines and their and the generations that benefit from this wealth generation latch onto these institutions and proliferate them into monolithic monolithic gargantuans that grow to commandeer the lives of everyone the generations that helped create these institutions never pass on the helm of the ship they continue dictating the direction of everyone under the umbrella of these institutions even though they were erected under completely different leadership and under completely different paradigms society and generations move on but the institutions stay the same eventually there is such a large discrepancy between the needs of society and what the institutions in power are capable of offering as a result the generations that come after these lucky generations receive less and less of the wealth that is created by these institutions as the prior generations find more and where more ways to capture all the value that is produced the wealth does not trickle down because these institutions never find new leadership new brains or new innovators and new entrepreneurs they begin to age just like the people that compose them eventually they turn old and senile too and the social leadership these institutions offer is fundamentally misaligned with the desired goals of subsequent generations that come after them as a result the social institutions reject the young folk and the young young folk reject the institutions and a societal crisis occurs in 2020 both the left and the right in america took to the streets and rioted distrust in institutions is at an all-time high wealth inequality younger people are increasingly pessimistic about the about our ability to vote our way out of issues because the older generations never seem to acknowledge their perspective to that lets them get their way see the 2020 democratic primary between bernie and biden instead of playing the society game younger people are just opting out and making memes about depression and helplessness they have learned that they cannot succeed in this environment because the institutions are not on their side new institutions new culture younger generations are in dire need of new institutions we can see this in the ways that they attempt to express themselves in their culture younger generations are in a state of learned helplessness and they struggle to discover where they fit in today's society many are discovering that they can't actually find themselves a niche to build and excel in and instead find ways to compromise on their expectations about the future and learn to be satisfied with minimum wage jobs and living with their parents for younger generations cryptoculture is product market fit our memes are hilarious our conversations are efficient our lifestyle is digital cryptoculture offers a new landscape both of economic output and cultural expression and it's specifically tailored to digital nomads forum surfers laptop jockeys counter culturalists content producers swipers meme artists blogger bloggers internet squads cypherpunks the cypherpunks created cryptoculture the history of crypto doesn't begin with bitcoin in 2019 in 2009. it begins with martin hellman ralph merkel whitfield diffy horst feistel peter elias and david chom and many of the others who were critical to the rise of cryptography and the cryptographic system that our industry relies on what started out as a counterculture fight against the establishment for the freedom of cryptographic information has blossomed into cryptoeconomic systems that create the foundational substrate on which infinite kryptos cultures have been established cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down cypherpunks make networks safe for privacy cypherpunk's write code the story of the cypherpunks is a story of permissionless creation a group of people banded together under a commonly shared set of beliefs and values each with unique capabilities to contribute towards something that they believed in and stood for the desire to create a counterculture of permissionless problem solving a disregard for nonsensical outdated established norms a readiness to escape from tyranny and oppression and the willingly willingness to adventure into new lands the foundation of all cryptocultures is built on the backs of the cypherpunks infinite cultures thanks to the effort of the cypherpunks we now have an alternative universe for money and finance this realm is uninhabited and fertile there are just two things missing in this new empty landscape people and structures the migration of people and their capital in this into this new realm has perpetually grown ever since the first bitcoin block was mined in 2009. slowly but surely people have been migrating into this digital realm and setting up camp these initial pioneers of crypto are the most culturally similar to the cypherpunks that established the foundation of this land in the first place independent adventuring creators who have a vision for the future outside of the status quo ever since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 and especially since ethereum was formed in 2015 the migrants into this different realm have taken on different flavors than the purely crypto punk or cypherpunk cryptographers each new community that arrives in the cryptoverse is a new spin on the og cypherpunk culture and each community brings something new to the table that expands the fold one of the first communities that settled into the cryptoverse were the libertarian goldbugs who saw the dormant potential that lay in bitcoin each different application of the cryptoverse entices its own varieties of users to migrate over after the ultra libertarian goldbergs and early suck crypto punks came cypherpunks came more casual cohorts all interested in a different specific flavor of what crypto has for offer dogecoin brought in a cohort of internet memesters nick carter came in via doge i actually wouldn't call him an internet memester although he is good at memes bitshares brought in economic incentive tinkerers which brought in roon christensen founder of maker dao monero brought in privacy coins brought in the privacy-minded but with the introduction of ethereum an entirely new dimension opened up ethereum enables applications that don't want to or don't want or care to be concerned with the fundamentals of what makes a crypto economic system operate app developers on ethereum don't have to worry about the hard problems of crypto economics monetary policy security consensus no no matter the ethereum protocol takes on the hard problems of cryptoeconomic system design and lets the application developers focus on what they want to focus on producing their application this is a massive boon to cultural creation by eliminating the labor and energy that needs to be dedicated to blockchain design and sustainability app developers can focus on creating value in their apps and incentivizing a community to band together and circle around the campfire that the app creates sadly dogecoin is just another l1 block trading masquerading as a meme and much of his vibrant community from 2013 to 2016 has moved on dogecoin was not a place of final settlement for the migrants looking to live inside the cryptoverse bitshares was similarly economically flawed and constraining to the developers while monero and other private privacy coins maintained a strong community their growth hasn't cr kept up with the rest of the cryptoburst these systems have not proven to be sufficiently sticky for migrants to be convinced to settlement there this is the power of ethereum's application layer a foundational substrate that creates economic viability for all possible cultures to be expressed earlier microcultures the 2018 to 2019 bear market saw a mass exodus from the crypto space as capital leaves so do the people yet a few communities managed to hold on and kept their fires going the link marines the synthetic spartans the ave avengers these communities suffered through 90 drawdown in asset valuations then they suffered through two more years of flat crypto prices before things began to pick up again two years of poverty two years of communities contracting into their truest and most convicted believers the discord channels for these communities were the campfires that kept the energy alive through a long cold winter community members turned into community leaders and tended to the fire to make sure it kept everyone warm culture was created in these shared experiences of unexciting low asset prices yet relentless optimism and conviction about a successful future was present each different bear market community generated its own style of memes jokes and coping mechanisms as they waited out the winter together and then spring came ave snx link violently ended their bear markets by completely rejecting the pessimism expressed by all other assets in crypto and led the charge into defy summer 2020 and where we are in the markets today defy summer happened and out of it came the communities of yern sushi yams harvest and many more each with massive treasuries to help fund the development of both the product and the community each ecosystem has its own contributors investors developers leaders organizers members or just believers some don't do much other than just sit at the campfire and be present and that is enough each ecosystem has its own culture and the culture is alive due to the shared conviction and sufficient funding via a collectively owned asset the asset makes the community and the community makes the asset these communities and their shared cultures are amplified via the financial and economic tools that lies in their respective token the token is the thing that funds these communities and allows them to tap into resources that help the community grow and proliferate when the when these tokens go up in value it brings in more community members who find residents in the value of the token and the values of the community nfts are vehicles for cultural cultural creation here's an excerpt from steven levy of wired though it might seem like nfts have burst out of nowhere and into the news the phenomenon has been inevitable since 1975. that's when two academic computer scientists scientists whitfield diffie and martin martin hellman made the public key breakthrough that brought us modern cryptography enabling security and privacy in an online world their discovery also opened up cryptography as a creative tool in which scientists could cleverly transport the conventions and regimes of physical reality to the new burgeoning digital world one of these innovators was cryptographer david chalm whose ideas made digital money possible it was only a matter of time before cham's cryptocurrency concepts became mainstream especially when it merged with another cryptographic innovation the blockchain if you could describe value to verifiably unique strings of bits and used as money why not other strings of bits that represent artwork tunes or slam dunks and once you've made the transition into collecting blockchain valuables you can get really creative it's no accident that nfts are going wild during our lockdown state when so much of our lives are played out on zoom twitch clubhouse and amazon prime novelist william gibson famously described cyberspace what became the internet as a consensual hallucination on a practical level digital reality is just as real as the stuff that hurts our knees when we bang into it nfts merge that illusion with our long-standing consensual hallucination that something void of intrinsic value is actually precious and fungible our embrace of these hallucinations long ago overstepped what was once considered its bounds even when we are somewhere we're somewhere else if we don't buy that try not to touching your phone for a day why so why shouldn't our ideas change about what holds value as new as they are nfts are confronting us with the evidence of how much we're already in the matrix we're the people who need people thank you steven that was poignant the power that lies dormant under the innovation that is nfts is about to erupt into the world of artistic creation justin blau more commonly known as blau raised 12 million dollars in 24 hours by selling a combination of digital collectibles exclusive music and their rights to musical direction in return justin was able to create a direct connection between his artistic creations and a list of 60 people that put 12 million dollars into his pockets for the rights to these items while spotify is great for distribution it sucks for data that's because spotify keeps all the data for itself it provides the artist with no insights into who their fans are or the ability to communicate with them blau's top 60 fans are willing to collectively pay him 12 million dollars yet a platform like spotify treats them like every other blough fan or worse people listening via radio mix as a result of the nft token that justin blau issued on ethereum his fans were more capable of communicating their value to the music that he produces intermediaries broker the emotional relationship between artistic creators and artistic community consumers with intermediaries replaced by financial and economic software and a theory on ethereum the expression of culture through the digital arts will be able to flourish art is simply the ability for an artist to strike the senses of the experiencer what happens when we generate incentivization vehicles tokens for the funding and development of the digital arts the emotional response humanity will be able to access from its art will be revolutionary lowering the barriers ethereum democratizes finance and that's what is happening with nfts it's just the beginning of the democratization of the value derived from art suddenly the sharpest and most precise financial tool ever created is in the hands of content creators and the artists of the world through the power of tokens and at the scale of the internet ethereum disintermediates the distribution of art between our creator and our consumer we have already seen the immense amount of energies that icos sparked in 2016 to 2018 and icos made no sense at all yet the takeaway was ethereum's innovation in capital formation nfts are taking the capital of power of cat nfts are taking the power of capital formation and directing it into the arts tokens are the tool for artistic creators of all scales to tap into the power that of their creative energies and produce something of cultural expression if the market values cultural expression it will have the ability to communicate this to the creator through the token how many jobs will ethereum create by reducing the barriers for capital to flow into new lands of artistic creation how many labor hours can be redirected from meaningless tasks in gargantuan companies into the land of free market cultural generation nfts offer a way for the younger digitally native creators of the world to not rely on established and entrenched permissioned infrastructure to help fund their personal well-being while the issue of large misaligned social and political institutions are not simply fixed by nfts nfts offer a cypherpunk alternative to how to allow the younger generations to bypass these gatekeeping institutions and empower them and us to serve to secure a livelihood outside of the status quo not only do the legacy institutions of the world have to compete with the permissionless labor monetizing tools offered by ethereum but they also have to compete with the lifestyle that these tools offer the freedom to work for oneself no 9-5 no boss just a creator and their computer a quote from vitalik's recent blog post even a billion dollars of capital cannot compete with a project having a soul the crypto wealthy will subsidize digital art it makes logical sense that nft spring is occurring after d5 summer it's simply the correct order of operations ether ran from 200 to 2 dollars and along with insane amounts of new issuance of defy tokens and hundreds of billions of dollars gets injected into the ecosystem and investments meanwhile the high-powered growth also drives funding and investments into companies and supporting infrastructure as well adding in jobs and salaries into crypto and now this newly created wealth is rotating out of digital finance and into digital arts this is like only the millionth historical example of this happening from an article tracing renaissance art to the birth of modern banking when it comes to the renaissance few of us would immediately a few of us would immediately equate the rich cultural fruits of the period with the birth of modern banking entitled money and beauty bankers both selly and the bonfires of the vanities the exhibition in florence's palazzo strozzi looks at how florence's famous families got rich and how then they used their wealth to commission works from some of the world's most celebrated artists you could say that some of these gestures were simply penitential oh boy but sorry but then the banker begins to realize that in giving them money he can begin to define the image that is produced by his money and of course one of the things he instinctively does whether it's conscious or not is use the image to change the attitude to money that is begin to use the image to undermine the resistance to money said parks money was feared he said not only because christianity espoused poverty but crucially because it allowed for social mobility and therefore undermined the set medieval hierarchies still for a few years the medicis were in charge of papal finances the artists were happy to oblige in order to ensure their economic prosperity i want to pause here because i don't have this in the article and i need to put it in there the takeaway here is that there was this res the social institutions of christianity told people that poverty is good and that was that was the the social institutions of the day me and i need to research this i'm not an expert in european history but like meanwhile the popes and the pope and religious institutions are collecting tithes and generating a ton of revenue they're telling other people to be be poverty be in poverty and then they're collecting a bunch of money there was corruption in those social institutions too and then and the establishment of money and finance in the renaissance in the 1400s europe and specifically in florence put a lot of wealth into the hands of the people specifically a very concentrated set of people like a one percent the bankers but then the bankers financed art and then using that financing of art they changed the narrative of what it means to have finances and have money and now we can extrapolate this into what's going on with nfts where crypto in the legacy world has this bad stigma you know money laundering crime child porn totally unwarranted but yet the stigma is still there now this nft revolution is behind us and we can the crypto wealthy can use their wealth to direct the art of the digital artists who want to make art and do it for a living and they will take the direction of the crypto wealthy to produce the art that the crypto wealthy wants which will put the crypto wealthy into good light because they are the ones funding it i was recently reminded of a clubhouse room i was in which was a clubhouse room of artists talking about nft specifically not crypto people artists and artists alone and the speaker said then this is a direct quote i am so ready to suckle from the teats of the crypto bros because they're going to pay me a bajillion dollars to make that and now i'm paraphrasing they're going to pay me a lot of money to produce art right this is the exact same like historical parallel that we're seeing all right back to the article it's simple society advances and learns how to create wealth and prosperity wealth naturally concentrates and generates a wealthy cohort of people who have nothing better to do than to fund and finance the art that they wish to see created artists want to capture this wealth generated from innovations in finance and banking and then they start to make art that suits the taste of the wealthy entire revolutions have come and gone due to this cycle 1500's florence 1640 amsterdam 1870 paris 1950s new york 2021 ethereum question mark ethereum is the new frontier we have completed the exploration of the earth and the new frontier is of money and finance and art has moved into a digital realm the next cultural renaissance is digital and it will be financed on ethereum conclusion the culture that is being cultivated in this space is the result of the awakening of younger people who are turning away from the notion of being simple cogs in the machine and instead are focused on becoming self-actualized contributors to the world andrew yang warns of a world in which much of the world's labor has been automated by machines and robots we stand at a fork in the road where our future can turn into either a utopia or a dystopia without a place to redirect the energies of our younger generations into productive outputs we will lose these generations forever to the basements of our parents and the spirits of these generations could wither into nothingness that's a dystopia but with a place in which creative energies can be expressed and valued we will have the opportunity of automating away all the low-value work and replacing it with time spent creatively if robots are doing the labor and humans are creating art that is a utopia let's choose the latter let the robots flip the burgers and let the people create the art let's choose the future in which people are free from the limitations on their paths towards producing a livelihood from themselves and others let's choose ethereum let's choose cryptoculture so thank you everyone for for bearing with me i think i i think i did a good job on this article and i hope it lands pretty well i think it will um so if you resonated with what you heard here please share it because we need to share cryptoculture it's up to you the the consumer of said information to also proliferate it as widely as power and as far as power as you can so thank you everyone for for listening cheers
