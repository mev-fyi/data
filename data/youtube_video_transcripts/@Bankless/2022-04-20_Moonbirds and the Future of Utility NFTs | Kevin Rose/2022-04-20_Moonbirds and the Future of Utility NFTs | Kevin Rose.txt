hey bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation we've got a hot episode for you today with none other than kevin rose kevin just launched one of the biggest nft launches ever i think definitely the most successful launch of the year it's called moon birds we're gonna talk about how he did it what made it so successful david some stats here man before we begin okay so the best nft launch of the year 280 million dollars worth of primary and secondary trading in two days okay so this just did what uh more more than more than board apes did in the last 30 days and it did it in in a 24 hour period of time uh 59k per moon bird right now it might be like 50 to 80 k leading the open c charts over 177 million dollars worth of trades um kevin's got his hands into a couple of nft projects right the first was with proof collective which we're going to talk about and the second is this pfp profile pick type of nft experience called moon birds and that's the one that that's mooning right now but proof is doing pretty well too anyway so much to talk about what are you most excited to uh to discuss with kevin well i think it's going to be especially relevant for for bankless listeners because if you are a content consumer this is what kevin is making an ecosystem around he's making an nft ecosystem with the moon birds the profile picture but also his scarce like 1000 unique membership nfts and he's just making a tokenized community around the the the content that he creates and overall just like a tokenized community uh and so this is very very relevant for the world of web 2 or excuse me web 3 content consumers these products are for you guys uh and so i'm going to be just tapping into kevin and seeing the lessons that he is learning because kevin is on the frontier of tokenized content and tokenized communities in web 3. so we are bringing him on to hear about what he has learned on the frontier and taking it back so we all have something a road map to go on as we go on the frontier yeah this is amazing i think this this episode is going to be full of alpha because whether you're part of one of these communities there's massive opportunities for you or if you're a creator we're actually going to ask him like an hour of free consulting with kevin like how do you do this if bankless wanted to launch an nft for its community right how do we do that i literally wouldn't do those questions exactly like i want to pick his brain because he's got a couple successful ones under his belt and he's doing it with a a long-term vision here so it's not sort of a you know quick uh pump and pump and dump sort of thing like he's got a lot of utility that he's injecting in these nfts and he's put together a fantastic community so it's going to be a great discussion david got something else going on and that is graf day which is coming up this is a conference by the graph protocol okay it's happening june the second in san francisco it's a four day event and i think this is like part conference and graph day and june the second and then also part hackathon what uh what else should we say about this conference uh the collection of people that are going there is fantastic kevin o'keefe we all love kevin he is going to be at this conference we also have sam williams from are weave michael cena from ceramic arjun bhutani from connext cammy russo as well uh another defy content creator uh and just the fact that the graph is throwing a hackathon uh it's just it's great to see app layer stuff uh throwing hackathons because hackathons are just the great way to outsource development riesland mark is actually one of my personal heroes in this space so he's going to be there so if you are in san francisco during june or you just want to be there june 2nd is when it starts it goes to a four-day conference wave 2 tickets are out so you've got to get your tickets there is a link in the show notes also bankless dot cc slash capital g graph capital d day graph day bankless dot cc slash graph day but with the capitals uh and we'll is where you can get your ticket yeah that link will save you 50 on this ticket so uh there you go right in the box david got to ask you the question before we get into this conversation with kevin what is the state of the nation today sir oh ryan the state of the nation is pioneering like i said kevin is on the frontier he has discovered some cool new things some cool new primitives for community engagement community uh content creation uh and he's bringing this information back to the to the center back to like this is kind of how i think about these things is people go out on the frontier they discover some gold and then they come back to bank list and tell us how that would be discovered yeah and so we are broadcasting the gold that's on the frontier and so this is why you are definitely going to listen to this episode because on this episode we are pioneering into the frontier yeah super excited to pick his brain about all of these things guys we will be back with kevin rose in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode

web 3 vc he's been on bankless before he's the host of the proof podcast mentor of nfts in the proof collection which we're going to talk about and now today we're going to talk about moon birds which is absolutely living up to its name is absolutely mooning in the last 24 hours or like a few 24 hours ago it actually did more volume than bored apes in the last 30 days so absolutely phenomenon uh phenomenal success kevin it's great to have you on bankless we're excited to talk about this yeah glad to be back on thanks for having me guys really appreciate it hey you having fun man is this fun it's it's the time of my life like for for me this is like what i love to do the scariest part was the sale what i love to do is build products and that's what i have done my entire career so going out and building products for this community is just going to be a blast it's it's my favorite thing on earth this is really cool because i feel like you are pioneering a lot of ways that the building product side on the nft like utility bringing utility to nfts through the community just a couple of stats to rattle off for people who haven't been following uh what moon birds has done we're about to explain it but 280 million dollars worth of primary secondary uh purchases in two days a moon bird is going for 60k right now that's in eve terms uh absolutely crushing it on openc so leading the charts i think one of our big questions coming into this conversation kevin because we want to like unpack the secrets of nft here right is uh how did you do it can you teach us can you show us your ways like how did this actually come about about what is the secret combination to success here it's it's a good question um honestly i didn't expect it to to be honest we it was one of those things where we had started off with a community in building proof and and the proof collective and that was our first nft drop which was a thousand members and we really got to just this amazing community of hardcore nft collectors which serves as the backbone of this drop like people that were really excited about the things we were building and then i think that if you take a look around at who's building in the space there's you know a lot of big promises from a bunch of different teams and um people are looking for i believe uh people that have built um credible things in the past you know you want to pick a team that you know is going to deliver and live up to all the hype and expectations and so you know i think about dom and all the great work that that um you know he's done uh you know he created loot but he's done so many other fantastic products um prior to to that and some of the other builders that you just look at and you're like okay i trust you because of what you've created you know over the last couple decades and i feel very fortunate that people trust what we're about to embark upon and what we're going to build and and it was that that led to just so many people being oversubscribed and we were going to do a dutch auction initially and then we realized it was just going to turn it into a gas war and then we had to flip it to a raffle and then once it went out we had no clue what the secondary volume was going to be if you would have asked me the day of i probably would have said well we'll end up at around you know two eighth or so and then it immediately shot up to five and then 10 then 15 and then it just kept climbing so it was it was shocking but um you know i do realize it's not lost on me that um there is a lot of hype here and so it's on us now to go build and really fulfill everything that we the roadmap that we've put out there kevin will have already said this in the intro but i kind of view you as a pioneer who went out into the the margins the fringes of the web 3 universe and discovered something cool and now you're coming back here to tell us all about what you found uh which is very appropriate for somebody who also like made dig the one of the first like uh bottom style websites of the internet uh and so okay following through on on your brand is somebody who's been on the frontier of the internet since since day one and there's so many different elements about what you've built right there's the proof community there's the proof nft now there's moon birds uh and each one of these things represents what feels like a a lego that stacks on top of each other and we're going to explore each of these things and kind of how they relate to each other like how the legos stack upon each other and what really gets me excited about this story is as somebody who came into this industry in a non-technical fashion uh realizing i was never really going to be able to learn how to code because i just didn't have it in me it was always going to be content consumer or content production that was going to be interesting for me and there was always on the horizon something about content production and tokenization somewhere as soon as we figure out what that thing is and it seems to be that you figured out what that is uh and so that's gonna be i think the theme for the episode but before we go into the details can you just give us the uh overarching scope of proof the whole thing like what are all the pieces what are all the components because we're going to dig into each one of these things so when you view the the the system what is the system what is proof yeah absolutely well i think that's a great place to start so proof started off as just a podcast covering all things nfts and it was driven from my personal passion to interview artists and creators and have them on the show to talk about their journey and their passion for creating whatever it might be so i was very fortunate that you know over a year ago to have you know the founders of art blocks on and the founders of quantum and just uh flamingo dow and a lot of the really early kind of pioneers and builders um in this space and you know it was actually the crypto punx episode was really fun too when i had those founders on as well so it started off there and then i quickly realized that we were just building a pretty massive audience i mean we kind of hit the market at the right time and that you know nfts were starting to pop and when they did then you know that went from 25 000 viewers to 50 000 100 000 and it kept growing and i realized that these are all people that are interested in collecting uh nfts and some of them are really passionate and really hardcore and there's a bunch of different groups out there different discords out there that are focused on information around the collection or collecting of nfts but the problem that i saw is that there is just so many new projects that are dropping every single day and every you know every single week anyone armed with photoshop these days can create an nft right and the the majority of the groups that you find out there are focused on quote-unquote alpha groups right and those groups are about trading they're about trading um oftentimes they can talk about flipping they can you know it is about how do you get into a project score that three to five x potentially get out and and oftentimes move on to the next thing and so for me that's not really that interesting to me that's not what i want to focus on like what i want to prove to be about is really about that artist story and about the long-term collectibility and why you should care about a particular artist and so i wanted to get into their backgrounds and go deep on that and so when i wanted to create a private discord which became the proof collective it was like let's not create an alpha group because i just that's not my dna like i'm a believer in nfts for the next you know holding for the next few decades and beyond so let's create something that is about like-minded collectors that want to talk about you know curation with a kind of a point of view so like just really about going deep and finding those projects when you buy an x copy which one should you consider that you're going to hold for the next you know 10 15 20 years that type of conversation and that's what launched the proof collective and so that launched in december of last year it was 1 000 nfts they looked like little membership cards and if you held one you had access to this private discord and so that is what kicked off this entire thing after the podcast had already been out for like you know almost a year at that point and i did dutch auction and so i said okay i'm gonna sell these proof collective passes it'll be you know five eth and eth was less expensive back then working its way down to eventually point one each is where it would have bottomed out and they sold out at uh 1 eth is where it ended up and so we got to work we said okay let's let's start building and so with that we launched the private discord later we launched several different collaborations that were unique to proof collective holders one exclusively with heart you which is a great artist we did one with hakka tau and probably another three or four others that we that we launched over the last few months and granted we're in april now so we're only we're only really four months into this we launched the actual membership kicked in january first and then the idea was how can we take this capital and not put it in our pockets but every single dollar that was raised actually went right back into the company and so the cu and so what does the company do the company does a handful of things we go off and we obviously we've talked about the private discord but we also are going to hold an annual nft conference in l.a called proof of conference that's going to be crazy it'll be free for proof collective holders we're hiring full-time analysts so we're about to close three full-time analysts that we we've narrowed it down from 20 applicants down to three they were going to be responsible for doing what we call proof deep dives which are these really deep full analysis it's almost what you all do at bank list on the defy side where you go really deep and give people the the understanding and the analysis but rather than we don't want to we're not defy experts we're nft we're on the nft side so we're going to go deep on the nft side and tell you who is xcopy what are their genesis piece like and then really work with these upcoming utility uh drops and these other pfp drops and help you sort through all the the the garbage that can happen out there and really elevate the best ones and give you these really deep concise like tldr briefs on on why you should be collecting and holding these particular nfts it's almost like a forester research back in the stock days but for nfts um and then you know early access to our podcast and then we do exclusive projects like grails was the first project that we launched which was really cool where you didn't know who the artist was until you actually meant the piece and you had to have a proof pass to be able to meant it then we launched moon birds and so every proof collective member got two free moon birds with their pass we have a future metaverse that we're building uh the code name right now for it is called highrise and so the proof collective is kind of that thousand person like backbone to all the things that we do if that makes sense it does it really seems like um you you said you're trying to just not not uh get into the whole like all right you get in at this price you buy this nft and you get out of this price it seems to be a lot like more um like paid research right like some people pay like a lot of money to have journals uh you know send them the best research that an industry has and it seems to be the web three version of that and and kevin i'm wondering if you uh how much um how prepared or how like like scared perhaps you were of turning this into a token right all of a sudden there's a token or nfts that trade on the secondary markets where previously you were a content a producer with a with a community around that but now you're a content producer with a community around that with an nft badge for membership and also the moon birds did that decision to go into on-chain tokens that trade on secondary markets like talk about that the weight of that decision yeah i mean i think when you when you launch something like this you never know what the adoption is going to be and all i know is that the nice thing about what we do as product builders and what we've built over the years in terms of the products that we've you know created that have touched literally tens of millions of people's lives um we know that we can deliver on that piece and if we hold true to that promise then the price will take care of itself so i i don't follow the token the nft price is like the of the proof pass of course i'm looking at moon birds right now because it's just insanity and like of course i'm gonna check that out but it it's it's i don't check it every single day and it's because i have to have work to do like we have it's time to let's go let's get to work and and at the end of the day you know we is we've laid out what we're going to create and then we have to go and execute and i think that the price just will fall where it falls like it's i i hate to see like there's this there's this danger i think if you're a creator of one of these projects where if you're chasing this token price like it must hit this or you know i have to get this much value extracted out we actually would rather take in less revenue and have a a more stable community than the roller coaster so what i'm really proud of one of the terms that i'm proud of or figures i'm proud of right now is if i go to i'm clicking on right now the proof collective um on openc we have 933 unique holders out of 1000 that's a 93.3 unique holder rate of our proof collective token that is awesome and you can compare that against any other big pfp project and it's always much lower moon birds is obviously much lower right now we're going to get that up and the reason i love that is it's less churn yes that means there's less revenue because obviously we don't get those royalties but we're starting to get to know each other as a community and we're we're the goal is to create these like lifelong bonds and relationships and share information and intelligence we believe that people coming together can create a collective intelligence that is better and stronger than any one individual and and that's held true so far and that's that's what we're going to continue to build that's uh super cool kevin and i i think we have so many questions this is just on the proof side of things we're also going to talk about moon birds but i want people listening to the podcast there's there's probably you know two camps of people one is there's a lot of creators out there with communities involved in communities and and they're scratching their heads and they're looking at what you've done with proof and what you've done with with your community and uh you know nfds and they're trying to think about okay how can i launch something like this for my community what what does that look like putting themselves in the mold of a creator there's also another group who's like okay i'm part of a really interesting community and i want to participate more how can i uh gain opportunity entering that community so i think we want to address both of those but there's more to this story too so um like with proof itself um were you how did you get the curation right so you said 933 members but like you've kind of built this thing in concentric circles right where it's like it starts with a nucleus it's you maybe a few others on your team at proof and then it expands to like a thousand core proof members and now you've got 10 000 pfps so it's you're sort of building from this concentric circle of new fans if you will you know the the 100 true fans the thousand true fans right like that how is that important what's your secret to good community curation because i think a lot of people if they launch a token or an nft they will get those you know telegram nft pump and dump groups that aren't necessarily incented for the long term they have a really hard time creating a a nucleus for their community can you talk about that no it's a it's a great point and i think that you know you and i you over at banquets are in a similar position where you have people that listen to what you say because you have a proven track record for talking about high quality projects and you by the nature of you just not talking about the pump and dump type stuff you don't attract that crowd so when i was doing the podcast around proof in the early days there's never been a single episode about flipping about how to make money you know with uh there's never been a single episode about how to pay extra gas to get into something really fast like we just never did that and so it was always about the artist's story and and that attracted a lot of these long-term holders like the people that were really into that style of collecting because diamond handers that yeah the diamond handers the ones that that see this is the first inning of of of a great story that's going to play out over many decades and so when you have that as your core then you can introduce them to this product and you don't on purpose give allowless spots to alpha groups into flipper groups and all this stuff like that was by design like a lot of collections will go out there and engage with these these flipping communities to try and give them access and spots and that's great for your initial sale if you if your only goal is just just grab some money and run but if you want a real durable community um that that's that's not the way to do it but you all have kind of done that with bankless and what you've done i mean you're on the token side right but with your dow and like you you have that trust you could easily do this and to your point earlier about other communities that could do this as well and people that are looking to do this i think this is it it's it's early days and that it's tough because i was talking to tim ferriss about this actually because he's got a massive podcast and i don't know what percentage of tim's base would be into nfts but i know there'd be a thousand people for sure that would be hardcore probably ten thousand or more um so this is just a new way to think about monetizing and a way to get off of that ad drip and the reason why i have had such a hard time with advertising uh in general is it forces you to make bad product decisions that are more about retaining your eyeballs and selling your customers than it is about really building things that are really going to be beneficial to them and so you know when i had dig i launched dig in 2004 it became the first social news site before reddit you know we grew that to 38 million people a month and we still weren't profitable with 38 million people we only had 50 employees and if m50 may sound like a lot but not for someone that's servicing 38 million people right and so and it was because you know we were living in this ad world and there was just no way to monetize what we were doing and we were slow to monetizing and yes we could have gotten to scale and eventually gotten there but we made bad product decisions because of that and so this is a beautiful new world where we don't have to sell out our users any longer and we can you know look to that kind of recurring revenue that comes with the royalties so this is so cool and i think a lot of creators are hearing this and they're just getting really really excited about the potential for their communities but um let's talk about the the revenue model if you will here because this is a switch you called it the uh the ad drip and that's how a lot of creator communities are you know funded right for example bank lists bank list has ads other podcasts have ads that's one way to fund a community the other way to fund a community is sort of through a a subscription service you might have a sub stack you might have certain community members paying for premium benefits oh i pay for your newsletter i read it all the time well there you go it's like like sam harris as well like he's got a very successful podcast and his thing is like hey i'll give you a taste of the podcast but if you want the full podcast you become a you know a premium member of my community and these models have been successful so you got the kind of the the you know revenue model 1 of ads revenue model 2 of premium subscribers through to traditional payment rails what is this new third revenue model that you're opening up so with take us through proof as an example so you did that original nft sale you received some amount of eath from that see from that sale as revenue as kind of like i guess seed revenue and then is there a royalty attached to proof how does that work and then what does the the community receive because now the floor price is like 84 for for uh 84e for a proof membership so i imagine the community received the majority of that of that upside how do the the puts and takes of the of the revenue model work for for a creator when you're doing something like a proof membership yeah it's a great question i mean essentially um the good news is when the price of the actual membership goes up when they do churn and it's slower because they're not many as many are selling so you know i would say out of the thousand maybe um i i had to go look at the numbers i don't i couldn't even tell you i haven't been i've been swamped in moon bird's land but it's it's maybe let's call it three or four passes move per week then you get a percent of that you can define that any way you want and so we set that on the higher side at 7.5 percent and we receive that back into the company as revenue so we have to recognize it as revenue and then that is what we use for everything so there's like no odds ads on the podcast even for the people that aren't members there's no ads on the podcast and we we use that to fund all of our future initiatives whether it be the conference and and all the things that we're going to go off and build right so that is kind of how that gets funded and then in terms of the users that are collecting these um you know they receive a whole slew of different things over time so with grails for example we launched something called grails where there were 20 different artists and as a proof collective holder you got to pick one to mint we didn't tell you who the artists were the secret is that four out of the twenty were top uh five grossing artists of all time in the nft world and so we had a very early prototype of the larva labs the creators of cryptopunx their um autoglyph and it was called the protoglyph and so one of them and it didn't look anything like the because it was a higher fidelity but it was one they couldn't put on the blockchain back then because it was too high resolution and so we had their early prototype as one of them and so the people that minted that um those are going for over a hundred thousand dollars in the secondary and so they received that in their wall they were they some hit 200 000 when they first went out which is crazy and so they received that in their wallet and that was part of the upside that that they received as a holder of the proof collective pass so the products that we turn into nfts whether it be grails or our future metaverse or moon birds which they each got two of which you know are now valued at 20 or 30 grand whatever they are usd per moon bird they go back to the proof collective holders so they they receive that in forms of in a form of um just value that comes back to them as holders in addition to all the information value that comes out of the the membership and the meetups and the group we've had 20 international meetups now with proof people getting together which is just crazy it's uh we're actually hiring a head of a head of like meetups and we have to have a whole services team now around these different meetups and functions that we're going to be doing have you ever done like a back of the envelope calculation and how much uh value you've driven to to appreciate i have not it would just be like just 100x at least it's more than the one eat they paid for the initial if they bought in back then but you're saying for for creators who are like a little worried about getting off the ad drip model like this is enough revenue to accomplish for you as a creator to accomplish the goals you set out and to like pay a team and to staff somebody for meetups and to staff some analysts it's it's just working out from a revenue side to be able to fund this operation as well yeah yeah i mean i think the proof in general is if i had to guess and i'd have to go talk to our accounting folks i would say that the collective pass has probably brought in around seven or eight million dollars in revenue since january wow which is this year of this year yeah which is great um and so that you know but you'll see i i should probably do like a public like show people what we spend our money on because we're gonna do we're gonna throw one of the best nft conferences in the absolute world and those are expensive conferences those are very expensive so ryan carson who is our ceo he used to throw uh future web apps conferences back in the day i mean zuckerberg spoke with them ev williams like all the greats have spoken at his conferences and they were fantastic and the first thing he said to me when he joined and he knew he was going to throw a conference he goes as long as we don't have to make money during this conference it would be amazing he's like because they barely broke even they would have to charge like you know thousands of dollars to attend but they would have to spend so much money on staff and venue and all the logistics and operations that you know record all the video production and streaming and all the stuff that goes into a massive conference and so yeah we're excited so this isn't just money it's important to note that even though we make this money it doesn't come back to us as individuals i mean we get a salary and i'll be transparent i pay myself 50 000 a year from from from proof that's that's my salary um and in the the the purpose though is like we want to go build something massive here so we want to reinvest those funds it's about going bigger and broader and and doing this better than anyone else and that that's the kind of goal here and part of the value you've been able to drive to your community coming like with uh those uh the the mints the autoglyph mint and what was the name of that project again where the the mint grails grails yeah uh i would imagine that the reason why you were able to uh attract that opportunity for your community is because of the nature of the community that you have collected around proof again they're not they're not the flippers they're not the nft flippers so the people that are saying hey we have some nfts for your community have some assurances that your communities are not going to flip these things because you've specifically curated a community of very strong nft experts that are very qualified uh consumers of these nfts that these nft projects would be very very interested in having this particular community be a holder of so what you've really done is you've really curated the best consumer possible of the nfts and saying hey if you're a long-term focused diamond hander you are probably part of the proof uh proof collective and that is particularly attractive to people that are minting new nft projects and so it's really playing that long game and the optimizations for quality that has allowed so much value to be discovered in the proof collective yeah that that's exactly right i mean it's for us it is about how can we play this for the next this long game for the next decade like um i've built a handful of businesses and i i know that for me i'm not aiming to do another like little single or double like we're really swinging for the fences here we want to be a top five pfp project with moon birds and so um yeah we're we're going for it this is this is not about a little short-term exit or rug and run like this is this something much bigger so you have the membership nft the thousand membership nfts now you have the moon birds for the profile pictures because you know you gotta you gotta look good in the metaverse uh but i'm cognizant that you are missing an erc20 token is there an erc20 token on the menu oh man i didn't know you were going to ask me this question um [Music] you know i i think that well i can i can tell you what we we won't do and and let's start with us talking about what we're seeing out there in the in the market if that's okay with y'all so you know when when you think about these coin kind of air drops that are happening i think a lot of it is is broken um in that there's two problems one there's why would you need to use that new token versus say just using eth like like take ape for example like they're gonna build that into their metaverse but why do i need to have that versus z why couldn't i just pay with eth or with dye or ustc or whatever it may be um that is one i have yet to kind of i'm still kind of grappling with and trying to wrap my head around the other is what is the value of that token pegged to and this i don't think is solved by anyone it's just like saying it's an inventing a token saying hey we have a token hooray and like i'm just launching it but there's nothing there's no backbone other than a story of where there may be value like i i do appreciate what dye has done and that they have baskets of underlying other assets that kind of back them up and and i think they can something can be done here um on the nft side as well so i'll hint i'll hint at that you know i like to think about what an underlying basket of nfts could do to power some type of new token and then the other thing and the real thing that i i think is tragic is the reward structure is completely broken and so one of the reasons why we have nesting with moon birds and nesting is a non-custodial way of locking up it's like staking your moon bird but we don't actually take it out of your wallet and you actually get these little upgraded nests you start with straw and then eventually becomes a bronze nest and a silver nest that upgrades over time but what that means is you're saying i have conviction in this project i'm not going to flip this now again we could make more money if people are flipping them but that's not the point we want loyalty we want community and so if people are locking in their birds and saying i'm willing to lock up my moon bird then they should receive the outsized rewards if there ever is a future token in the in it that comes out so it was so odd to me that ape token launches and i could have bought an ape token that or a board ape the day before and received the exact same amount of tokens as someone that had held since day one and i think that that's the wrong reward structure it should be based on your commitment to a project and so we're we're changed in that and and i i will say with this all with one caveat nothing the board apes have innovated in so many different ways it's mind-blowing nothing but respect for that community um i'm just thinking about in the token sense we're just going to do a slightly different take then then if if we go there when we do it'll be a different take than what has already been done out there building and copying some other project you know i think a at a minimum like a pfp is kind of table stakes for anyone that is in this world but we wanted to make sure with the nesting mechanic and some of these other things that we added that were built into the smart contract it wasn't just a me too project and that we are thinking about this with a set of fresh eyes and going back to first principles versus just doing another clone because clones are a dime a dozen and the board apes were not clones they did very quite a few different innovations with their serms and a bunch of the way so that they looked at how to do um derivative type projects on top of their existing user base which i think were brilliant and spot-on um especially at the time no one was doing that um but you know ours is just a different take on this when we eventually get around to that that world i love that these nft projects are kind of leveling each other up because like you know one one project will just take the best ideas from another and then like iterate on them make improvements in various ways and then we get to kind of the next level we unlock it and we see what's oh i love it and i don't consider this i think this is a fantastic thing for the industry so i'll give you an example this just happened today this is fresh news uh quantum art uh justin arvisano uh fantastic uh best known one of the best known um photography nft creators that's out there sold his artwork at christie's all this stuff they created quantum which was initially just for photography-based nfts they announced this morning they had their quantum key which is like their version of kind of grails i was understanding that grails but the version of what we did on the proof collective and they announced this morning that they're going to do a grails type launch we don't know who the artists are and then they'll do the reveal after but they're putting the emphasis back on the art getting people to consider and look at each piece and decide which thing when they want to collect and then doing the storytelling around the artist this is the entire thing that we built for grails that we launched you know a few months ago i love that they they are now using this as part of their mechanic it's like if we find useful pieces to your to your all's entire thesis around lego blocks let's reuse them take the best ones modify them make them better and take them forward and that's that's how we all win and i i so i like to see more of that that's super cool all right well let's uh let's back up and just complete the story around moon bird so we we talked about this foundation which is the the proof collective and now can you tell us a bit more about this moon birds launch so it sounds like if you had a if you're a proof holder then you got some moon birds minted to you you got two and you could just go and claim two that's right you could claim to you okay so so tell us about uh like the moon birds concept how is it distributed um you know where is it now i think we can look on like open c stats as we said in the intros absolutely crushing it volume of uh 36 000 eth over the last 70 days 76 000. so excuse me 76 000. who's counting though yeah exactly what's what's a few uh 100 you know doesn't uh eat anyway thousand eve anyway so tell us about the launch of this thing the attributes the the the features um you you sort of explained the concept of nesting i wonder if you could tell us about that again just give us the lowdown on what moon birds are yeah absolutely so um in in classic uh tip of the hat to crypto punks there are 10 000 edition pfp and um essentially what they are they're these cute if you can't see the video these cute little characters that look like you know owls they are owls and they have different attributes in terms of rarity around the different things that they hold so that one that you're looking at there has a little crown on top of its head the one next to it has a baseball cap those have different rarities associated with them and then their eyes are different and their tones of their different fur is different there's one with some some fire hair that you just had up there and when we set up to create this project there was a couple things we wanted to do we'll get into nesting in a minute but let's just talk about the design justin mazzell who's my co-founder and head of design created them all except for the one with a little grump grimlin toad on the head when other great artists called grimplin designed a little toad which is a smoking elon musk on top of uh the head of moon birds but one of the things that we want to do is we wanted to make sure that it wasn't lost on us that as justin and myself the one kind of putting together the designs for this project that we were two white guys doing it so if you pause there and look at that one there that one has like a little tupac kind of bandana tied up and a gold chain around its neck and so what we wanted to do is go out and get a diverse group of people that were our advisory panel on the attribute side so we included a bunch of women and a bunch of people of color um to make sure that they were being represented in the things that they would like to see on these different birds so you know we have some eyes there that you're looking at right there that are the rainbow eyes um you know depends on how you look at a rainbow but oftentimes it can be associated with gay pride as well which we thought was great uh was recommended by one of our members um we have a little do-rag attribute that is amazing by uh it was built we literally did a design session with john gray who you got to watch john gray's ted talk he's actually wearing a do-rag and his ted talk he's amazing um really helped us walk through all the stitching nuance and like what color it should be and all this different stuff and so it was it was our goal to set up and create different um attributes that would speak to different people and then some of these attributes uh would have further kind of utility over time meaning we could do fun things with them so for example once you nest your moon bird and you lock it up at the three month mark we're gonna drop you like the most insane hoodie for all the hoodie moon birds like like these it's really thick like high quality 200 hoodies that are just done by this really great brand that we haven't announced yet but um they'll be coming dropshipped to you as for free as a moon birds holder and we have ones that have chromie squiggles on their head which is a very famous art block uh project so you can imagine what will eventually be coming to those moonboard holders i have an x copy that's going to be airdropped to one lucky winner of our glitch attribute so there's only five glitch attributes um you can pull under if you go to body type there on the left and choose glitch at the very bottom you'll see if you scroll down that center section there yeah i just hit glitch there there's oh sorry there's six of them so if you have the one the glitch there you'll be eligible for that particular airdrop so we we want to have fun both in terms of blanket benefits that will come to every moon bird holder so it won't just be about the ultra rare ones like if you nest your moon bird you will get things like i'll one awesome one that we're gonna do is um we should mention this as well is when you hold and own a moon bird you own the ip for 100 of the iep for that that image so you can do anything you want with it you can you can build a company around it you can sell merch with it on it like we we're not holding this is like the board board apes license absolutely it was a fantastic innovation by board apes to do this it was it was brilliant and so what we're doing at the three-month nest uh the nesting mark we're actually going to send you 250 stickers of just your specific moon bird with your number at the bottom of it that are these super high quality um process that we're having done on these stickers that's just one example of like a fun way to show off uh who your moon bird is and kind of distribute those around to friends or wherever you want to put them uh of course only in legal places uh but we'll have like a moon bird sighting channel on our discord as well does um does a moon bird holder get any of the same benefits that a proof collective holder would they get access to a private discord so there's a private moon birds only discord they're going to get a front row seat to our metaverse so they will have they won't probably get as much land as the proof collective members but they will have access to land in that metaverse as well there'll be other projects that are dropped on top of this it's just going to be a whole like internal roadmap that we have of things that will come to these holders so absolutely there's going to be a lot of there will be overlap there they won't get it's not really moon birds are are more for the community and fun and irl and the meetups and the culture side and then the collective is more the hardcore collect uh nft collectors so the collective receives the research reports things like that so that's that doesn't uh extend to that it's crazy because i really see the network effect what you're building essentially kevin is like if you are a hardcore nft collector like you want to be part of the proof network right because that's where everyone is essentially so you're almost making it such that it's just so attractive to opt into the proof network if you're an nft collector and it almost strikes me that the community almost self curates for you once you've established that hey this is our stake in the ground this is the type of community we're going to become then they just they just come to the community as a result of that which is uh which is fascinating david i think you wanted to say something yeah the it seems to be what you're doing with um the perks like the hood the hoodie birds the pretty mood birds get an actual hoodie uh a nice quality hoodie and your everyone gets the sticker of the of their of their moon bird and it just makes as a moon bird holder i would feel very just like warm and appreciated and fuzzy and thankful that like the the operators of this project are allowing me to have all these perks related to to the moon bird but it's also just a great marketing tool for moon birds itself right you're giving marketing assets to the individual holders right you're allowing the moon bird holders to express the moon bird brand to the best of their ability because they have the hoodies or the stickers or like whatever merch comes with their particular moon bird so like you're you're making sure that the community feels answered and appreciated by but also equipping them with like marketing ammo to promote the moon birds brand uh so i i think they end up borrowing a little bit from like the gary v model because very garyvee had those like redeemable nfts right um but like it wasn't about the art and this is much more about the art and so it's really doing the whole like you actually get perks with this nft but it's also nice to see in your open sea as well yeah i mean that's garyvee was a big inspiration gary's been a buddy of mine for over a decade now and when he first announced that he was doing um v friends and he told me how he was tying utility to these nfts that were very much tied to gary if you look at the first you know drops like you get to go to a basketball game with gary and um i i love that i was like whoa okay that was a big aha moment for me connecting like real world life type functionality to nfts and so let me get you really excited this is where we're going so what hasn't been built and this is very early days is the rails to talk to real world locations so there's no way right now that you can walk in to any location any restaurant any any place and say i hold this nft let me prove it to you you can open your menomask on your phone which is dangerous if it's a hot wallet or whatever right because there's there's ways to like show people a screenshot of something that you say you you own but there's no way to really prove it so how can we build a product and this is for product people so this is what we're thinking about that allows you to verify that you hold an nft on your phone without it being at risk for being stolen from you if someone holds you up at gunpoint right and what so now what does that unlock so that unlocks very basic stuff like you can go to an event and someone could scan your little thing or tap your phone and let you in and say okay oh you're a moon holder come on in right but it unlocks even crazier things when you start talking about the rails that talk to the point of sale connectivity so if there's square or there's shopify um i'm actually talking to the shopify ceo in a few days about this um we want to be able to say okay moma who uses shopify to power all the entry and entrance and i'm just making this up but i don't know if momo uses it but like let's say it's a museum of modern art we're going to do proof moon birds day where it's free and open to all moon birds holder to walk into the moment and go walk around and we can then power and tell and send moma the money to comp and benefit them to be able to go in and have that experience and we can do that at bars we can do that at meetups we can do that anywhere so we can power all of these this this connectivity to physical businesses to unlock experiences does that make sense to you yeah it's super powerful so you're manifesting the digital community into into reality and into the physical and creating like a bridge there we don't have to be there we could say hey this bar and random bar in norway we've seen that there's 25 moon bird holders up there friday night's a meet-up and guess what here's a thousand dollar bar tab to have fun and we just power it instantly and they can walk in and comp all their drinks or food or whatever it may be and so it's just figuring out creative ways to tie the online and offline worlds together that is going to be a big piece of what we're focused on as well that's awesome kevin all right well um i think we want to get to the next section where we start talking about like actually people uh your creators communities thinking about launching an nft and your advice for them but just to tie off this first section and what you've accomplished with proof and moon birds what would you say the big lessons for you have been through this experience like the things you you'd advise or pass on to a creator thinking about doing something like this for for their community both in proof and for moon birds what are the takeaways the key insights for you yeah i guess a couple things like well there's a few one one is um always hold some back for your own like local always hold a few back so when i first launched proof i uh i i basically told all my friends that that didn't that didn't get i'm like oh i held some back and i was like hey you can just have them at whatever the floor was so i sold them off at one eighth and then i actually over promised so i had to go buy some off the secondary myself and so i was i actually had buy a couple at two eth and i was like why did i over promise too many of these um but i would say don't don't focus on the price like when you're going out to launch something like this if it sells without appointment one eth that's fine because it's not about that initial sale yes you'll get that nice little chunk of change to go out and build but the it's gonna be the word of mouth the momentum of what you create to back up what you've just done in launching that sale that is going to drive more and more people to seek that out and want to purchase and hold that utility pfp so or nft so that is is kind of like it's on you as a creator then to go out and and deliver so for us it's never been about okay we just need to um you know we saw how much how oversubscribed we were in terms of the the sale so we had 70 ours um sorry uh 8 000 available spots because 2 000 went to proof collective members of the moon birds and we had about 55 000 applicants that applied to be in the drawing at 2.5 eth and so we could have easily gone out and said hey guess what it's five eighth now and we still would have sold out but we didn't we kept it 2.5 because that was what we promised and so we sold out of that and that's okay because that was the right thing to do and you just have to always listen to the community and play back and do the right thing like i'll give you another example we screwed up and there was a when we were doing the last tranche of the drop so it was like unlocking these different these different people that could then mint there was a 10 second delay between when the mint button went live and when the actual contract allowed those people to mint and so we had a hundred plus each that was lost in gas when that happened and it was difficult because we knew that there were a bunch of scripts that went in there and tried to jump the gun that didn't actually you see the mint button appear and they went in and rushed in a bunch of gas really fast and and so we had some valid people that actually clicked the button and we had a bunch of invalid people that didn't click the button to use bots and we said you know what this is the it's a long game here so we just went and refunded 380 000 worth of eath yesterday wow and and but but it's like that that's the kind of stuff that yes we could have gotten away with it and said that hey we're not going to do this because you tried to do this or xy or z or we don't believe it was right and when metamask was even throwing errors to people saying don't meant this even though they went and clicked go ahead anyway and so we just said hey listen metamask through an air but you click through it but we know we've all been there you get excited about a minute you click any button that comes up right so a lot of people actually get like they're in a t-stool and they're not paying attention to what they're clicking so they're just clicking as fast as possible and so you know it's like you just got to go back to that who am i who am i building for and and what time horizon is that going to be and for us it's decades and that means uh it's not worth the short-term eth versus the long-term vision we're trying to build here so it's i guess it just comes back to always delivery always always be shipping and and uh and and don't set even though the the the excitement can be to go out and build 10 or 15 things but really hone in on the two or three things that you can actually deliver versus trying to boil the ocean i think that's another big mistake a lot of entrepreneurs make in general not just people in web 3. this is incredible i'm you know just recalling the the famous neval quote of long-term games with long-term people and i think you really differentiate yourself by playing the long-term game for community kevin and i may the alpha is just like be wholesome this is like refunding all of that gas it's just like wow that is the right thing to do and it's so wholesome in it it's a shame that it's rare but that that's uh that was that's what differentiates the community and it signals that you are playing a long-term game here um guys we're gonna talk more about this with kevin because i wanna uh ask some more specific questions around uh launching an nft like creators out there who are wondering is the time now for me to launch an nft uh kevin we're hoping you can get into the specifics of what that might look like and then uh maybe if bankless decided to launch an nft all right that's actually looking curious you know yeah just curious as a model we want to talk about all of those things but because we are not yet off the ad drip we also want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to port their ave position across all of the networks that ave operates on like polygon phantom avalanche arbitram optimism and harmony the beautiful thing about ave is that it's completely open source decentralized and governed by its community enabling a truly bankless future for us all to get your first crypto collateralized loan get started at ave.com that's aabe.com and also check out the ave protocol governance forums to see what more than a hundred thousand dow members are all robbing about at governance.ave.com arbitram is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrarium and the d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home all the wild d-fire protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrary has never been easier especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrary through all the exchanges including binance ftx hobie and crypto.com once inside you'll notice arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas feed if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrom.io developer to start building your dap on arbitro if you're a d-gen many of your favorite dapps on ethereum are already on armatrom with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrum.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto all right so kevin where we left things was you were giving us the story of all of the success proof has had and moon birds have had um for creators out there say they want to launch an nft can you guide us through the prerequisites so i'm thinking things like okay what kind of a team do you need at this point to pull this off maybe we'll start there and then we'll also talk about community but let's start with team what kind of a team is required to pull this off yeah it really depends on how technical you are um i would say that for me i studied computer science in school but dropped out year two and so i can look at code and and read it more or less depending on the language um but i'm not i shouldn't be writing it that would just be bad we'd all be hacked and i'd have no money um so so essentially what i did is there are i would say um several really well known smart contract developers in the space um if you're gonna do a utility nft i would say probably just don't go to one of the big marketplaces and mint on there like you want to have your own you know your contract you know your keys if it's your keys your crypto it's your contract and your community so you definitely have your own contract built um the good news is a lot of the the on-chain dutch auction mechanics have been built before we use divergence for all of our smart contracts they're absolutely fantastic uh the main protagonists there um aaron is a dual md phd uh ex-google 10-year google engineer like just as rock solid as they come um aaron and harry are fantastic so i highly recommend them and we outsource that entire thing to them so they just wouldn't handle it at all so we didn't have to worry about that component we could focus on what we're good at which is more web building and um and you know app building and community and all the things that we love to do so um smart contract engineers are very hard to come by and oftentimes it's it's um it's it's easier just to partner with someone for this initial launch i also like manifold i think manifold does a great job on the smart contract side uh they're really really well known for building great contracts for artists as well so um that would be two recommendations there and then you need a front-end engineer that's going to talk to the contracts so who's that person that's going to write that code that javascript and you know work with infura or some of the other alchemies that are bridging web 2 to web3 so that people can connect wallets they can use wallet connect they can mint on mobile and all this and then of course you know all the hardware keys and everything you need to keep your crypto safe um and then you know a proper discord crew that knows how to set permissions and do moderation do token gating things of that nature where it requires you to have the nft to get in i would not recommend doing a public open uh discord because there is just so much spam and and scammers that are out there so i'm very much about the token gated communities um i think that's the way to go and um yeah that's kind of how you get off to the races then you work with an artist um you can find a freelance artist to kind of create your initial artwork if it's just gonna be some type of pass that you have access to um and and that should be it how about other prerequisites in terms of uh community right so you know it strikes me that uh proof very much had a community already that you'd seeded through the proof podcast um do you recommend people have a community before they do this because i think there's a a lot of nft mints out there that think oh we can mint the nft and then build the community on the other side of that what do you think the order of operations should be is it sort of community first or do you think you can mint and then build the community on the back of that it's a it's a great question i think if you are an artist that you're looking to build something in the space whether it be a pfp or put out your own art then you you just start without the community like you just get out there and but if you're on the creator side that is looking to build something on the utility side of of nfts then you gotta you have to have that community first right you just won't sell out otherwise no one would want to to collect um what you're creating so you know if you're a podcast then you have to get your audience up to a certain size especially if they're non-technical because if they're non-technical you can have a very low conversion of people that actually even care or figure it can figure out how to collect these things gary vee if you look at how he did the v friends launch he had a massive community but hardly anyone understood nfts back in those days and prob you know still don't and his community was largely people that weren't in the nft space and so he spent a lot of time and effort on the education side you know how to use metamask how to you know collect get purchased eath for the first time and really walk people through that process which i think most people wouldn't do kevin what do you think uh what's the role that utility nfts just have for creators right let's what's the the the opportunity for you know not just crypto creators but yeah i mean you talked about how like some many many audience members for just the average content producer probably aren't ready to get into crypto but we all think here that crypto's coming to take over the world right so eventually everyone's going to be ready to be a crypto consumer right so for the creators out there do you think that this is going to be a primitive that is going to be true for all creators and and how do you know when it's you should start to look to crypto and look to utility nfts to start to bolster your community and like you said get off of that ad drift so who is you tenant who are utility nfts really for and how should content creators identify themselves as this is good for me yeah it's it's a great question because it's not applicable to everyone right if you have a resource that you are producing that has um people consider to give them some type of information advantage or um some type of knowledge that is valuable to them um or they want a more intimate connection with the creator of that content being able to ask questions or do things in a more tight community versus a big community then i think this makes a lot of sense for those types of creators to have utility-based nfts um i think if you're just trying to to reach if you're a youtuber that just creates funny you know dancing videos i can't imagine this really applies to you at this point in time it also works where there are businesses that have high demand but not enough volume that they can produce so i'll give you an example uh i'm on the board of a winery called harlan estate and very small producer of a napa cabernet and you know the discussions that are that are kind of being had at that level is you have a three-year wait list to get into into a wine allocation right so you can imagine what was a traditional like sit on the email wait list could be a more fluid membership than in the form of an nft to actually gain access to something like that but to take it one step further and this is just crazy the when when wine gets traded and i know this is a completely different genre but it just shows you how broadly applicable nfts are to so many different industries when wine gets traded at the high end it can be changed hands like six seven eight times before it's actually the the cork is popped and it's consumed and so one of the issues is how was it stored was it stored at the right temperature did the actual wine touch the cork so it didn't go dry so it's not like a you know no air got in there and it becomes a cork bottle of wine there's all of these issues right so traditionally it's that is meant someone buys it they take it they sell it to another person sells it to another person that is being shipped all around the country all around the world all over the place you can imagine the issuance of an nft to represent that physical bottle of wine and now you can hold on to it you're going to deem it any time so it actually burns the nft and it sends you in the mail and then you consume it or you can trade it a decade later you know and it's guaranteed proven provenance in storage at the actual winery no fraud because there's a lot of fraud that takes place in that industry as well and every time it's resold the original producer makes a cut of that royalty as well it's just like a beautiful new model for for businesses that have a scarce resource that is in high demand and so you can imagine this happening to tennis shoes there's no reason why people need to be waiting around the block for supreme shoes or supreme gear right like they could have an nft that represents that piece of gear that can be claimed at any point in time comes directly from the proven manufacturer and the manufacturer gets a cut of the royalties going forward this could be so broadly applicable to so many businesses out there and the beautiful thing that i really love about that is it just cuts down on so much waste like we don't physically move we don't need to burn gas to move these these bottles of wine across the country and so like it's it's just instead we just move the token around in the metaverse and that is just an ethereum transaction which you know many people think burns a lot of energy but it actually doesn't and it actually will do a lot less in the future meanwhile the with the wine bottles or just the product stays put and just lets the token float around in the cloud so get this you probably have heard this before but in the luxury world of goods a lot of what happens behind the scenes and it's a horrible thing is they over produce and when they over produce they don't want their goods to go back on the secondary market because it cheapens the brand they're sold at at wholesale or slash prices so they actually physically destroy the clothes and bags and everything else and it just gets put in a dumpster somewhere and out you know it's like basically like shredding documents in some sense now imagine you have a world where you don't know the demand for the sneaker you're about to create and you put it out there and you were thinking uh maybe a thousand and if you would have produced a thousand you you maybe there was 1500 or if you produced 2 000 then your 500 over of the actual demand and so you lose money now you know it's 1 527 and you can go and do just-in-time manufacturing and produce the exact amount without any of the waste it's a beautiful thing that's interesting that's actually a model that we have experimented with out of uh manufacturing and bankless dow which we take in the orders and then we get like 284 orders so we make 284 shirts yes exactly yet yet to tokenize that so maybe maybe that's on the frontier uh and again speaking of the frontier um utility nfts i think just offers like this blank slate of opportunity for creators and we're you've already illustrated so many different ways that you can use nfts and you talked about how garyvee injected utility and that was an inspiration and you also illustrated just how we can aside from content it actually works for stuff like supply chains in a way i had never never heard described before just like for for creators and for other companies out there just can you talk about just how there's just this empty space that's yet to be filled in of opportunity for ways to do to use these utility nfts and i think this also goes back to your time at dig where dig was really just put the power onto the individual put the power on the margins of society so like the the average individual was allowed to have empowerment with dig right that was the utility website but now we have utility nfts and allows for the expression of the individual to come out do you have any thoughts about like what could be unlocked once we allow individuals to really be able to express themselves with how they inject utility into their utility and oh it's it's so cool because in some sense we're actually taking a very old model of kind of top-down media and and flipping it on its head like you know the disney franchises that we all know and love it's they're created by disney the characters are owned by disney the royalties are owned by disney the commercialization and rights of all toys and products and gear owned by disney and disney is a very powerful company in this model with with board apes offering the ip back to the users with moon birds with the ip back to the users you're saying guess what the the users can participate in the value accrual right as something becomes more and more popular and you hold on to these you participate in that upside so it's a bottoms up and then now you actually own a piece of the character set as well that you can go off and do very unique things with so it's just a it's a it's there's so many different things that can be done in this new model like the next disney will be built and owned by the people not by a big fortune 500 company you know so it that's that's very exciting to me that's cool all right kevin so um put these pieces together for us all right so um bankless has a community right now we do we have a podcast many of the community are very uh crypto educated uh what do you think we should do like what would a bankless nft look like do you think like because we we're sort of in this hybrid of um we're spreading crypt of knowledge we're building a crypto community but we're doing it mostly so far using uh web 2 tools right like you know sub stack podcast rss feed we do have the bankless doubt piece of things and that's kind of building off in another direction but we've not unlocked like um what crypto native membership features could be so like what would your thoughts be for us what would your advice be for us if we were thinking about doing something like this yeah it's a great question well how many people are in your dow right now thousands yeah i think there's probably like uh 5 000 or so token holders uh in the downtown and what do they have to have to to be a part of that how many of the token they have to have 35 000 bank tokens to be in the discord and what does that come out to in usd right now oh i don't know 35 times point zero three so about a thousand dollars yeah right a little bit over a thousand dollars so i would allow every single one of those members to be a part of this community for free so they get one of these nfts so you reward them for being your early supporters right and then i would figure out what your number is going to be uh your total like number of how many people you think you would like in this community whether it be a thousand well you have you said there's thousands of people in the in the house there's thousands in the dow there's also on the bankless newsletter there's like 20 uh 200 000 free subscribers you just get this distributed to them and then we have also premium members so we got like this all of these different i guess tiers of memberships you have to figure out how to gracefully roll them up right because you want them all to come along you roll them all up now you have one nft membership nft that represents everything that you do and you have to have one of these have early access to the newsletter early access to the podcasts weekly q and a's with all of you like all the things that you would be providing to across all these different channels is now just done via this nft right and i i think that you have to put a hard cap on it so it's not this ever expanding base where all of a sudden the people that hold it had five thousand they're like okay great we're one of five thousand and then like tomorrow you're the one of ten thousand like i just got half you know so yeah yeah you gotta figure out um what that number is for you all but yeah then i would i would roll it all up and then have this one utility nft that people can point to rather than this being this like floating token number it's like i have my pass this will get me in to see the guys when they throw an event or a live podcast or hold a meet up at this conference or whatever it may be this is my thing and i think that'll be your path forward and you get recurring revenue on all of that right as new bankless fans come in and join then you know you get a piece of that which i think will help fund your business and you can decide whether you know i would definitely do addless versions of your podcast for those users you know save them the time do you think this should be like um like do you like the 1000 fans type model or do you think it should be it should be larger right so we we kind of struggle with this a little bit where part of bankless's mission is to get out to everyone right like on board billions of people to in into crypto and you'll do that with the podcast right like that yeah so that's going to be great but the the deep dive information advantage that you all provide on d5 the reason i pay for your newsletter is because i'm always reading about stuff that i don't have time to go out and research on my own and you give me that killer tldr that i know i can trust and it's not about somebody that's just like saying hey you invest in this and and then that disappears the next day like you do your due diligence and so you have that trust as a community and i would lean into that and so those those are the hardcore people that say i believe enough in this to hold this nft that gives me access to all this additional resources but still you're still doing you know the good work and and putting out the podcast to the masses so you're not cutting that off at all and you know it's like maybe every fifth deep dive article is completely free and you tell them they can have all of them but they hold you know the nft so it's it's a lot to think through do you think um so another part of this kevin is that's been intimidating for david and i because like you know i i do have one year computer sci and then i then i switched by the way in uh my undergrad so neither david and i or are super technical is our question is is the tooling there for for kind of creators like how difficult is this i think when you were talking about it look you need probably someone to develop the smart contracts you need front end engineer that sort of thing how are the tools in the space coming along is it i know it's not sub stack level just like click a few buttons and auto mint but is it um is it easy enough at this point are the tools in place to be able to deploy this fairly easily yeah it's it's a great question in in its early days and a lot of people are are creating the tooling around this what we use right now is a site called nftportal.xyz and that will power all of your kind of dashboard for your users so it collects their information if you want to ship them things you can token gate all of you can talk and get articles there you can talk and get a calendar you can do a private podcast feed there that gets released early so it's a it's a lot of um a lot of what you're looking for can can be done with this tool that's super cool all right kevin man um this is been awesome we invited you on to talk about moon birds but it was actually because we needed you to consult with us yeah we just think you've never consulted the free consult there love it yeah this is awesome uh really fun so i i guess like what's um what's kind of next for the moon birds community and like what's uh what are the immediate next steps for everyone in in moon bird are you guys like just catching your breath right now and and uh we're we're running you know we've got five people right now we just uh got together on monday and we put together a list of our immediate hires we have another 12 people that we're looking to hire for so um that'll be posted up at the moonbirds website or at the proof website and um you know it's all about uh con you know consistent month over month delivering of the things that we promised on so we've got a new director of engineering that just started we've got a couple other engineering candidates that are starting so um you know it's folding all this back in and getting this to be a well-oiled machine and just ensuring that we can ship product which is is my favorite part like that's now that the sale is done i can actually rest a little bit not in terms of my workload but just in terms of like that was the scariest part like i know how to build products like we can build products in the problem like we'll deliver on everything we want to do that's that that i'm confident in it was the initial sale and the smart contracts and all the risk around you know proceeds and all that that um that that was scary but now now we just go build build build so can't wait how much how much time out of the week are you focused on this on on proof is this like a a 40 plus hours a week thing or how do you deal with your time with it yeah yeah so i'm still a partner of trueventures and um you know we we i take a lot of my deal flow and hand it off to other partners we have a fantastic network there and and true is one of our investors is well improve um which is great um and um so that's that's easy for me they we have a you know 50 plus person company they're uh true that that helps take in all the different deal flow and and things like that but yeah my my my focus right now is is just really on this community kevin this has been awesome congrats to the proof team uh into the moon birds community and the proof collective community on the successful launch you guys are absolutely crushing it and uh really excited to hear your story here about this this long-term uh multi-decade game that that you're playing here in nfts and we're excited to see what you guys do next well i'm excited for your june launch of the bankless nft we'll launch at the same time the eth merge happens how about that oh god so what two years yeah something like that it could be three it could be one the developers are are meeting in amsterdam as we speak right now are they right now depths are working that's where i am right now yeah when do you like give me give me give me the five second version when is this launching yeah okay okay so uh i'm not gonna are you gonna get us in trouble by saying a date so we were joking about the same question i was sitting with like anthony cesano and justin drake was with us and we were all getting a beer and so we were joking about all right let's take all of our empty beers put them in front of justin drake get him one more full beer put it in his hand and we'll take a picture of him and be like justin drake says we're merging tomorrow we did not do that yeah if i had to guess if i had to guess um uh august to october august september october always four to six months out yeah just keeps pushing out a little bit better happened this year it's got to happen this year i i think ethan is going to go nuts if this goes well and and the merge is like it's nothing breaks you know like in a bad bad way um i i think it's going to really benefit from from this being a success so i'm exactly yeah i think we're all in alignment on that one we're excited to time our nft for that date so yeah stay tuned yeah kevin this has been a pleasure man thanks for coming thanks guys always
