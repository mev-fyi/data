it's hard to be bearish eat above 3k in my opinion congrats the three-week bear market is oh i'm not excited it didn't say it can't say it it's over this weekend next week we'll see what next week rings all right guys it is the second week of february david what time is it it's the friday bankless weekly roll-up time ryan and this one is going to be a doozy uh this one is going to be like two hours long so uh and i don't even know where to start so many things happened in like every single different sector we got bitcoin stuff to talk about we got exchange hacks to talk about we have social dynamics to talk about we had like the amount of nft things that are happening is absolutely insane oh my god where to even start well we could start with uh the world's worst crypto bank robbers that happened this week okay there was an fbi bus a hilarious story all right this should be circulating on late night it's that funny so we're gonna talk about that 3.6 billion dollar heist and it caught up with them heisted by insane people by lunatics lunatic stay tuned to the roll up just for that story it's worth it also apple uh tap you can now pay via crypto adoption uh blackrock is getting into crypto as well the world's largest asset manager i believe they're finally coming to crypto gucci buying some land where in the metaverse and the crypto super bowl that's why i'm calling it david cause i think we're gonna be inundated by crypto super bowl commercials and uh i might just watch the super bowl for that there's a bunch of there's a bunch of predictions about like all right which nft projects are making it into the super bowl are board apes going to make an appearance what will happen to prices what's budweiser going to do yeah right like yeah people are playing that game right now yeah uh it's going to be fun guys uh a lot of things but at first we want to tell you about a couple of announcements the first is this david it's been a long time since we talked about bankless premium membership and we appreciate our friend uh hardison underscore cj on twitter tweeting this out how i felt listening to bankless hq premium feed episode top secret you know the bankless premium episode david we're putting some awesome content out on that and i think if you are not a premium subscriber you don't have access to that but it's a whole podcast that you don't get it's a whole extra bankless podcast that comes at you in addition to um podcasts come early at you on the premium feed there's a lot of other benefits to you becoming a subscriber anything else you want to mention yeah the in parentheses coffee mug with the semiconductor for the win at trustless date what the hell does that mean well bankless premium subscribers definitely know uh and so the debrief episodes are where ryan and i just like reflect on the episode that we just recorded prior and just kind of uh capture and and connect that to uh other existing knowledge that we think that we have about the rest of the crypto space so uh some alpha question mark yeah also you get a nice um premium badge nft badge for 2022 when you sign up and you can unlock things unlocks things maybe things that are coming in the future you get yield guides premium access lots of good benefits there uh also david we should talk a bit about our friends at xerion this is not my wallet but it's a wallet i would like to have and what's cool about xerion of course is this gives you one-click access to your entire d5 portfolio across chains so it's not no longer just about ethereum mainnet now we're looking at some layer two chains here so we're looking at optimism we're looking at avalanche uh they're adding more networks over time so i think they have seven already listed and a major theme for this year has been the great migration from l1 ethereum to uh layer two and you can bridge within xerion as well take a look at these bridging functions david bridgeore there are so many different bridges and bridges out there there are so many different destinations out there xerion supports seven different chains but all inside of just one xerion application in addition to all the bridges that can get you onto those different chains so uh sometimes i get caught up in choice paralysis like do i use hop do i use connects like do i use where do i go like and so xerion can just make that super simple for you all in one place and that is the power of xerion uh blockchains belong in the back uh and xerion puts itself in the front so you don't have to deal with the blockchain just using zirion nft viewer too it's really it's all your your assets so connect your wallet start using xerion hop across some bridges we'll include a link to the show notes so you can do that all right david mark it's time man bitcoin baby we're happy about it we're happy about it yeah bitcoin started the week at 36 600 which was also the low and it is currently clocking in at 45 000 45250 which is also the high so start of the week at the low end of the week at the high it's the best possible outcome uh we're real happy about it so uh up 20 this week ryan how about ether what's ether doing yeah ether start started the week at 20 2 600 currently at two hundred and twelve dollars uh the high is three thousand two hundred and eighty so almost currently at its high uh up also roughly twenty percent on the week almost as much as bitcoin bitcoin did win the race this week i think bitcoin is up like one to two percent more than e3 this week that's pretty impressive and i i feel like it's getting rid of those uh bull market blues i feel like the market is blue yeah bear market blues uh i feel like the market is moving squarely into like uh neutral territory like we're not sure what comes next but we're no longer as bearish it's hard to be bearish eath above 3k in my opinion congrats the three-week bear market is oh i'm not saying it didn't say you can't say it it's over this weekend next week we'll see what next week brings but um yeah it's it's you know definitely looking good on this pop back up how about the bitcoin ratio how's that looking down just a little bit down i think it was at .074 last week it's currently at point zero seven one so down a little bit um no not too much action there bed index as usual is tracking all of these assets so this is what it looks like on the one week it is up about 7.3 percent this is of course bitcoin ether and d5 also if you want to get in some more risky i i guess a bit higher risk and reward defy assets we have the uh bankless defy innovation index this is the gmi token gonna make it make it it's an index of all of these like defy 2.0 protocols and in addition to uh the dpi this is a pretty good tracker of what d5 is up to and it doesn't look great on the month of course like anything looks pretty good on the week though this week it beat bed on the week yeah so newer defy tokens more experimental defy tokens more on the frontier defy tokens uh more more upside if things go well more downside if they don't but uh this week it beat out the ben index so the bankless gmi index uh which has a much the bet index only has three assets right but i guess dpi has many many many the bank this uh gmi index uh has a much larger number of assets in it um things like tokamak uh things like ohm uh a bunch of the newer like d5 2.0 type stuff and so if that is your cup of tea go check that out at the index co-op application uh another thing to check out is the growth stats on maker they just passed 10 billion die yeah yeah it's pretty impressive you don't have your sound board so you can't click the applause manually that's 10 billion die that's 10 billion dollars of non-black listable stable coins which is really important point die does not have a blacklist and there's 10 billion of them out there um i would like although although i will say you know the usdc or anything that's centralized that is backings in the collateral of maker could be blacklisted but that's uh used to be a higher percentage now it's lower right and it's um you know it can be adjusted up or down based on based on that but that's what that's what the maker contracts do it takes risk into its contracts and it outputs uh this unblacklistable stablecoin so it's supposed to be a risk filter uh using the strength of the mkr market cap and also kind of um uh security through like mingling right like uh and so it i i think it's a fair take to say that like even though that usdc inside of maker vaults is blacklistable uh the die on the other side of that is still like has strong security properties i agree with that take too and i do think that blacklisting is yet another risk that maker sort of tries to abstract and uh you know take away from from dye but what's cool about this is 10 billion is a big number david i remember one of our early bankless podcast episodes maybe the first 10 the first dozen anyway with mariano conti this is back in 2020 2020 i think and uh he gave out a number that blew people's minds at the time blew our minds at the time uh dye was like under 100 million if i'm remembering correctly and he gave this crazy prediction that by the end of 2020 dye might hit 10 billion dollars uh sorry not 10 billion one billion dollars and now here we are at 10 billion it's pretty crazy the market cap the supply of diet at that time was roughly 50 million dollars yeah so asking for a one billion supply was insane now we're at ten billion dollars it was it was in time and maker mkr is one of the few applications that's actually generating significant on-chain revenue via their product and that is what stands out about maker dow versus any other thing that's in defy and for some reason the mkr prices does not reflect it it's the turtleman it's it's slow and steady it's like maternal atmt david it's just like you got to love it it's just cranking up on a yearly basis and actually we say it's slow but this is pretty fast for all other traditional markets to go from 50 million to 10 billion in like the course of two years um let's talk about something else this is why this role is going to last two hours inflation is searching one 7.5 percent this is annualized this is inflation on u.s dollars so inflation is continuing to heat up crank up even more than expected highest since 1982 the numbers just came out i saw this meme i thought it was kind of funny kind of sad what are you going to do you just got to laugh at it this is me watching 200 worth of groceries in 2022 and it's like this picture of like a tiny sink a miniature miniature fruit a tiny sink and a strainer um yeah what's going on i i mean i'm with regards to how this impacts crypto i'm conflicted because like more inflation drives people into harder assets like crypto assets but also more inflation means the federal reserve is going to be more aggressive against fighting that which means they're fighting our assets so like i'm conflicted yeah i um i think ultimately this is part of the same story which is um you know crypto's gonna do quite fine over time relative to to fiat but um yeah who knows what i'll do in the show in the short run i wonder if inflation is going away sometime this year we're going to drop remember our jim bianco episode he sort of predicted that it will get higher it will also peak and then by the end of the year we might see something like three to four percent right as sort of the new normal for inflation moving forward it's hard to know who knows yeah we will figure it out guys crypto is bullish regardless of inflation yeah that that remains true and uh we'll talk about a bit more reasons why it is bullish when we get to releases before we do

the wallet icon to get started all right guys we are back with the hot releases of the week let's start here this uh something is blooming says the lens protocol i think this is ave's social network that's what lens protocol is what's going on here david yeah this is the uh hotly discussed uh social web 3 social media platform being developed by some of the the team behind ave so everyone's kind of hungry for details and we're starting to get some of those details out right now i think the high level tldr before we know too much is that we are taking a social graph as in like imagine like all of your connections on twitter or facebook that's a social graph like a social web all of your connections and then lens protocol is working on building that on chain as part of like the trustless verifiable immutable properties that blockchains give it and so that we can have um a social graph like facebook but that's open rather than closed because facebook doesn't let you you know export your social graph this because it's on chain you can export your social graph and that makes it like you know composable other people can build on this uh is the idea and so this is an on-chain social graph that's being deployed onto polygon so polygon is the network of choice um i think we're all kind of waiting to see what happens next and how this rollout plan uh occurs um we are in conversation with christina from ave who is checking with compliance as to whether she can come talk about this on a bankless panel about uh social media and digital identity in the web 3 era so hopefully stay tuned for that because it's going to be a really hot panel yeah this is a bit more of a protocol than i thought it would be david there's no app yet but i guess that's what you have to build out first is sort of the protocol the primitives for the social graph and then you can build the apps on top of it uh david you're something from celesta so their data availability bridge has launched i believe and celeste is like a data availability layer how would you explain what a data availability layer is david yeah so when you make a transaction on a blockchain it gets embedded into a block and that is you putting your data into a blockchain and all blockchains that have a history help store their history on their data availability layer now we talk about like the modular concept of blockchains and how you can take apart each different module or component and they're the data availability layer of blockchain is just one component that's separate from consensus how consensus comes how things come to consensus is different about what we are coming to consensus about and data availability is what we are coming to consensus about or what we've already come to consensus about and now are now storing uh and so this is an innovation in the storage aspect of what has already been uh having consensus had about yes well so okay so here here's how i think of it so we we've got three layers in the modular block chain right you have consensus that's what's true you have data availability that's what's happened and then you have execution that's what's happening right now and so the modular chain the like the modular blockchain design splits these three pieces up into separate parts and so ethereum mainnet is really going to be the uh the consensus layer primarily and then later when we have data shards it will turn into a data availability layer as well so that means there's opportunity to outsource some of the transactions the data availability transactions which is basically the history the blockchain history if you will to somewhere else and celesta thinks it can be somewhere else polygon also has a solution to this like immutable is offloading its data um somewhere else right now not on ethereum main chain so it's cool to see this uh the space emerge and it fits right into the modular chain thesis that we have if you have no idea what we're talking about right now go listen to the modular blockchain podcast that we put out a few months ago and that will get you up to speed really important concept i'm speaking of polygon david polygon edge it's a new product from polygon they it allows anyone to spin up their own evm chain in minutes so this is like sidechain as a service i think that's how that's how i understand it has layer 2 support more consensus modules trustless bridging that sort of thing uh and you know uh founder of polygon says multi-chain ethereum is coming like it feels like it's here what's your take on this yeah well we've seen how lucrative lucrative it is to take the geth geth codebase and fork it and spin up your own l1 oh you said it not me ryan um but yes avalanche uh polygon edge is turning this into a service like yeah like let's allow anyone who wants to spin up an evm chain uh enable them to do that uh and then it's just a super awesome uh way to capture business in mindshare uh if this becomes a valuable service um and maybe this is a litmus test as to like do actually people want to spin up their own side chains or do they want to just issue their own l1 tokens like what does the market really want um we'll find out yeah i do think that side chains are are going to become somewhat of a commodity if you could just like spin them up and pump them out and print them like this as polygon is doing but it definitely builds the network effect for um for the evm things like this also speaking of network effects looks like some of the layer ones are getting it ftx major exchange that you know of course it now supports arbitrum on mainnet so i think this is withdrawals and deposits to and from arbitram the way binance supported it about a month ago what's weird here is like uh when coinbase where's coinbase yeah coinbase coming in third at least uh i mean ftx saw the demand out of uh using binance to get ether on to arbitrarily so they're like even ftx which isn't inherently ethereum aligned is like oh we want some of that that value too uh so they're doing it win coinbase when coinbase brian don't make me text you or actually we should probably should text them yeah we should we should text them let's let's work on that uh raises on the raises section uh speaking polygon we were earlier they just raised 450 million dollars from sequoia capital india softbank and tiger global pretty massive raise for this layer two which is really what polygon is it has side chains but it has a suite of layer two uh solutions as well and it just goes to show you alternative layer ones aren't the only ones building out war chests right this is gonna be very much uh a fight for the execution layer of crypto and polygon is uh raising a war chest in order to engage in that fight yeah we all know that we're moving into a multi-chain world whether it's a multi-layer one world or a multi-layer two world and polygon kind of has real estate in both sides uh and so it's kind of like a bet on a manychain world and we know that we can't have one dominant single block chain like in order to scale this ecosystem we need to have many chains guess who has many chains polygon polygons got a lot of changes we got chains of every flavor l2 chains l1 chains side chains any chain you want is polygon uh let's talk about this phrase too alchemy 200 million dollar raise at a 10.2 trillion billion dollar valuation crazy 10.2 billion dollars if you guys don't know what alchemy is it's probably because it it sits behind the scenes anytime you use like metamask or many of the apps today there's there's that historical data that your defy apps need to call and likely they're calling something like alchemy alchemy powers a ton of this it's sort of like the aws for blockchain data so we're not talking about kind of the consensus layer running eth nodes so much as all of the indexing that needs to happen to make the front ends of d5 applications work like a ton of that is powered by alchemy so that's how you justify that 10.2 billion dollar valuation just the the massive growth of defy and blockchain indexing um i do think they have plans in the future to decentralize a little bit but they are they are centralized right now um so think of this as like blockchain aws in my opinion any thoughts on that nope that's about right jobs time david you ready man you're not your regular place i don't know if you can get up and dance but i'm sitting down dancing today he's sitting down celebrating guys this is your reminder we do this weekly because it's important 2022 could be the year you get a job in crypto because we got jobs don't we lots of jobs binders full of jobs we've got tons of jobs a senior product engineer at moment ranks a community manager as a contractor dydx governance growth leader dydx business operations and finance associate dydx marketing associate dydx lots of different skill sets here accountant smart d5 web 3 engineer at goldfinch a senior go rust engineer at syndica smart contract tech lead at star x as well i could go on but there's this new feature on the bankless job boards i should mention as well we are building a talent collective so this is a little bit different this is where the talent gets to submit their profile and then the web three companies get a bit yeah it's like so think of like linkedin your own web3 linkedin profile and uh employers come to you so maybe you want to play a little hard to get or just put the feelers out there right submit your profile to the talent section and uh you know web3 job finders web three uh higher talent hires talent acquisition will come find you that's the way this network works let me tell you in this day and age in the crypto industry uh uh the market favors talent more than does jobs there are more jobs than there are talent they will find you they will find you yeah put yourself out there if you are passively seeking it's a good idea and of course uh if you're an employer you know we got some we got some talented folks in the bankless community that you can connect with uh all right david let's move to news talented folks huh let's get into this we have some talented folks we have some not so talented folks as well in crypto to be fair yeah who are they actually talented or not is something that we're gonna have to figure out all right we have to start with a big headline okay so for context in 2016 a very significant exchange called bitfinex got uh atta hacked for what was then i think like 72 million dollars worth of bitcoin uh over a hundred thousand bitcoins i think it was like 116 000 bitcoins so remember 21 21 million supply a hundred and sixteen thousand of those bitcoins was hacked out of the bitfinex exchange michael saylor levels of bitcoin yes yes like yes that's exactly right i think that's exactly right around the right number imagine all of michael saylor's bitcoins getting hacked from this exchange a very big deal this happened before my time in crypto um uh but it just caused a bunch of drama and hubbub and no one knows what happened to the bitcoins um turns out uh the department of justice found the bitcoins uh in the hands of two individuals uh isla lichtenstein 34 and his wife heather morgan uh both citizens uh residents of new york were arrested and charged with money laundering of the cryptocurrency stolen from bitfinex in 2016. the department of justice says that it has recovered a whopping 3.6 billion dollars worth of the the bitcoin i think they recovered something like 90 000 96 000 of the 116 000 so they not not all of it but like significantly most of it so this is a big bust and a good recovery and so you know when i first read this i was i was picturing some like you know elite crypto hackers out there some shadowy super coders right right not only did they heist living off of the united states somewhere else yeah no no you know they didn't only heist billions of dollars worth of krypto but they also hit it for like almost a decade yeah okay so like what are we expecting there and uh yeah so i was expecting some sort of shadowy supercoder to emerge but instead we got something else david what did we get we got these ridiculous insane people who like the the the woman wants to be a rapper and she's terrible struggling influencer significantly struggle rightfully so struggling influencer uh who is like acting like an actual actual lunatic on tick tock and instagram making very just ridiculous raps uh the behavior of these two people who are very very public is insane it's insane who they are they are not right in the head and like i'm trying to like think that it's a show but i don't think it's a show i think it's real um here's a video of her eating these fluffy pancakes and commentating on it uh we'll put the links in the show notes about how crazy some of this stuff is it's just fun it's just good entertainment you know it's one of those things that's like i i watch these videos i'm like why do i even care about this world look at this what the hell what's going on there's okay for the listeners this is a this is the the the lady the woman hacker uh drinking heather uh drinking a bottle of something with her toe with her feet so like bottle in her feet drinking it going straight to the mouth this was this was a couple oh my god it's absolutely billionaires are getting weird david that's what's going like this person's a billionaire hacker right uh you know next slide what is this yeah so this is a terrorist we've had him on the podcast he used to host these like kind of web 3 style talks dinners every now and then uh and he hosted heather morgan once uh once at one of these talks in 2019 uh and the uh the the talk that heather gave was how to socially social engineer your way into anything and so she gave like these i'd say she's qualified yeah clearly she took her own advice i mean this is three years after she and her husband hacked bitfinex right allegedly hacked big bitfinex uh and so like some of the pictures that came out from this were absolutely insane did you have that that tweet uh pulled up oh there's more than this uh yeah scroll scroll down there's a few pictures yeah here we go here we go how to socially engineer your way into everything from proving cold email tactics to event crashing and infiltrating black markets around the world there's something for everyone let's go to the next photo yeah so like um uh actually we'll go to the next one and go to the next one uh okay useful objects for br for event crashing badges press passes professional camera a notebook money for tipping if you needed to buy people your way out of it a black shirt because you look like security layered outfits and accessories this is so shady we actually we actually don't know how we are still discovering how they actually got the bitfinex bitcoins we don't know that yet uh so that is i mean this might be the answer right this might be that they probably socially engineered their way into like 3.6 billion dollars worth of bitcoin right and so okay it's just tldr and social engineering it's not like hackerman where you're tapping on your keyboard exploiting some weakness in big and bitfinex is like walls uh it's it's doing something like calling an employee pretending you're like an exec and you get them to give you some information and so it's a social it's social like you are talking to someone and they just give you something it's way easier and probably like a greater you know weakness in most of our systems and structures uh yeah some places i've infiltrated wow imagine documenting your crimes like this david mm-hmm just for the clout you know you just gotta crazy you gotta make sure everyone knows um this is a tweet from uh alistair uh imagine being a hacker or money launderer and keeping the unencrypted private keys to 3.5 billion dollars of bitcoin in an online account linked to your name mind blown are you telling me that this is how this is where the fbi found it it wasn't like on a ledger it's not on some like you know private keys that they manage you know encrypted somewhere this is on a um an unencrypted online account link so it was encrypted but apparently very poorly so here's from from the doj report they say after the execution of court authorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by liechtenstein and morgan special agents obtain access to files within an online account controlled by lichtenstein those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallets that directly received the the funds stolen from bitfinex and allowed the special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94 000 bitcoins that had been stolen covered bitcoins uh valued at 3.6 billion uh so apparently it actually was encrypted there's another report and uh with the link in the show notes will will provide more details but apparently it's just encrypted poorly uh okay there is good and bad encryption out there and apparently like so they stored it online with poor encryption um under their name under their own names okay but again how we actually know these people attacked bitfinex we don't know we just know that they had the bitcoins and they were like you know money laundering it why did it take the fbi so long to find this i don't know i don't know like we're gonna have to this is gonna be an ongoing like report we're gonna we're gonna be following this one for a while i mean i i think the other big question is uh okay 3.6 billion dollars uh what happens now the fbi owns it this is they've seen stuff in the past and they've like in in you know previous seizures like the silk road they've auctioned it off right right is that kind of what happens or where do the proceeds go who actually should own this money yeah so this is part of this big mess and so there is uh bitfinex attempted to make all of its customers whole again via issuing um equity or ious to say hey we're going to repay you guys once we figure it out and i from like my limited knowledge on this is like they actually did make customers whole again via a combination of issuing this leo token which is kind of like a pseudo equity it was like bitfinex's version of bnb yeah and you actually could see the leo token price leo was a promise it was either it was some sort of like commitment on like uh value or if you ever got if they ever got the pseudo equity kind of thing so no equity with a promise repay bitcoins if it was re uh uh re seized by the fbi and then given back to bitfinex the rightful owner of the bitco of the bitcoins but like customers have kind of been more or less paid out by this by this hack everyone felt good with it they more like it's not like mount gox they felt like they were made whole right exactly you could actually see the leo token spike in price well before this news broke so like people start yeah yeah efficient markets yeah right uh and so but now the leo the leo token price which is in theory and iou based on the backings of the bitcoins that's now been seized it went from something like five dollars to eight dollars on the news that the bitcoin had actually been seized but now there's a bunch of drama about who actually gets the bitcoins because people have differing opinions on this uh so a quote from eric voorhees says bitfinex doesn't owe me anything they made me whole years ago eric voorhees lost some bitcoins in the big finance attack but apparently many customers disagree uh particularly given bitcoin's appreciation from less than six hundred dollars in august 2016 when the exploit hack happened to around forty four thousand dollars now the tokens were worth about 71 million dollars at the time of the hack the bitcoins with and now is valued at 4.5 billion dollars all uh oh there's definitely look this is going to be settled in courts right there's going to be lawsuits from customers like there's going to be this is going to be a long drawn out process to see who actually gets that money right so like some customer says i think that this is ridiculous that's my bitcoin that they took from my multi-sick wallet i would like my bitcoin back aren't off this customer says he doesn't remember if he signed away any rights to his stolen bitcoin while accepting the big finance reimbursement they can have their equity back says arnoff who claims to own about fifty thousand dollars of illiquid bitfinex dock i'll take my bitcoin thank you very much so tbd on how this bitcoin actually gets distributed man uh hilarious hilarious i guess you know what are the takeaways other than like something like this is going to make the best crypto movie ever like incidents like this so a super cringe krypton right are you embarrassed that this is why we're making headlines it's like one of those things like if you go like if listeners are that curious go to the link at the show notes go to this uh heather's twitter page and tick tock page and like watch how absurd her behavior is as in no no just plan it just stay tuned for the moment of zen stay tuned for the moment hide your kids because you don't want your kids listening to it uh it's just you can't make this up you can't if you were to write this down and like give this to like a producer of a movie they'd be like what the hell is this yeah this is lunacy it's absolutely insane it's the best it's the best books will be written movies will probably be made in the future uh this is crypto every week something like this happens and on a completely different end of the spectrum something equally loud also has happened in like the crypto sphere uh this has been a very touchy subject for a lot of people so we're just going to like cover this just the facts ma'am just the facts just the facts okay so the facts are brantley milligan uh one of the ogs behind the ens protocol uh has and also has always been very very publicly catholic had some 2016 tweets uh merged talking um very negatively about um a lot of uh individuals who identify uh in certain capacities he said homosexual acts are evil he also said contraception is a perversion among other things so is porn and masturbation you know catholic stuff out very out loud and open uh and this has the and the thing is like these tweets got surfaced from 2016 but then brantley like doubled down on it on a public twitter space and that's really what really set off this conversation since then i believe members of the en the the non-profit true names limited that employees have voiced concerns about working with brantley brantley has uh his contract has been terminated with true names limited and now as a result of this there is kind of like this cultural infighting i guess about like woke culture versus whatever the opposite of that is and now we're trying to find out like is this woke culture is this cancer culture or is this just people expressing like they don't want to work with somebody that says that they openly hate homosexuals this is something that like the crypto community is trying to like unpack and come to terms with and and come to some sort of conclusion and have closure with um a lot of fighting on twitter it's been very draining um yeah yeah it has been it's just unfortunate i guess we'll kind of leave the story there i think it's you know for unfortunate uh overall uh you know what actually going back to the hack thing the 3.6 billion dollar hack when that news broke i almost felt like it was like some healing for crypto like crypto was getting very like heavy topics very serious right and there's like a lot of vitriol back and forth and then we got this great story and everyone's just like okay let's let's pause let's have a moment and just laugh at the absurdity of what's going on yeah it's getting weird again that felt pretty good uh anyway that's the story we got some adoption news too man big institutions in crypto they're here they're coming so kpmg of canada they just added bitcoin and eve to their balance sheet people that's huge big kpmg canada big auditing firm big accounting firm and they're adding ether and bitcoin to their balance sheet i can't believe i'm saying that two of the big four have bitcoin and ether on their back by the way we told you it would be ether too sorry not bankless listeners i know you guys already know but like we told people it wouldn't just be bitcoin it would also be ether and these are the assets that they're adding uh pretty cool to see blackrock as well what are they doing here david us offering crypto trading uh so diving getting their toes wet into the world of crypto blackrock the world's biggest asset manager biggest most money under management uh starting to get its roots into the world of crypto um i'm happy to say that in the last couple weeks i have helped a or helped convince a blackrock vp person uh exit from blackrock yeah so yeah got them into the world of web three out so should we thank you for this david the soul yeah you can thank me for this one is mine um but you know there's blackrock who's getting into crypto and then there's a straight up working in web 3. um go to where the puck is going or skate to where the puck is going uh but you know good job black rock you're catching up uh trillions in assets i mean they're pretty massive so of course they couldn't ignore this space for long uh neither can apple new apple iphone feature giving merchants a way to accept crypto payments and so i don't know if you use apple pay on your iphone exclusively now you can just connect it to a coin based card a crypto.com visa card something like this and you're basically just paying using crypto this isn't super defy yet but like at least it's um bankless money right ether is bankless money bitcoin is ether uh bankless money you could pay via that which is pretty cool to see here's another uh adoption story from our friends at wells fargo what's this david it's a whole report yeah understanding cryptocurrencies is it too early or too late uh it's too late for you well as far ago so wells fargo finally trying to do some education i have not read this report so we'll see how actually like good it's i their main takeaway is where look at this line cryptocurrencies appear to be near a hyper adoption phase similar to that of the internet during the mid to late 1990s i guess they're listening it's bullish crypto not so bullish wells fargo where do you guys go if crypto's here to stay is wells fargo here to stay yeah i don't know ryan do we just put them out of their misery and just buy wells fargo someday we're gonna at least uh you know the arenas that they have we gotta we gotta replace wells fargo arenas with like bankruptcy arenas yeah um ftx look we already talked about this but uh layer two ftx is supporting arbitrum immutable they now have usdc on the immutable chain on layer so usdc on immutable via moon pay so straight uscc on-ramp right onto the l2 uh i think you can buy with debit and credit cards via moonpay so just easier and easier to buy stuff on immutable uh also set is deploying its perpetual protocol on optimism what is this david yeah so the uh with perp protocol perpetual protocol is being integrated into set which is being integrated on top of optimism so we got we got a trifecta here uh perpetual protocol we didn't meet the nation with them uh if you want to learn more about what they are but uh it's kind of all in the name perpetual protocol perpetuals need to be on l2s because they have a lot of computation they got integrated into set protocol which is uh one of the same teams that's also powering the index co-op and some other assets uh index protocol basically yeah etf yeah uh and now they are also on optimism so kind of in one fellow swoop we got three things on optimism all at once so that's pretty cool stacking these money legos and now we're doing it we're doing the stacking on layer two now which is good stocks and stuff stacks on stacks uh look we haven't even gotten to ethereum stuff but the good news is the merge is coming soon emerge soon then moon actually we'll probably move before that but who knows but the merge is going to happen soon and how do we know it it's because developers are talking about it the people actually shipping the code where you know everyone's usually usually asking these people like okay when's it gonna be done when's it gonna be done so when they say it's coming when they say there are prs that are one major pr away from being ready for the merge that's a good thing and i think that's what peter is saying who is peter and why is this this kind of a tweet important david peter is an og open source uh just open source maximalist i think is the right way to call him just believes in open source uh and has been working on the geth client for since the beginning of ethereum tirelessly without out without thanks sometimes you know without avalanche is built on geth by the way uh and so like the entire avalanche ecosystem was built on peter and the geth team because they were tirelessly building geth because they believe in the concept of open source software peter tweets although not really visible from the outside the go ethereum code base that's geth is one major uh pr away pull request away from being done ready for the merge and that pr itself is also done it just needs test tm ethereum basically saying it's like yo guys like we're kind of ready to like start to break this thing and if we can't break this thing that means we're ready ready uh if so we can't break this thing david i'm gonna say because peter's not but if if the tests if there's not a major issue in the testing process i think this thing goes live early summer yeah i think we're talking june and july yeah as long as we get through this testing phase without bugs what do you think yeah that i think that's right um the merge is coming um there are people murmuring about that's why ether has done so well in the last two weeks it could also just be reverting to me who knows um but the merged trade is definitely a thing did you say reverting to meme mean oh i like reverting to meme too that's good i think we're doing that too reverting to ethan's ultrasound money reverting to meme i think that's what's happening this is uh this is i love these tweets because i never understand what these tweets are oh you don't understand this yeah this is this is when developers tweet out um uh pic snapshots of the compiler the the uh command line and they just get really really excited yeah i have no clue what this means i have no clue going on but this is the time of the year where developers tweet out command line snapshots and get really really excited which means like something is happening in in the development space yeah i'm excited this is a test net from one of the beacon chain developer groups this is from prismatic labs who have the prison uh client so good news too and uh can i summarize a little bit of this for the layman because we we just talked about like the the dev takes um but i think this is a tweet i just put out i still don't think people get it okay ethereum is about to become the world's best bond market after the merge where else can you get a bond denominated in deflation in a deflationary asset backed by an economy with triple digit gdp growth the outflows from fiat bonds go to eth i still think this narrative about eth being a non-sovereign bond store of values uh is like unknown right now david it's like i think that people still don't understand it they still don't get it this is like this is like a t-bill okay except it's it's equity so you get like upside exposure and it's denominated in a deflationary asset and the economy is growing 400 percent per year when i say the economy i'm talking about block blocks based sales that's what it's growing it grew over 400 last year okay imagine that gdp in an emerging economy growing at 400 percent the thing that you're buying is a bond in this economy which is also like buying stock in their publicly traded market and it's all denominated an asset that is a store of value that's deflationary unlike all of the fiat systems like tell me how this doesn't just slurp out all of the liquidity and all of the capital from the traditional fiat bond system i think that's what happens here in the same way that like bitcoin is kind of slurped out of uh all the capital like some of the capital from gold and is on a trajectory to do that more and more over time ethereum's coming for the bond market you know 30 40 trillion dollar non-sovereign or sovereign bond market that's what it's going to do yeah and i i really just want to keep on going on this but we have such a long agenda yeah we did it and you know last thing i would say like so so many so many people there's a lot of been a lot of tribes especially in the last half of 2021 around all these alternative layer ones and people are doing this whole like relational trade these comparative trades like well uh if ethereum is this market cap then like solana should be this market cap or teslo should be this market cap or avalanche should be this market cap that is baking in the assumption that those assets actually compare to ether the asset are you sure that they are actually comparable because i don't think they are uh and so you know once this merge actually happens and some of these actual metrics actually start to become instantiated in the value of the asset we will see whether those uh you can actually compare those things i think it's apples to oranges so do i time will tell it's bullish though look the merge is going to be bullish we all know this um david let's uh let's talk about this uh so this is julian assange tell me about this story looks like it has support from a pretty major backer at this point in time so what is it yeah this is coming off of the heels off of things like constitution dow and um and uh ross ulbrichtau obrichdow trying to get ross out of uh prison for the silk road now we're making assange dao to help fund uh julian assange's basically like probably legal costs which we kind of know i think are coming because he's probably going to get arrested somehow somewhere and so the assange dao has netted 55 million dollars in ether 17 000 ether vitalik buterin donated 10 ether martin koppelman also donated 10 ether and so people are pushing ether into assange style to help fight for julian assange here look it's a crypto use case uh you can't do this with gofundme okay you try to go from it they de-platform you i mean this is what happened with um the canadian trucker incident that that that's going on in in ottawa right now and you know whether you support that or not it doesn't really matter they just got de-platformed by gofundme and actually in this case david gofundme said to you um like the truckers that were raising money for this this protest uh yeah and we're gonna confiscate your donations and give them to other charities that's what they actually said at first rather than refunds right it's like our money system i i don't think that held up under scrutiny but they can do that right uh this is why we need unsensible money systems right whether you whether it's this cause uh saunched out you know or some other cause that you support like at some point in time you're going to be on the receiving end of de-platforming and that's not cool when it happens to you so free money public money systems that's what we need i'm glad there's ways to organize this now uh david we gotta zip through all of the nft stuff that's going we're gonna go really fast here because let's talk about the super bowl though yeah how many ads do you think are gonna be on the super bowl i think i asked you this and like a couple weeks ago and you're like like three or something and i gave a higher number i think i said like seven to ten or something what about now how many ads how many crypto ads or nft ads some allusion to crypto how many do you think we'll see in the super bowl um seven seven see it's up it's up it's by my estimates all right so like we know crypto exchanges are going to be there right you got to see some ftx definitely i would be surprised if not i'm not unsure about coinbase but ftx definitely definitely so there's going to be at least some exchanges there and if you group like the crypto.coms and the mexios crypto banks then you know they'll be there and then we've got like uh bud light and now so we know that one so we know that two strong ones um board apes probably like this is what they they're good at so board apes like a likely third we're already up to three yeah i i mean i think you're gonna see them scattered throughout all of these different brand commercials who just like why do they come to nfts it's clout collection they're trying to get the you know the coolest hippest you know most vibey cult you know culture thing and so they're they're gonna they're gonna have nfts um dapper labs is gonna be there as well so that's like a guaranteed three we already have at least three that are guaranteed so it's a discussion commercial is this just launching nfts for the super bowl is this actually oh i don't know that's true i don't know if this is gonna be a commercial this is super bowl related though i guess we'll see though and um yeah i don't watch the soup like i i kind of watched the super bowl like you know some years um but this year i'm watching it for crypto commercials totally uh i also don't watch a super bowl i just make guacamole and drink ips that's good well you still do that this year with crypto yeah all right and that's not the only thing about nfts uh nintendo also expressing interest in the metaverse and nfts and they feel their potential i mean think again anybody that has a brand is probably interested in nft so you know think mario think yoshi um think all the things that you pokemon all the things that nintendo got they want to make the metaverse out of it and they kind of already have like remember pokemon go um yup what was what was an early version of the metaverse other than pokemon go right and so like this is a natural fit so nintendo getting into nfts yeah especially if you're a video game company like uh zynga they plan to launch nft based games this year we just last week we talked about immutable and gamestop creating a whole marketplace for this uh this is a um a ready player me punks game david what is this this isn't actually a game it's like a meta platform so if you have a crypto punk this is for you uh where you can get a new sort of like avatar to put your crypto punk avatar into and then the avatar apparently can go in many many different games uh and so it's like one one nft avatar thing to that's interoperable with many many many games and if you have a crypto punk you can go claim one of these wow so nfts are becoming like uh you know brand legos in the same way that d5 is like money legos and we're stacking these brand legos up of course who's the biggest brand lego builder out there in the traditional space it's disney and they are hiring a business developer with nft experience right now that's that's a hot roll disney is coming okay gucci gucci is buying digital land in the sandbox as part of a metaverse experience bid gucci the apparel bag brand wants virtual real estate like when i read this headline i was like oh maybe the dot-com bubble of this age is like the metaverse bubble a little bit you know you know all the brands uh do you remember way back in the day there was this virtual world called second life where all of these brands started like putting up you know shops storefronts and that sort of thing it totally died off because people like second life was boring people didn't actually interact on it i wonder if this time it's a little different and i i i understand why people resist that language this time it's different but this time we have economics assets property rights and i think that's the thing that's been missing from the virtual worlds and the metaverse this entire like that's the thing that gives triggers that's the thing it will trickle bubbles it will trigger bubbles but also it will trigger real organic things that last and don't just like do the second life thing where it's kind of a ghost town of branch there will be some ghost towns don't get me wrong i just think previous digital worlds didn't have the the energy and life breathed into them that um you know that crypto brings with with property rights at the base layer right how do you in a virtual world how do you in like in the second life gucci store how do you buy stuff without crypto like right and how do you how does money work how do you like um i guess become an entrepreneur and how do you like you know develop develop some some piece of property some land or some asset and make it better and receive upside for that right it's like everything is kind of owned at the end of the day by second life isn't it uh anyways we'll see how that develops yeah celebrities too brie larson she's buying nft what's this uh this is a new nfc that i've seen actually only celebrities get so maybe celebrities are finally ahead of me and are you telling me they have their own telegram channels they're from running us now yeah probably yeah celebrity alpha nfc follower girls nft bought by brie larson uh if you want to uh experience what anti-nft hate is you can definitely scroll down on this tweet oh cool for yourself there's some free larsen hate too i'm sure oh my god that is a lot of capital letters oh my god oh this one's this was so someone just took a breath before they just typed in all caps for like okay so here's the top reply to brie larson's nft oh my god not you two i don't know how many celebs need to hear this but takes deep breath it's literally written out nfts and crypto are horrendously bad for the environment worse than the entire carbon footprint of some countries so bad is tearing kazakhstan apart in civil war nfts are apparently causing civil wars in kazakhstan look at how many likes this has david almost 12 000 likes it's got more than the parent it's she's been racist she's got ratio she got ratio look this if you if you haven't listened to bankless long enough to know why this is a terrible take and completely false and inaccurate uh definitely go listen to some more episodes uh that's just crazy it's just like false stupid rac has a fantastic thread we'll talk about that in a hot summer yes yes heidi klum heidi klum it has a crypto punch so basically yeah me and her she didn't go four days basically are basically bffs no she has way too much taste um yeah so uh yeah well welcome to the family heidi uh but one turtle but when turtle seriously winter wind turtle yeah that could be next i'll ask her um what's happening here china you're getting into china cbdc type stuff i think there's there's there's three things here david that uh all have the same thing in common maybe just like read them out real quick and talk about what they have in common uh yeah so we uh we got uh china and the cbdc at the uh that the olympics that's currently going on uh we have russia also coming to recognize crypto after recently banning it question mark and then also an el salvador bitcoin ban so three different countries bond bond thank you um three different countries all doing some positive things in relation to crypto uh interestingly enough china rolling out the digital wan allowing a lot of people to use it in china while these olympics are going on has actually triggered the attention of the american regulators and they're kind of like oh what it's real like oh it's people are oh we have to stop this stop using that don't use that that's bad we don't want you to use that what better sanctions we're going to have another hearing about this american cbtc we'll rate two more white papers absolutely ridiculous uh so uh so some oh [ __ ] moments happening from uh the west about how china's cbdc is working at the olympics and now people are able to experience it for themselves so that so there's that um all right next one which is russia coming to recognize crypto unless you yeah i think the unifying theme here is like all of these countries are kind of like um a little fu to the imf right i mean they see the imf is sort of a rival power they see um yes systems like swift being used for uh western u.s sled sanctions and there's you know they're they're they're opting out they're opting out of that and you can kind of understand why but this is basically the game theory that crypto proponents have always predicted this is the way that crypto gets propagated where you know some country says well your payment system your money system is not credibly neutral it's not credibly neutral so we're gonna either go off and build our own or just default to one that is credibly neutral for the world and this is what you think putin is like embracing freedom here he's just like you know what i'm i'm listening to bankless and i'm real excited about the the liberation these guys are right yeah those bankless guys are right i mean look at the potential for freedom for my citizens and for the world and so that's why you think he's saying that no he's just saying f-u-i-m-f us doesn't control me so we're just gonna embrace crypto to piss him off that's what's happening that's the game theory and the insane amount of sanctions that united states has on russia makes it a very easy choice to make it's like well i can't use the global financial system because of sanctions uh i will use crypto like it's just a logical conclusion and so how does the us react as a result of this do they do they double down and go like start shaking their finger at the rest of the world and saying nope you have to use our swift system no one no one used this or do they wisen up and actually think about how they can embrace and adopt crypto as payment rails maybe export the us dollar in order to try to retain some some reserve currency status of the dollar and also adopt these credibly neutral rails obviously we think they should do the second and by the way guys we had a fantastic podcast with representative tom emmer that we're releasing next monday where we discuss this very thing so a member of congress who is uh you know sees it the way we see it and is actually fighting for this sort of thing in in congress so stay tuned for that but look the geopolitics continue to play out and crypto remains a big part of the story el salvador as well you know they're just like doing a bitcoin bond uh hanging in there um did you see this by the way so ryan selkis our friend he went on fox news he was on tucker carlson did you watch this i i did not watch it but the face the two faces right here are fantastic yeah it was great here this is like memeable as well this is a meme template i i mean the tldr is is basically you know uh ryan's had some things to say negative things to say about the biden administration's handling of crypto and of course like you know fox news and tucker carlson absolutely eat that absolutely eat that up and so invited him on to talk about um the us's you know strategy on crypto and how they're falling behind so good conversation but look this is another example of crypto bleeding into every area of of media and gaining some mainstream attention you'd never see this sort of you know interview a few years ago i'm looking forward to additional interviews beyond tucker carlson same okay so this was pretty interesting speaking of media uh binance taking a 200 million dollar stake in forbes um i think the play here is binance has just like bought 200 million dollars worth of positive pr uh that's my kind of kind of negative take but i think it's pretty accurate yeah i think that's a good take and um i've always you know with crypto banks i think we've always like been excited because they're pushing the adoption of crypto yet also been wary because they can become the next centralization vector right and so like what happens when a major crypto bank starts owning the media it's not something a protocol can do ethereum is never going to own a forbes and be able to like you know co-opt and covert media and so it's okay right now for crypto adoption but uh it's just another centralization vector so yeah like i look at this with some hesitation binance or forbes says finance good yeah exactly coming to you soon exactly um david uh we're going to get to the the takes of the week in just a moment but guys we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible first stay tuned when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically

change how we use d5 and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitrarium and arbitron's d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitram you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nft projects building on arbitrary many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrum.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitrary using bridge.arbitrum.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free all right guys we are back with some takes of the week let's start here this is a take written by cooper turley and lucas campbell from from the bankless team web 2 allows you to focus on the quantity of your fans web 3 allows you to focus on the quality of your fans interesting distinction quantity or quality over quantity is the difference between web 3 and web 2. what do you think this means yeah i think the connection here is that because we have native money and things like private keys that allow us to put money directly into the hands of users we can actually start to reward users differentially based on their value to the artist or value to the system so what this does is that if you are of an individual fan who is you know the biggest fan of all time like you can be rewarded for expressing that you are the biggest fan of all time where in like if you're the biggest fan of all time but you're just listening on spotify you are intermingled with lesser fans uh and so web 3 and private keys allow you to more granularly acknowledge the differing levels of fandom in this base uh and so we are allowing actual quality of fandom to rise up out of the there's the sift so the basal level of just like spotify plays this is the rise of the super fans and uh web 3 definitely provides a conduit for for that it's less less of an aggregation technology the way web 2 has been um this is your take david uh why don't you read it out yeah uh so i've been trying to uh help my friend get onboarded into into layer twos and we're doing some uh some airdrop farming on our arbor trump which i think everyone's trying to do these days but then i was like had this like choice paralysis as to like how to actually use the applications on arbitrom in a way that would actually cast a net to like farm the airdrop and i was looking at all the apps i was like farm a future arbitrary airdrop that you're speculating on yes yes oh yeah right exactly thank you for that um and so i was it just made me think like how are these layer twos actually going to distribute tokens because it seems like a really hard problem because we want to reward whales and liquidity but we don't want to centralize the token supply we want to mitigate air drop farmers which is kind of what we're doing but without also disqual disqualifying small fries like how do you how do you differentiate people that just put 500 or 200 into arbitrary and just because that's all the money that they have versus people that are spreading out 200 all over the place on many different addresses trying to farm the airdrop like how do we do that uh and also how do we fairly reward applications that have differing uses and different differing different levels of adoption and quality like really i don't really see a good solution to algorithmically retroactively do this uh in the same way that like ens or uniswap had a fantastic like programmatic sort of um you know retroactive airdrop and so really the only way i kind of see this like working out is like a top-down best judgment distribution from the actual teams so this is just something i'm thinking about if you have ideas about how layer twos might distribute airdrops uh let me know because i want to use that strategy also we published an article on bank list this week about some speculation from uh william pister on how this how layer twos might do that so uh link to that in the show notes as well um here's another take by rac and uh i think this whole thread is really worth where the whole thing is fantastic it's a thread about nft hatred he starts it off like this okay so you hate nfts cool let's talk about it this is a an artist music music artist great artist so coming from a creator background and he is talking about um the benefits of nfts and i really feel like he is he is addressing the criticisms head-on it's like a tweet or so and it's definitely worth watching there was a a large youtube video that that blew up like got four million views or something like this do you remember what that was called david uh line up something yes sign up something yes uh anyway i go up yes line go up this this massive criticism about nfts and i feel like rac is hitting them thread is addressing them head on we probably don't have time to to go through all of them but how about this this tweet i'll i'll read it out david and get your comments a lot of people seem to miss the entire point of nfts is to make content free while making ownership scarce nobody is forcing you to pay for an nft you can still enjoy it for free alongside everybody else you like my music you can have it for free that's the thing is like what i don't understand about the whole nft anger hatred is it's not a zero-sum game here like people who hate nfts like you're not losing anything don't buy them this is only upside for the creator the creator gets this not some big corporation you know faceless evil empire music um record label executive it's the creator it's directly to the creator uh something i've never understood about this argument what do you think he said yeah this goes it goes back to exactly what we were saying about web 2 is quantity in web 3's quality with that allows fans that really really care to buy nfts and that is the funding model for artists to incentivize them to produce more total aggregate free content let the people who want to pay the money pay the money so that the artist can get funded without all these intermediaries taking their unfair cut so that the artist can be more creative and do more creative stuff i think people are still just wrapping their heads around what it means to have like internet property ownership where in like before in the web 2 world there was no such thing as owning anything digitally on the internet and so like now that we in the web 3 world we have digital property that means that like i have this thing and you don't have it and you not having it is i think triggering to a lot of like the web two folk that haven't got their heads wrapped around it oh yeah that's an interesting point yeah but they haven't if they haven't considered that no they actually still have the free content and in fact it's actually getting even better because we've made this new property thing that's going to the web 3 people so i think web 2 people are just kind of seeing being being excluded and they're not seeing the increased total quantity and quality of content come out of that yeah there's some social dynamics that are that are definitely playing out and some push back um let's uh let's talk about justin kang so he's the guy who built twitch twitch of course has millions of users and he tweets this out um yeah i built twitch has millions of users and gaming nfts are way bigger really cool to see web 2 builders that are super bullish on gaming on nfts on web3 now that's starting to happen i feel like this bridge between web 2 builders and web 3 builders is starting to be crossed yeah and of course the most the the next tweet following that threat is a anti-nft hater let's see how many i really got oh only 200 okay not too bad yeah that was that's bad okay uh yeah when the guy that built twitch says that nft's gain and gaming is going to be way bigger uh yeah uh big deal yeah uh alpha league two he's coming on overpriced jpegs or bankless podcast with carly riley if you are not listening to that on a regular basis you should be especially if you want to stay up to date on nfts it is the bank list for nfts yes it is the nft alpha that i go to because nfts are just too big of an industry for bank list to cover so yeah and i'm still here collecting turtles okay it's like what do i know about nfts dear god um speaking of web 3 is web 3 an echo chamber this is a a take from uh bante yep i thought it was a fantastic take this the first time i've ever heard a take like this is uh bitcoin is money for enemies as in like two enemies can send bitcoins to each other because they can use bitcoin as they i really like that line bitcoin is money for enemies yeah uh and so bantek is taking this to web 3 where web3 is a place to share with your enemies if you think that you can make everyone conform to your echo chamber you're either naive or in the wrong business because web3 is open public permissionless protocols everyone's going to be on them and so like with all of this like crypto twitter infighting that we've had in the last like two weeks it that's just mass adoption that's just different communities coming into the same spot and like bumping into each other uh and that's kind of what we're gonna have to figure out how to establish some sort of stable equilibrium and that will just happen over time but yeah the web 3 is not an echo chamber it's literally got all the opinions in it well i love that in web 3 you can't ban people you don't like i love that it kind of forces um forces people in the same room together as he put it it's it's yeah hug it out hopefully right resolve your differences hopefully but we're all there together um that's cool all right man look we're almost at the end of this episode and i feel like we just rug pulled everyone because we said in the intro this is gonna be two two hours which goes to show you david and i have no idea how long these episodes are gonna last on a weekly basis we just have no concepts we did a pretty good job of going real fast on this one yeah we did uh i guess yeah nice so just turn that into a compliment um what are you excited about this week though as we end things david yeah so what i'm excited about is uh i kind of said this earlier when we talked about ethioset ethiosite we we just did that show with ryan alice about the dcf model for eth and then a community member came in with their own version of a dc dcf model and said no like i think these are the numbers we have people debating about the numbers and the metrics of ether the asset that is the only asset that has the properties to be able to even facilitate that type of conversation and so when ether when ethereum goes through the merge and we have uh the reduction of supply issuance because proof of work goes to proof of stake and the average individual can stake at home or stake through some service the what ether the asset is fundamentally changes in the whole comparative trade about like well if ether is worth this solana should be worth this that's just going to go out the window because these things you can't compare these things at that point in time and so what i'm excited about ryan and i know it's gonna be a little toxic ethmaxy whatever it's being able to say i told you so around the time of the merge when eth just does some gangbusters price action either before the merge or right after the merge or for like the next following decade uh the differences between ether the asset and every other asset inside of crypto and also outside of crypto is uncomparable uh and so i'm looking forward ryan to seeing that play out and and having people say like oh like oh they were talking about what is now everyone else is talking about for david it's not about making money it's about being right it does i mean look i i i i understand what you're saying because it has felt like sort of um for a long time uh being a prophet in the wilderness like we were talking about eth and its value proposition since 80 dollars on on bank lists right like a couple of years ago and so we're already on the path to uh to some of that that you know gratification of like like being able to to um talk about and i i do think that merge will be another major catalyst on that trajectory um that's cool man i know you're totally excited about that too ryan but i know you're also excited about other stuff so what else are you excited about yeah i'm excited about other stuff you know what this week it kind of hit me uh with the whole you know the whole 3.6 billion dollar hack and how crazy that was and how you know the lunacy of that thing that everyone just can't stop talking about crypto like it's saturating everywhere it's like because we got everything this is a car every week it's a carnival and we get to do this on the roll up so it so it feels like this like it's finance so we have the bloomberg side we've got uh entertainment so this is like the you know e-celebrity news sort of thing we got all these celebs buying in we have politics we're just talking about russia and china geopolitics beijing olympics we've got economics okay this is about like wealth inequality and like you know bringing more people into the economy we got technology it spans all media and people that's why people can't stop talking about crypto and it's going to saturate every single part of media the way the internet did um so that's what's cool to me it's just it's all the weird stuff that happens it feels very weird like it feels very natural and it feels very organic and uh i don't think the world's gonna be able to stop talking about crypto and ultimately what is that it's bullish that's bullish for this asset class because even when they're saying negative things about it they're talking about it aren't they and uh i i don't see that going away anytime soon we're gonna continue to be in the news cycle for either some weird entertainment things some celebrity adoption a new music artist like billions of dollars in hacks like it's going to be in the news cycle for this entire decade that's what uh that's what i'm excited about and i think that this goes to show that crypto is about everything like it's not just money crypto is going to take over the world because it's relevant to literally everything that is like the fundamental bold case for crypto it's relevant to politics it's relevant to geopolitics it's relevant to money it's relatively financed relevant to culture everything just how like exactly what you said the internet touched everything crypto will also touch everything uh so the fact that everyone's talking about it is just you know one of the big fundamentals behind this whole space bullish crypto content producers i think david yeah we're never good at it you know here's a funny story when david first started security when we first started this podcast i was like uh but can we do a weekly podcast are we gonna have enough things to talk about each week this is when we were doing one episode a week that's what i was worried about at the time yeah now we'd have 4.5 episodes a week 5.5 if you're a premium subscriber oh there you go yeah uh nice premium show at the end david glad we fit that in um hey maybe the week time what are we looking at this week boom okay so this is of course a reference to the bit for next hackers where we have the expectation where the hackers are like the ozark family i'm not i don't follow this uh i just watched it i watched like the last season it's good yeah okay so ozark family i'm assuming some sort of like very professional well done uh optimized uh hackers of some type yeah money they're professional money launderers basically right there you go yeah good at their jobs uh and then in reality we have these two like squares like insane lunatics who uh i mean i guess they were successful money launderers for a while struggling influencers struggling influencers who had held almost four billion dollars worth of bitcoin on private keys that were on a cloud database and poorly encrypted guys that's the mean of the week just waiting waiting to see what happens next week lesson learned if you steal four billion dollars worth of bitcoin don't don't store it in the cloud david i'm gonna i'm gonna shout out risks and disclaimers but uh first you want to give them a teaser of the moment of zen that's coming up just don't listen to it it's terrible it's so bad it's it's the it's heather trying to be a rapper don't let your don't listen to it don't let you definitely don't let your kids listen to it but after ryan gives out his disclaimer it's coming yeah it's definitely risky it's probably the riskiest thing about this entire episode of course though none of this has been financial advice ethan's risky bitcoin is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey and now it's time for your moment of zen i'm a [ __ ] bad [ __ ] go on make me a
