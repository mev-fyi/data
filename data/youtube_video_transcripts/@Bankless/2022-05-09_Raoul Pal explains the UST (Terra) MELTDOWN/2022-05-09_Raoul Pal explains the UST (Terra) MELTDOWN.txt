uh can we talk about scary things in crypto right now oh god what's happening with you ust price and raul i don't know if you want to pull up a chart too it's uh not looking pretty i just i just interviewed doe this morning by the way well you when you hopped into this uh recording room ust price was at 98 cents being defended uh do you know what it is right now no it's at 92 cents yeah so that's a billion dollars of stable calling market cap that's gotten a race in the last uh 30 minutes uh and uh as a i'm monitoring twitter right now and uh the luna guard the luna foundation that has the btc has just sent their btc outbound so they are probably in the process of liquidating so they liquidated 500 million yesterday i don't know but yeah you're the one that talked to doe quan more recently yeah so they liquidated 500 million yesterday um jump trading who is the market maker i think we're liquidating eth um and look i don't know how much lfg have but i think it's what three billion dollars of of um bitcoin well what's happened is that never made it onto the curve uh because they weren't set up with the four pool that we're putting on curves so they're just having to liquidate the position in the meantime so the market's always going to test this stuff right this is what the markets do is you want to test the fragilities and this is an s curve moment for the entire um algorithmic stable coin idea i mean all of them have failed so far so let's see whether they survive it or not i mean i hope they do because it would be nice but it's not sure right yeah do you have any opinions on just like the systemic nature of terra in this whole ecosystem because they're using non-terra assets like bitcoin and avalanches also in their portfolio to defend the peg uh so like the the concerns that people are having is that they are going to dump the rest of the market before they have to dump their own assets well this is the margin call what i talked about right it's exactly the same thing um and so what's happened is they're um they're now getting asked for the collateral back i mean it's exactly what i talked about and it's going on this is what you expect to see at this phase you know this is a liquidation phase and that's when somebody taps you on the shoulder and say i want your collateral back and you have to sell it so in this case it's the bitcoin interesting because this has been much of the talk of the previous weekend is what would happen if you know tara had and ust had kind of a meltdown moment and your perspective seems to be well they're just like any other participant with collateral that's that's underwater and the markets have to flush we got to flush this out of the system and then your markets go down and then we kind of move on so we i guess what is your take on that because um some people are very fearful of a massive meltdown if like and we should we we should say it's not clear that ust will kind of fail but there's only three billion dollars to liquidate so that's it it's just another big whale market participant three billion dollars it's not massively systemic risk to the crypto system or to define your mind no i mean does does this change the anchor protocol i don't know what the knock-on effects are um you know as you said maybe there's more knock-on effects in avalanche i don't know it's a very complicated ecosystem terra so i don't really know it inside out much like you know try and pick apart the the ethereum ecosystem it's immensely complicated nobody really knows where the fault lines lie who's got the leverage who hasn't but you know markets like this this is what they do they find that they find the weakest hands um and drive drive it into the strongest hands i mean that's just always the way of the world what the clearing price is i don't know because i don't really know how much leverages or margin because this wasn't so much leverage as just the kind of margin the collateral of this system being asked back dokwan just tweeted out deploying more capital steady lads um so this is this is kind of the moment right where like do they have enough ammo in the reserves to to defend the peg or is it is it all going to get depleted i don't know if it's three billion or not but uh uh well you sound more informed than me but like can the crypto markets can be the bitcoin markets like accept three million or three billion dollars of liquidation depends on how fast it happens right um it's it's possible and we don't know who the buyer is one point sorry to cut you off 1.4 billion it just got sent out of the bitcoin luna reserve wallet um like obviously they can choose to sell that at any rate that they want but 1. 1.4 billion is the number you know what's kind of funny to me as we're all talking about this is um the fact that we get to see this all play out on change the data in real time like ralph this has to happen all of the time in traditional markets of course it does the public doesn't see it we're not talking about it we do see it sometimes right we saw it like the european debt crisis that played out in real time on our screens but a lot of the time you don't the play-by-play yeah normally you don't because it's some bloke at a bank calling up and saying but sometimes it happens on a gigantic scale which was like grease blowing up in italy and spain and here it is in the crypto market the bigger question is is let's assume that this is a show and that this continues in them and there's other leverage to come out of this system from some of the defy uh ecosystem what does it mean for regulation we've had terra uh before and uh the folks kind of the bull in the bear case for tara and part of our sentiment has been like hey let's not screw it up guys like uh there are regulators there are legislators like elizabeth warren who are already biased against our industry and will be looking for opportunities to scapegoat the entire industry and point out when things go haywire and this is a concern i have uh about kind of more centralized algo stable coins and i'm wondering what your take is on this so let's think let's assume this is a show it may not be hopefully things come out on the other side it doesn't go in that direction but let's assume it goes in a negative direction what do you think the regulatory impact might look like i think it's going to er towards and i've always thought this is nobody no governments wants unregulated stable coins they want central bank digital currencies whether their private sector or state sector i think there'll be a blend nobody wants this so they they will use this as an excuse and you know it's probably good for people like paxos and it's probably good for people like circle and it's not so good for tether and it's not so good for terror and you know the problem is if we are using borrowing somebody else's currency then we have to play their game whether we like it or not to their currency you know so anybody thinks that oh just because we've got some algorithm it's not the federal reserve's currency smoking crack [Laughter] i mean crypto is importing the unit of account of the dollar right and so i don't understand that take correct i mean it's like the sec quashed anybody trying to do synthetics because it's like well this goes back to the role of a bitcoin or an ether like a monetary asset that doesn't have an analog to the real world and the value of having that in the crypto system and keeping us more resilient that way because in these cases we are not borrowing the unit of account from any central bank exactly and i don't have an issue with stable coins i mean i think they're very useful because we need to integrate from our you know from the sovereign systems we live in to these digital web 3 world and and that that's an integration tool and it works very well so i have no issue with that but the key point is yeah if you're if you own ethereum or bitcoin or others you own them it's not somebody else's liability it's not their asset i mean the dollar it became absolutely clear to to the russians that they thought they owned dollars as their own asset they didn't the u.s had lent it to them it's like you know you've you've got to realize what game you're playing here and that's why you know i think the stable coin industry as is is going to shift towards the high regulated and i i don't really have a problem with it sure we're all utopians and we'd love this other world but we also need to be pragmatists if we want this world to win we need to realize that some battles we will fight and others that we can't win i do i do still think it's a net win even in that world of corruption you get regulated staple coins because what are they ultimately settling on it's crypto rails exactly and we're just a value accrual accrue it it accrues to crypto it's not a ban of ether bitcoin or anything if anything like the assets that are underlying the staple coin system become these more base crypto native assets so it's still a win even in that zone totally agree hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq
