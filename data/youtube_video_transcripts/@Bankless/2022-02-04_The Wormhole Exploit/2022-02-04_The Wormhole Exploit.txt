wormhole network which is a ethereum two solana bridge had an exploit that allowed the exploiter to mint a bunch of solana ether and that came out to a tune of a hundred and twenty thousand wrapped ether what is this exploiter gonna do with all the money well okay so they can't touch usdc they can't touch usdt they'll get frozen you can't just wash a hundred thousand units of ether through tornado cash like you can maybe do like a couple hundred each a week but like if you you have to pull it out into different wallets but then also like sure you can you can start to liquidate like the the trickle of each that you push through tornado cash so yeah you exploit something for a quarter billion dollars and then maybe over the course of one year you can discreetly withdraw one million dollars but like what the hell do you do with the remaining 249 million dollars you just keep it neath you take out some loans use it in d5 i don't know that's an option to do what if you can't do it where is it it's stuck there
