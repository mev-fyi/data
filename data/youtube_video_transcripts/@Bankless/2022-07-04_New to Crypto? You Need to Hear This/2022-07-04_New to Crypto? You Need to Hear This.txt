advice you have for these first cyclers for the newcomers that are down bad Eric what advice can you give them to make them feel a little bit better so I'll just be blunt and honest first and foremost don't expect gains that people got by being in early so don't expect that in a year or two years you're gonna gain 2000 x 100 000 X whatever it's just it's not gonna happen again like as the market cap gets bigger and bigger it's almost impossible right like you we're at a trillion dollar market cap or whatever you're not gonna get another 2000 X on top of that overnight reeling your expectations if you're here and you're invested and you believe in things I think that's what matters most so don't be here if you're just like you your neighbor told you to buy crypto and you think it's gonna go up right like find something that you believe in maybe you think the merge is cool like find something in this community that you actually believe in because I think even when you have a big downturn you actually believe in the technology I know that's a meme but it's like it's actually true you're gonna hold on I think if that goes down
