want to start to get into some more specific things about like the current state of d5 what parts of dfi are preventing the pi from getting a lot larger the central thing that we're working on right now at vault you know directly at the moment is this liquidity management system where you know people may be familiar with the die savings rate you know so there's a version where people can take their die stable coin and lock it to get yield it used to be some yield on it now it's it's been one basis point for a long time and the idea that a stable coin could be natively yield bearing yeah we initially created vault as the idea of the inflation resistant stable coin and a hard target on that u.s consumer price index inflation peg all we've realized of course is that in some market conditions the risk that's needed to achieve a hard target may be unacceptable it's a magic number and we need to get rid of it the goal of the system is still to preserve user value and i'll create a marketplace where that's possible but it's just that sometimes it's not up to me to decide that eight and a half percent interest is the right amount at the right risk level
