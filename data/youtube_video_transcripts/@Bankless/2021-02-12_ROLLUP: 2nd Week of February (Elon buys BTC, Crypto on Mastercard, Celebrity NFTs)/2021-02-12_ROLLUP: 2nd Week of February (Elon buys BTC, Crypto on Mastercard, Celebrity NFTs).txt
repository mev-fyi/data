[Music] bankless nation welcome to the second week of february david what are we doing today we are rolling up the second week of february in this weekly blips we go through five at different sections to make sure that you can stay up to date with the crazy world of crypto we start with the markets we talk about what's going on in the markets what are the markets saying then we go into uh releases what got released who released what products in the crypto world then we go into news what happened in the news cycle then we finish up with some ecosystem takes who had interesting opinions this week and then we finish up with what david and ryan are excited about and of course our new section which just takes a little bit of time at the very end which i'm in love with this new section the meme of the week the meme of the week it is finish it off it's it's hard to pick the meme of the week every week and it's hard to condense all of this crypto information into a hour 45 minutes segment how long does it take us these days david i i don't know we're getting it down depends we initially committed to trying to get this to be 25 minutes and we gave up on that like roughly three episodes in so now now we do this in about 45 minutes all right it's a week of crypto in 45 minutes the bull run uh edition of rollups is going to be a bit longer guys but we're going to cram this into your brains as quickly as possible david you ready to start yeah let's do it all right let's roll him up uh the markets let's start with bitcoin price david what is happening in bitcoin land oh you know just a few things uh bitcoin had reached an all-time high new all-time high of 48 000 after elon musk and tesla announced that they bought 1.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin it's the largest single announcement of a bitcoin purchase ever and so not only did that the actual purchase itself probably pumped the price but the announcement also pumped the price uh and that's that's where we are now so now bitcoin is consolidating between 48 and 45 000 at the time of recording we're at 47.7 thousand dollars really expensive bitcoin we're we're flirting with 50k there and the question is will bitcoin hit 50k or will eath hit 2k sooner which one happens first e let's talk eath price david what's eath doing this week eth also following in bitcoin's footsteps breaking this all-time high a new all-time high set of 1840 at the time of recording we are at 17.95 uh ether still kind of doing its it's kind of slow breakout on on a pause uh because when bitcoin rampages everything else takes a pause um but after bitcoin kind of capped out at 48 thousand dollars we uh we saw the defy tokens start to like really start to try and climb out of that pause that they took uh d5 tokens don't move when bitcoin does move but like they are ready to go it seems like they're ready to go uh and that's kind of where i have my eyes on right now we passed some really interesting metrics too here here's one on ethereum more than a trillion transactions on ethereum that's trillion with a t since its inception pretty incredible david yeah yeah i i this is a pretty cool landmark to to pass i wasn't i don't personally count the number of transactions i never really realized that this was a metric but you know 1 trillion was 1 trillion 1 trillion transactions on ethereum that's pretty cool yeah big number uh all right let's talk about d5 for a second start us off with total locked value where are we this week yeah we are above 40 billion locked in d5 ryan was it it was under a year ago that we like passed 1 billion in d5 or we must be coming around the one year anniversary now we're at 40 billion and like these landmarks are just like flying by us uh 50 billion dollars is in the sights i guess uh a hundred billion maybe we stopped to appreciate that a bit more i guess that's the next milestone and then what a trillion are we gonna hit a trillion this market cycle i mean tbd right i think we could hit a trillion this market cycle a trillion dollars locked in d5 this market cycle i think it's totally happening let's talk about the d5 pulse index too david what what what's that heading this week 451 dollars again an all-time high all-time highs across the board you know just everything everything is up and to the right so that's that's pretty cool uh and of course i'm also always paying to dpi eth that is my defy season indicator and again it continues to march upwards in this slow motion trend dia you know formerly known as alt season now known as defy season is typically characterized by like really violent upwards moves and we aren't seeing those violent upward moves but we are seeing slow motion upwards moves and the dpi is outperforming ether slowly but surely every single week it's a little bit higher uh and this week is no different we've got some numbers by sector this time that is interesting we don't always cover in the market section but i think we should this time because there is now one billion assets under management in these things these things called dows decentralized autonomous organizations how important is that and what are dows david yeah dallas don't have a completely defined uh definition but basically it's like a protocol on ethereum that has a treasury that it manages right so unit swap has a uni uni token treasury uh iron has a treasury uh yams have a treasury all these protocols have treasuries uh and uh deep down this twitter account is reporting that there is over one billion dollars of value in daos and so that's one billion dollars worth of funding for these dows to get done what they want to get done right this is capital yet to be deployed if you are interested in working in this space you should be looking at that one billion dollar treasury mark from all these different dows as potential income for you the worker if you can provide value to some of these dows they will pay you that's what it's for yeah it's and i wonder if the stat is actually under reporting because i know for a fact like there are there are some um protocols like uniswap for instance who have maybe billions in their treasury like lots in their treasury for from the unit token so i wonder if this is under reporting at some level but what's what i was saying about the looseness of the definition of what it exactly is there's some subjective subjectivity and inclusion here but what these things are is they're basically capital pools aren't they so you know one of the most common capital pools in the traditional world is the company the corporation and it of course keeps its assets in bank accounts in various you know uh dollars or currencies or bonds or this sort of thing this is just that it's capital coordination only it's happening on chain in these token vote dao type structures it's almost like it's almost like the modern corporation in this uh d5 landscape which is super exciting to see it hit that one billion mark let's talk about another sector david this is crypto art sales crypto art sales on ethereum have reached a record 80 million dollars that's pretty crazy yeah that's pretty insane uh nft sales are up into the right uh and this 80 million dollars i mean comparison to d5 it's actually kind of a small number but with nfts nfts is like this massively growing industry there's another link uh crypto art dot io slash of data that has some nice bar charts if you want to look at nft data over time uh and this is transactional data this is like volume of nft sales uh and it's also heavily up and to the right uh type in slash or hit that data button uh ryan right there um and you'll see the massive uh bar that was last week's uh what was it the max masks activity lots of volume there um and so that's a little bit of an outlier right there but uh uh the the current weekly bar chart for this week is also much higher than all historical bars except for the last weeks um so that's pretty cool nft volume up and to the right david this is this is 80 million crypto art uh i think that this is going to do 100x this year and and the reason why is we're going to get into the news right like like celebrities it's just like the celebrities are just scratching the surface people with brands people with communities are just scratching the surface we're going to talk about a few in the news section but pay attention to the space because nfts are going to have an absolutely massive year as they start to see mainstream adoption here is another set of metrics which is automated market maker metrics this is from token terminal which is one of the best places to actually look at defy data they put together some fantastic analytics and metrics for various defy tokens this is them reporting out automated market maker revenue and david i was struck by this when i saw it revenue since launch 300 million dollars uniswap has generated in terms of revenue now the vast majority of this went to its liquidity providers but that is a crazy amount of top-line revenue for a protocol to develop and unit swaps what like two years old just a bit over two years old these numbers are staggering already i mean look at that sushi swap number sushi swap is almost at 100 million and it's it was born in in september and so like it's already like planted its flag in in revenue 73.9 million in revenue that sushi swap has generated for its lps and and let me let me know like this is why governance tokens are valuable like yes these fee the revenues went to the liquidity providers right those providing the value to the protocol yet it's the tokens that govern over the direction of this cash flow and so uni token holders are able to point 300 million dollars worth of revenue as they see fit and that's just the power behind the uni token and that's why the uni token has a market value you know what's crazy to me is like sites like token terminal can show you insight visibility into all of this we talk so often about defy and its killer killer uh feature is that it's completely transparent completely transparent so this kind of information if you wanted this information about a traditional exchange or like even a um uh you know some sort of bank you have to wait for yeah you have to wait for their quarterly reports basically they'd have to be audited you get that on a quarterly basis this is all real-time and trustlessly verifiable on-chain information so the quarterly report is kind of it's kind of dead when it goes up against on-chain protocols in this way all right david let's talk about this last and it also makes it really really easy to produce content about because it's always something you need to produce content every week absolutely all right um let's talk about this last stat so eth is now powering over 30 billion in stable coins when we talked to jeremy and jeremy elaire about staple coins a couple weeks ago i feel like that number was maybe 20 billion or so we just added a cool 10 billion i think this number is going to absolutely skyrocket too david what's your take here yeah i think this is worthy of a comparison the ethereum market cap ether market cap is just slightly over 200 billion dollars and there's 30 billion dollars of stable coins um largely on it all on ethereum right so that's a pretty decent percentage right like to uh 200 over 30 or 30 over 200 or whatever um and just just think about all of the transactional demand that 30 billion dollars worth of stable coins creates on ethereum like well no no gas prices are high like there's a lot of economic economic activity to be done yeah absolutely we're gonna talk about gas prices in a little bit i think uh david that is the market gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 percent interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes at gemiini.com gobanklist and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith d5 visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of d5 so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited bunny goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today let's turn to releases the first is this from uh fromatic actually so matic which is changing its name to to polygon full disclosure i am involved as an advisor to this project because i think they are doing great work but david what is the news here yeah yeah matic is this it's it's one of the san diemonica pier metaphors uh it's it's a it's a it's an l2 with a bunch of activities on it so it's a it's a scaling platform uh with uh you know stuff like amms borrowing and lending a more expressive and composable type of l2 than other l2s um and it's doing this rebrand to polygon uh which is kind of a cool name there there are many many layers behind that name uh not not not enough time to go in on the weekly rollups but it's actually comparable to polka dot uh is is that is the branding this is what i'm hearing i'm not a uh expert on polygon or consensus design or l2 design so take that with a grain of salt but uh this is a polka dot alternative as an l2 on ethereum uh and so this is kind of part of ethereum's power like if you can build it you could build it on ethereum and since all the uh already all the activities on ethereum you might as well just build it on ethereum um and so i i think the polka dot v polygon uh conversation is one that will be had for a long time absolutely and it's it's polka dot it's cosmos it's it's many of these uh alternative layer ones who have the vision to be an internet of blockchains the question is kinematic can some of ethereum's layer twos deliver that only have it secured by ethereum and how does that compete against these other competing layer ones we've we've said before david that uh oftentimes it seems like many of the alternative eath killers or layer ones are actually competing against ethereum's layer two right and uh i guess we'll see how that plays out let's jump to the next uh hash masks david we talked about this last week and this came up when we were talking about markets how big art is growing on crypto in the blockchain on nfts in particular hash mass had an absolutely incredible week you want to talk about this yeah so we report when when we record weekly roll-ups we record it on thursday and so we talked about hash masks yeah it had not yet finished up its first week of sales and so if we take the the second half of thursday friday and saturday sales for hash masks we run it into a number that is 13.4 million dollars worth of sales in one week so congratulations to hash masks for being absolutely successful yeah it's it's a crazy amount of growth uh david let's turn to this on releases so ledger is now providing access to wallet connect uh what is wallet connect and why is this important yeah wall connect is like a middleware type uh communication system for connecting your wallet to your application right i use a wallet connect when i want to use my argent with uh some sort of uh protocol uh if i want to trade on uniswap i can go and open up my argent wallet and then i can scan the wallet connect integration into uniswap and that will link my argent wallet with the uniswap application uh and so uh people who use their ledger to connect to metamask to connect to uniswap or to connect to a compound this is a similar thing where metamask is is offering that bridge but now wallet wallet connect is offering that bridge for things that are wallet connect integrated uh and so now we can go straight from your ledger to an application on ethereum like uniswap or compound using wallet connect and so it's a it's an alternative to metamask um and so it's a new way to connect the app and and i think that's actually kind of nice because we have as an industry complete dependency on metamask and so having alternatives to connect to applications that aren't centered around metamask is nice agreed and particularly from a hardware wallet which which offers a tremendous amount of security for your crypto if you are custodying it let's move to to this release uh pool together has built a prize pool builder so does this mean david you can essentially create your own pool together lottery is is that what this release is about yeah yeah leighton cusack he's the ceo of pull together and for those that don't know pool together is a no loss lottery where you pool your funds and then instead of putting your funds at risk in the lottery you actually only put your interest into the lottery and then the winner gets the interest and so it looks like this is a a build a pool mechanism out of pull together which means that there's more composability and more options and so what they are doing here is they're just making their surface area for building larger so people can build on top of them uh so that's pretty cool nice job laden yeah very cool uh pulled together has been doing a lot do you know how big they are these days like i i'm not sure how that's i do not have the numbers off the top of my head interesting we'll have to look that up all right uh uma protocol they are creating some novel community incentivization mechanisms uh what is this this latest that they've created this is one of the d5 protocols for synthetics and options yeah so uma it's a synthetic asset platform and so what they are doing is they are making what they are calling kpi options kpis for those not in the marketing world is key performance indicators uh and so it's really the numbers that you want to go after when you are trying to measure your skills at marketing but what they're doing with kpi is not talking about marketing but more talking about the protocol there are a couple metrics about the protocol that they are turning into synthetic assets right and so the way that this works is that the synthetic asset that they are making is based off of a metric or an indicator about the protocol that they want to grow and so if you hold the asset that tracks that indicator or that measure you are then incentivized to make that indicator or measure go up right because then the value of your asset goes up so it's actually a really clever incentivization mechanism and also the other through line is that these are now new native assets on top of ethereum right no no bank dependencies these are trustless assets if you trust the protocol and there and what similar to synthetics the protocol for your synthetic assets uma is just able to be a factory for types of assets that track types of measures if you can codify it you can create an asset out of it and that's what uma's done here so interesting so they're creating new ways to incent their community to do and to do what they want essentially so they're using tokenization and tokens as an incentive and they're giving away 2 million uma tokens for this purpose david it strikes me there are just so many ways to earn tokens by using d5 protocols these days and this is this is yet another one and i'm wondering if this kind of token incentivization will catch on across other protocols if it becomes popular totally totally agree all right let's go to the next david so uh coinbase custody is now supporting deposits and withdrawals of sushi so that is always a precursor of things to come so if it goes into their coinbase custody then generally it ends up on their exchange i'm just blown away at how fast this is happening like sushi is a relatively new token and already we're getting to the stage where it's about to be on coinbase in 2017 there were layers and layers and months and months you had to kind of go through to get a coin to get a token listed on something like coinbase now it seems like anybody can is going on coinbase like what's what's your take on this yeah you beat me to the punch ryan so like uh with the coinbase custody coinbase custody is actually not indicative of it making it to the exchange uh not all the time uh there are plenty of tokens that go into coinbase custody that don't make it onto the coinbase exchange however the reason why we're including in this week is i think this is totally the exception uh i think sushi is getting included on coinbase custody because they are gearing up for the coinbase listing that is my speculation i have no more information other than that but i think i think we can definitely be preparing for a sushi listing on coinbase all right david that has been releases let's get to the news my friend we've got to start with some of the biggest news of the year for sure what is it yeah it's the uh tesla which is a company that everyone knows put 1.5 billion dollars of bitcoin on its balance sheet and you know elon musk the world's richest man the man with some of the world's greatest meme power behind him and some of the biggest audiences behind him now is publicly a bitcoin holder basically um by by proxy of also being the largest tesla shareholder uh so elon musk has a bunch of bitcoin on his personal balance sheet technically and tesla has bitcoin on its balance sheet everyone loves tesla everyone loves elon musk and that's what caused them the bitcoins largest one day candle we missed this topic in the uh markets but bitcoin had its largest one-day candle ever of over eight thousand dollars increase in one day and we can definitely thank elon musk and tesla for getting that done uh that's pretty cool uh the after effects and shock shock waves out of this are going to be massive and last for a really long time uh and i i always try and say this like moving up price targets and being bullish just because other people are bullish is always a bad idea but i can't help and not think just as like dude the world's richest man and one of the world's most beloved companies is now like publicly known to own a 1.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin and then also bitcoin went up by the way so now it's more like 1.8 billion dollars worth of bitcoin uh and i think that this could just if this is this is one of the biggest catalysts of a bull market that i could think of and so like maybe the bull market is going to be even bigger than i thought it was who knows yeah this is absolutely this is massive news so what they did was they took 11 of their cash position and rather than hold it in cash it's huge i know 11 is is huge and rather than hold it in cash they they they're holding it now in crypto money in in bitcoin specifically and you're absolutely right david it's one thing for a company like like microstrategy that you know some have said uh well microstrategy didn't really have anything else to do with the money you know their their their product was kind of a little older perhaps it's in the business intelligence space they were just sitting on this f what else were they gonna do with it tesla has a lot of things it could do with its money it is trying to grow into the world's largest like um you know battery provider basically right um it has endless ambitious silicon valley level ambitions and it is deciding to put its funds into crypto money so this is not a micro strategy this is one of the top companies in the world and you have to wonder who's going to be next david is this just going to cause a cascading effect of like tons of fortune 500 companies making this same move or did elon kind of front run them and they're just going to let it play out i'm not sure yeah yeah there's there's a take that we're going to get to in the take section that is about this that i will save for later so i'm going to tease that but it's all about the economics and incentives behind putting bitcoin on public companies balance sheets so stay tuned for this takes section so that was huge that happened this week and then we also had joe lubin on where we talked about eath cme futures that was almost overshadowed i feel like whenever eth has a has a big day some big news like bitcoin comes in with big bro like a big brother and he's like no step aside i've got something bigger i'm announcing and sort of overshadows it and that's totally what happened on monday futures launched on monday at the same time uh elon musk uh you know kind of not announced but it was revealed that tesla had purchased the bitcoin but this is still massive news and the cme this this is the headline saw nearly 400 eth futures contracts traded on the first full market day refreshment david i know you wrote a post this week right 400 eath futures about how much eath is that yeah so one eighth contract is worth 50 ether so 400 eth futures contracts is 20 000 ether so on the first day 20 000 ether was traded uh looks like it was actually 19.4 000 you know close enough um uh and that and the interesting comparison i saw was that i think this was roughly 2.5 times larger the amount of volume that bitcoin got on its first day when cme opened up bitcoin futures back in 2017. um this is part partly true just because of you know the the whole entire space is more uh mature and people are more hungry to get into ether and and other crypto assets and so the the fact that we are seeing a much larger first day volume than we saw three years ago is uh with a the second largest crypto asset rather than the first large largest crypto asset is just really healthy really good strong signs so the the manager of this product from the cme had this quote that the response to ether has been overwhelming uh quite the quote there david do you think that so we had this discussion and there's the community's somewhat divided there there are some who think that cme futures kind of mark maybe uh the end of the ether bull run right so and and the reason for this is is somewhat historical they're taking a data point from the launch of bitcoin futures in december 2017 or like late 2017 uh and then after that not long after the kind of the bubble burst and uh we we saw the end of the 2017 run and they're projecting that they're saying that well this that caused the end of the last bull run so maybe it could cause the end of this bull run or or at least the end of the bull run specific to ether what's your take on that i think that's the stupidest goddamn take i could ever think of like first off let's just go with statistics here you can't extrapolate from one data point so like when bitcoin futures opened up bitcoin had gone from 250 to 20 000 and then bitcoin futures opened up like what like no bitcoin is going to go down after that first you give the option to short the asset to people with large amounts of money who play on cme futures and bitcoin just went up like a thousand x like that's not good data that's confounding data you know ether is only it's only two or three hundred dollars above its previous all-time high not not two hundred times it's above its all-time high like no no this is bullish like everyone who's giving out that opinion needs to stop because it's wrong it well it's interesting because it sort of amplified amplified the the the popping of the um the last bull run but it could have the same amplification effect here but in the other direction yeah right this could this could swell up the balloon and um it's interesting to see how that'll play out but uh yeah i think you're right especially when we have news like this mastercard we like to defer to the bullish inside of things oh yeah well it's been right so far so we'll see how it goes um let's talk about mastercard mastercard is bringing crypto onto its network this is a press release from mastercard and here's the money quote we are preparing right now for the future of crypto and payments announcing that this year mastercard will start supporting cryptocurrencies directly on our network we've seen visa say something to the same effect it seems like fintech and traditional payment processes processors are moving big on crypto particularly in stable coins what's the take here yeah things like mastercard and visa all they are are networks they're not denominations like there's nothing intrinsic about mastercard or visa that is us dollar based or like you could in theory put bitcoin on the visa network that is something that's possible to happen and so all we have to do is we have got to swap out whatever uh whatever payment rails mastercard's using with crypto payment rails and not even swap out keep the old ones add on new ones and you can now integrate like a mastercard usdc underlying on some likely an l2 because l1 is slower and more congested than what mastercard would need but like the fight behind being the payments for crypto assets uh the payments network for crypto assets is massive right and it's not just uh visa and mastercard that's playing in in this game it's also paypal it's also um it's also d5 protocols like loopering are they are also playing in this in this in this uh arena uh and of course mastercard is also now uh getting in with a big bold step into the world of crypto payments it i always think when i read headlines like this why mastercard is bringing krypton to this network these are headlines you would have never seen in 2017 that's why this time it is different right like we're seeing a another level of adoption something that we didn't see in the previous bull run uh and it's super exciting speaking of which uh we were talking about celebrities endorsing and getting into the art and nft game let's talk about this one a major soccer player in uh the eu has just launched his nft who is this and what what what's going on here yeah masoot ozil i think is how you pronounce his name famous uh football player for all the european and non-american listeners um i don't watch televised sports and so uh yeah i don't really know who this guy is but apparently he's a really big deal he's got like 38 million twitter followers which is just a few more twitter followers than i have um and uh he's minting an nft right and this is this is just the future of the bull market or at least when it comes to nfts is the in the incentive for celebrities or people with fans or just creators in general to mint nfts to figure out how to commercialize themselves is absolutely massive right and so the the nfts are just going to gain massive tailwinds for every single celebrity that wants to try and monetize themselves which is every single celebrity by the way it was it's interesting we didn't have nfts in 2017 and so what we saw toward the end of the the bull market was all of these celebrities you know talking about launching coins right and the trouble with that was the sec came down on them and said look you know you can't do that uh these are securities you can't go in that direction um we've got a comment from the sec this is uh crypto mom hester pierce from the sec and she we love her she's fantastic and she is still uh one of the commissioners of the sec um even though there's a new chairperson in in the biden administration anyway her comment is the market is ready for a bitcoin etf yes it is we're ready for a bitcoin etf aren't we david yeah so what you're saying is that the market is structured in ways that could that an etf could get approved in this article we're seeing an etp i think that means an exchange traded product i'm pretty sure what she means is an etf um and like so all of the boxes according to hester pierce all of the boxes that are are needed to be checked uh for bitcoin to get an etf are checked and so hester is saying let's get this etf underway and like i totally agree all the the lack of there being an etf for bitcoin and other crypto assets means it's a it's a failure on the sec to protect consumers because then they have to go into grayscale and again this is not grayscale's fault but the fact that there's so much demand for bitcoin it means people are buying the grayscale trust version of bitcoin which has a premium associated with it same thing with ether and this is something that the etf version of bitcoin is supposed to fix so like let's start protecting these consumers sec like let's get this show on the road let's get this etf out the door could you imagine what would happen to crypto prices if the news of an etf was released like is that is that just the catalyst for the rest of the bull run or or does that in some weird way mark the end of the bull run i i put out a tweet earlier this week uh after elon musk announced putting bitcoin on this balance sheet and i said you know what at this point a bear market is impossible i'm increasing the price targets to infinity i put a little infinity sign it was a joke because obviously it's a joke about how people move up their price targets when they get more bullish and that's a fallacy and you shouldn't do that but but bitcoin put or if bitcoin is on tesla's balance sheets and we're probably going to get a bitcoin etf if we also get a bitcoin etf like i don't know how how will this bull market actually end like where does it actually stop like there's too much good news there's too much good news into the future that that just hasn't clicked in yet and then a lot of unexpected good news that is already hit to fuel the early stage of this bull market so we'll see how that plays out um speaking of good news that may be yet to come twitter is considering bitcoin putting it on its balance sheet twitter of course is uh partially controlled by by jack dorsey but this is uh who's the ceo this is their cfo talking about this like there are a relatively small number of corporate executives and ceos and cfos uh in corporate america right and they all talk to one another that's why last week david when we were talking about michael saylor and he put on this kind of seminar for other uh corporate executives and ceos who talk about bitcoin he was like guiding them through the process of what it takes to actually put it on your balance sheet right um they're all super networked and they like they move as one they get fomo too so like uh bezos he sees what elon's doing he's like oh god man he front run ran me but i gotta get in before zuck did and he goes and he puts like it's just such a small group of people right like making these decisions uh and uh it does feel like something's building and about to cascade here what's your take yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring up a take from the take section and talk about it right here i already hinted at it earlier in this recording uh this actually came from pierre richard who's like a bitcoin maxi of bitcoin maxis and he made this prediction that uh over 50 of s p 500 companies will have bitcoin on its balance sheet by the end of 2021 and his rationale was this um company x announces that bitcoin that they put x number of bitcoins on the balance sheet they make the announcement the bitcoin price goes up and the stock price of the company goes up at the same time like the incentives are too strong and so we've already had three examples of this where some company put bitcoin on his balance sheet made the announcement bitcoin pumped and then the company share price pumped at the same time we're just going to get that repeated over and over until it stop until it stops working they're gonna just until it stops working until it stops working that's exactly right and at that point in time bitcoin's gonna be worth like 10 million dollars of bitcoin crazy and like the the bull market is going to like blow up half the world or something yeah i think i think that there's an element of truth there for sure that that will continue to happen and then maybe when bitcoin stops working as much maybe then they go downstream and start doing other assets so what's the first publicly traded company that's going to put eth on its balance sheet now that it has cme futures um absolutely that's how bull markets tend to go they they certainly go in herds and they try the same things until they stop working um david let's not let's not get give institutions too much credit though because they can put bitcoin on their balance sheet but that doesn't mean that they have diamond hands institutions can also be paper hands too so while there can be a massive massive winding up institutions can fomo out of bitcoin just as fast as they can fomo into bitcoin so that those diamond hands can turn into institutional paper hands real quick honestly the longer i'm in this space david the less i believe that there is such a thing as smart money it's all psychology like all the way down whether it's institutional or whether it's retail it's all psychology um let's jump to this which is the amount of gas that coinbase is using so coinbase of course in exchange we call them crypto banks did you know david it uses 25 of all eth block space one fourth of all block space with one crypto bank this is will price on twitter he's saying with different architecture it could use twenty to forty percent less gas what what's your take here why isn't um coinbase optimizing its gas usage and were you surprised by that number one fourth of all eth gas yeah so uh i i knew that coinbase uses an insane amount of these block space i did not know that it used it is using 25 of each block space and it's doing that when there's no the the most amount of block space for demand on ethereum ever so like they must be absolutely burning cash and actually no i kind of know what it's like to work in a centralized company that needs to make transactions on ethereum as part of its day-to-day operations and so you have to make those transactions no matter what the gas fee is it hurts it hurts um the thing is coinbase is a massive company that is extremely well funded and so they're just paying the bill they're just saying like oh like how much are we paying for you know the last 24 hours worth of block space oh three million dollars okay it's nothing you know not a big deal like whatever uh and so like and to be honest like coinbase is a little bit too big like they grew really fast really really fast and now they're kind of hard to get that ship turned um and i think this is kind of just a signal of a stress of a startup being stress tested they can't really figure out how to pivot fast enough to start to not pay ridiculous gas prices but coinbase it would be really nice on all of our budgets if you could figure out how to optimize your gas usage like come on guys let's let's do this well this is interesting dave and i want to get back to this when we get into the take section but this is an example of um economic density right so like the more economically dense transactions on ethereum will persist because of the way each gas is auctioned up it's basically highest bidder wins and if you're coinbase and you're making millions a day these gas fees are nothing to you you're making way more and but if you're uh say issuing nft right you're a small-time artist and you're trying to pay gas fees to like trade exchange your nft right well that transaction is much less economically dense than all the coinbase transactions settling you know millions of of stable coin dollars in value so let's get back to that soon when we talk about eth gas but david a few other things we got to hit in the news this one the federal reserve put out a research paper about what about defy the federal reserve st louis and they they they put together this fantastic diagram david i've seen this diagram before i feel like i've seen it in early edition right bankless articles but it's a fantastic uh diagram to describe the layers of d5 the settlement layer at the bottom is um is ethereum we've got an asset layer protocol layer application layer if you're on youtube you can see this with us what is your take on this article and about the fact that the st louis fed published it yeah so uh i actually talked to the author behind this uh behind this article fabian uh perhaps a bankless podcast in the future question mark uh is it in the works maybe it is he's a really smart guy and he's a he's a professor he's a professor and that specifically teaches crypto networks defy uh and he so he can speak at a level of like 301 401 type of uh of of you know at that kind of level with regards to d5 and so and he's been reading bank list for the last year and a half so that helps yeah yeah exactly yeah exactly right like he uses bankless as a as a place to cite which is pretty cool um so bankless made it into the uh the research arm of the federal bank which is the federal reserve of st louis yeah it's it's cool and um i think that would that would make a great podcast david we should i think i think we can broadcast he should come on bankless very good all right um a few other things being bny melon i'm just gonna actually read this headline bitcoin to come to america's oldest bank america's oldest bank bny mellon so this is another traditional bank who's capitulating and opening up a way for its customers to do custody digital currency custody more and more banks i feel like this is going to be a regular thing on these rollups too david let's get to a couple more you're in finance had an exploit uh last week or so right before yeah we did the last the last roll up it was in 11 on friday yeah loss and this is what we said we say at the end of every bankless podcast like this is the frontier you could lose what you put in folks who are using one of the urine with the wire and vaults i think it was a die specific vault they lost money they lost 11 million dollars i actually had a friend who texted me and was like oh shoot i had i had funds in this i'm sorry but i also said i bet your wire and governance will uh issue these funds and make vault older um vault holders whole and that is exactly what they did as well so what what's your comment on this both the the hack itself and then the restoration to make why uh earn vault holders whole yeah so i actually made this prediction in the issue the 2021 uh bankless predictions uh that i predicted that there was going to be a loss of funds from a faulty vault out of iron uh and that came true in in february that happened pretty frequently the the thesis behind this is that uh there's just a lot of surface area with hacking or exploits when it comes to to urine they they touch so many different protocols and so every time you touch a new protocol you know you are adding in another layer of layer of complexity and another way for an exploit to happen uh and so um sorry to any of the why die uh holders that that got their fun snagged but uh conveniently yearn had just voted to mint six thousand six hundred and sixty six i think that's the right number double um listeners should double check that uh but mint six thousand ish uh yfi tokens which is a lot of money uh and so that was more than enough compensate people who lost funds and you know protocols are supposed to be protocols but also to the end at the end of the day we can be like pragmatic and say you know a protocol that can compensate its uh use use its centralized coordination abilities behind the the urine team to compensate people that lost funds like people are going to feel better about that like oh people that lost money in urine and then if they didn't get compensated probably will never go back but people that did lose money in urine but then did get compensated for that we'll click like say thanks thanks for compensating for me and i'll stay with the protocol like it's a it's a trust growing mechanism so nice job for for uh compensating people yearn it's super interesting because what's the lesson here right the first lesson is uh here's another example d5 is risky be careful where you put your funds in smart contracts they can be hacked they can be exploited but the second lesson is also that oh my god some of these d5 protocols are flush with cash and they do have this social coordination mechanism this token governance feature which allows them to make um those who are exploited whole and we've seen this happen time and time again so it's almost like a mixed message here right one is like be careful risk off the other is like yeah but there's also some built-in insurance in d5 and um yeah it's uh it's it's interesting to see how that how that happens david let's talk about the last thing before we move on to some takes for the week this is the avalanche blockchain what happened with avalanche this week it's not a chain that we talk about too much but there was some news it broke okay the avalanche blockchain broke it stopped going uh and uh if anyone remembers my tirade against the frogs it actually started off with me talking about avalanche and and and the genesis of the conversation was that um avalanche was given praise for being this blockchain that moves fast and breaks things uh or maybe that wasn't the word they i think the word wording was they shipped really really fast um and i i said in the comments you know well when it comes to l1 things like you actually don't want a blockchain that ships really really fast you want a blockchain that's really careful and moves really slowly and methodically and that's how i would characterize ethereum development even though bitcoiners would characterize ethereum development is too fast i guess i guess everything is is uh subjective and by you know a comparison at the end of the day but i think when your avalanche blockchain breaks and stops going that's an indication that you have moved too fast and you should have slowed down but also what happened when you said that did you get like did did you get angry mob on oh yeah i got a huge angry mob and that's kind of what's triggered the the whole my fight against the green frogs but that's that's a that's a topic for a different day hard to know who is real and who is a bot on things like twitter especially now in the bull run ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on quentin can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics david let's get to the takes um this is the first we're nowhere near the top is kind of the take and here is a graph that is showing in blue um ico searches on google i believe uh and it shows it from 2017 up till now and you see this chart where it goes from like zero to 100 and 100 is is really peak ico peak 2017 peak mania of the north bubble you know what chart that looks like ryan what the eth price chart right totally does okay so it looks like the 8th price chart and then and it's just this mountain um and then you see this other uh this other line which is d5 and d5 is a search term and it's much lower it's hanging out at like between 1 1 and 10 for all of 2017 all of 2018 all of 2019 and it's only just gone up a little bit still under you know 20 or so it's just hit 20. so nowhere near the the level of 2017 this is basically comparing the search term mania of icos versus d5 and what it's saying is defy hasn't even started to enter into the public consciousness people aren't even searching it at these state at this stage um you're talking about like well is defy in a bubble is it not uh in in this in this most recent d5 season we're nowhere close to what we were for icos in 2017. i don't think anybody is talking about defy on cnbc at this point uh so if this plays out like 2017 it feels like we've got a long way to go in this is this what this is saying to us yeah so the the d5 matching the uh ico search terms back in 2017 is in my opinion the floor because i think this bull market is going to be bigger than the last bull market so the if it once define matches the ico search terms back in 2017 that i think is the minimum it's going to get to i think it's going to go well beyond that and if you look at this chart you can you can definitely see uh d5 starting to tick upwards it's definitely growing but like like you were saying in comparison to what icos were back in 2017 it's still it's still a blip like there's still so much left to go in this market absolutely and it does seem like d5 tokens are going to be the icos of the previous run is that that's what this is implying as well yeah and hopefully it it is just capturing the energy and not the scamminess from what we've seen so far in d5 i'm actually pretty proud of the lack of scamminess in comparison to what we saw in 2017 icos uh cross my fingers and and knock on wood that that stays the same i definitely do expect scamminess and bad behavior to come into the space but so far so good so far everything about defy that i've seen i really really like and all the stuff i don't like is is staying small and kind of under the radar which is good and and that might be an indication of the the early stage of this this bull run i bet we'll tend to see some scammier and worse projects as time goes on as the bull run really kicks off david let's talk about gas fees because that actually could be an impediment uh to this vision so gas fees are high and it sucks if you're a defy user it sucks i'll tell you one thing that really sucks this is like getting have you ever been gas jailed so maybe you have some stable coins in an eth account right so let's say you had a hundred dollars worth of dye inside of one of your ether counts and ether dress and it takes like thirty dollars to move that die from one ether dress to somewhere else right so that's thirty dollars out of your 100 and what can happen is if you have small enough amounts it's not even worth the cost to actually do anything with your assets in the etherdress this is a problem isn't it like what is the problem of gas fees i guess your take on that first and then um what does it say about the ethereum network yeah so the whole point of ethereum is to be maximally inclusive and right now it's not it's not fulfilling that that vision and that's why ethereum 2.0 is is that's the whole effort behind ethereum 2.0 ethereum 2.0 is supposed to scale so we can have more people and transact on the base layer and it's also supposed to scale scale its consensus and let everyone be a part of that that's part of the vision of ethereum maximum inclusivity if you have been priced out of that that's ethereum failing and it's in its vision but it's also on its way to achieving that again that's the whole point of ethereum 2.0 so like there we are in this unfortunate like uncanny valley between like d5 is really awesome it's the future like there's tons of value and speculative upside to be gained here so you need to be playing in it yet also sorry we also haven't solved the gas v issues like we're in this very painful time where like we're between these two things um and and i think that that's where uh scaling solutions like like loopering uh polygon which we talked about earlier um uh you know zk roll-ups optimistic roll-ups you know uh synthetics is on optimism you know uniswap's l2 is coming out and so i think that's really going to be the stop gap between um that's going to help ethereum scale before charting comes out but again we're actually not there yet either uh loopering you can actually start to do some trading on some eth to die or east the usc trades and so if you are trading ether on uniswap maybe try out loopering you can you can uh do you know faster trades with pennies rather than dollars um but yeah i just think that this is going to be an unfortunate period of pain but that's just the precursor to growth in my opinion i agree i think this is the process of defy has to kind of re-architect itself on on layer two and off of layer one but but what happens to to layer one is we've used this analogy when we talked to haseeb in a podcast of like the ethereum mainnet that's manhattan and manhattan uh property like prices are just gonna go up and up and up like the value of manhattan is very high because manhattan has everything it has network effect there's better jobs there's better opportunity uh lots of people want to live in manhattan and so as as much of as this is kind of painful for smaller d5 users it's also a marker of product market fit of ethereum right so like it's it's it's very striking that all of these other eth killers have basically like empty blocks they're basically like zombie coin like chains right there's nothing going on their gas feeds are very low because no one's actually filling them up no one's actually using them everybody would rather pay super high gas fees on ethereum rather than go on to this this eve killer chain so that is also interesting i would i would characterize like the story of high gas fees as well as just being like two words it's insane demand that's why gas fees are so high and i do think david that the reality is uh we talk about ethereum as a credibly neutral settlement layer that's worth a lot so block space in a credibly neutral settlement layer is worth a lot more than block space on you know binance smart chain right which is controlled by 21 different validators all associated with with with binance right that is less credibly neutral and how much are people going to pay for that block space a lot less so there's something interesting about this and it goes back to our conversation earlier um coinbase settling on ethereum consuming 25 of its block space paying these massive fees what what's going to happen on main net is the transaction fees are going to become more and more compact more and more economically dense so pretty soon a transaction on ethereum main chain is going to contain all of the economic value of a roll-up chain like like loopering or all of the economic value that's going on inside of a coin base and these transactions are going to become more and more dense so some people talk about um ethereum solving its gas fees and what they think that means is it's going to go back to like 2018 when when gas fees were really low i don't think that's going to be the case like the reality is gas fees are probably like they'll have they'll have ebbs and flows they'll go down a little but they're probably never going to go down to 2018 level what is going to happen is we are going to start to be able to fit more economic value more trustless economic value in every transaction in every unit of block space in ethereum and i think that's how it's going to play out haseeb's model of manhattan i think is really really helpful here so like what's going on is the ethereum l1 blockchain is a city it's manhattan everyone wants to live there and we don't have any other suburbs there's nothing else other than manhattan in the ethereum universe and so there's two ways to create more land we shard or we create l2s and charting's not here yet and so l2s are creating we keep using the santa monica pier but like the really the santa monica is really really big and so like there's this place where you can go to now that loop ring is here now that polygon is here now that you know insert your l2 is here uh there's what we are doing is we are we are building land we are creating new land to uh absorb some of the overflow that is uh people's demand for trying to live in manhattan so we're it's a matter of creating new land for people to live on right and so that if that's why people are bullish on polygon people on loopering because it's it's new real estate it's new real estate to to to leverage right and so i think you're totally right i don't think l1 gas fees are going to go down ever i think where we there where they are now is probably actually going to be where they are going to stay for a really long time it's just that there's going to be overflow options and that's going to be how we solve gas there's going to be places to go to overflow that demand and capture that overflow that's the the goal of all l2s is to capture the overflow for people that don't want to transact on the l1 so what do you do if you're a defy user i guess some gas tips one thing i think you can do is buy eth like generally earlier is better when price was lower like buying eth two years ago would have hedged you against all of the usd price increases of gas so that's one thing that you can do is because you know gas fees and the price of ether somewhat correlated uh and uh you can kind of like minimize the cost that way with eath price appreciation another thing you've got to do is um have fewer accounts to be honest you can't have your your funds spread out across like 20 or 30 different etherdresses because like it it it it's hard when you when you start doing that to you you split your funds up into smaller and smaller pieces and it's not like worth it to move 30 out of a specific account do you have any other gas tips uh david for defy users yeah i would say like and especially during bull markets and especially if this is your first bull market i know what it's like you see a token that some that your friend just mentioned or you see a token that's pumping you're like i gotta get some first off no you no no you don't and second off when you look at that unit swap trade and you're saying like okay i'm gonna buy 200 worth of this token and it's going to cost me thirty dollars in gas uh it's thirty dollars in gas denominated in ether right so if you ape into that token that you might sell later tomorrow depending on how you're feeling when you wake up in the morning you paid thirty dollars worth of ether to make that trade and that's not eight dollars that's ether and so if ether goes to 10k that thirty dollars is going to like three hundred dollars right so remember when you are paying gas is not dollar denominated it's ether denominated and you are giving up your fees and ether to pay for that so like think slower don't make uh do make intentional slower trades you don't have to buy every single token and if you don't if you don't buy every single token you get to keep more ether and that's good for you anyways there you go david we got to put an article together with all of these gas saving tips uh we'll do that sometime on bank list um is is just buying ether a real a good tip or is that maximalism i mean it worked a bit better when you were buying it in 2018 than now but like yes buy and hold can can hedge you against that a little bit well here here's a take that's kind of related uh to that from ashley on twitter what how do you pronounce ashley's last name oh shap i think i think it's shop okay ashley on twitter uh so she says the first cell phone came out in 1983 and picture it it was 11 inches long two and a half pounds and cost four thousand dollars early adoption is expensive and clunky i think that says it all right there we are early adopters in d5 and on ethereum and transactions are expensive and they're clunky at this stage in the game we're early we're at the frontier like with that is uh some ux pain some risk some challenge but there's also a reward because when else are you going to buy eth at these prices and crypto at these prices so there's a tremendous amount of upside but keep in mind how early we are this is like cell phones in the 1980s this is like the internet in the early 1990s this is like um give me another one david what is this like oh gosh oh put me on the spot this is like uh your your uh pre-ipod like you know hold your disc in your walkman like what was it called the microsoft zoom did you ever see people with a zoom zooms were relatively late that was a that was an ipod competitor i'm talking about the thing where the the walkman where you actually have a cd in there and if you take too large of a step it skips like that's that's where we are yeah that's where we are in crypto in d5 in particular so it's still super early david um anything to add to that nothing all right man um let's get to the last take which is which is yours so uh maybe you should talk about this yeah so so i i put a lot of on my instagram stories just of like ethereum content just to tell all of my friends from college from high school that like hey you should be paying attention to this ethereum thing so one of them mentions me uh hits me up in my dms and goes so why do you think ethan's going to 10k and like i took a pause and i said well there's a number of reasons why like what's what is the the best reason you didn't want to bust out the triple point asset thesis no i didn't i mean time was over he wasn't ready for that okay he'll get ready for that one um and so i my response to him was well there's lots of reasons and i go well the main reason is means right and memes will will take you know ethereum to 10k and already the 10k eath is already a meme uh formulated by our friend anthony cesano here who you can actually see on the screen at the bottom um are like digestible little nuggets of information right um triple point asset is one of those things uh it's it's that's that one's a little bit hard to digest but like memes and culture and just sharing memes and talking about like you know um all the little like snippets of information about how ethereum is the thing that it is that helps people understand what it is in short little bits i think is going to be the reason why ethereum ether goes to 10k ah okay so you were saying memes in general and by that you meant narratives you weren't saying specifically in only the me the eighth to 10k mean right we'll take it to 10k although that's probably part of it the more people who believe in 8 to 10k will socially coordinate around that number get it to 10k but you were talking about memes in general and by memes you meant like narratives to help um simple people understand complex concepts like crypto that's what's going to take it it's basically another way of saying what we say i feel like almost every week that the most bullish thing for crypto is to be understood and memes help in that understanding not only do they help they propagate it ryan i think you saw that website that came out not too long ago and it was i can't remember what the url is but it will be in the show notes i know where it is in my dms but you go to this website and it's a black screen and all you you slowly see this 10k eth slowly appear into into the website and it's got it's got this very like mysterious vibe around it and you start hearing the voice of eric connor talking about defy on the bull case for ethereum podcast that we did and then all every bullish sentence that era conor ever said is like cut into this like very interesting website you guys got to watch it and then and then anthony cesano cuts in and then dc investor cuts in all the bullish things and it's like the whole entire website is one big bean but like you can send that to someone and it's like hey there's the 10k eth meme just like baked in there as this thing is like slowly making its way to the forefront of the website and then you are listening to the voices of eric connor anthony cesano dc investor talking about all the bullish case cases for eth that whole website is a meme in my mind that website is a meme yeah it's also conveying really good information yeah it really is this is how this is how internet culture propagates units of information as well and increasingly this is how people are investing right just look at gamestop just look at gme just look at amc these are all community meme driven investments as well and crypto is definitely that it's reflexive on the way up as well as the way down uh david those are our takes for the week now we've got to get to what you're excited about what are you excited about this week yeah so last week i was excited about loop ring and i'm still excited about loopering but this week i'm excited about the concept or idea behind fiat on-ramps into l2s uh and so i think that we all we just talked about how much uh coinbase is spending on gas a lot of what they're spending on gas is fulfilling customers requests for withdrawals right like you go to coinbase you have 10 ether in your coinbase account you're 100 usc or whatever and you want to get that into your ethereum wall so you hit the withdraw button and then coinbase makes a transaction that transaction cost them like five dollars per user per transaction right so you and they pay that you don't pay that uh and maybe instead of sending bunny to peoples on the l1 they could send two users accounts on l2s like loopering right and so imagine this right you you take your your fiat money from your bank account send it to coinbase and send it to gemini uh buy eth with it trade it for eth and have that eth or uscc and you just get that uh those assets sent to an l2 directly right and so the way that this would work is that coinbase or gemini they would put they would take one large sum of money right so a pool they would put like i don't know half a million dollars into loop ring of ether usdc and then they could give their uh users the option to withdraw directly onto loopering um for free and and uh and it would be free for them so they're obviously incentivized they're the ones the the companies the exchanges are the ones saving that money but if they withdraw to loop ring they only have to take that like you know one million half a million dollars worth of usd or stable coin or ether put that on looper and that's one transaction right so if 10 if like 100 users all want to get onto loopering every single 100 user has to every single user has to pay like 15 but if gemini or coinbase wants to get their assets onto bloopering they also just pay 15 once right and so if they move a million dollars onto loopering then they can start paying out users requests for withdrawals on loopering using ether or the supply of money that they put there and they only paid one 15 transaction fee and now that they can distribute those fiat or ether settlements on loopering for free right less gas base and uh many people who are trading on coinbase like to trade on coinbase or gemini because they're centralized which means they get instant trades you know uh there's no gas fees and that's what loopering offers uh and so i think the future of uh fiat on ramps 2l2s is ahead of us um i i'm i'm excited for that to come i want to see which which of the major exchanges are going to integrate that first but injecting cash straight into l2s i think is going to be really really powerful especially for people who just hate gas fees yeah look the first exchange that starts doing that gets our business automatically so tyler cameron winklevoss you guys are listening we know you're listening we know you listen these uh gemini to build the fiat bridge directly to ethereum layer two directly to these layer twos look they're still early but you could you could do that right now with a loop ring for sure and over the next six months all the new layer twos that are stopping starting up i mean that's where defy users can start their their crypto journey essentially they don't even have to go on high gas v main net they can start directly in a layer two that's still secured and just as trustless as ethereum absolutely david that is the future and all we need is is kind of those fiat bridges so we'll see who builds them ryan what are you excited about all right uh i'm excited about a new crop of stable coins that i think is just starting to peak its head up and and just coming above the horizon so um there's so many different like it's actually pretty easy to create a stable coin uh you know usdc is a stable coin that is backed by dollars in a bank account somewhere that part's easy what's what's what's really hard is making a trustless stable coin and that's the difference because of course with the usdc who are you trusting you're trusting the issuer you're trusting the whitelist blacklist on usdc ultimately you're trusting settlement in the traditional financial system in a traditional bank account somewhere that's not bankless or it's kind of bankless it's using crypto rails but it's not really crypto natively completely trustless bankless bearer instrument that eth or bitcoin uh are so what's the holy grail the holy grail is to create a trustless stable coin something with the characteristics of ether or bitcoin but also with some stability characteristics and turns out that's really hard to do but there are two ways you could do it one we had a conversation with dan elliser and this is the approach that many of these algorithmic uh coins are taking is is you can basically back it by faith back it by faith in the future demand of the algorithmic stable coin you kind of take a bet on that future demand so empty set dollar do i think that's going to increase in demand or decrease if i think it's going to increase in demand and that demand will be sustained well there's a reasonable chance empty set dollar might be able to hold its its peg over the long run so it's it's backed by faith essentially in the demand characteristics of empty set dollar this is like the senior shares sort of model but the second way that you can do it is you can back it by eath rather than faith you can back it by a crypto money that people already have some faith in that already has some value so what i think we're going to see is this this second type of uh stablecoin basically an eth-backed purely eth-backed low governance uh stablecoin so almost like a a die before it was die and it was just a single collateral die but without the governance layer and so we're seeing the advent of of some of these i think you you talk to liquidity on uh meet the nation which is going to liquidity liquidy okay liquidy meet the nation um i'm looking forward to watching that and actually learning about that so that's one there's also rye that's coming out um i i've been made aware of a few others i think these are coming in the next six months and these are basically stability stability coins not quite pegged one to one with the dollar though some are pretty close that are all backed by trustless collateral eath that don't have the uh the the messy human governance slayer that a a maker has so i'm super excited because i think this is going to there's going to be a massive wave of stable coin innovation here and i'm also excited because it's bullish for for banklessness right you know bear instruments uh stable coins that are completely trustless and it's also quite frankly it's bullish for eth you know eth being the collateral uh that that backs all of these these this new wave of assets so um i'm excited about that david i just um it's going to be cool to see i think it's coming in the next the next couple of months and into the you know 6 to 12 month time horizon i bet we'll see tons of these projects and some of them will be doing some traction yeah the end of course the things that you get excited about also get me excited well what i get excited about is some of these uh trustless stable coins uh have options to not use the dollar as oh yes and and so the the conversation here and this is kind of one of my my early what really got me excited about maker dow in the early days is understanding that die is just a price feed right we just choose to peg to the dollar because that's what people want if the dollar loses its dominance all these stable coins don't have to point to the dollar anymore um and so that's something to to also consider in the the very long term is that you know the dollar is temporary yet some of these things have the ability to pivot unlike the dollar the dollar can't pivot the dollar is like grasping for straws if you if you listen to bitcoiners which i tend to agree with um the other thing that gets me excited about is each one of these stable coin projects tinkers with incentives so each one has their own incentive mechanisms uh yield incentivizations uh different ways to participate and each one is going to tinker with all of them they're going to be great for all the d5 power users that want to and you know at least one of them is going to get it right because everything that can be tried will be tried on on ethereum and in d5 so i i've heard this one before yeah well you know what we we uh we see these themes playing out everywhere david let's get to the meme of the week what is the meme of the week this week yeah the meme of the week this week is a bankless listener who who has made a couple of of memes about us lately and so we we had to we had to keep with the bankless themed content but jay-z wearing a bankless shirt doing the triangle sign i don't even know what that's called i don't really listen to jay-z anymore but he what he's showing in this meme is the triple point asset right doing doing the triple points and with the hand store value on the top commodity on the right capital on the left jay-z is woke to the triple point asset folks oh my god dude who who's the biggest celebrity we can get in a bankless shirt uh who would be your dream celebrity getting back it's jay-z he's wearing one oh yeah okay oh yeah that's already been done jay-z did you know yeah okay okay i didn't i didn't know if it was real i didn't know it was a real picture okay yeah it's awesome well jay-z i'm sure you're listening right now thanks for listening to bankless and uh thanks for believing the triple point asset thesis for us that's a good thesis all right man uh risks and disclaimers eth is risky crypto is risky so is d5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you joined us on this friday morning this has been our weekly roll up
