[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and today on this episode of our zoozalo series we are exploring some New Frontiers New Frontiers and new technologies all of which are poised to completely revolutionize the world and change everything about the operating system that Society is currently running speaking of operating systems that are about to change that guide Society Bank location today we are exploring the frontier of crypto in Africa perhaps the first continent that is poised to LeapFrog its way into a new operating system that we call web3 that we call crypto what can crypto do for Africa what can Africa do for crypto the conversation of crypto in Africa is extremely rich and should get anyone in crypto looking for real adoption real utility very excited developing countries have the ability to LeapFrog technology for example landlines never made it to Africa the entire continent just skipped to cell phones and the same thing is playing out in crypto the banks never win to service Africans but nonetheless Africans are finding utility and access using bankless Technologies using ethereum there are two conversations here in this episode one is about crypto adoption in Africa and why Africa is such a primed continent to accept and adopt crypto protocols and then another about an African Network state project going deep down into the reasons for why a network state in the first place and tying it to the Deep cultural bonds that tie all Africans together no matter where they live in the greater Globe both of these conversations gave me goosebumps simply out of excitement and satisfaction of the adoption of crypto protocols in the way that they were always meant to be to uplift individuals and coordinate communities we're first going to hear from Joseph ayele who's working on building a borderless Africa using web3 of course he started a venture fund to invest in African web3 development and adoption because he thinks and also gives the arguments for why web3 will be will see its first billion users Out of Africa the needs that Africa has as a whole are things that web3 provides Financial stability and access of course but also identity services and credit facilities Yosef does a great job painting this picture of Africa's trajectory to LeapFrog its way to becoming a dominant player in the web 3 landscape after Yosef we have eche and mole one of the founders of aphropolitan a very ambitious Network state project looking to build an Afrocentric digital Nation this conversation spans both crypto and network States and adds its own spin onto the Balaji and idea of a network State one with apropolitan hubs that exist wherever the African diaspora finds itself both of these guests are amazingly articulate and relentlessly optimist like two things that makes my job so fun and enjoyable as a conversation moderator and these were probably two of my favorite

Bank location I'm here with Yosef Ayala yeah yes beautiful you got it and we're going to talk about crypto in Africa and why there's such a large opportunity for the web 3 Industry the crypto industry in Africa Joseph welcome to bankless thanks so much for having me first off how as your Zello experience been uh it's been amazing amazing humans great connections I thought I came here to do work but then spent a lot of time just building really good relationships and having a good time what did you come to zuzalo to do uh to meet folks who are interested in the African continent I came here for edcon as well so I gave a talk there share my thesis on the continent and also to be part of some of the network State discussions and really understand where people are thinking about you said the word thesis which means I'm interested you have a thesis on a continent yes uh what does it mean to have a thesis on a continent just a framework and a way for the rest of the world to connect with the African continent I feel like there's a lot of crypto activities happening in the African ecosystems but most of the ethereum community as well as just the broader crypto communities just don't understand uh what's happening there many people haven't traveled there a lot of African Builders don't get to come to places like this so being a bridge and helping provide a framework yeah there's I'm assuming just a very large divide between Africa crypto and the rest of the crypto industry yeah I think there's also a very large divide between East and West in crypto yes but even that that divide co-mingles a lot yeah like the the Chinese uh which part of crypto which is very large yeah does mingle a lot I mean there's been a large Chinese cohort of people here azuzalu would you say like the African side of crypto is even more cut off between way more cut off way more way more cut off because the biggest like barrier for a lot of African Builders is that it's hard for them to travel to uh where Global crypto communities are and where main events are so like the number one issue is just visas the west and many Eastern countries just don't give Africans visas I was organizing a whole side event around Africa at Defcon in Colombia and basically everyone who is supposed to come participate in it couldn't make it because they couldn't get a visa to Colombia or couldn't get a visa to Transit through the US so that's just one of the biggest barriers that creates the physical divide yeah so the cross-pollination of just the it just doesn't happen exactly so uh I think there's going to be two parts of this conversation it's it's what can crypto do for Africa and then maybe we'll talk about what Africa can do for crypto yes I will talk about the cross-pollination here awesome uh but let's start with that let's start with uh why does Africa need crypto so much like why is Africa primed to be a cryptocontinent because centralized entities have failed us that's the main point like um a lot of centralized government centralized Banks institutions are either not effective or non-existent so that's where I think uh decentralization makes the most sense is it acts as the layer of Trust on which so many economic social political uh and financial institutions can be built on and when you go to places where there's you know some years are way more developed but a whole lot of areas are just so uh not developed so far I think the core infrastructures of crypto from money and payments and uh trust and coordination all those things make so much more sense there would you say that another way of saying that is uh institutions have not just provided structure in Africa and that's what you mean by like centralization is there's not trusted centralized places of organization yes that has provided like social scaffolding for the African continent let me give you just a few examples so uh there are 14 African countries that were colonized by France when the French were kind of leaving in the 1960s they instituted this currency called the CFA this stands for colonies of Africa French colonies of Africa and that's picked to Evo spec to the Franc and now spec of the Euro what that means is 50 of all the income those countries get goes to the French treasury directly so you don't own your money it goes to the French treasury is it fair to say that that was a tool of like maintaining colonialization exactly yeah even though so like France like wanted to get out of the continent physically but they were like we'll leave our currency and maintain yes maintain value attraction that way correct and all also they don't like the the French government created some boundaries if your interest rates and how much money you can print and all of that so those governments you can say that they don't control their own currency their own monetary policy so here in the Western World we talk about sovereignty from government in those countries the governments don't have sovereignty over their own states and their own monetary policies so that's one use case where you know for example the Central African Republic uh recently made Bitcoin Illegal Tender that's not because they're Bitcoin Maxes or whatever it's just it's out of desperation they have no control over their own Montreal policy therefore it's easier to say hey why don't we just jump into a whole new monetary policy that's inherently Global right so the idea is like okay if we're going to use somebody else's money perhaps we should use one that is based on the internet and not benefiting some particular power elsewhere and let's just use the the one that's found on the internet well you will you will use Bitcoin because it's monetary policy is going to be better than the French monetary policy exactly and so like it's it's maybe they they still don't the African countries don't have control over the monetary policy but at least it's not the French it's Bitcoin and Bitcoin is has all the properties of Bitcoin that we know and enjoy now that's not to say that that's the ultimate goal and answer I think some level of sovereignty is amazing right uh but it's kind of an example of where some of those countries is just 14 countries out of 54 uh are basically struggling to get sovereignty over themselves another sort of macro example is that there are 54 African countries only 40 countries print their own money in their own countries so they're outsourced that to European printing press and they pay six percent of the total money supply as printing fees and transportation costs so just imagine a  charges that uh the three companies in Europe and France in the UK and Germany that basically act as the printing press for the Fiat they charge a service for active for access to the printing press of course so they get inflation and they get to charge fees yes foreign I can see why uh there's demand for something else yeah and even at a very practical very those are like examples at a macro level just at a human level like uh the internet has been a big game changer for many people when I was growing up in Ethiopia um the internet opened the world to me I learned most of my English online it it you know opened up a lot of access to information and connectivity which is amazing but internet is still variegated to Africans that was gated that was many years ago and still get it because if you don't have a means to transact and pay and receive money then you cannot access the best of the internet if you cannot set up a PayPal account and use that to receive money for the work that you do then how can you say you're actually accessing the best of the internet so even remote workers in many African countries are using crypto as a means to get paid for the work that they do so what you're saying is that the the internet is a massively democratizing force that has been into the world as a whole including Africa but then there's this more that as the internet matured it evolved and adapted and became what you're calling permissioned as in like parts of the internet or paywalled by uh whatever you would do like subscribe you subscribe to Bankers use a credit card we do accept crypto but also you can also subscribe anything that you would subscribe pay for on Amazon or pay for any sort of credit card yes you're saying that that was not available to most of Africa because most of Africans can't they're not connected on the payment rails and today is still the case right so you might even have the level of connectivity but for example in Nigeria banks have a limit of 20 a month that you can spend internationally with your bank card so even though you have the connectivity the lack of foreign currency creates this really low ceilings for people to actually participate online and in digital world so as much as as great as the internet is it simply just means less for Africa and that's because again it goes back to centralized institutions even in Tech you know centralized technology institutions are still gated and some of it is just structural right so how those countries economies are structured or the relationship between that economy and Global economies um we pay five to ten billion dollars a year on Swift fees alone right that's that's a massive cost if I'm trying to send you money from one country to the next country the money goes through Europe the US blah blah takes makes a big route around the world and comes next door and then I pay like around 10 of what I'm sending you and just fees routing fees to get it all around so that's so inefficient it it's blocking any type of development and progress when you're basically relying on global institutions that are not designed for your needs interesting so a bank transfer in Africa that goes to a different African country routes through like Europe banking rails yes and a bunch of middlemen up there charge a bunch of fees and then down to a different African country that's very very proximate to the originator but it just goes through Europe first and most transactions are low in numbers so the percentage volume high low and low and high volumes lower numbers so the percentage that you pay for the transaction costs a flat fee yeah it's so high as a result of it okay so these are all money and fee and banking system use cases yes which makes total sense to me does it does it end there no or where where does this go next so Africa has 1.4 billion people 500 million don't even have any form of ID okay so that's that's a big friction point right to participate in anything in the world so that trust identity reputation those are really critical areas where I believe uh blockchain Technologies can have a real impact and that's actually when I talk to different African governments those are areas they're really interested in how do we create shared consensus based truth what is true who owns this land who owns that land knowing like uh having a verifiable form of property rights that's one of the biggest areas where you go to truth is consensus based then we're always in negotiation what's through this that creates a lot of friction right to actually build you know really sophisticated economies on top of those I would imagine something these problems are symbiotic with each other it's weird to call problem symbiotic but like in the negative Direction yeah as in like perhaps it's harder to produce a financial system and banking rails in Africa because there's no identity yes and then also there's it's harder to produce identity when like such a core part of identity is like your bank account yes and your nation state ID yes and you're saying like there's neither in in Africa well I want to say this nothing exists right there's less it's just there's a lot less of it it's not sophisticated it's not fully developed right so for example when you look at payments some African countries have way more advanced payment systems than the US you go to Kenya for example we have m-pesa there which is a mobile money company it works so well everywhere including remote Villages doesn't need internet when you have internet it can get sophisticated basically your phone number is your bank account it's your means of paying salary so receiving income it's your kyc it works so well you know in that country it's heavily centralized but it's functional but when you're trying to do business cross-borders then that's what it becomes challenging when you're trying to get any form of credit then that's where you reach a ceiling because those layers of trust and reputation and and even credit scoring are not as effective or not as efficient so you see some things that are way more developed but a whole lot of things that are not as developed right okay so I have so I have so many more questions but but I first want to make sure that does it end there or so we have Banking and money yeah we have identity yep the other for the use cases that we need to talk about about like what's okay oh boy it keeps on going no no I mean so the the other area is actually the art creative spaces so there's a like African art and African cultures all over the world you see it in music you see it in art you see it and food you know the world is consuming African creatives but very little value is captured by the people who are creating that right so I'm seeing so many artists getting into the nft world and even experimenting with that Medium that wouldn't be possible in traditional art of just painting something you know so uh that's one that's one movement that's happening okay so I think the the picture that you're painting is that there are there are no good monies there are a few good monies in Africa yes and the crypto monies that we've invented as Troublesome and chaotic as they are yeah still present very valid options for for Africans yes uh not only that but stable coins I'm sure are very very relevant they're massive right it's easier to access table coins in so many countries than accessing Fiat dollars especially US dollar stable coins sure to give you an example where I come from Ethiopia uh there's the bank rate and it is unofficial rate of course yeah 100 yeah there's 100 premium 100 premium twice so call it the corruption rate or the free market rate right that's that's what I call it so there's the controlled bank rate right and that's because um and there's a lot more money being transacted outside of the bank rate than you know outside of it than within the system right right that's because um you know there's so many layers it's hard to kind of go through every aspect of it but it's systemic and I don't know if there's a pathway for the governments to find a way out of that right right so uh basically people are transacting outside of that system if I'm running a small shop and I need to buy inventory let's say I'm selling shirts and I have to import a whole lot of shirts from India how do I pay the thousand dollars to actually order that um this is hard to go through the you know the existing process yeah I'm gonna try to use MoneyGram or Western Union right but I'm going to pay ridiculous fees long processes and all of that I might as well just buy US dollar stable coins send it to person over there instant settlement and then I get my items shipped over to me that's how a lot of people are using it right okay so the money conversation is is a double whammy because it's not it's not not just a better money or stronger money Alternatives it's also the lower fees yes right and so like that that makes it a very competitive banking system and access and access yes um and then and then there's I'm sure as soon as you have like established bank account on ethereum with your wallet and your money then like you can start engaging in a more sophisticated Financial tools that we call defy yes I'm sure that is a much more powerful set of financial tools than what the Africans can discover locally yes and that's just the money and finance thing yes that is like that's where so much demand for web3 utility products and services comes from and then also identity on top of that as well yes interesting the broad area of trust trust so basically wherever you need Trust here there's so many things that we take for granted right like um you uh get into a hotel room or you buy a piece of land or you order something online you know something is going to be delivered you kind of like assume that's already going to happen right in a place where there's not a lot of trust infrastructures you're always asking is what the person said actually going to come true right if I have this thing is it actually mine right right so all the different things of trust that you kind of take for granted um they're either non-existent or are very weak in many African countries yeah if any bankless listeners just had the term settlement assurances coming to their head points for you uh supplement insurance is like core part of like what we believe is makes crypto so powerful is the thing that you think is yours actually yours that's like the beautiful thing about crypto is extremely high settlement Assurance yes uh and so it sounds like not just like money and settlement insurance is benefit for Africa but just like identity as like this is also your identity too and other people not just yourself but other people can also rely on this which is important infrastructure yes um I want to ask about just like the culture of users who use these tools in the the United States and in the privileged land where we have like General abundance like we have the crypto is like a casino for us yeah uh it's like absolutely sadly uh I mean it is one of these things that makes these things powerful and you proves all the use case but it's that we have the luxury of using this as a casino and I'm wondering what what is the the culture or the disposition of uh African users who use crypto not as a casino but because they actually really need it and is legitimately a better tool like how would you describe just like the how people engage with these things down there so uh start reality is the casino still exists oh really it's everywhere it's like you see a lot of that in Africa as well okay now we're in a bear Market which is actually good because there's not a ton of like blind uh speculation that's happening but the other side the real use cases one is US dollar stable coins so that's something that a lot of people use for cross-border payments for uh inflation and currency devaluation hedging um I would assume inflation across Africa is terrible it's very high yeah um and the other side is all also I'm hearing of fintex traditional fintech startups who are actually becoming the Key Banking infrastructures in the continent so you're fighting startups providing better Financial Services than Banks do but that's a separate conversation they're using crypto at the back end they want to admit it but they're using Crypts at the back end why don't they admit it because uh it creates a lot of uh crypto issues crypto yeah exactly like you don't want a lot of attention but when I talk to a number of exchanges they're telling me that the biggest clients are fintechs not retail users which is fascinating so they're using it for the treasure management again if you cannot access US Dollars and the currency that you're holding is being devalued over time you want to put it in other asset classes and crypto stable coins make a lot of sense as a Treasurer management it's just a smart thing to do and it's more available to you in a permissionless way than knocking at the doors of a bank yeah the one thing that makes me just so happy and optimistic about this story is that individual visual applicants are choosing to use crypto tools by their own merits and adopting them and you know becoming bankless getting all their their bank accounts but I actually think that that part of the story is also very really cool and optimistic too fintechs adopting crypto for the same reasons because it also provides them as businesses better foundations yes to provide financial services so even if the individual African is not adopting crypto tools the fintech layer of Africa is also improving because of crypto exactly to do the rest the the rest of the mile exactly exactly and I'd expect to see a lot more of that another area that I'm seeing some action in and I'm super excited about is the credit space now for you and I and many people here you know if you've got salary or whatever it's easier for you to access some level of credit even if you have crypto you can borrow money from Ave or compound or whatever right um but if you're just like you know a small business and most of African companies are small businesses um and you don't have a real asset that you can use collateral Banks won't lend to you Banks so here's a sad reality Banks lend two Bankers right because it's Bankers that have stable jobs that Bankers think is solid which is kind of weird and twisted right yeah so if you're if you don't have something that's valuable that you can collateralize then you go to uncoletalized borrowing right do you know how much money you pay what's have a guess have a guess of what how much interest are on average on a year yeah higher than 20 percent keep going 40 okay so uh in Kenyan uh uh in Nigeria for example a bunch of fintechs they are charging 10 to 30 a month a month a month oh my numbers were in a year no 10 to 30 a month because the risk is so high well yes uh perceived risk some actualists some perceived risk so some fintechs that I've talked to where the default rate is less than 10 percent the steel charging super high because that's the current going market rate is it just uh why why is that the going market rate is it just a very inefficient Market with no liquidity so we're like this is a big part of it but the main issue is also just how to press risk oh yeah right okay how to price risk and also as a borrower I can borrow x amount money from you and then if I cannot pay it then I go to somewhere else for that money and then pay you back you get into these cycle ah so one one person can cause 100 people's worth of Destruction exactly uh so one interesting area of application that I'm seeing is there's some fintechs that are getting access of user data uh from mobile money for example which huge mass adoption there and put in that on chain and helping you build on-chain credit credit reporting which helps you access on chain liquidity ah uh-huh so it's actually onboarding a whole lot of people into crypto without them even realizing it and helping you build on-chain reputation and track record which now multiple fintechs can use as a single source of Truth as opposed to each one kind of determining you know what your credit worthiness does that make sense yeah 100 and when I was previously talking about oh yeah so you you have your ethereum wallet or your Bitcoin wallet and you're using stable coins and that's all great because you get better money and cheaper fees uh and then I was talking about D5 it's like oh and also like D5 is better like they can use uniswap to swap tokens maybe they are yeah but I think maybe the bigger story is this credit access to credit is the bigger part of the finance for world forever let me put in this way um you talked about casinos earlier right right my view is that in the Western and many Eastern worlds cryptra is a nice to have but for the masses it's just a nice to have right because you already have so many things working for you right and that's where we things are a nuisance not a critical problem exactly yeah there exists they provide services governments provide services even though we don't like them right so for for the like 10 or 15 of us crypto is so much more valuable is important but it's hard to go above that unless you start adding real utility that is way better than the current system right and the friction is low and that's what we keep talking about in this world um when you go to many African countries the the existing apparatus the the current Paradigm is just not working right so that's where you can reach beyond the 510 15 of adoption rates of a whole population you can go a lot higher than that right when you start building applications that actually meet people's needs um so that I think that's where the real opportunities to me is in Africa crypto can be a plan a not a plan B plan C or plan not a backstop it's exactly the First Choice it's not a backup plan right it is the plan yeah well so this thesis resonates obviously and I think anyone who's been in crypto long enough understands that like this is why we do this like this is why we're here the opportunity Salient yes um the also if the opportunity is so good what's the The Venture landscape what's the the business landscape look like I would imagine this would be interesting for more than a few VCS out there yeah what's that like so um in February I led a trip with vitalik and Aya for a month across four countries who runs the EF and a number of other uh ethereum communities and we just held very low key events um didn't make a big splash um and we had about you know a few hundred Founders and Builders came came up to various of those events is a vitalik known as well known in Africa as he is in Argentina uh I don't know about how well he's very nice we went we went to cafes and restaurants where uh you know people were trying to pay for our meals or come by and say hi you know like you know it was it was it was amazing but also I think uh people are quite respectful sure you know so he wasn't getting overloaded but people recognized him and that was a really interesting Miss test uh so yeah you know here is well known and yeah we met a whole lot of Builders who are basically at the stage of building the core infrastructures I think that's still very much needed so bomb ramps and off-ramps exchanges uh credit tools lending pools [Music] um means for people to basically uh create advances on their salaries but we met a whole lot of people trying to build new stable coins either real world asset back stable coins or a basket of currencies because that's where the energy is at that's where the demand is at um and there's so many other builders who met around you know solving problems that you wouldn't think of coming from the West so for example like in Ethiopia getting medicine that's high quality and known is really hard and the one common thing that we have is you know if I'm visiting Ethiopia I can tell you all my relatives are asking me hey Joseph can you buy a b c d put it in your bag and bring it along here yeah it's so common and like every Ethiopian listening will totally get this yes it's just something we all do right so there's a team that's actually building an application to like make that process a lot simpler like hey if I've got a kilo or two keyless in my bag I can get stuff that people need but then how do I trust right me how do I trust what I'm buying is correct so they're putting aspects of that on chain to create a level of transparency so these types of applications that you wouldn't think about it coming in the Western World um but African Builders are working on those so you see some like really original thoughts and approaches but the market is still early so uh crypto adoption in my view like really started in 2018 2019 so we're we're just seeing one cycle on the continent so uh it's still quite early but you know last year there was about 150 plus million dollars invested in crypto companies five billion dollars in just general Tech startups so still a long way to go in terms of the Venture space being developed sure uh so I'm kind of afraid about how naive this question is but you said like adoption happens and it started happening in 2018. well I would say like even inside of America or Europe the adoption didn't happen until then too yeah um and even throughout the bear Market we were so like looking for our use case uh so we were talking about oh yeah payments we know that but like we want more um but it really sounds like perhaps Africa is actually the continent that has adopted crypto the most it is it is already it's already number one in crypto users uh so Kenya and Nigeria make the top 20 crypto adoption index okay last year we had about a hundred billion dollars of on-chain transaction um of volume uh it's small compared to the rest of the world right but it's significant for the local economies um you know many countries is between five to fifteen percent of those populations but if you see in that in actual numbers Africa is 1.4 billion people to put that into context since all of Europe all of the United States and all of South America combined so it's a huge Market huge continent Nigeria is just 250 million people right Ethiopia is 120 million people right so it's we're talking about large populations so ensure numbers it is high the volume per User it's low what's the average age of Africa median ages 19. yeah so it's the youngest part of the world what about like internet connectivity and access access like how hard is it to access crypto yeah so about 590 million Africans have access to the internet and that's growing six percent a year okay so in urban areas six percent a year six percent it's increasing by six it has to be the highest rate in the world right yeah yeah it's very high I don't know I haven't benchmarking the rest of the world but that's really high right um and in urban areas where 40 of the population lives internet access is very high right so one of the things I spent the last two years doing is actually talking to normal people students crazy recent graduates universities well that's where a lot of the people are right right just to understand what's the dream what's their vision for their lives what are the things that they're learning about many young people are learning online more than what they're learning universities and in schools two-thirds of all African developers are self-taught or learning on the job so the internet is really opening up access to education and information and you know I've talked to a number of folks who you know graduated in agriculture in architecture for example and thinking well what kind of career can I build in architecture in my country here unless I have an ability to go elsewhere and then discover crypto I said this is so interesting how about I teach myself solidity people teaching themselves solidly on YouTube on their mobile phones right and then start working with Dows and then earn your first few hundred dollars and you buy a laptop right and then you start contributing more to Dallas and you do it anonymously no one cares you know when it's still who you are where you're from and people are making real income real living as a full-time job without meeting a single person in real life who's working in the space and that's really fascinating like how people are getting to this space on their own yes there are a whole lot of people getting in to speculate to buy tokens and all of that but there are a whole lot of serious people getting to the space and seeing it as a real source of income and a real source of really maximizing the full potential as human beings right without needing to leave home there's always this idea of leapfrogging Technologies yes uh I think this is typically used when Africa never really went desktop it went just mobile first yes and so it leapfrocked into that technology yes I'm sure there's other examples that are low hanging fruit that I'm gonna forget In This Moment we've had multiple Loop rocks on the continent we LeapFrog landlines right yeah and it's so fast right uh I think the last data points that I checked 93 out of every 100 user has uh set up a SIM card account on the content so that's like right that's that's huge right Willie frog banks with mobile money right and now we're leapfrogging the centralized institutions with crypto and so it seems like and that's I think the the punch line uh in the combination of like leapfrogging education Tech with AI sorry to bring AI into the conversation but just like I'm sure AI is a powerful democratizing force of Education totally it's happening at the same time that we are able to Africa is able to LeapFrog into better money and better Financial Services with crypto yes and that part like leapfrogging technology is always an exciting conversation and of itself but when you LeapFrog money is Big because money's so deeply rooted in this in the bottom of a social cultural stack yes it is very important critical social infrastructure yes and so when you LeapFrog advancements in money the downstream net effects of that can only be best we have to absolutely so massive yeah because that a whole economy is built on that if you don't have that it's hard to build everything else everything else right right exactly frogging trust yeah yeah leapfrogging centralized institutions and my my view is that if we keep with the status quo Africa's position at the bottom of the pyramid is pretty much locked in for at least the next hundred years right that's right because it's it's there's a downward pressure to kind of keep you at that bottom of the pyramid right and when you talk to a whole lot of young people there are 900 million Africans who are under the age of 30. men who are a million they have dreams they have desires they want to have a much of this world as much as everyone else right right and so the best outlet is online but then online is gated if you have a means to pay and receive money right you need that to power that right and so crypto is like great this makes a lot more sense so this is not um to me the Africa narrative here an opportunity it's not just like hey let me put five percent of my assets into some high growth high-risk space and see what happens like no I want to have access to the world and this is giving me that access to the world that's very that's beautiful um also the another opportunity really is is that the incumbent continents like uh America and China um like America is going to go down fighting like the banking system is going to go down fighting like they're they're trying to ban crypto before really allowing it to be adopted and then like most of the population doesn't care yes like crypto is that weird thing with like the Wall Street bets folk yeah so they're not going to adopt it simply because they're they don't need it and then the incumbent systems are going to fight it meanwhile Africa is going to adopt it simply out of necessity yes and learn to use it and learn to refine it and grow it yes naturally and organically yes that makes me bullish yes because it's it's accepting crypto there's all like continents and populations and cultures have to get over the accepting crypto hurdle yes and it sounds like Africa's like that hurdle for Africa is like very very low to the ground like exactly it's not hard to accept crypto in Africa this this makes a lot more sense and to me it's not like um you know shops and everything except in crypto necessarily that's not the indication of success to me it's not like onboarding everyone to the crypto economy the way we think about it here is like I don't want to have a bank I don't have it Fiat I don't want to hold any local Payment Systems I think what I'm observing is actually people move Fiat to crypto and then crypto to Fiat to do things that fiatifiat doesn't allow them to do and that's a lot of things right so to me it's not like just make everything ethereum and that that makes sense is actually make you your whole economy powered by ethereum right right I think that's that's the bigger opportunity to me it's not like what we talk about in just in our own crypto Circles of like how the world can be more like live on decentralized blockchains right is actually make decentralized blockchains the back end right that the powers the whole economy right I remember this one line from Andreas Antonopoulos he called it um I think it's like technology inversion uh something inversion and he was using the idea of Once Upon a Time yeah we squeezed the internet through dial up yes and that's how we use the internet and then we made broadband and then that was instead of having to put the internet through telephone lines we just made we made wires specifically for the internet yeah and then and then the internet exploded because it didn't have to get throttled through dial up and when you tell me like like in the beginning stages it goes from Fiat to crypto to Fiat to do things that Fiat only can't do to me that's like we're trying to squeeze through crypto through the Fiat yeah bandwidth and which is great it's where you get started you got to start somewhere but then also merely doing that also sets the stage for the inversion where we just do away with the Fiat and we're like okay just just crypto yeah crypto only yeah and Africa sounds like it's first down that down that path yeah and it's happening at scale in a lot of different places and you talked about governments earlier African governments are still wary and not sure about this space there are some that have outright banded so when I talk about Africa Africa is 54 countries right so it's very different Dynamics right I actually love to talk about Africans the people it's like this is people power right it's not institution power and it's the people who have the needs of the demands and I'm very more on the African people building the infrastructures for an economy that works for them instead of waiting for a permissioned way to create this so crypto is thriving despite governments not as a result of governments yeah and and to my loose and uninformed take about like Africa is that's just like the borders um the countries of Africa mean less than the culture and communities of Africa as in just like uh the the boundaries of Africa was drawn by uh like Europeans and they were just a bunch of them yeah in like the 1880s Berlin Conference right and so I think Africa of all continents that are out there is most primed to become borderless using borderless tools like ethereum like crypto yes I I have a this Vision that you know borderless Africa is what many young people are striving towards but not necessarily like hey let's let's bring down the borders that we kind of see and know off is just the borders like we're borders exactly where borders create a lot of the barriers right because the way IMF relates to Africa the word the World Bank relates to Africa the way the global power is relate to Africa is bordered Nation by border Nation right and so whenever you try to break free of that you come across a brick wall right that you can't pass through right so the shared experience of being separated from the world separated from each other that's that's that's the borders there's a physical border there's an economic border there's a psychological border you know and and that's what I see many African Builders thinking it's like I am African first right and a citizen of that country second is because there's a shared experience and there's a shared challenge there and and I believe like you know kind of inspired by you guys bankless right I think a bottle of Africa makes a lot of sense right yeah no well that that we also see that we also see that um uh Joseph you're starting a venture fund I am tell us about this thing so uh my vision is basically increasing Crypt production on the continent in real world use cases and helping us build a borderless life for a whole lot of Africans and I see that in multiple approaches one is actually uh creating soil I love the notion of infinite Garden right so you need to build rich soil on the continent to help whole ecosystems to thrive right and that is our education Community Building awareness building and that's all to me Public public goods and that's one stuff I'm really focused on is supporting a lot of communities on the ground supporting events hopefully you know you and friends can come spend time there connect with local communities so there are a few events that are happening there there's eat Safari it's a local ethereum community happening in Kenya in September so there's a lot of those beautiful things that are happening that I believe is public goods and we need to put resources and support that on the other side when you have fertile soil you need forests right and those are the projects the protocols the applications that are actually bringing these Visions to life and to me I think capital is a means to support and enable that to happen so I'm building a venture fund to basically back black African Founders who have deep local context and understanding and are building from the bottom up and our long-term thinkers and I didn't wake up thinking hey I'm going to be a VC but that's the highest leverage way to actually support this work right funnel Capital into the places that it needs to go being a good capital allocator is one of the best things you can do to grow up burgeoning like ecosystem inside of a a an economy that needs it why are you the right person to do this job what's your advantage why are you going to be a great capital allocator for Africa like what skills do you bring to the table so I have uh spent still the majority of my life on the continent and I have felt the pain that many young Africans feel and I have deep like in my blood relationship with the struggle right and I feel like I've been extremely lucky in my life uh to have leapfrogged so many parts of society and you know spent a lot of time in the US and the west and in the East um and I've seen that side of the world as well and have built a lot of relationships and I see my role as a bridge builder between that world and African ecosystems where there's Mutual value and relationship building so that's one less that I have the other lenses I've spent the last eight ten years building stuff so I come from a builder perspective in world and I have a deep empathy towards Founders and Builders who are down in the trenches building the infrastructures that's going to last so that's the lens that I'm bringing to the table and the third is you know I want to see the crypto World succeed and I want to see Africa succeed so I'm operating with a very long-term length in mind the sad realities on the continent today there are a lot of mercenaries sure mercenary chains mercenary protocols I don't want to name names now but um there's a lot of bad behavior that is underselling the value of crypto and underselling the value of where Africans want to go um so I'm positioning myself to do the opposite of that hopefully and help us build a thriving Community a thriving continent um and help Global communities also understand and be part of Africa's Journey you know we sell China's growth and it's tremendous why we're seeing India's growth and development and technology has been a big part of that now is the face of Africa and I I don't think the world understands what's happening there I don't think the crypto World understands the potential and I want to see more of the ethereum community get plugged in and connect because I believe the ethereum values are deeply aligned with where many young Africans want to go and and I want to help build that bridge where are you in the uh setting up this fund where are you in the life cycle of this fund and what are you you're currently raising and yeah if people are interested where can I go to find out more uh they could reach out to me Yosef hey.com uh or we'll get those links in the channel sure sure or reach out to me on Twitter hi pretty chat uh on that front uh building it and there's a lot of projects that I'm ready to back right now so I'm really Keen to get going as soon as possible um but the main thing I'd say is you know um there are a lot of people who kind of raising fund and cutting corners and all of that to me it's it's about relationships and this is a long-term Journey so um if people want to invest it's less there's a money part of it but there's also like hey let's actually build a direct relationship with African Builders and this is one of the gateways for them to do so well yes if the thesis makes sense to me and I think that if in the world where we fast forward into the future and crypto hadn't completely uh integrated into Africa and really helped out at a very deep level then we've deeply failed as an industry uh we should look at Africa as like the first main validation of what we can do for the rest of the world because it seems like Africa's running uh for it first and so uh I wish you the best of luck on your on your adventure arm and I'm happy to help in any way I can thanks so much crypto needs Africa so let's make it happen oh yeah what what give us the bull case for our bags give us the for us westerners who are going to stick around in front of our TVs and our computers and we're just gonna like oh I hope Africa uses the the crypto what what is the bulk case for crypto if Africa adopts it in the best ways that it can yeah why is it good for the last 10 years we've been talking about Mass adoption we've been talking about real world use cases uh Beyond just the you know intellectual circles that we're navigating right well the masses in Mass adoption are in Africa right so we're gonna pay more attention there you want to have this technology to be used in daily life whether it's a bull market or a bear market and people derive real value from and if you're deriving real value you pay fees right and there's a real economic model to sustain it I believe that's where Africa contributes to the crypto narrative and and cycle so I think for this industry to succeed and to actually survive the test of time we need that we need the real stuff right and and the real side of the conversation to me Africa is a big part of it it's not the only part but it's a huge part of that

zuzalo means many many things for many different people uh what does it mean for you I think the one word that encapsulates those value for me and even for the anthropolitan community is access right being able to have a seat at a table when especially when you get to be around some of the brightest Minds in the world where a lot of these Frontier knowledge is being pushed you have access to that seat and for so long I would say a lot of Africans have been the last of the party when the cake has been shared and when we come we're like oh we don't even get crumbs what's going on right so for me suzalu represents access right and access at the front seat at the table okay so uh you mentioned that for politan which is the thing yeah that you want to bridge towards here here's uzalo but specifically for your movement uh access access is important but what what here what is here in zuzalo for that movement so first I think we were able to also come here with at least 20 plus of our citizens right coming out to Montenegro I mean you're around against one of the brightest Minds right so you have Founders within our Network creatives within our Network professionals within our Network they're able to come here collaborate connect even I think a few of them got some investment opportunities as well again it's like access not just to even the people but just again to the capital that's probably available or to the information that's available which is huge because for a long time the way the world has been set up this information Arbitrage which is you you know and we don't know and because you know we we don't get to be again at a seat at the table so again that's what this represents for us sure okay so let's dive head first into the movement yeah what is the after polishing movement so I would say is movement movement the right word you know definitely the right word and I think I'll probably want to just give context real quick so I think the best way to understand the anthropolitan journey is to think about it in three phases right phase one of our politics is an organization I started while in law school in San Francisco catering to the Afghan dashboard through events so think your favorite afrobeats parties concerts festivals cultural events cultural events yeah a significant a significant highlight of that phase one was something called the year of return that happened in Ghana in 2019 where we basically helped facilitate about a million plus people from the diaspora heading to Ghana it generated about two billion dollars worth of economic activity for Ghana right that's phase one phase two then starts in 2020 where we wanted to reload the year of return again and then covet happens right covert decimates the entire in real life events industry and we were forced to Pivot and we pivoted into media but through a social audio app called clubhouse right so in clubhouse between I am my co-founder chica we built communities under about 200 000 people collectively right and we show the capacity for active action which made us very ready when the next year 2021 Balaji srinivasan right he drops this article called how to start a new country and in the article this was April 2021 and I'll be wearing the car Senegal actually when we read this and he proposes this idea of a network state which is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for Collective action that's able to craft front territory around the world and eventually gain diplomatic recognition in pre-existing States now when I read it it was like man this is like a powerful idea but it was more theoretical but I could see the shapes of it but there was a particular quote in that article that I think really held us to the um the idea where he says because the brand new is Unthinkable we fight over the old and I think for us it was like damn it feels like that encapsulates that's a good one it felt like that encapsulated what we felt as Africans like we consistently fight over the old whether it's historical constraints or Colonial baggage we're not able to transcend into the future right and so for the rest of the Year this is where Bank list comes in we red pill our way into web three right a lot of backless podcasts a lot of like articles you just consistently like every weekend you've been through those rabbit holes where you're just consistently web3 driven and come December 21 2021 I wake up in Nairobi Kenya at 5am I'm pacing the room for about an hour um my partner's like hey what's going on I'm like look I know how I would look at someone who's about to tell you what I'm about to tell you but I think we need to start a new country and she's like wait what and I'm like yeah but we need to find out why because you're you're towing the line between being a conspiracy theorist and like just being cuckoo bird right and we drew some inspiration from the American Foundry fathers from the Federalist one where Anthony Hamilton basically says is it possible for societies of men to form a new constitution through reflection and choice or are we forever destined to depend on our governance through accident and force and we were like damn that's our why no modern nation state in Africa was created through reflection and choice it has always been through accident and force and so what would it look like if we could form a new country but this time with people who have shared values and purpose in a borderless manner right the internet enables us to organize around shared values if Facebook for example was a country with its own cryptocurrency it would be the largest country in the world but this time instead of an online passive Community which is what Facebook is it's a social network it's now a community aligned around shared values and purpose with its own currency and then you can bring you can you can you can get recognition from pre-existing States based on that and so our why is pretty strong right and it cuts across like I said we're trying to do away with a lot of the historical constraints in the colonial baggage and that whole idea of because the brand new is Unthinkable we fight over the old it that's why our ideology is one of abundance because we're seeing scarcity wreck a lot of stuff across Africa or just even just being African in the world and we want to build upon an ideology of abundance abundance of tools abundance of even in mindset abundance of resources and that's the way we see it so I've talked with a few other network say people and like the broad pitches man we haven't had a new city or a new country in over 100 hundreds of years yeah and so we're built on Old foundations like you said and so like it's just like the incumbents of the world I do really enjoy the idea of thinking about countries and governments as like incumbents that could be disrupted which most people don't think about yeah but for many people like people in the United States people I'm assuming also Europe are like that's a great thought experiment yeah interesting article yeah some good brain candy uh but like practically I'm comfy with where I am uh but also I think with what you're teasing here is that like Africa particularly is primed for this yeah as in it it can be not a thought experiment it can be a manifest yeah uh so can you give the pitch to people who are uninformed about Africa why Africa is so primed for a network State movement yeah so I would say and I could give this an analogy I think it gives us an effect so picture a house that has a weak Foundation right you go into this house and you say hey we want to fix the weak foundation and but instead of starting with the foundation you start painting the walls you start fixing the AC stop fixing the fans and then you're like oh pop up the window and then yeah the house is stable but it still collapses right because the foundation is weak the weak foundation in that analogies are governance systems across Africa right the AC is maybe like our fintech industry the fans are like maybe our health tech industry or whatever industry exists what happens is we have this idea that we can entrepreneur our way out of these problems and it doesn't work because eventually the weak Foundation collapses these different sectors that are trying to thrive right so for us we're saying why don't we go foundational fix the actual Foundation because when you compare Africa to the rest of the world there's a sense of is this a feature or is this a bug right and so our argument is it's a feature and we'll explain why when it's a when it's a bug what it looks like is Singapore Vietnam Dubai these are countries that for the most part maybe got their independence after a lot of African countries so I'll give you an example Vietnam war ended in 1975. Nigeria got its independence in 1960. that's a full 15 years Head Start look at Vietnam today look at Nigeria today right Singapore right the Singaporean leader would literally come to Lee Kuan you would literally come to Africa to visit because Singapore hadn't necessarily achieved its independence yet look at Singapore today look at like a whole host of African countries 9 out of the ten countries with the highest poverty rates are from Africa right and so for us what we're saying why we're saying is the feature not a bug it's because the feature was we never actually started it through reflection and choice right Vietnam's the Vietnamese fought for what they believed in right the single parents also put out their own Constitution and fought as well for what they believed in where did we we had a fight for independence but it was never based on any philosophical or Independence right what was the reflection and what was the choice keep in mind also because of the borders that were drawn haphazardly in the Berlin Conference right a lot of tribes just got tossed in and the borders just got written where when you visited Africa today you can cross the border and they speak the same language but it's just a line in front of them that was drawn by someone else again who was not privy or maybe didn't even care about the realities on ground which brings us back to the whole zoo point right the original seat at the table was the Berlin Conference right where things have been divided and the whole continent is being shared I bet you there's no African in there being like right and just to dive into the history because like the Berlin Conference yeah 1880 yeah yeah it's the same thing yeah a bunch of Europeans yes come down and draw the map of Africa from Berlin yes and this is no Google Maps by the way which are completely incongruent with the actual cultural uh cultural divisions that are in the space which was we're more organically emergent boundaries would be formed exactly and so this is and this has been the way that this is and it's not like so today it's not like the tribes of Africa then settled into those boundaries and so there's still tribal differences yeah and so you're saying that that discrepancy between where the European lines are of Africa versus the actual cultural topology of Africa because there's discrepancy there because there's friction there that makes Africa primed for a new map yeah or a new country yes because the network states allow us to withdraw those Colonial borders but this time digitally first and inline second right so because now you're forming a new Society or new nation but this time it's around shared values and purpose and so it's no longer about like the historical constraints of the colonial baggage or saying hey we don't speak the same language or we don't have the same religion or all the things that divide us are the old we're trying to disembark from those to do the brand new and so for that that requires us basically recruiting like the sort of folks who would have come on the ship heading on a Mayflower basically so it's like because that's a different sort of mindset so right now we've set up with 500 citizens of permanent passports you're looking to recruit the folks who I don't know if you're into a lot of Viking shows like Ragnarok and all that stuff okay but the whole idea is like you have people who are like retired with our status grow we're gonna go on the ship it's the unknown we don't know but it is better than our status quo we know that for a fact whatever it's out there has to be better than our status quo and so for us it involves us reaching out globally to recruit the sort of people who would have boarded the Mayflower which only started with a hundred and something people by the way right and now obviously the US is like a 300 million people country trillions of dollars of GDP but it's the same mindset of we want the new world we want a new order and the reason is because our status quo actually sucks like this isn't even like it's terrible across every industry I just give you a stat of nine out of the top 10 countries in the world with the highest poverty rates are from Africa let's not talk about what devaluation has done done to our currencies proper so when crypto came right it was like okay now you have crypto and now you have the ability to maybe form with the internet to organize around shared values why don't we try for that right and that allows us to potentially hopefully transcend our current status quo yeah the uh one concerning theme of like the network State movement is that you have a bunch of just like centralized Founders trying to make a city yeah right and the what gets me optimistic about this movement is that you're the case for why afropolitan why Africa is the right place to actually apply these principles first is the latent demand in the people in the popular in the community in the culture the culture is ready to accept a movement yeah um or at least that's my that's my attitude and I think what you're saying because you just go into like why the culture uh is ready to accept a network State movement like why is this not going to be a top-down implementation from from some leaders I think it's the same reason why when you look at a lot of stats about crypto he's see a lot of African markets pop up right when you think through the principles of like blockchain and rep 3 it's maybe transparency accountability immutability no single point of failure right what continent has experienced the opposite of that sure that's Africa till today single points of failure across all our governments right across rcbns or central banks our currencies are like when I'm telling you bro like I'm talking about tissue paper it's probably better but seriously and so the people don't have faith even in their local currencies right so then they reach for at a USD equivalents or crypto so crypto land acts as a store of value for people on a continent and then talk about transparency like there's a low trust um deficit because we don't trust our governments and because of that we don't also distrust our institutions so blockchain or even crypto allows for us to say hey you don't even need to trust Etsy and Chica it's transparently on the founders yes the founders right and so it's not a thing where our governance especially if it's through a doubt right there's no single point of failure so if etchy and Chica starts growing up you can get them out of here and then you can continue going right or if actually and Chica because if you think about past historical movements like this whether it's like the mlks or the Malcolm X's or whatever once they died or once they got taken out the movement dies right and so it's again how do you not allow for a single point of failure how do you allow for accountability transparency and because it's also immutable it has immutable aspects at least for more trust so what one example I give is when we release our passports I love just being able to go to an ether scan and see all the smart contracts details so I remember a citizen couldn't find where they sent their passport nft2 and all we've just collectively had to do is just go and eat the scan and we're like hey you sent this to this address and that's this address right and it was like you didn't have to wait for us to go into the back room and then go look for papers and no it's like publicly Unchained and it allows for us to then hold folks accountable and I'll tell you another reason why in Africa there's a lot of corruption especially even with gov meant um budgets and stuff right you have budget start passed and maybe one of the projects is to complete a bridge or completed Road or whatever and the money gets allocated the bridge never gets built the road never gets built and when you ask her where did the money go to where's this you start hearing all these stories like oh a snake ate it or literally I'm talking about literally a snake ate it a monkey came in or and and these are real official stories from a government right and for us it's like hey it's not that blockchain prevents you from stealing but you still want transparently right you know what I mean for that it then allows us to at least have a standing point to hold you accountable which we don't have today right so then going coming back to the whole network set idea is look the young Africans they are ready for a borderless world right crypto also speaks to them it's an Emerging Market thing these principles apply more to a continent that's crying off for this because we're tired of living in conditions that don't speak to our need for Freedom right and so for us what's the one thing that allows us to enshrine our freedom and code right it's the blockchain but also a potential Network State as well and I think that's that's the approach that we're taking beautiful what would you say uh what is the afropolitan road map yeah there is one yeah and where are we in that romance so there are four phases of the road map phase one for us is what we're calling building out the network which is US literally going out and recruiting the best of the best Africa and the dashboard and our allies have to offer across multiple sectors I think the reason why that is is we believe that a nation has to be formed not just by Tech Founders or not just by financiers it needs to be Collective so you need to also reach out to the artists like the Renaissance movement especially in Europe helps usher in a lot of all the other advances in science and other other Industries as well so we've been very intentional about recruiting those folks to and we released our first 500 passports NFC art passports um to get those you have to apply what we were filtering for was high alignment right so it's not just to say hey I want to get your NFC and pump and dump and flip it and going blur open see no it was like Hey I want to be a part of this movement and I want to contribute to this movement right and then and then we release those that's phase one and it obviously we'll release more passports as we go so we're recruiting people as we go phase two for us is what we're calling government as a service so it's like come for the network stay for the tool right and for us it's we're modeling that around a super app type of idea where it's like within this app you're able to do things like potential e-residency self-serving ID being able to make payments for goods and services using afropolitan currency a token one day and just being able to just Ladder Up Services on there and I think it's similar to like a WeChat in terms of comparison out of China which they average about 57 per user by offering a bunch of different Services we're looking to model that out as well within anthropolitan platform phase three for us is What's called the minimum viable state which is how do we Ladder Up The credibility of build up The credibility to be viewed as a country when you don't just come and say hey we're a country recognize us it's what is the thing yeah here's our flag what are the things you've done to show that you even have the responsibility of the capacity legitimacy where it is your legitimacy come from right and so in September of last year we got recognized by the New York Stock Exchange as the first ever internet country for the Afghan diaspora again that's more of a perception play right because so um the New York Stock Exchange is a 200 year old institution right and they're recognizing you as a internet country for the African diaspora today's New York Stock Exchange America be the United Nations right and so other than that we provide visa and arrival services for four African countries today Nigeria Ghana Kenya and Tanzania and the thought process behind that is we started off as an entertainment and tourism company when you try to go through the official channels and a lot of these governments you get hit with bureaucracy where you come through us we're all about efficiency and capacity we just got it done right like we're at government or where services company we just get it done we cut through all the Merck and just go to handle it and I think from that is similar to I always give the example of Amazon right if Amazon says to me today like hey I need your garage key to drop off your packages in your room right I'm like here you you've earned my trust over so many years they're like hey just do what you have to do right please place it in the top dresser trap door thank you thank you I appreciate all this help you have done over the years and the reason for that is they've aggregated their trust over years I remember the first time that I didn't get something properly delivered through Amazon and before I could say refund the money wasn't my account right and I was like God damn and it's like now you have me as a lifetime value Customer because I'm like these are the people who've earned my trust and that trust is compounded that's the same way we're thinking about phase three right phase four for us I just to dive into that because I think that's such an important Point yeah to me the success getting the green check box on phase three is like the Tipping Point because this is the fight that we take on Bank list which is the fight for hearts and Minds yeah right and so you said you're here in uh zuzalu to to access right for Access yes accessing what accessing a network accessing Capital accessing influence because the way that you get the hearts and Minds is that you get people on board to accept the movement as legitimate yeah but the movement you can't just accept it as legitimate just because it's a good idea you also have to actually meaningfully improve people's lives exactly right and so that's where that's phase two comes into play where you actually start providing value and services not just a meme not just a movement but you actually meaningfully yeah move the needle in people's lives for people who are agnostic to the movement it's like the movement I don't really care about but they helped me and they improved my life and then so phase three is you turn up the dialogue you turn up the juice exactly you you get more Capital you get more leadership you get and you you just win the hearts and Minds together and you get larger institutions to accept you as legitimate not because they're going begrudgingly but because they think like this this is this is a real I want to align with that Force yeah that is a movement that is powerful again I don't care I don't necessarily care about that movement I'm agnostic to that movement but I acknowledge yeah that is powerful and it's in my interest to accept it as legitimate you you have encapsulated that so perfectly and I think even doubling down on that what we say when we go with our manifesters we are curators of African Talent culture experiences capital and information and all those things is what we're looking to use to aggregate our leverage so we we have Founders within the networks today who literally have gotten funded by being part of the network right for raising capital or the exclusive information that we get access to all the experiences of the culture right and so for us it's you want to be viewed as hey this is a powerful movement that I want to align myself to because first of all they don't around but first of all you just want to have these people on your side right and so it's it's basically down up the knobs on everything like whatever it is that you have leverage you just dial it up to 100 right and you apply it so that people are like hey I might not even really care about their whole alignment a sovereign movement or whatever but you realize that the people within this network are people who represent the influence and the power and The Leverage that you you would want to have with anything that you're looking to do and that has been something that we're like dialing up the knob on right so even like with zalu like a lot of folks are like how do you guys even get access to this right and it's like yeah we're here we're at a seat at the table we have information the people of zuzaru have people of the best movement legitimate exactly right and so you you leverage that and dial up the knob in other areas as well right so yeah I think you've encapsulated that perfectly okay take me to uh phase four which is the last phase so um it's a land face right so it's it's a redrawing the map phase yes yes I love that and we want to combine two concepts together for that we don't just want a border anymore to be four corner borders we want to discontinuous border that cuts across the world so much like a Chinese wall type of Border but across the world what would that look like we want to combine two concepts together one is the embassy and the other one is a Chinatown take for example the US Embassy in maybe Montenegro is a sovereign territory in a host government right in chinatowns they have their own post office they're on malls their own banking their own Services right we want to combine those two concepts together to get us a sovereign afro town Sovereign afrotown yes okay located in every major city in the world okay so going back to the whole Visa issues I was telling you about before imagine you just had a sovereign Africa town and you're not for parts in citizens and you're just going to the afro Town within Montenegro right you might not be running into the same immigration issues if you're just going to wear your own town is right you're going from home to home to home to home to home to home exactly and so let's then zoom out right for this roadmap you're an anthropology citizen you navigate the world with the arthropolitan passport you're able to make payments for goods and services using the anthropolitan platform without currency cryptocurrency are you able to get physical entry into Sovereign Africa towns located across the world right and so like when people hear us say this Vision they're like you guys might have jumped off the cliff but I think for us it's when we're thinking through what is it that we want it's like we want freedom at scale but we but we're tired of navigating the world from the place of Outsiders like the Hoops that we have to jump through all this time even if you have the same earning power it's it's insane but we've gotten so used to it that we're navigating the world consistently from a place of survival where I'm like I'm I'm enough is enough because we've been to the same schools we've read the same books we watched the same YouTube shows so we now know that the advantages are not necessarily innate it's just information Arbitrage we're gonna have to go fix this so we're locked out of a Global Financial systems I can give you an example when I travel across Nigeria or when I'm in Africa I might not be able to access some of my U.S banking apps right and then you call them and you say to them like hey what's going on like why can't I access my money like I'm on my bank and they're like hey you know Nigeria it might be a fraud issue you know there's a lot of Nigerian princes out there so exactly you you the database decision and like yeah I'm like okay cool yeah so pull up the top 10 countries on your platform where fraud happens right and I want to know if you've banned all of them because Nigeria is not even the top 10. and I'm like oh but I see are you Banning Russia you've been in China are you Banning Poland are you back like you've been in all these countries no why everyone goes silent but what's being said to me it's not even a racism issue it's more of like they have power they have influence they have resources and you don't so I was I was very heavy on philosophy um Greek philosophy back in the day and there's always been this quote where it says to strong do what they can the weak and deal what they must right and for us it's from an African mindset is we know the cards that life has dealt us we just refuse to accept them and that's just the basis of where we're at and so right now we're in phase one right phase one we put out the passports they sold out we're gonna release some more but every day even while being as a result you're consistently recruiting people whether it's allies or just even pure citizens or even Visa holders to your movement but you're consistently recruiting Because again it's our goal is if we can get critical mass we aggregate leverage at scale and we can apply it to the causes and the goals that we care for just to dive into phase four a little bit more um something I've learned well here at zero um that I probably should have known anyways but I needed to know to learn it is this word diaspora yeah can you define that word for us for me and the many bankless listeners that actually don't know that word bro you just killed me I know yeah no but I love the brackets for that because chicken is that too and every time she's learning something about immigrants and I'm like yeah don't worry like there's a whole different type of story so diaspora is folks who for the most part like I consider myself an African dashboard right and for the most part my family left Nigeria for better opportunity and optionality in our lives right because our status quo just wasn't it most diasporary movements are like that whether it's the Chinese diaspora the Indian dashboard any just any diaspora movement which is we are born into a country and the opportunities and optionality we don't have it right we want opportunities I'm surrounding our lives for our families for our children we then migrate out right and so when we migrate we still have connections to the Homeland because we still might have other family members who are not able to come and we're not able to get visas right but what we then do is we send money back home so that's going to ask for our sends about 70 billion dollars of remittances yearly right that's a huge like in Nigeria's case that's uh that's bigger than our foreign direct investments from anything else so that's why did she holding up the country for a foreign investment perspective and so that those those are the type of roles that's for our place it's the dashboard that says okay now um I've gone to America I might have a job by myself with a low paying job but maybe I walk my way up but now the money I sent back home is not able to support my family they might be able to get health care they might be I might not be able to buy a home or a house for people back home I'll be able to send other folks to school to get them other opportunities to go and so that's the thought process that's what that's the role of a diaspora and it's a lot of responsibility right it's like you feel it as you go like you you do not just here by yourself you represent a lot of other people so it's almost like when we get access into rooms your your goal is to basically keep the door open for all the other folks who can't get in to get into it and you always carry that sense of responsibility because there are folks who just getting throughout doing like Hey guys you're gonna have to figure out your ways to get in here similar to how I did but for us and for like even after parts and we feel that weight of responsibility which is why by being as a result you're like I'm not just representing myself I'm representing all the folks who I know would never even have a chance to even be able to get in here so that's that's that's the diaspora movement right and to try and put it into this like the most concrete words possible that I've understood it it's like people who have a home away from home exactly right and so uh people that are like African yes that live elsewhere yes because of opportunity or many other reasons they were just raised there they could be raised there yeah but they also have family members and their cultural Roots exactly and they also in their mind consider Africa or whatever part of the region also home because of family and culture and so there's a bridge that's connected and so the African like at diaspora is like this which is kind of cool to think of like the the spreading out of Africans all over the world as like a movement yeah and but everyone considers Africa a home yes and so it's like the the bridges that are connected everywhere else but it also has roots back in Africa and so that I think uh is also why uh like an African Network state is so primed yes because it is a network say it is networked all around the world anyways exactly it's like a human chain link below the internet right and I think um we even consider the African American diaspora as part of our African-American Community as part of that diaspora as well because remember we were talking about the whole accident in force right so the Forest Park could also be even slavery if you go back way or not because it's like they didn't necessarily leave the continent militarily right so it's like how do we because the African-American Community is the economic spending power is a 1.5 trillion dollar spending power and they're like 44 million people as a population Africa has 1 billion people and our GDP is two trillion dollars so you can imagine a world if you could combine the spending power of the African-American Community to Africa that's a boost as well and that's what we were able to do with the year of return that happened in 2019 it was a proof of concept right right and so for us it's to say like look a lot of them don't feel even though they have passports or they have their citizens of America they don't feel sometimes like citizens because they're treated sometimes in subjects right whereas in Africa we're citizens but we don't have have any other benefits of being citizens and so for us it's how do we create a bridge that allows us to again aggregate our leverage at scale what do you have that's useful and what do we have that's useful and can we bring it to the same table and then use that to navigate the world through it right because right now we're just all divided and in silos and I think through anthropolitan it's like it's a bridge that's supposed to connect just a dashboard together as well so right and uh so the the yeah the vision the the idea that I have in my in my head is like first there's like there's like the main Hub of the actual Network stage in Africa yeah and we're getting rid of the 1880s uh conference yeah Berlin Conference Europeans Drawing the Line and we're making a new network State yeah that is resonant with actual African culture and the irrelevant people exactly yes but then also you have the African diaspora all over the world with the with the uh would you call them the the towns The Sovereign towns Sovereign towns African towns yeah and so and so those the idea isn't for like uh Africans to finally have a place that they can truly call culturally home yeah they also is to put call the other parts of the world home as well for their satellites of this finally this part of Africa that is now resonant with actual Africans and it's all over the world which actually makes it like the when we were talking about building a country in the year of 2023 yeah that is way more powerful than just a single country exactly it's a it's actually a global movement which uh again naive Westerner here but a white a white naive white Westerner here but just like I would imagine that yeah after the African Community has never been able to actually truly have its own home but that's because it's everywhere it's the whole world exactly and no other no other culture has that exactly so I'll tell you like a quick story so again that helped inform my mindset on this I moved to the US when I was 15 with my family from Lagos Nigeria and I I moved to California right I went to school like private white high school where I was like the only black kid I remember coming from Nigeria um you have a situation where I had no concept of race like we're all black like I don't I didn't even know that race existed and um but in Nigeria when we did our studies if you didn't get a good grade you would get spanked or you get flux like literally if you didn't get a you could really get at school so I come to America I'm in Dublin California and I take my first U.S history exam and I score like a 98 right and I'm like and then the teacher is like yeah right but then the next person is maybe like in their 70s or something and I'm over there like culturally like like are they about to get beat are they about to like what's the issue and no one's getting flocked no one's getting beat I mean they're cool but so there was you could get beat but you would also have shame for the Grady just got right and there was no shame right and I'm like over there puzzled like so first of all they're not getting flogged for failing or getting not getting a and then there's no shame attached to not getting the grade what's the reason for that and so later on in life as I'm navigating a lot because I'm I usually find myself as the only black person in a lot of white spaces I was like yo when you've already won at life what is it great because they were moving from abundance they have audacity they're the people who are like Hey we're gonna put a man in the moon in 10 years and they go do it all right for us as Africans like we're still in a survival state so we're not moving from abundance which is why what you get flocked for not getting their grade because they think that that encapsulates failure in your life when that's not true so for me it was like that level of audacity bro that I saw when I was in that school I want to inject that into every African person in the diaspora and across the board because for us it's like how do we ensure our freedom at scale so it's like you because we also want to travel and that's the point I was trying to get to that story it's we want to see the world too we want to go around we want to visit different cultures but for by virtue of where we've been born a lot of us don't ever get a chance to do that and that you can't put a price on the real exposure plays in your mind you you had a lot of folks who went down to Silk Road and brought back ideas back to their hometowns we're not even able to get to travel to be able to be in maybe you know zuzaru where you're being impacted by different ideas where you can take it back to your home country and be like huh this is how they're doing it over here this is my doing it over here so we are in these silos right and so for us it's how to by having a global movement that's not just relegated to your four corner borders do you still create an environment in which you can go out learn new information bring it back but you're also able to experience the world in a holistic manner right so like for today you can wake up today and say Hey I want to be in Brazil tomorrow and you're there tomorrow I want to say I want to be in Brazil tomorrow I'm like I gotta wait six months yeah right or I the Visa can get denied regardless or the opportunity doesn't pass me it doesn't even ever come back again so for us it's we don't believe that those rules apply to a 21st century world or even in 2023 how do we then rewrite those rules that allow us to stop navigating the world from a place of being Outsiders right so yeah so the uh the actual specific afro aphropolitan effort uh still in phase one phase one maybe stabbling with with phase two yes yes we're already building out the products sure uh can you just go into the actual specifics of like you're here in suzalu and fighting the fight here uh who else is doing what elsewhere yeah so we we are I think where we spent six consonants right now with the first 500 citizens you have citizens um who are in like entertainment citizens who are in Tech Founders who are in Tech so I can just give you a name drop a couple of examples one of the biggest um festivals that bring it after that Sports together in Ghana it's called afrofuture formerly known as apachella they're based in Ghana but they're the founders are citizens of anthropolitan right um some of the biggest YC backs tech companies for politics citizens or after parts and investors so you have companies like a pay stack that got acquired by stripe for about 200 million you have um companies like a flush away just the top African companies and even VCS are within the network right so I think the idea is just to say look we have literally brought together some of the best of our best in different verticals and our goal is then to Showcase that to the world because it's not just even about the African dance bar you have folks who are curious about Africa but they don't know where to start right like you might have mentioned cynical you might not have had a cultural guide or you don't even know the best places to go to through afropolitan if you're part of the community right are we then able to curate that experience for you whether it's you're looking to invest you're looking to know what the best Founders are or the best ideas are we represent that because of the folks and type of folks we have within our Network we can actually take you to the source to the real sauce not the stuff where you're like yeah this is not that good but like this is dope and because we've spent our time I'm really attracting the best the best that's what we have to offer across the board so actually there's a at least a handful of bankless listeners that have been inspired by this conversation myself included yeah how can they help what kind of talent are you looking for who are you looking for that can that can just help this movement honestly we need a lot of technical Talent as well right we want to be able to compete from a technical perspective because I do believe highly obedient between Shrine our freedom and code right and I think crypto allows us to do that or just blockchain in general we also want allies and these allies can cut across because it's all again about access we got invited to zoology just by photograph just reaching out and say Hey I want to invite you guys to this thing that we're doing with your proper City experiment just something that little right and it's it's more about you if you have privilege and you have a key can you borrow that key to someone else right and that's really what access is and so sometimes people are like hey how can I help I think like they have to go build a rocket ship for us no it's just thinking through access how are you able to say hey I have access to this thing and I'm able to share this with you guys can you guys come use this right so we've gone offered islands and we're trying to offered it to tell you it's amazing but we're going to offered like so many different great opportunities even like the whole New York Stock Exchange thing right it was a hedge fund that was like hey we have access to being able to close um do the closing bell at a New York Stock Exchange but we want to offer you the opportunity and then the New York City embraced us as well so again it's thinking through access and what access looks like for us but we are really just looking to attract the best of the best across the world right and this cuts across race cuts across religion we could care less about what which where you are where you've been it's really about what you hope to become right and I think that that ideology of abundance is so powerful for us because it includes Redemption it includes again audacity right it includes an ability to win and help win right and then we want to be able to play long-term games with long-term people right so yeah that's that that's it beautiful and if people just want to learn and more because they're compelled by the and they want more education or maybe they're still skeptical and they still need to be convinced were there any more resources if you if you go to afropolitan.io afropolitan spell a-f-r-o-p-o-l-i-t-a-n dot IO you will be a link in the show notes yes thank you thank you thank you Dave I know I watch I want you a lot of Bankers no but thank you so much for having me man of course of course of course that's right thank you um and there's a a lot of crypto that I think everyone knows that crypto has done a deal with the devil and we have things like Pepe coin and all of these short-term like short-term or stuff that Gamble and then there's this story like this which is the complete opposite yeah uh and so it's a great articulation for why this crypto industry is is here to actually change the map of the world in ways that it ought to be have drawn in the first place so thank you for bearing the the responsibility of this crazy movement and we need people like you to to actually apply crypto principles for for better yes uh without that then I would have much less of a passion for this industry so thank you for providing that to me you know um I had a friend who once said crypto has always been about abundance right but for some reason obviously it's the short term is that that tend to navigate the headlines a lot more but I truly do believe that it is a way I think I fill up punk6529 and where he makes this argument about the freedom of the transact is a it's a human right right and I think with crypto if folks knew how much of the rest of the world where like systematically cut out from the Global Financial systems it's why crypto is a need in Africa it's not just a nice to have right and so I would encourage folks if you want to come visit Africa to see for yourself we can help arrange that but I do believe that like why crypto exists is to help bring the rest of the world into this abundance right there's a lot of the world that's still in the darkness and I think if folks it might sound altruistic but really you could also benefit from this too because the more people who live in abundance the more they have money to spend and the more maybe they earn an entire economy thrives right right and I think I want more stories like this to be told because I think during that whole period when we announced our application process that was like the week FCX just collapsed right and you have a whole lot of skepticism of like okay nfcs dials crypto I don't even want to hear it but we received about 3 000 plus applications and I think it was because people were tied to the mission and not just the the technology right and so that allowed us to still be able to kick on and then attract the people that we want into the community so I'm here at long term for crypto man I'm here for the principles of crypto transparency accountability immutability and just also a no single point of failure I think we're tired of that like we're tired of living in that world that's right thank you so much thank you cheers foreign [Music]
