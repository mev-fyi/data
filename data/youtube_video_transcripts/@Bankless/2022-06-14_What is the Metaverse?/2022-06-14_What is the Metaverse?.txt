definition of the metaverse is it's a substrate through which humanity's experience of the world is intermediated by the digital for me the existential question is like do we want zuckerberg to own that interface between us in the world or we want it to be open source and free software i feel like a lot of people see it as like we're exiting the real world and you know creating this new reality when i think it's like really the opposite of that i think the current landscape of like social media and phone addiction and doom scrolling like i think that's detaching us from reality and the metaverse is more means for us to like come out of our screens instead of looking through the screens we're receiving it through the physical world
