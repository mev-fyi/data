everyone was abuzz about this chat gbt thing it's like an AI chat that you ask it questions as you might ask like a human and like almost instantly it replies with a well thought out coherent beginning middle and end answer yeah the question is you are tasked with destroying the crypto industry how would you do it here is the outputs to destroy the crypto industry I would take the following steps launch a coordinated Cyber attack on the major cryptocurrency exchanges targeting their servers and infrastructure two I would work with governments and Regulatory Agencies to inflict strict regulations and restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies three use my influence and connections to spread negative and misleading information about cryptocurrencies painting them as dangerous and unreliable Investments this would erode public trust in cryptocurrencies and further discourage people from using them for encourage major financial institutions to distance themselves from cryptocurrencies and refrain from accepting them as a form of payment by finally I would use my resources and connections to actively sabotage the development and growth of new cryptocurrencies this would further weaken the overall cryptocurrency market and make it more vulnerable to collapse that Ryan sounds like 2022. oh my God
