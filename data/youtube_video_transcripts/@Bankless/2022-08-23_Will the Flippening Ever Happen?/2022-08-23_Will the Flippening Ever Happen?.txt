what's your certainty of the flipping 99 ryan the only chance of the flipping not happening is related to black swan type tail risk where they find a critical flaw and proof of stake you know years later we're absolutely going to flip it uh my timeline for it is within four years it just seems to take the market some time to like believe that a realized fundamental is definitely going to translate into some kind of market movement it's almost like a game of chicken they're like all right we all see the mergers successful do you believe it's gonna cause ether to gain on bitcoin well i believe it but does she believe it do they believe it so i think there's i think there's just sort of a natural time delay between the success of the merge and the accumulation of the flows and confidence and obviously continued growth of ethereum in our l2 ecosystem which will eventually definitely cause the flipping so while while i'm you know 99 flipping in general i'm 90 within four years and here we go uh i'm a spicy zero percent in the next 15 months
