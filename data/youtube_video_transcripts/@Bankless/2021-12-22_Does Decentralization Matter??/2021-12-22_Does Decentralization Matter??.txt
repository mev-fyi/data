i saw a tweet this morning here that said something like extreme decentralization is just a solution looking for a problem what if users don't care about decentralization cyrus i think that's just empirically false just looking at the bitcoin market cap you know it's just kind of dominating the space and dominating the narrative i think maybe what the tweet is getting wrong is that kind of the more transactional crypto community doesn't necessarily care about decentralization especially when they're already using somewhat pseudo-centralized tokens and coins like usdc and tether but that's not the whole story right there's like this huge swath of wealth coming in from all over the world that are just looking for a place to park their capital talk at length about kind of the the reach for yield and trying to store your capital in a world that's slowly being overrun by inflation retail users who just want to trade on indexes and whatnot they don't care as much so what right there's like clearly this huge contingency of investors worldwide that definitely definitely do care and that's kind of why the market cap rankings have shaken out the way that they are right now
