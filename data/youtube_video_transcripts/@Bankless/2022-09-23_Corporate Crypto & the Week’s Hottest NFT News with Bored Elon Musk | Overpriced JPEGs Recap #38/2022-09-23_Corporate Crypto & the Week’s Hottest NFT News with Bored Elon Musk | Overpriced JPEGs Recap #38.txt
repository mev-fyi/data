what's up [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs it is weekly recap time where we will be talking about everything that's happening in the world of nfts and maybe a little market talk that we think is relevant here on the show and joining me today is the one and only board Elon y'all I'm sure probably know him from Twitter awesome started off really as a parody account of Elon Musk and has evolved into a a whole kind of entity and brand in and of itself which we'll talk a little bit about I'm sure but uh board thank you so much for joining me yeah thank you Carly for having me I went through my own merge uh recently so uh now a new version of Elon yeah okay great um well speaking of the merge I think we'll probably end up starting there and just talk a little bit about what prices have done you know since the merge what we think that means some macro trends that you and I are both tracking right now in the space uh you know I want to talk about the new see cool cat CEO the Haas Brothers drop token proof news like lots lots to get into but before we do all that I do have two things for the audience first if you are listening to

we were hovering around what thirty five hundred four thousand dollars uh for for each ethereum um personally I was just really nervous that something would go horribly wrong and we'd be talking about three-digit eth and uh it all went smoothly so I'm I'm fairly happy there and I think ultimately the macro markets are not great right so no matter how well the merge was gonna go I just don't think it was going to make that much of a dent so yeah long story short I'm very happy that it didn't tank yeah yeah I think uh obviously macro markets feel like they're having the biggest impact in this right now I think it also we're getting news on a couple of friends that this is going to be kind of a longer colder winter than maybe some people expected or some people hoped on all fronts I think the fact that the merge didn't change you know didn't didn't pump the price of ethereum means that okay we're gonna we're gonna be in a crypto winter for a little while uh and and everything that's coming out of the fed and everything that's coming out of the the kind of macro environment suggests the same so you know inflation coming in higher et cetera et cetera so it's a winter folks I I honestly am trying to kind of relish it a little bit which is you know we were in a very hyper growth environment for a decade that isn't undone in seven months and I'd really like a a fresher slate and it feels like um a longer bear Market is actually probably a healthy thing you know so um I don't know that's that's why this is going to teach patients and I I always try to think about the fact if you were in the space for four years plus um remember what Bitcoin was remember what ethereum was and then you know five years from now ten years from now um be really happy that you were just patient and waited and uh you'll you'll be fine you just need a little bit of a longer time Horizon than the typical nft customer probably has yeah I think it was Randy Zuckerberg on this podcast it was like I always tell people if you're still standing in this industry in like three or four years like you will have won like you know what I mean and there's something very gratifying about that framework for it of like I just gotta like stay in the ring you know and um and for me personally like really feeling like I can you know develop the strongest podcast product possible because anybody who's listening here like you know if it's working during the bear Market you know when the next ball hits I feel like you know I'll be well positioned so I think that that kind of thinking applies well beyond just like being an nft project leader for example yeah absolutely and anybody who heard about the recent uh figma news about them being acquired for 20 billion dollars by Adobe I mean if you look at if you look up their uh their revenue for the first like four to five years it's just a flat line boom yeah so that's that's a good analogy I think for what you're working on and what everybody else in the space is working on and having that longer uh you know time frame that longer vision for sure um okay so macro trends that I'm seeing I tweeted this out this morning to mixed reactions I think but I feel like the space is corporatizing professionalizing let's say and I mean that in a really positive way I think there are growing pains associated with this but I look at Doodles board apes or you know Yuga um cool cats just announced their new CEO and to me this reads like just uh taking themselves really seriously and becoming really professional organizations again that comes with Growing Pains there are a lot of people who hate that I'm personally all in favor of it and then on the actual corporate side we see things like the Starbucks program which I talked about last week on the program um that I think are really genuine entrants into web 3 that aren't cash grabs they're not gimmicky they are I mean they're building a loyalty program around nfts and it's Starbucks I mean I think that's that's huge and we'll talk about a couple other loyalty programs that that are coming out so there's like a general wave towards corporatizing professionalizing as I'm putting it which I think triggers some people but that I'm I'm really positive on yeah and I mean I think that the space either has to go to hundreds of millions of users or it's going to zero inevitably and the only way to really do that is if it corporatizes and that means there are going to be some lame cash grabby uh or just kind of you know uncool versions of of what we've already seen but they're going to be brands that really figure it out right you think about like the adidases of the world and red bulls um they know they know how to preserve culture how to create culture and I think that they'll do a good job and I even think to the analogy of like when Disney bought Star Wars Star Wars obviously had a huge fan base before but the product was a little scrappy their movies weren't always very good I know I'm gonna get hate mail now but after Disney bought them like look what happened to Star Wars right so much cool  came out sorry if I swear uh oh I curse all the time sorry um but yeah I mean it was so much better so I like to think about that like if the big content creators and the brands that really know how to you know uh maximize and create culture come men and some of them are going to do a great job so I I have a similar take to you that overall it's a positive totally and I you know I find the push back to it a little bit strange because I it feels like it comes from a place of hey I've been in this cool nuclear club for nuclear wait right am I am I now in my career is correct nuclear nuclear is the problem yikes all right Thursday morning y'all are gonna make it um and you know like it it you can track this across any subculture that then becomes mainstream where you have the early adopters in the early subculture adopters who hate what the culture becomes but to your point it will die if it doesn't grow and and so I think it's like I get why people find it painful but like this is this is where it has to be to survive so uh I I'm very pleased yeah look I I saw Lady Gaga perform in 2013 on a very small stage in Lollapalooza and nobody knew who she was and she was really great and then she got big and uh she's still great that's fine animal screamed at her being like sellout you know yeah you've abandoned the original community at that Etc um you tweeted and this felt tied into this recently I'll pull this up here um basically I love this um if hype is the thing that brought you a customer it is the product they'll continue to expect for them to stay so if hype is your you know product that's what people are going to continue to want to say a little bit more about this do you think we're entering a phase where where hype is is not the product as much anymore is that part of this professionalizing in your view or where do you think we we are well I certainly don't want to name any names of recent projects that have come out but there's always this like perfect proportion of product versus hype and unfortunately when the when it's when the Spectrum swings too far to the hype side you're really bringing in a first cohort of customers that are really focused on that level of hype and they're always going to expect it throughout your you know your company's lifespan and that's just not sustainable right like hype moments are just these small moments in time that get you um a little bit of visibility and then you've got to deliver a product but the problem is is like if you set those expectations really high you're inevitably going to disappoint so I'm always I'm always in favor of under promise and over deliver and I think to your point earlier with the corporatization of NF of the nft space a lot of these projects and companies are probably going to get that same kind of you know help and advice which is hey let's make sure that we're ready to launch and put a and have a really good first impression because if we over hype ourselves um we're just gonna lose everybody you know after that few months and everyone every project because the space was over hyped every project has suffered some sort of blowback from the overhype phenomenon whether or not they had a direct hand in in causing the overhype I said endlessly on this podcast this space has traditionally penalized specificity and rewarded vagueness and hype is all about vague you don't really know what we're gonna do we have some like you know abstract vision of this amazing thing we're going to create that's going to create all this value and the truth is value is created over the long term slogging away day after day month after month four years and it's just not going to get you the kind of the kind of quick return stuff so I think that's also part of the growing pains here is like as Doodles or or Yuga or whatever like start to actualize Visions the vision gets more specific and it's sort of less just like vague hype and and that gets penalized by by a certain cohort so yeah and you certainly see the the bigger uh projects you know like the Hugo Labs of the world that are very careful now about what they say there's a lot of speculation that happens by the by the community of course but that's not something that they spur um they they hold back and then reveal stuff now when they're ready to reveal it and I think that's that's the right approach and ultimately you have to earn the right to Hype I think if you're hyping before you've earned that that loyalty it's kind of disrespectful to your community yeah I'm into it I agree um something that I have been getting a kick out of this week and I'm assuming you saw you may have seen is Mark Andreessen changed his bio on Twitter to a quote that Kanye West said on CNBC have you been tracking this a little bit yes but go on so let me read this tweet so he's since adjusted it a little bit I'm wondering if he was getting some pushback but originally he had set his Twitter bio to I'm not going to argue with people that are Broker Than me about money which is something that Kanye West said on CNBC this past week I believe or last week um when he was being interviewed about the Fallout of his deal with gap he had this you know deal to design clothing for Gap it was the Gap easy line it's Fallen apart for any number of reasons I'm sure and um so he was on CMT talking and he said I'm not going to argue with people that are Broker Than me about money Mark Andreessen made that a Twitter bio I think that's hilarious frankly um and as part of Kanye's appearance on CNBC his his broader Point seemed to you know he took this very like I alone can save Gap mentality which is very Kanye hubris whatever but I was thinking about it and I was like you know he's probably not entirely wrong like in terms of somebody who can bring cool factor and culture and can sell out a product line like Kanye is among the best of the best at that and GAP is really like an old school retailer that doesn't have a lot of cachet at least in my world anymore and I think that's being borne out in their numbers and they're a struggling retailer along with a number of struggling retailers from a similar era I would argue I've written about Bed Bath and Beyond in the past Old Navy which is the gap brand is struggling like all of these products are struggling and it feels like it's part of this broader Trend towards people and creators over corporations um and so the all-in podcast this past week I don't know how many folks who listen to my show also listen to All In I wouldn't be surprised if there's some overlap there uh Jason free uh Jason freeberg yes uh David Friedberg David Friedberg oh my God Jason calkinis David Friedberg you've merged them all into one God Thursday mornings really are suddenly rough for me I I'm not I'm not on my game today anyways David Friedberg um really talked about this where he's like I think the m a deal of the of the year was um pen gaming buying Barstool Sports because he's like everything is about content now the biggest brands are being launched not by corporations by individuals Mr BEAST's chocolate brand that he launched went to number one Kim Kardashian obviously doing her private Equity deal you know any brand she tweets about you know is is you know catapulted into the stratosphere so um I just think it's an interesting Trend and it bodes well for like nfts and and the blockchain economy which is so much there's so much talk around Creator empowerment and um kind of servicing creators so I want to get your thoughts on on that trend yeah well first of all I think ultimately here Kanye is right uh with the typical hubris as you said but you have to ask why did he take the deal in the first place it's almost like you know this is a bad breakup and now he's kind of like crapping all over his ex uh which you know is very appropriate given what he just went through but if he understands culture if he is a force of attention like why why did he take the Gap deal right it almost makes him look like the dummy um and he should have known better so yeah I I think probably you know he didn't really um agree with the gap on a lot of their approach But ultimately kind of his bad for for jumping in but I think the macro takeaway for me is that um old retailers are dying because retail and the attention on physical Goods is also a decline right like that is what the nft represents it is a digital object and we have a lot of value in these things that are not sold in balls Across America and so if you're Kanye you should probably be expanding uh into digital retail and digital objects and not getting into um you know deals with these 50 year old companies that are super lame in my opinion and what he he had he said he was never gonna don't ask me about nfts or something he didn't say he was never going to get into nfts but Kanye did come out and kind of publicly say with that little sign or something like stop asking about nfts I'm not doing them or something a lot I mean listen every every song he he sells that is downloaded uh is an nft right you can call it whatever you want like he's already in the business of selling digital Goods it's just they're they're called different they're not back on the blockchain yeah yeah it's also this greater segmentation of audience I think like you know we have so much more choice now and and so much of talks at least in the Creator economy side of the blockchain space is about like monetizing your super fans more and then kind of Highly monetizing the groups of people that really love you and and you know that ties into this like we just aren't reliant on like five Brands anymore we have you know we're getting Instagram spammed all the time for like the much cooler Linens store than Bed Bath and Beyond you know and and what I think is cool as a linen store is going to be different than what my fiance thinks and like you know it's the segmentation of audiences into like smaller and smaller niches that I think nfts can really help to to better monetize for for businesses as we as the audience sides maybe get smaller um for Brands because we can just you know go more into what we each want you know I can tell what life stage you're in just based on the ads you're getting served on Instagram recently moving settling down yeah yeah though I don't think I've gotten a lot of Linens ads to be fair but I was thinking about Bed Bath and Beyond um I get just like constant uh sports bras that fix my posture and I'm like yikes wow seriously specific that is what I am fed daily on Instagram and it works I've bought two of them so um okay a couple other just outside of the nft space but I think have some relevance here that I wanted to flag um tencent which is one of just the biggest I I don't know Chinese Venture funds funds I mean I I as I've been kind of studying the gaming industry and and studying Spotify and like a bunch of businesses that I just find fascinating 10 cent shows up again and again again as like an investor in in all of these companies I think they they own effectively uh epic at this point I think they have a 93 stake in epic games which did um you know fortnite obviously and they have a 40 stake in Riot games which was League of Legends and um and just everything else they are potentially spinning off some of their like subsidiaries um saying that they want to kind of invest further into gaming and go go further into their core um just think that's interesting given sort of the gaming nft conversation like they're just a player to kind of watch they'd actually launched an nft Marketplace and shut it down after about a year partly because of you know declining sales and the Bear market and also because of Chinese regulation and just I think issues um with the Chinese government um you're very in the gaming world just any broad thoughts on this it's just something that caught my attention yeah well I mean first of all tencent is the biggest gaming publisher in the world now if you if you kind of combine all of their stakes and these massive games uh Riot and epic of course being very large ones um what's really interesting is that you know in China there's a lot of Regulation against gaming a lot of gaming companies can't even publish their um kids are restricted in terms of how long they're allowed to play so um you know it's it's very much kind of banking on the fact that the West quote unquote uh it's going to continue to be interested in video games so um them kind of shutting or divesting from these um older Industries and putting more money into gaming is bullish for the gaming industry um you know it's a little bit of of an odd contradiction uh you know based on sort of just like the the the rules they have at home but what I will say and this kind of ties back to the the retail discussion we're having if you're 10 cent and you need to grow your your Investments and you see that there are supplying chain issues people care less about physical stuff um yeah you probably should take your money out of businesses that focus on that and put more of it into digital Goods digital world scale yeah yeah very interesting very true um well speaking of gaming and digital Goods give us the update you launched board boxes got like was it a year ago at this point how when did you learn it was four months ago but in the world of nfts that is a year wow and but you and I talked about it I guess because you would you and I actually kind of talked off the Record about it before it launched when did we talk yeah yeah we we had concepted it about a year ago and we launched the first box back in May so you're you're not wrong okay it's been a year in the making for sure yeah and I appreciate your perspective back then but yeah we launched our first box in May um have a really core community of of Gamers and really people who just want to own their video game items like that's that's always been the key we never really wanted to get the d-gens and the Traders we basically just wanted people who love video games and love to to own that stuff so we're launching our second box uh very very soon and we announced that yesterday actually very cool so tell folks what it just just give people a high level overview of board boxes for folks who maybe don't know yeah so essentially it's both a package of goods and those goods are game items for various blockchain games and then it's also a game pass so basically when people buy a board box they're getting a variety of game items from from games that we've kind of hand Chosen and ones that we really feel have a lot of potential for being super fun and having a great community and then after the box has been opened and you've claimed all your stuff you still keep the board box nft and then basically we continue to uh throw people uh different game items give them access to our private Community have tournaments lots of fun stuff like that so if you were to kind of combine this idea of like a physical Loot Crate and then also um an Xbox game pass that's very much what board box is so cool and sorry if I just miss this or if I'm being dense but is it um it's all like blockchain game assets because there has to be that ownable component to it that is enabled through blockchain correct yeah it's it's exactly and it's across any network so whether it's Solana ethereum polygon Etc we're totally agnostic but yes it does need to be an Unchained game that's our Focus today in the future who knows and what what games are you playing these days like what are you super into on the blockchain gaming world so I've been loving this game called EV dot IO it's a very simple uh first person shooter that you actually play in your browser you don't have to you know download a launcher have a console um it's a really good example of what blockchain games should look like which is basically you jump in have a lot of fun you don't have like nft stuff rammed down your throat and then once you're hooked on it it lets you buy stuff in the game and own it and I think that is what is going to onboard Gamers uh in the future it's a very sort of um subtle you know kind of drawing you into the nft space but really putting focus on the game and the gameplay first uh what is your perspective these days on the current state of Gamers feelings around nfts is it as negative as it's ever been is it starting to move a little bit where where are we well we certainly have got the environmental impact issue out of the way with the merge right so great great news there um I think that right now there's just not enough games on the market from a blockchain's perspective to win over Gamers yeah and it's very fun yeah they're fun and I mean it's very similar to every console launch like when you look at when the PS5 or the Xbox went live there were like two or three games that were available it just took time to build the library so that's where we're at the other piece of it is that the old video game media like kataku and IGN they keep pushing The Narrative of nfts bad it's going to ruin your games and so there needs to be more video game media and content creators that actually educate players and help them understand why it's valuable for them um and so you know we're certainly trying to play that role and we're seeing a lot more content creators become friendly to to nfts and and it's just going to take time to win over people do you think it almost feels like a leading question because it feels like an obvious yes but this is this is a question to get you to speak broadly on this topic do you think we'll see more businesses or even like you know web 2 or traditional companies um invoke like a digital loot Box model into their businesses in the future outside of games you mean yeah outside of Gaming oh that's interesting um yeah that that makes a lot of sense I mean it certainly preys on the psyche of uh of humans right like we all we all love gambling and we love to sort of you know even if you look at kids toys like all these like oh my God surprise and all these other toys that are meant for kids I mean it definitely is something you've seen um and even like all the subscription boxes that people are now getting in the mail whether it's for makeup or books or candles or anything else like we love the element of surprise so I think there needs to be this delicate balance of it not feeling um like it's taking advantage of of the of the customer and instead is really focusing on the surprise and I will say like on the board box side um when everyone buys boxes they all get the same stuff we don't do loot boxes we don't do the gambling piece everybody gets the exact same thing um because we didn't want to lean too hard into sort of like that that Randomness that really gets people upset when they don't pick something that ends up being you know valuable yeah I mean a quick plug you mentioned OMG surprise boxes and the kids toys I didn't interview with Will weinrob who's building kryptoys which is fully premised off of like lol surprise dolls and I think it's just an absolutely you know brilliant business and and um I'm rooting for them I mean somebody will succeed in that space creating kind of digital collectible toys that have that surprise open box concept uh right now it feels like cryptoys is well in the lead but you know we'll see we'll sort of things shake out but they're they're a really impressive company so go listen to that interview if you have not heard it um will wine Rob it's it's great he's he's awesome um you know yeah I'm thinking about I'm thinking this through like in real time and I feel like part of the appeal of like you see it you mentioned like with makeup or with like you know bark boxes for for dog items but there is a physicality there that feels really important with those things like makeup obviously and it's very about it's a way to sample a number for makeup products and see what you like with with dog products same thing it's treats it's chew toys they can they can kind of bite into so there's definitely a model and I mean you see like pranksy does his um the pranksy boxes which are different nfts that you get in a box which is cool and that that's like on the art side of things really and focused on kind of art and collectibles and getting a surprise box full of Art and collectibles um but I I I'm sure there are other interesting ways to utilize this in a traditional business I just think about it imagine you're going to a concert right and Ticketmaster says okay we're not going to sell you specific seats you just buy a ticket for a flat fee and then we'll tell you where you end up sitting it could be the front row but it could be the back row oh that's interesting or a plane ticket same thing yeah but that's that's that's like one item that's not like a box of like a whole bunch of things you know what I mean that's like just like a way to gamify and create gambling pretty much mundane tasks yeah oh no but yeah I think this idea of serendipity and surprise is really important because you know people are buying stuff online now they're not browsing through stores as much so giving giving everybody a little bit of like oh I didn't expect to buy this today but I really like it is is is something that is a powerful mechanism for yeah for people who are selling physical products we all are just trying to get more dopamine hits in life you know we just I've said this on the Pod as well but it's it seems like an inevitable conclusion that we have you know nfts become just a way to like bet on TV or you know you have your game of throne characters and as your nfts and if one of them gets killed in the show it disappears from your wallet because you know shows have just gotten increasingly like violent or sexual or any of these things to try and up the Annie in in sort of our experience of watching them and nfts have the potential I feel like to just further up the ante you know look at like how sports betting has progressed into just like you know an insane industry in and of itself and you know on and on so okay moving on to some other nft news there's some yoga Labs rumors this does seem for as much as they have professionalized leaks seem to be the one thing they can't get a freaking cap on a lid on and I don't I don't understand now uh I'll say there there are rumors and there are some leaks claiming that they are planning on doing like a 50 million dollar raise by selling Mecca ape nfts I guess sometime later this year they're going to launch a new line of nfts called Mecca Apes with the goal of raising another 50 million dollars and some metaverse land pieces um garga came out and said this is fake news like none of this is true um but I think they've previously denied like there was a leaked deck that came out if folks will probably remember and again Yuga kind of denied that it was real and then later said okay well it is but it was out of date and so there's like some mixed credibility they have in denying these leak rumors um I'm not saying that they are gonna launch Rebecca Apes collection I have no idea it seems like maybe that's fake news but they seem to have gaps they're they're leaky they've got leakage what do you think about this well I mean I for one would love to have a Becca ape so I hope it is true um uh yeah I mean with with like a big deck that has a lot of information in it it's easy to say that that's not real or it's fake because you can just point to like two things that are wrong in it so therefore the whole thing is is really correct um if it's one specific thing and they say that that's fake that feels like it's actually fake um again to my dismay because I want Mega Apes so um I feel like I feel like the the the um you know they've gotten big enough so the leaks are going to continue to happen unfortunately you see this with apple and video game companies inevitably like you know be going back to the dopamine piece like employees at these companies want the dopamine of leaking really hot information because they want people to to give them the acknowledgment that they got that information first um but they also have to be extremely careful they raised you know 450 million dollars from a16z um you you are actually harming your potential future Revenue by releasing information earlier than you than you're supposed to so to me if I'm a betting I I say that this is overall probably not accurate yeah I'm not as sympathetic like they're not as big as Apple at all like yeah they've got their four billion dollar evaluation but I don't know how many employees they have like 200 like they're they aren't like get this under freaking control like you you don't you're not like a sprawling International 10 000 person org at this point anyway I know I'm sure it's something that they're concerned about I just it is confusing to me how this keeps happening and specifically with Hugo like I don't think I maybe I'm misremembering but like I I don't feel like we've gotten big Doodles leaks or like these other projects don't seem to be plagued with this I guess Noah Davies there were some punks well that was also eucalabs though right when before Noah Davies took over as a Punk's uh you know brand lead or whatever there was punks pumped and so clearly people knew um you're right though yeah I mean I think I think the intensity is higher for them just because of the value of the board ecosystem um maybe that's part of it but arguably so or do it you know Doodles are very valuable and and azuki's and so many others so um yeah I mean if I was a betting man I'd say they they are basically growing really fast they've raised a lot of money very quickly they're relying on contractors because they can't hire people fast enough and uh and that's what leads to it um it's not I'm not saying it's acceptable I mean they should definitely not not let this happen um given all the scrutiny on them right now but it does continue unfortunately to pop up and you know this is I think probably part of these growing pains that when you're moving from like a the totally Wild West to a four billion dollar like corporate entity you know that's not a perfectly linear smooth transition right where people have buddies in the space they're used to just like on Discord telling their buddies about this and that or telling their friends because it it's still probably in many ways feels like a little bit you know like the wild west and we're all friends and we live in this weird little insular nuclear which still doesn't feel like nuclear it doesn't feel like the right word why am I losing my mind like nuclear family because in movies and TV people keep saying nuclear yeah but but is nuclear even the right words like my nuclear family um in the in like the 70s yes uh I don't know if people use that I was raised by people who lived in the 70s so it'd be okay tabernacular you know like I gotta like they like picked up on it um anyway uh let's speaking of professionalizing new cool cat CEO was announced Stephen tagless I think I'm pronouncing his name correctly um he from Warner Brothers he was an advisor to recur which I think is having some difficulty so that's not necessarily like a huge bragging right but um but I don't know and whatever so um is the new CEO of Cool Cats news the the floor pumped like 10 on this news what do you think um I think that 10 is not going to last very long uh you know I think It ultimately comes down to results and I think in the especially in the web 3 space like you saying you worked for Google or Warner Brothers or whatever is not as valuable like this is a very different space it does not operate the same way in Old stodgy uh production company or music company or Entertainment Company works so um you know I I think he'll do a great job but the proof will be in the pudding and ultimately um as somebody who invests in in nft's longer term um I don't care about the short term right I want to see what this person is going to do over the next few years um My Hope though is that the access to all the the connections in the Warner Brothers family all the celebrities musicians Etc is going to turn into um cool opportunities for for Cool Cats and if you consider them to be something like uh a Hello Kitty like Hello Kitty started off as just like simple IP now it's on every type of merchandise in in the store right so you could see cool cats going that way and you do need somebody who has the vision and like the depth of knowledge in so many Industries to make sure that IP can be stretched out further so I I give them the benefit of the doubt but right now I mean I don't think that the pump is Justified because no work has been done yeah I think it's a positive signal that he is fundamentally an IP man you know like if you look at who these different companies hire Doodles obviously with their higher of Julian like Julian came from billboard he came from the music world you get a pretty clear indication that the Doodles is leaning heavily into music and then of course they announce uh their Pharrell partnership like that's a good signal of where they really want to double down and and be relevant and prominent and it feels like the the trouble with Cool Cats has been they got away from the core IP and like the CORE family friendly art and that at their value prop and they move too quickly into gaming and cooltopia and sort of these other things that were distractions from just these adorable iconic potentially iconic characters and so so bringing somebody in who has experience with like long-term franchise management which he you know apparently does and has has really worked with IP my guess is it's pumping partly on the feeling that this is a return to what cool cats has historically done best and that he can kind of Usher them into this next phase which is really looks like a return to what made them great in the beginning my guess is that's what that's like the the where the optimism is coming from and I think I share it I would say with a lowercase s yeah for optimism hot take question do you think they seated sort of like that family friendly vibe to doodles yeah a little bit I mean I you know I think there is a lot of room in this space so I think it was I think Doodles benefited frankly from some of the kind of downfall of cool cats but they certainly didn't didn't cause it right it was like an unforced error like I think Cool Cats kind of made their own grave and I don't mean that in like a permanent sense I've always been I you know if pudgy Penguins can make a comeback by God so can cool cat so like you know I I don't think I use the term grave Loosely but like you know cool cats made their own kind of grave and then Doodles was there I I imagined to kind of pick up some of those pieces and definitely but I think family friendly is a really powerful way to go and that was something else that really clicked for me and talking to will wine Rob and the cryptoys team and thinking about what they're doing which is like that's a powerful route when you think about the the biggest IP that has come out I mean I'm looking at Steven teglitz's you know history and it's Mickey and Minnie Mouse Frozen Cars Toy Story Hello Kitty Nickelodeon Harry Potter like what do these things have in common they're they're children's stories that adults also like like they're targeting families so I think the the amount of space out there for family-friendly content is just about Limitless so um so I do think they see it in some space to Doodles but yeah and I I agree I think that ultimately we're in a place right now where kids cannot directly engage with crypto or probably shouldn't be right legally speaking and so it's the parents of those kids or it's people who just want to invest in a company that's going to make products that are not crypto based for kids and that's right now A tenuous business to be in I think that down the road we can get to that place but if you're family friendly with the intention of actually reaching kids I think we're way too early to be banking on that type of business so will wine Rob who I've now mentioned for the third time in this conversation drink every time you say will wine wrap yeah exactly exactly take a shot uh you you could tell the interview had an impact on me um they're working with flow to develop like you know safety parameters around wallets for kids like the way that you would have like safety controls as a parent on Disney Plus or you know whatever insert here on on TV or on the Internet um so developing ways for kids to interact with these like digital toys but in a way that's very monitored by a parent and that isn't just like free unfettered access to like metamask or something that obviously should be behind beyond their age so and that just struck me when he said that it's like one of the things that comes out of having a really clear sense of your target audience and a really clear sense of your goal where and that's I think where cool cats got a little lost was they they kind of didn't have a clear sense of who they were targeting or or why or For What and um so you don't end up having these yeah I mean building these products that are like really once you hear it you're like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah I definitely think focus is very important in the early days and you know if they do want to go uh after you know enabling kids to to sort of engage with with the brand in some way they will have to think about parental controls and all these things that will make parents feel you know assured right that it's safe and you know based on my time in the video games industry I can tell you there's a lot of sensitivity um to how kids can engage with digital uh digital objects and like how much money they can spend in games you see that with Minecraft and you know fortnite like parents just like losing their minds over their kids spending thousands of dollars and so much time in these spaces so now imagine like you know blockchain enabled versions of these things and the outcry that might come so yeah gotta you have to approach this very carefully and methodically and I think that anybody who is doing that with like you know protecting kids uh front of my a friend friend Center is really important or is really smart like you have to you have to take that approach I interviewed Klan who's the cool cat artist months ago and and he noted that you know the some of their original Community was really built because it was parents being like this was the first project I was able to kind of introduce to my kids too where I would show them the cat or or the kid would pick out the cat that they should buy you know and it was just very friendly for kids to kind of look at um and there's a quote from Clan here and this announcement about Stephen teglist taking over a CEO Khan says Stephen believes in the vision for blue cat and the impact this character can make on the world with him at the helm Cool Cats is on its way to becoming a household name so again just I think reiterating like a return to fundamentally that character that art as like the the path forward metamask is the leading web 3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just

the day Scotch and Soda nfts are you familiar with Scotch and Soda as a brand board um honestly no yeah that doesn't surprise me entirely again like this is a brand I wasn't even actually overly familiar with it but there's a scotch and soda store sort of at the end of my block and it's Got Fabulous very cool clothing so I okay I was like is that a is that a clothing store is that what that is okay Cool website yeah they're a they're a Cool brand I have to say I have some pants from Scotch and Soda they're great so um they have they're a brand with some Swagger and so it's exciting to me to see them entering nfds the and again entering it in a way where this is fundamentally a loyalty program for them so they had launched something called uh club soda is that what it was uh club soda yeah they launched club soda which was like a um you know their like loyalty program only a few months ago I think it hasn't been around for that long and then they kind of quickly updated it to include this nft component they're calling it club soda 3.0 it will include exclusive access to merch and events they throw you know Partnerships and collaborations there's an element of being able to co-create with their Partners so um again really treating this like a full-on corporate loyalty plus program that's underpinned by nfts and and feels like they're coming out with utility first it's not just like Hey we're doing an nft drop and like whatever like they're really um just making it a part of a loyalty program that they were already on they were already planning on so I think that's exciting yeah I mean it feels very much like what the Starbucks uh you know nft uh loyalty program is um and and I think it's yet to be seen like does this need to be an nft because I think that the question is um if I have this loyalty you know membership can I sell it to somebody else um and if I can't then what is what is the sort of the blockchain enablement doing other than just making sure that like everyone can publicly see how many you know membership points I have to either Starbucks or to Scotch and Soda um so I I think it's really good for onboarding people and just raising awareness of nfts um I do I do want to sort of hold my breath and see kind of what the utility is um and personally I would love to be able to sell like loyalty points like think about racking up Hilton points or Marriott points and never wanting to use them and being able to sell them to other people I I would definitely would be down for that yeah it's it's a great point and I think it speaks to part of the utility I use that Loosely with nfts is the future promise that everyone will use them and therefore it can be used as a way to socially signal because we'll know where to go to look right and so we need Brands like these we need peop Brands coming in early to bootstrap that mainstream adoption and then the utility will be obvious for future Brands because they want to show off that Taylor Swift or Gigi Hadid or whatever right like shops at Scotch and Soda like you know that's probably a poor example but you get the point right if this for the socially signaling thing to be fulfilled which then becomes really beneficial for the brands themselves we need people actually using nfts on a regular basis and showing them off in wallets so so to me part of this is like some of the utility comes later I also think if they just be you know they become mainstream enough it is a more efficient way to manage a community then like an email list and then like you know what I mean and then you've got an email like thing that's hard to verify you scan when you go into the party like nfts are a better way to manage it once people have the tech and the infrastructure because it's just you know to to hold on FTS and everybody does it and it's like a normalized thing so some of the gains here come come just when mainstream adopts you know it's a chicken and egg problem well right now the floor price is 0.02 for a scotch and soda nft so uh good entry point if you are a fan of their brand I might I might hop in only because I do live near a club soda or like a scotch and soda store and I I have shopped there before and I don't know kind of interesting the other thing that is we we have to mention here is they launched on polygon but they launched through salesforces nft platform which again is something that I think is exciting to see Salesforce getting into this recognizing its value I mean they have a lot of materials on their website clearly trying to explain nfts to folks explain it from uh why your business should care about this perspective so the Salesforce is building out like an nft a launch pad so you can you know launch nfts on there sell nfts on there manage your nft program through this Salesforce platform I think it's a very smart move by Salesforce um it's still in some sort of beta so this is like one of their initial like pilot Partners is scotch and soda um I will say going through the Salesforce literature and I text I tweeted this this morning as well they are still referring to ethereum as a proof of work blockchain so if anybody has connections to mark benioff get that man on the phone get somebody from Salesforce on the phone tell them to update their website ethereum is no longer a proof of work chain and the worst part is they like call it a proof of work chain in the context of talking about like how bad proof of work trains are for the environment so they're like trying to draw this really clear distinction of like we're not we're using things like polygon or immutable X like we don't use those terrible proof of work blockchains like ethereum and it's like well you add a touch yeah I will say if you if your business model is being a concierge for big Brands who don't know how to navigate crypto uh you should definitely have the most up-to-date information Salesforce obviously um has lots of analysts and people who can make sure this happens so hopefully they prioritize uh that that point but yeah clearly you know they're trying to be sort of a nicer front end for Brands who don't want to like deal with open C and minting and contracts themselves and and they will definitely help onboard more Brands to do this and I think what's cool about it is ultimately if all these loyalty programs get created um there's going to be a lot of competition for how to reward customers and win over attention so I think ultimately it's going to be really good for for consumers win totally yeah yeah and Salesforce just has a such a trusted name is just it just it makes the water warm for brands that want to get in you don't get fired for hiring uh sales force exactly exactly exactly um well put um okay a couple other things we'll maybe speed run through a couple of these um the Haas Brothers multi-beast project launched and sold out so I think if it's only on secondary now did you track this project at all by any chance I'll say a couple things on it look this is this looks like one of those projects that someone should have told me about before and I totally missed it and made no money yeah yeah no worries I don't even know where the floor price is now I'll I'll give some context and I think I think the project is cool it's not I don't know what it'll do on secondary but um so the premise is well I'll say the Haas brothers are pretty renowned artists and they do interesting installations and you know they they're like true artists through and through and their premise for this was how do we represent digital identities like what's on the inside not just what's on the outside and so they designed this personality test that is wild and I guess I can talk about the personality test now now that other people have taken it and it's kind of public it's like also kind of sexual this personality test like it'll show you a bunch of images with like varying degrees of like pubic hair and then you have to like select you just like just like pick one you know so I will say I I took this test with the hospitals team and some like Agents from UTA I was like a trial run of these tests and it was a very strange step a little risque you wouldn't do it full of people yeah and they you know so um I've laughed about that publicly and um now I can talk a little bit more about it it was a funny thing but they were all super you know polite and lovely about it so anyhow so you take this personality test which they claim has some sort of bearing you know some sort of backing of like this will tell you something about yourself and then those inputs determine the look of the monster that comes out and you know we're all narcissists this plays right into you know our innate egotism and like it's just fun it's fun to be like what do I look like in a Haas Brothers conception of like my personality and um and then they they have really approached this project with um with like Partnerships in mind from a smart contract perspective that their back end is remastered I've had the remaster folks on the podcast before as part of a panel with like IP lawyers because remaster is really focused on how do we encode licensing rights digital rights at the Smart contract level you know into these nfts because there's a lot of ambiguity around it right now with a lot of these projects so the hospital is approaching this really with the goal of like getting some sort of corporate partner and their that that wants to license a number of these monsters and then if your monster gets chosen you can license it and that'll all get encoded and kind of properly tracked at the Smart contract level so that if you do resell it for example like that that history follows with it and those licensing deals are um you know very accessible and seen and whatever so I just think it's a thoughtful project by a uh you know well-respected artist Duo so yeah and I think the fact that they have a brand um it's more impactful right like if a new project comes out and says you know CCO and everybody can do whatever they want with their IP um but they haven't really built up that IP over many years it's not as impactful but um you know these guys clearly have some Equity that they're willing to share with the community so I do appreciate that approach and I do think it's going to become kind of the norm moving forward yep totally I did a Twitter space that you can probably go find uh if folks are curious with the Haas Brothers talking about the the project so folks want even more details go scroll through my my Twitter um okay other news token proof announced that they are supporting now the flow blockchain for their you know token gaining Services um no major commentary here on my part I don't know if you have anything I just think it's it's cool and exciting I think Flo has really been turning up the pressure lately turning up the heat you know they announced their partnership with Ticketmaster um you know on bullish on cryptoys which is on Flow and loves building on Flow they I've had friends texting me about their NFL all day program which I have friends who are like not even deep into nfts who are loving NFL all day so um just continue to be good news I feel like out of the float ecosystem and and they just continued to build it's impressive they've they've been around a while they have really strong relationships um you know they're not the darling of the nft ecosystem uh which is still uh you know eth but um I do think that their their relationships on the corporate side is really powerful and again I'm going to just now plug this idea uh for Ticketmaster to do loot box uh seating at concerts I think that's gonna be a lot flow if you're listening um Pitch this to your partner um yeah totally I mean you know we talk about friendly entrance for businesses and we start you know Salesforce being a friendly entrance for businesses I think flow is too like they look at okay they've got Partners in the NBA Top Shot did incredibly well they're partnered with the NFL their partner with Ticketmaster they're like family safe you know they have that feeling and of course they've optimized their chain specifically for onboarding new users so I've expressed plenty of hesitation on the show about you know kind of locking up your project on a chain that doesn't have the network effects of like an ethereum and the the concerns around bridging assets from chain to chain and and concerns around will we get to a multi-chain a safe multi-chain future um but credit where credit is due that within the ecosystem that they're building and you know it's they've done a lot of impressive things and I love token proof I love flow so I'm glad to see them coming together um yeah and I I have to assume that the uh the multi-chain future is inevitable so the same way you can exchange dollars for you know other types of currencies that's that's got to be the way that that crypto goes um otherwise there really is no future like everything that is Promised by crypto implies that yes you should be able to change your stuff fast cheap uh and easily and so it's not quite there yet but at 100 I feel like is going to be the the counter is like if ethereum gets to the point where it's hyper scaled faster than bridging between chains feels safe why not just build 90 of everything on ethereum with maybe a couple outlier cases meaning it could be on like layer twos or you know whatever right yeah and then the network effects have accrued there and that's where we land I I agree I think I'm probably not there I I literally vacillate on this question yeah if one chain is truly going out and one is going to be the the king then I think projects and companies are gonna just migrate their their items over to the to the other chain and your investment will likely be protected next as we go through our lightning round the NASDAQ is preparing to launch an Institutional crypto service specifically they want to custody your crypto um this is interesting I mean I think the the reality is anybody who's in the Trad five worlds and I would think this is especially true for like your Banks and your JP Morgan's or your Bank of Americas or whatever like don't want to lose customers who are increasingly putting money into things that they can't custody which is crypto so not surprising to me at all that anybody in the Trad five world is trying to increasingly like get a piece of this and actually hold in custody or crypto I'm sure Regulators also prefer it and are pushing hard for it because they feel like they probably have more control or visibility in into a Goldman Sachs then into Ledger you know I don't know what do you think about this yeah I mean it's a great sign for for crypto very bullish uh but it it really is a product that is catering to large institutional money right so like if you need to invest a billion dollars you're not setting up a coinbase uh account right and like yeah you could work with an ft with an FTX but then people might have questions you know I haven't heard about them until a few years ago they're based in the Bahamas but NASDAQ I know them I've been you know entrusting them with my money for a very very long time and they're gonna basically handle crypto for me and I don't have to think about it cool let's let's go with that so it's a very smart business decision uh it's another just asset for people to trade there's the demand is there and NASDAQ doesn't want to become irrelevant as you know older types of assets get less popular corporate crypto that's what we're dubbing it and we like it I mean that in a good way corporate gets a bad gets a bad rap which I feel like or maybe it's just me I think of corporate as as bad because I hate any like I hate being confined in structures and having bosses and all these things that I associate you're I mean you're a corporation right so it's okay yeah I mean I well I'm an LLC right legally if we're if we're getting really specific and legal but yes I'm a corporation I um sort of I but I you know I tell myself what to do and so I hate anything where I feel like I lose freedom but it's great for the space corporate crypto okay um okay Bears signed with IMG uh IMG has been appointed as the exclusive Global licensing representative to launch consumer products and experiences for the solana-based pfp project I really just wanted an excuse to Circle back with what's happening with okay Bears is this a project you tracked at all or uh have followed have also been on the sidelines honestly the thing is I got really uh early in to Yuga and so once that happened and I picked up some Apes I was like I'm never gonna win again like that that's the win so why am I I'm gonna try to trade yeah that's brilliant you realize like you probably have the best you know like that's like you don't win the lottery twice you know what I mean nft collecting yeah no and look I'm not I'm not like a super active Trader either for for similar reasons like I really want to study this space and like see where it's all sussing out and so much of what's happening in the bull market just was clearly unsustainable and and funny enough so okay Bears was a project I talked about on the show back in May I guess um it was like a month or so after it had launched and it was doing really well and I think I said at the time like somebody called okay Bears the next yoga Labs or not somebody I think it was like commonly people were being like this is the next yoga labs and I was like this is a top signal like this is a sell signal and I went back and looked Play Play that clip Dave I think we have that clip of me saying it's a sell signal and then it is getting called the next board ape Yacht Club this to me is a sell sign I have said it before I think it is a red Freaking Flag when somebody when people start saying this is an XB you know board API Club especially very early in a Project's founding it usually means that it's super super hyped and it's due for a bit of a downturn that's my personal opinion we'll see what happens we can look at the chart it's literally like it peaked on May 17th I said that on May 19th literally the peak in the chart is May 19th or May 17th it peaked and it's just been like downhill from there so it it you know it really was a sell signal when you're getting that much hype being compared to Yuga um with that being said I've always thought they had like a sweet branding to them which is half the battle in the beginning of being an nft project is having sort of an authentic Vibe I talked about that with d Gods with with youths I think like they have this like for whatever else their problems maybe they have this like authentic bro vibe that resonates for people and okay Bears has this kind of authentic like almost positive mental health Vibe I think the characters are cute so like I've always felt soft towards them from that perspective that their team is anonymous which I hate um I know you're an Anon so you know and I oh lots of feelings but yeah yeah I mean we can talk about it but um but it's like a cute little project so I I don't know where to where to land on this I mean like I'm you know sort of rooting for them because they're a solana-based project they they predated the Utes de-gods thing with having like this kind of good branding on Solana um I I don't think I don't expect anything crazy here they signed with IMG as a global licensing representative which is really interesting that suggests they're not shooting for like movies right they're not getting they didn't get like a UTA agent to go pitch them on like TV shows they're clearly going for like merch and they've got a global licensing representative for Consumer products so that is what they're they're going for that that is very smart honestly because in all of my sort of understanding of how the uh talent agent you know business works is they're taking a pretty big chunk of of your your Revenue once you've signed with them and you know if you have influence if you have reach you kind of have to ask like why why are you giving up your profits but in this particular deal with licensing it's basically like if you can get me licensing deals then yeah you can take a big percentage of that of that profit that's fine so I think that they approach this in a really smart way um and they have a brand that yeah is going to look really good on t-shirts and other stuff so um I I think it's it's bullish for them and it will be cool to see what products come of this that are just not at all related to crypto and are just leveraging the IP yeah a pair apparently they recently partnered collaborated okay Bears recently collaborated with NBA basketball supplier Wilson and Chicago Bill's point guard Lonzo ball on a one-of-one signed nft in his likeness so they're looking for these kinds of deals I mean again we'll have to see what comes out of it the the cynical take on this is like IMG is going to go to like the licensing trade show that I think happens in like February and they're gonna have 50 Brands like splayed out on a table and you know the people looking for projects a license are going to come by and they're going to say which of these 50 do you want and maybe okay Bears get gets picked the optimistic view is this is a cool slightly maybe different way to go than a lot of these other projects who seem pretty like you know they want their TV show and um and we'll get the face of these these products out there and good for them for continuing to build and push forward well maybe maybe we'll see a Build-A-Bear that is an okay bear soon that's true yeah gosh our Build-A-Bear's still a thing you have kids don't you no I don't but uh wow you know OMG surprise dolls and and build a bear I I might have worked in some Industries where this was a thing so yeah I won't go too deep into it fair fair um cool let's close on last two pieces of news uh uh look we'll end with that Tyler Hobbs Tyler Hobbs latest project qql.art um because I have more to say on that KKR uh shares of KKR are being sold on avax um so KKR you know one of the biggest private Equity Funds in the world um has made its new healthcare strategic growth fund available on the Avalanche blockchain so they're they're basically trying to securitize okay let's read this individuals we will be able to invest in kkr's healthcare fund through a tokenized feeder fund on the Avalanche blockchain provided by securitize my big takeaway here is Avalanche is doing a lot of interesting financialization of products things they did the initial litigation offering product where you basically they're crowdfunding like lawsuits and then looking to share the profits that may result from these lawsuits and and kind of arguing that there's like a big you can get these big kind of risk-adjusted opportunity disease of like if you if this class auction lawsuit succeeds it's 400 million dollars in payout and you can get a fraction of that for having put in I don't know 100 bucks or whatever in buying one of these like initial litigation offering tokens so a kind of dark kind of brilliant and uh so the ilos and now they're doing it with with um with KKR and this specific Healthcare fund they're doing I think it's very interesting huh how does the SEC feel about something like this the ILO I don't know how they're doing it for this the ILO is a security so they ran their their first ILO product offering through Republic which is a broker that is registered to do reg CF crowdfunding deals so like regulation crowdfund is a law where if you're raising less like under five million dollars um you can basically do it from like non-accredited investors but there's all of these like Hoops that they end up having to jump through with Republican whatever but so they actually issued a security for this um which is I imagine why the the SEC would be okay with it yeah well I I certainly appreciate that and I think then the other big question is um you know are they kycing people who are buying into this um and and and how secure is that yep I have to look into this this Healthcare this KKR deal a little bit more again I know more about the initial litigation offering deal in that case people were had to be kyc'd um like to go through Republic I'm assuming it's the same here um because there's almost no way there's no I mean they're literally calling it The the they're using a company called securitize yeah so they're getting around the security component of this so it's either all for credit investors or they're doing something like the reg CF rays and in either case you know folks are getting kyc'd um yeah I like that again I think it's um I think we have to get away from feeling like everything has to be allowed to be done like totally Wild West anonymously 100 agree I mean I I will say on the record like I pay all my taxes do everything legitimately I don't think that Anonymous identities should be using that to avoid you know um doing things ethically and legally so a 100 agree with you there yeah cool okay let's close on qql.art this is the latest Tyler Hobbs project I think you you tweeted out some some success about this um SAS specifically suggesting you don't love the art let me give let me give a breakdown of um of just sort of what this is for anybody who maybe hasn't been following it and then and then I'd love to get your hot take um so qql.art is this you can go to it it's that's like the website um and it's in their own words a collaborative experiment in generative art by Tyler Hobbs and dandelion West so you go onto the website you can go to create and then you can select all of these different variables and I'm assuming it's um it's an algorithm that was created by Tyler himself and you click generate art and it creates a piece of work based on Tyler's algorithm and sort of the the inputs that you put in and then you can save these works of art to kind of your whatever collection on the page and end up with hundreds of pieces of Art and then what Tyler's going to do and I don't let me check the date on this basically there's going to be a mint pass the mint opens September 30th there he's doing a Dutch auction to buy mint passes you get the mint pass then you can pick one of your generative pieces to action that you've created to actually mint the mint path is good for forever there's like no expiration on it so I think there's going to be some interesting kind of game mechanics here of like people waiting and not minting immediately to kind of see what kind of traits start to be the most valuable um and I think Tyler's actually gonna pick three like Pro three pieces that are his favorite to Mint and so that'll probably influence what becomes then the popular uh art to try and mint so um a fun experiment as they say all right hit me with your take well okay so I I love experimenting on the web I uh my perspective on gender generative art is that it's a really cool tool for creating components of other art so for example you want to build a video game and you can't draw all the items that you need for that game cool you can use generative art and the pieces of that can be turned into what is actually the art which is that comprehensive story that you are telling to call a single item art that was generated by a computer I think is not really accurate and is kind of lazy because part of the process for art is the actual process right not just clicking a button or typing in words and guessing and checking so my snarky tweet was like I posted a picture of a spirograph for anybody who remembers that which is just a bunch of lines and in circles um so I think it's cool I just yeah I I think that like if the Standalone output is a single piece of art um I'm not as impressed by it I certainly would not invest in the space from an nft perspective so my pushback is one of the things that was so impressive about fidenzas which are popping off right now probably because qql is coming out and so people are focusing on Tyler or there was like a sweep somebody bought like you know a bunch of fidenzas um what was so impressive about fidenzas was the consistent quality and variety of that project now the way art blocks Works folks probably know this right but but like Tyler wrote that code and then I you know I would go onto the art blocks website and mint affidenza and he had no say after he locked that code in he got no say in what the output was what wasn't a case of like I'm gonna generate thousands upon thousands of prints and then pick my favorite 100 and put those up for sale or something right like the code was what the code was once he stepped away from it and so to be able to write a code that can produce like almost entirely beautiful options that also have a tremendous amount of variety is from my understanding like very challenging and impressive and Tyler's art history has been usually a blending of like generative stuff from an algorithm and some like physical art as well um so I I think that is like that should be considered real art like crafting the algorithm and trialing it in and of itself I see is a very legitimate form of Art at some point there is a line you know and we're going to brush up against what is that line I mean with things like Dolly right like if I'm just like typing in words and an algorithm is like reading my words and outputting something like do I get to be an artist like that there's a there's a fine line there and and this obviously this qql project pushes closer to that line than than I think just Tyler's like original art blocks work because this is a case where like I as a user I'm just like plugging in some variables I like seeing what spits out and then out of like hundreds and hundreds of options picking my favorite um yeah but I I do think there's a gender of art I I will compromise with you on this point which is what he created is art that code is absolutely art and if there was a contract that said that anything that gets produced with that code can never be sold or traded then I would say cool this is a really interesting product so what he created was Art now the output that people are are creating and then selling and trading is where I draw the line and say no that's not art that's a really cool thing that exists but you didn't actually create art you took someone else's art and you used it to make something with it and so that's a very kind of vague and loose interpretation uh from from my perspective on it but when it starts to get traded that is where I feel like you kind of lose the magic that was created with that code why because trading introduce into the system because the process right the process he put He put time and effort into creating that code that process was the art the the people who are using the thing that he made who are using the art that he created are not putting that time in so my personal definition then is that that is not art that is just a product and it being traded as if it is Art is not really legit for me are fidenza's art I don't think they are personally so you don't think okay you think the code is Art but not the first exactly like kudos to the people who wrote the code that is a hundred percent art um if if if a traditional artist if like Jackson Pollock created like you know a piece of art and then said hey you guys can go and remix this and do whatever you want with it um ultimately he did that work he still did the initial work the fidenza is nobody's remixing right like he wrote the code somebody's just hitting the degenerate button I guess you're saying like that's the remixing part like it's not you're not putting in the variables the same way I very much think fidanzas are art and therefore I think that this is also art I support you that's okay it's just an opinion oh totally of course this is a code that Tyler wrote um but yeah we're gonna bump up against these lines and these questions because we're moving into a world increasingly where computers are can be tools to create a lot of things that had no really human intervention at the outset you know or strategically at the outset and um it'll be interesting to see where it comes out all right bored thank you so much for joining me this was our show any final words any any topics you feel like we need to hit upon before we part ways here Carly thank you so much it was great to spend time with you and chat about all these things it was so comprehensive I feel like we've covered basically everything that happened in the last week and yet I'm sure in this like a hundred things because this space is absolutely bananas even during a bear Market but thank you so much and I hope folks have a wonderful weekend [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you
