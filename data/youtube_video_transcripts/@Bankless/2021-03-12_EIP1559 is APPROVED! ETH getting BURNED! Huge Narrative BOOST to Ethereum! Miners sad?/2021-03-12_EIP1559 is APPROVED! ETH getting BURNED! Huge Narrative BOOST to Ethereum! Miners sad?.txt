[Music] let's talk about another story that is super important this is a crypto native story but we've been tracking it for a while this is ei what is segway so in crypto we're not trying to print more money actually we're trying to to burn money apparently right bitcoin is the story of a fixed supply money but ether is becoming a story of actually a negative issuance possibly a burning light the furnaces my friend eip1559 has been approved to go in not the next hard fork but the hard fork after which could be slated for a july release of ethereum and that would put this thing eip 1559 into the protocol for for folks that haven't been paying attention to what eip 1559 is could you give a quick summary and tell us why this is so important right eip1559 instead of making a transaction in ethereum and that transaction fee going to validators or miners instead it just gets burned and there's a number of reasons behind this one it's just more game theoretically stable if you just burn that fee and the imp important juxtaposition here is that transaction fees on ethereum it reflect demand for ethereum's block space which will reflect demands for ethereum economy right and so ethereum has a protocol when it collects fees that is like the ethereum system collecting revenue that is the gdp of ethereum the revenue that ethereum collects is directly correlated with uh the gdp of the ethereum economy and because we are now burning this ether the asset the scarcity of ether should also be tracking the gdp of ethereum as the gdp of ethereum grows we should be burning more and more ether making ether more and more scarce so this is in stark contrast to the united states economy where our gdp except for during covid our gdp has never been higher yet we are still issuing money at an all-time high rate those two things are backwards because if the american economy if the american nation state was efficient it would be able to generate revenue from its own gdp this is what a nation state does this is what ethereum does it generates security to fund itself to fund its growth through the gdp that it taxes in in the united states we tax our citizens and then we also print money ethereum taxes the people that use it and then it burns money and it importantly burns it issues like a stock buyback on ether of the asset because the more and more ether that it can pull away from the secondary market to make ether more and more scarce makes ethereum and ether harder to attack under a proof of stake paradigm there's your eip one five five nine lessons like two minutes that was awesome man and and guys uh go check out the uh the opening note that that david wrote about eip1559 is a great summary so basically what we're doing is we're taxing transactions and we're giving that back to eth holders in the form of a burn good times to be an eth holder the last thing i'll say david is i don't think the market has woken up and realized that this is an actual protocol going into a store of value commodity asset like ether i don't think the market understands what eip1559 is guys i think this is alpha this is alpha if you are in this space you see do you see anybody talking about this oh well here's the closest thing actually actually this is bloomberg this is the bluebird front page the first time i've seen an ethereum related article but david this is what they this is their headline cryptocoin outperforming bitcoin is about to see supply reduced david cryptocoin i guess they're talking about ether are they crypto coin that's my favorite crypto coin it turns out they are but this is the first like um i guess narrative that we're seeing of eip1559 escaping into into mainstream so it's still stupid early the market doesn't understand this the market has just wrapped its head around 21 million fixed supply bitcoin wait till they figure out eip 1559 burning supply ether dude so eip1559 extremely elegant upgrade to a blockchain it just it is so perfect in every single way yet the best thing about eip1559 is not anything about the code it's about the narrative it's about the story that is done which is the best  thing about it oh it's so crazy it's so crazy david we're gonna do an entire episode about eip1559 guys and we have a fantastic guest who's been in eip1559 like the best analyst the guy who understands is the best hassu who's a pseudo-anonymous um uh i guess analyst thinker researcher crypto economic researcher i would call him yeah yes we are camping an entire episode on this it is that important so stay tuned to bankless podcast make sure you check out that episode coming last thing on eip1559 not everyone's a fan not everyone's a fan miners do not like it can't believe this is if we can't well this is ethereum miners and this is a headline saying ethereum miners plot a hash power show of force against eip 1559 so there's undercurrents of threats coming from miners of course miners revenue is going to get cut as a result of this uh 20 30 i mean they're doing pretty well and they've been doing pretty well okay so that's the that's the backdrop of this that's the context but i've had actually a lot of people reach out to me david and like are you concerned about this that it won't go through are you concerned that miners might fork um my response to that is no i'm not concerned at all not even in the slightest i think miners think they are some miners think they are far more powerful over this ecosystem than they are they if they fork that's great for eath holders right thanks for the free coin see you later i'm gonna sell it i'm gonna buy some more eth that's it and a story right um i think that the the threat of minor fork is definitely uh over inflated um in fact i think a lot of this might be saber rattling we'll see if they fork or not uh but it could very well be just saber rattling if they do fork in the end i'm not concerned about it what's your opinion on this yeah it's absolutely saber rattling and the reason why like the title of this uh a hash power show of force and what that means is that a bunch of miners are going to all signal with their hash power saying hey we do not approve this and this is just the wrong paradigm ethereum doesn't answer to hash power that's not what it does it's not bitcoin this isn't bitcoin cash versus bitcoin this is ethereum first off proof of stake is coming where your hash power is just going to get deleted anyways and so like goodbye and also cool you can anyone can fork a blockchain it doesn't matter if all the hash power goes in one direction if all of the community goes in a different direction and starts valuing the a different fork hash power is going to go to the fork that is valued because that's where revenue comes from it doesn't matter if you have if 99 of hash power is signaling in support of something if all of the value goes into a different fork then miners are just gonna go back to that one like the hash power is not the the saber it's not a weapon like no it's a bluff we we've and look man we've seen this play out already time and time again even in the bitcoin ecosystem right with kind of these other uh minor instigated forks or other party instigated forks like bitcoin cash and all of these things and um it's the community that decides what bitcoin is the same same with the theorem in fact more so because now we have assets that are issued on top of ethereum we have a whole d5 ecosystem that gets to choose which chain is going to be the chain that it supports right um and so miners have very little power here i'm not worried at all eip1559 is going to go through uh and it's going to be great i think for the stakeholders of the platform who are users dapp developers people who believe in a decentralized future and want more economic bandwidth i'm super bullish it's going to be fine don't worry about the miners guys all right
