[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show in the spirit of nfts beyond pfps which is our theme here at overpriced jpegs at least for this month i have as my guest john rogers john was the first franchise management hire at disney and created their franchise management department and really what that means is john was in charge of from a business perspective looking at many of disney's biggest franchises and saying what do the next 10 years look like for this franchise how are we going to develop it how are we gonna make sure that the audiences don't burn out from it are we gonna do a theme park ride are we gonna do merchandise are we gonna do six more movies like what makes the most sense for this franchise so as we talk about in this nft space intellectual property and creating franchise ip no one really is better suited to talk about what's happening based on what has happened than john rogers and what's so cool is that john not only worked at disney for a long time and did this in the web 2 world he now works in the blockchain space and is as far as anybody can be is is fairly native to what's happening in blockchain so his ideas around what's going to happen with intellectual property in web 3 i think are awesome i really enjoyed this conversation i learned so much and i think it is so so critical that if you are buying into nft projects that are telling you that their value proposition is basically the ip that they're building which is like all projects at this point like most projects tell you that their long-term vision has something to do with intellectual property you must understand what the heck that means because not all intellectual property was created equal and there's lots of different models that are emerging in the nft space that are really interesting in terms of ip and you know how it might be monetized and how it might make money for the individual user but like you got to understand it so if you're curious about this at all if you're investing in these kinds of projects definitely listen to this interview all the way through i think john did a great job explaining this from a web 2 perspective again i learned a lot so i hope you do too and before we get right into things we do have a word from our sponsors and i want to give a big shout out to the

today uh very excited to chat with you about what i think is one of the most important topics right now in nfts in the blockchain and that is intellectual property all of these projects it feels like are in some way telling their communities that what they are building is intellectual property and i don't think we often dig deep enough on like what the heck that actually means and what intellectual property is you've worked with some of the biggest ips the biggest brands in entertainment and some of the biggest franchises in entertainment for many years now so i know your perspective on this is super valuable super helpful and we also work together in a couple other contexts you're friends of block block which is the company where i work so very excited to be bringing our relationship here to the overpriced jpegs world let's start with who you are tell us your background why i'm so excited to have you here talking about ip with me yeah so as you sort of set it up i've had about a 20-year career in intellectual property primarily in feature film entertainment but i really kind of at one point my career i shifted over and joined lucasfilm so i was on the marketing and the brand marketing team for what we thought was going to be the last star wars movie ever revenge of the sith and it turns out that's not the case but uh that was really my introduction to the entertainment industry before that i'd been at an advertising agency and i started my career after graduate school in management consulting i was a strategy consultant at blues allen hamilton and sort of just one position led to another and kind of moved me deeper into the intellectual property space so i spent about two and a half years at lucasfilm and then when the star wars project was over uh the head of marketing at disney called me up and said they were looking to create a whole brand new function that never existed before called franchise management and asked if i would come and be the the founding executive on the franchise management function at disney so i was as far as i know the first person in hollywood to have franchise in their formal job title what briefly what does franchise management mean it's different for every studio it's not a standardized definition in the disney context it means that you're managing the brand from a long-term perspective so looking at a property let's say like tron for instance looking at it from not just the next movie or the next tv show but looking at it from a 10 year out perspective in planning out what is that content plan what are the projects that we want to develop to further storytelling and to further the brand and what projects more importantly and this is the toughest part of the job do we want to say no to and traditionally studios and they still most of them do this to this day is say yes to everything they just want to make every buck they can and for disney it was saying we need to be selective we need to think about from a long term what won't hurt this property if it's just a quick buck and so at times that made me a very unpopular person at disney because i was usually the one to to say no and uh but it's really taking that long-term planning perspective and i think it's clear past couple years i think have demonstrated how strong disney's been in this i think we'll talk about this maybe a little bit more later as it applies to nfts and and things like that but the mandalorian like i just feel like all these projects that disney has ultimately said yes to has strengthened their brand positioning tremendously and i feel like i hear that even as somebody like pretty outside the industry i feel like that's the the general consensus is disney's done this brilliantly so congratulations for your role in that my little piece of setting up the team from the beginning but um you know one of the challenges and this you'll see this with disney and with all the studios is the film side of things that there's a lot of pressure from the film side to make movies that that drive the property and so when the franchise teams are working they're working across all all outlets all media platforms film television publishing interactive you name it and so you've got this careful plan but then if a film comes along that's not carefully planned it can really set the set things up wrong and so one of the things that the team has to work closely with the production partners and the filmmakers is getting that all to fit and there's always this because the film is the the big thing it's the it's the real driver that there's always a lot of pressure just to let the film do what it wants to do so you've got to create great relationships with your filmmakers and your production executives to get this to work and that was one of the things i think we did excellently at disney and my team was that we really put extra emphasis into making those relationships with the creative talent and building that bridge between the suits and the creatives and so whenever i get asked what my superpower is i always say it's that left being able to marry left brain and right brain thinking that i can meet with a costume designer and talk about design and walk across the hall to talk to a lawyer about deal points in a in a talent deal i want to come back to this and ask you about how you think that same skill set is needed maybe in these nft projects and and you know what projects need to be investing in if they are going to build long-term ip from a creative perspective but i want to kick off with one of the reasons that i wanted to bring you on here today because you have a very crisp thesis that i think is fascinating and i'll say it here briefly but then you can really say it the way you want to which is that blockchain is really an emerging media platform and that you think ultimately nfts and the blockchain will stand really shoulder to shoulder with film and tv and these these major media platforms and that's just like whoa like that's a huge idea and a huge statement put it in your own words and and tell me a little bit more about that thesis you just took my terms carly sorry i've heard you say it several times yeah so so here's here's my thesis and that this is i think something a little bit different than most people look at blockchain and blockchain has many things it's that's one of the amazing things it can be so many different things but from a media person's perspective what has me excited is that in time as it matures and content matures and the the expertise develops blockchain will be an originator of content standing quote unquote shoulder to shoulder with film television publishing internet you name it and that stories and characters that are created on the blockchain will move easily into the worlds of film and television and publishing and characters created in the worlds of film and television and publishing will move more easily over to the world of blockchain and we're already beginning to see the very early trials of this and the missteps and the good steps but in two years i would say two or three years time but the pace of this industry it could be in two and three months time you're gonna start to see real projects crack that and stand up and become just the next great franchises and so what's got me excited to move over into this nft space is that i want to be it's like looking over the shoulder of marconi when he invented the radio i want to be a part of that and i want to understand how the plumbing works of the of the of the technology and create the great stories that are going to build on top of that plumbing and move to other worlds why do you think that what is it about blockchain that makes it such a natural place for film and tv to both go to and then to originate from yeah it's it's there's aspects of how a consumer and audience will engage with the characters and the stories that are unique to the platform so it has elements of linear storytelling but it's not true linear storytelling it has interactive elements but it's not true console gaming interactivity so it can stand and have its own unique attributes so a a fan let's just take let's just say star wars came to the blockchain which i'm certain it will someday we'll talk about that later i'm sure that a fan of star wars can experience and engage themselves in the world of star wars in a different way you can have a longer drawn out experience on the blockchain you can own a part of the star wars universe on the blockchain you know web3 you can own a part of it and that's what i think is really exciting for another way of engaging audiences changing and expanding that fan experience it's another layer it's another layer of that fan experience so let's start where this started right which is the web 2 world and this is a broad question but i think it's a it's a jumping-off point how does intellectual property work in web 2. what is intellectual property what does it mean right i know you have a lot of thoughts on all this well traditionally it's been centralized and this is actually another aspect of what makes blockchain different it's now moving to decentralized storytelling and so you've usually had a centralized owner let's say disney that owns a property like tron and you've had centralized creative development they hire a director and a producer or whoever a store a writer to create the stories and then you push it out through a mass channel what's different here is that not actually answering your question directly but what's different with web3 is that it's now decentralizing that but traditionally it's coming from a top-down approach and now you're creating opportunities to do that differently and we've talked about this a bit before and you've talked about there's there's an anchor with intellectual property so in some cases i know you've worked i think on pirates of the caribbean you know that actually started as a ride at disney and then became a film and then became all these other things whereas other properties start as games or as tv and i guess one question i want to push on is for something to really be intellectual property in a massive way does it have to ultimately have a full story like the way pirates of the caribbean obviously is a full story now or cars and other property i know you worked on is no it doesn't necessarily have to have the full story at the beginning but it does have to have a vision in a road it could be called a road map but it might be overstating it to say that there's a road map there has to be a vision behind where that story can go so cars for instance it started off with a road trip that john laster took with his family and that was the idea and he created in his mind this world of cars and it was at the very early stages a very undeveloped idea but that was the start of how they began to build out that franchise and then it just grew into other other areas but there's usually an anchor point where it begins and there's usually a natural home star wars is in film james bond they very clearly have said is in film um other properties are going to be in publishing harry potter for instance as fabulous as those movies were harry potter's home is always going to be in publishing so there's always that that anchor point and i think what's going to be interesting with nft's evolving is that there will be anchor points that franchise let's say board apes will have the anchor point in nfts but you might see a board apes movie or tv show coming in the future you said to me that one of the things you found at disney was they wanted every property to be a you know a billion dollar merchandise empire and everything understandably i suppose given the world is about like how do we make more money how do we extract more value from this and your perspective was that not everything bigger isn't always better in all channels and that you really need to kind of tailor make a plan for a franchise for the property talk to me about that a little bit more and i'd be curious how that might apply to this new world and and from how people should think about investing in nft projects and this is where when my team was founded at disney in 2005 where things really began to change traditionally disney was make the most everything as big as possible and make every single penny possible and every studio had run that way and some of them still run that way what changed was we really began developing these analytics around franchises and understanding them from a qualitative and a quantitative perspective deep audience research really began to realize that hey this property isn't going to be the next star wars but it could be great it can drive create affinity for consumers in a certain segment that we want to target it can be its own thing and so one of the things that we always worked with our filmmakers and executives on was understanding that you might think that this is the next star wars but it shouldn't be this should really be something different and special in its own thing it's always about finding that right size not taking a deal because you can but taking the right deals and really having that perspective and that was always a challenge on every project of in an ongoing discussion with the senior executives of what is the right program behind this property what is the right size for it what that deal is probably not a good deal and um that also led to a lot of internal challenges because you have say teams in the interactive disney interactive or disney consumer products who had quarterly goals they had to hit or annual goals they had to hit and there was a lot of pressure of this big hot movie coming from the studio or tv show coming from abc for instance has to be huge so we're going to take do everything we can and our answer was no you're not you can't do that because you're going to burn this property out you're going to two years everyone's going to be sick of it and we have a 10-year idea what this can be so there was a lot of that and what we got through my disney's been so successful over the recent say decade is that that process and that conversation can happen it doesn't have to be adversarial and it's expected whereas at other studios still to this day it still doesn't happen it's just do everything you possibly can i think that's so interesting do you have specific examples you'd be willing to give of a property that you guys were like no don't don't burn this out don't this can't take all of that exposure the biggest one which everyone's familiar with is pirates of the caribbean that pirates especially in the 2005 to 2009 time frame was probably disney's most important franchise and there's a way it's not necessarily by the box office it was also one of the top three drivers of attendance at the theme parks and when you think of what that dollar value is behind attendance at the theme parks it's a it's a multi-billion dollar annual property and so there was this emphasis especially after how big johnny depp got and the property got just to do everything and so that really became a challenge for me because in those cases i was saying no to a lot of projects more than i was saying yes because we can't take a half a million dollars on this deal here because we have a two million dollar opportunity the year after and so and the the story is not going to fit with the story the filmmakers want to tell in the next movie and so we are really having to to manage and right-size pirates of the caribbean to avoid burning it out and that was uh and that took that was years that that conversation kept going on where is pirates of the caribbean today and and how did that vision end up playing out i have a question this will tie i think to nfts in a way that i'm curious about but let's start there the way i'd characterize this and i should say i have no contact with any of the teams at disney on this topic is that pirates of the caribbean is in turn around that those that first wave of movies probably over lived their welcome some of the creative changed in the later years and you know gore verbinski left as director it changed a little bit and i think that they're now in a regrouping period and i do believe pirates will come back i believe it should come back um it's too important for disney at least certainly in the theme park perspective but just owning the idea of pirates is theirs and that's a big idea to own and so i think it's a turnaround they're probably trying to figure out what does that creative look like with or without jack sparrow or does johnny depp come back as jack sparrow or is there a new jack sparrow and those are the questions that they're answering internally right now but i do believe it'll come out i see a disney plus show in its future what do you think of my predictions i i think pirates will be a theatrical property and would be surprised if it goes to disney plus oh really okay so it's not i'd be surprised i think of like i feel like there's been this move to instead of making another movie like i think they didn't they did this with the mandalorian wasn't that originally a movie and then they were like actually let's break it out into a but like a series and you know make people buy disney okay yeah all right never mind in star wars you look at these worlds and we actually could take tremendous time and spend a lot of resources to develop the myth what called the mythology which sometimes they'll call it a show bible but we called it the mythology and it's a binder that's like five inches thick of documentation about the full world all of the history all of the characters um star wars has what's called the data bank which is more of a digital mythology but it's really documenting that and putting that plan in place and star wars is a bigger world it's a bigger idea so it has more applications in say to go from film to tv pirates isn't quite as big of that of that world as big as it is it's not as big of a world so it's a little bit harder to move that to other other areas so i asked you in part about where pirates is today and what that life cycle looked like and it's obviously still ongoing but because part of what i'll say it this way part of what terrifies me about launching nft projects and i'm involved in launching nft projects and i've had people ask will you do an nft for overpriced jpeg someday is it feels like it's a lifetime commitment right like you basically have to keep interest up in the project for forever to keep in this case like nfts valuable is that true how do you think about that how should investors be thinking about that like is should they be trying to time life cycles in terms of buying and selling like what does that mean in the nft world and for investors well if i think for nft creators you need to come into the project with that already planned out is this because you are committing to a community you are building a community that's going to be potentially ongoing for for years and you need to really say upfront to that community hey this is a this is an ongoing initiative you buy into this project we're going to be engaged with you as long as there's interest in it and that could be years down the road in some cases i haven't really seen this yet but i think that this is a fair model is to say upfront this is a two-year project we are going to engage with you for two years you're buying into a two-year project we're going to take you through an experience with story online and offline we're going to take you into other fun activities that you might not be expecting and at the end of two years the project goes away but then investors might say well is that going to have value at the end and it could be well we turn it back to the community at that point you then take full control so i haven't seen those models evolve yet but this can this idea of like a long-term commitment i don't know if that's going to be sustainable in most projects it just if you have an apes or punks yes it's going to generate enough revenue to justify a team to support it but at some point some of these projects are just going to not be able to support the staff and the time and resources required and what you don't want to see is a rug pool you don't want everyone to wake up one day and find that the twitter's been shut down and the discord is shut down like that that's a bad experience um and i do believe the concept of pedigree is going to be important and you're beginning to see this now that you know on the film and tv side of things we look at a team that comes in to pitch a project and talk about their pedigree what have they done in the past what are they capable of that hasn't fully developed in nfts yet but you're going to start seeing teams like yuga labs or marvel labs or block block that will start developing their pedigree and reputations and say okay that's a great team so i'm gonna invest in that project because i trust the team even if i don't know as much about the project and that will be very important going forward i am starting to develop a couple models in my mind around how i feel like intellectual property has been playing out in the blockchain and on the blockchain so far and i want to get your reactions to them and i want to hear if you think this is correct or if i'm missing something it strikes me that on one end of the spectrum you have what i would call the closest replication of what you see in web 2 which is you have a central team that is building something out and they already have nfts associated with it and they're basically saying these nfts are going to be valuable collectibles in the way that the first mickey mouse drawing would be a valuable collectible if you could get your hand on that because of what disney and mickey mouse has become the example there to me is v friends and i think gary vaynerchuk has been very explicit about what he's doing he's saying i'm very i'm a very talented business person i have tremendous connections i'm going to make this set of characters that i've drawn relevant via building on an animation studio that's making movies or making tv shows or making books and you know exploring all of those avenues and so at the end you as a v friend holder are holding a collectible now there's actually a lot more to that because you also are getting other benefits and i think this gets into your point about your an expanded fan experience by holding this nft that i don't get by holding a disney collectible for example but that feels like one model we're seeing play out and i think that's what garyvee is doing on the total other end of the spectrum you have projects like blitmaps and cryptodes that are fully in the creative commons i think is the way to phrase that and i've talked about blitmaps a number of times actually on the podcast where the there's a central team there there was one originally but they have said we have no copyright to any of this it's completely completely belongs to the community you guys are driving the story and we have no sort of ownership over this at all we're gonna see what what y'all create and then you have something in the middle which i think is where you have your board aids for example where the community doesn't own the property as a whole but you own full rights to your specific ape for example you can do jenkins the butler or whatever who is now run by caa may go make a ton of money that will benefit the jenkins owner but but they couldn't go and do something as a whole with with the board a property because they don't own that as a whole do you think those three breakdowns are what we're seeing right now are there others i've missed and i would love your assessment on each of those yeah i i think those are the i think you've assessed the three that we've seen so far i do believe there's gonna be more models coming and different models coming in the future and i have an idea for one that i think i've been playing around in my head that i i like a little bit better and we can talk about that oh yeah i wanna hear that you know i can see like if you go the complete wild west you own everything it's yours we're out of it i can see how fun that would be for a member of the community an investor a consumer but it's going to run into some problems and i'll talk about that one a second so hold that thought for a second then the middle model which is all right like we're board apes we've we've got this mother brand of the board apes yacht club and that is kind of defined and you can't touch that but what you can do with your ape you can go sign a deal with caa and the owner of the ape next to you can go sign a deal with caa and then we'll see kind of what develops um that model is also a little challenging why i like my model better and then v friends is just awesome like that's the pedigree model that is you are investing in a team or a person a creator based entirely on their pedigree and you're trusting them you're going to rely in what they're doing and i think that model has a huge future and i mean gary's probably the the leader in the space right now but there's other teams kind of right behind him who are emerging and will be there right side by side with him and following that pedigree model now what don't i like about the wild west approach of just do anything you want or the kind of the middle ground of board apes and that is i see the fun of decentralizing the storytelling and the engagement that you own it you can go develop it and i do believe you should own like that in any of these models you should own the character the problem is what happens when board ape 52 signs a movie deal and board 84 signs a movie deal and both movies are going to come out simultaneously that is eventually going to burn out the property would be my concern in traditional on the traditional side of things that absolutely couldn't happen because you would burn out pirates you'd burn out a franchise there's no and you don't want a centralized organizing authority because it's sort of against the spirit of web 3. so how do you how do you manage that how do you kind of keep the spirit of ownership and decentralization but yet not allow property to be burned out and so the idea i've been playing around with is you launch with a limited license you trust in the team and launch with a limited license let's just say something with llamas for a trivial example and we want and when you say launch with the team it'd be like you hugo labs created yacht club so you launch with a huge labs yugo labs launches their llama project and they're the licenses are restricted but what happens is everyone who's invested then and owns a llama has a share and a doubt and that dao uses part of the treasury to then build out the franchise plan to say here is the road map here is the story line and you could you got to develop internally as a creative team or bring in expertise experts who have writing experts who can develop that story and that long-term franchise plan and then let the dow decide and that way when llama 52 signs a movie deal mama 84 signs a movie deal the dow can decide which of those projects should be moving forward and that way you're still representing the spirit of decentralization but you're also protecting a long-term kind of vision for that this brand could grow and become many things and i think what's going to happen is like say 12 to 18 months when a lot of these board a projects come to market i think you're going to see a lot of of i think a lot of them will be really successful but i also think it's going to be a little messy in terms of contradictory storytelling like are they in the pirate era selling pirate ships which is one project i've seen are they going into outer space in a futuristic world which is another project i've seen like where do the board apes live in the where's their mythology and that is what needs to be documented i was going to ask do you have any insights into the jenkins deal jenkins the jenkins board ape deal or what's going to be done with that is that one of the references you're making uh only what i've read in the trades and like so no insider knowledge at all i'm not a board ape investor i'm kicking myself because i had the opportunity and didn't aren't we all aren't we all um so i'm not an investor but only what i've read in the trades about kind of ideas that have been pitched to say caa or other say producers so no knowledge there okay so i wanna i wanna talk about this model you just laid out i think it's so interesting and so when you say licenses are restricted you say you launch with the uk labs they launch their llamas project licenses are restricted it means you're basically saying the individual holders can't do whatever they want with even their own individual exactly for say a lockup period so say one year lockup period so for your first year owning the llama there's a restricted license so you can't just take llama 52 and do a movie deal in that first year and what's happening is in that first year is the community through the dao is deciding on what is that long-term plan they're investing using that some of that treasury to invest into the project and developing that long-term plan and at that point the license opens up so you then convert the license to say creative commons go do whatever you want and the dow will decide if there's a conflict after that year it opens up you're saying yep so wow and so you think it is the ideal here that the team that launches it is actually a team that has a certain level of expertise in how you go about planning for a future roadmap and a franchise somebody in that team is a writer or you need a certain level of built-in expertise to start to kind of set up the framework and then let the community make the decision would that be the ideal way this would go it doesn't have to be necessary there has to be some sort of a vision so there has to be a kind of an organizing vision and it could be as simple as a what we call a log line like it's just a two sentence three sentence statement about what this world can be and then it can be turned over and let the teams develop expertise and content what are the experts you would need because you say you say that you say oh you just need like a two to three sentence log line but as somebody who doesn't come from this world i'm imagining myself being in that community and being like what the f am i supposed to do like i don't know how to build star wars like so what would be like if you were advising a project right now that wanted to do this but doesn't come from that world it's like here are the five people you should probably have on your team to guide this project forward before it completely gets turned over to the the masses who have never done this before so let's let's run through a scenario let's talk take the llama example so i've i'm i've now launched my my my llama project so it's my project and um i've written up a couple of guiding statements pages com comments about what i feel the world of llamas should be and now we've rolled out the project i've got 8 000 so nft holders we've created our dow to vote on what we want to do next we're going to hire an expert to come in and actually write the mythology for us and sort of give us this guiding document or tool and so we'll do that now who are the people that you would hire if assuming the dow voted and approved that that approach you could go in two directions there are consulting experts in franchise building that's one direction one group is called starting off john rodgers uh or me would you consider yourself uh well aren't you isn't that sort of where you are as an expert in franchise building i i am the builder of the business plans in the brand planning i'm not the writer i am not a creative okay but there are experts who in that writing side of things who are available or you could go and actually hire an actual writer and developer someone who has expertise and experience developing like long-form shows and storytelling and movies and um they're there as well and so you go and solicit one of them hire them to actually build out that mythology for you and then what you're giving all the members of the dao is it could literally be a binder of mythology that can then be taken to any project you want to develop and and build it from there so it's a model that hasn't been done yet it's one i'm very interested in because i think it could solve some of the problems that we're going to see with the kind of the wild west just do whatever you want approach but still respect the spirit of decentralization and the spirit of ownership in web 3. so this dow this collective we all own llamas we vote and say yes we want xyz writer to build out the mythology for this project now we as the dow and we've we've agreed that we're going to spend x dollars from the treasury perhaps to pay this writer to do that and then now we as a collective own this mythology and you're saying the next step is then to take it to what do you approach who do you approach then for stage two and i'm sure there's infinity options you go do you want to show do you want a movie do you want whatever yeah and that's and that's when the license converts that's when the license becomes creative commons and it's going to be up to the owners of the llamas the members of the dow to go develop what they want some will do nothing and just use hold it as an investment or as something to engage the community with some will go sign a deal with caa and try to pitch that all around you know any studio that wants to take it and some will go to publishing or music and and that's but you have the guiding you have that guiding document and if there's any potential conflicts and projects the dao has the right to say or has an ability to say we can't have this conflict if it goes to the creative commons at that point i'm trying to understand the benefit actually of making it creative commons there as opposed to just the central body quote unquote that owns it are the members of the dao so it's centrally owned by 10 000 people say because it strikes me if you go to the creative commons suddenly now a competing dao that didn't buy into that original project can write their own mythology that's better and go take that to caa well that competing dao wouldn't own the rights to the sent to the core ip so they wouldn't own it when you say it goes to creative commons what's really saying is that the the investors and the dow the owners of the nfts then have the ability to go do deals if they want if you wanted to so the ownership transfers from the yugo labs initial team to the dao that's what you're suggesting to the owners of the dao okay okay does that mean that it is like pure creative commons or again there's some sort of almost like legal transfer from yugo labs to probably you probably wouldn't see you represented by the dao right you probably wouldn't say pure creative comments because okay it's because the dao is involved in this in some ways so it's it's kind of that's what i want to get precise on for folks is understanding that because again i think the blit maps is pure creative commons model the entire world has equal ownership in theory over the blit maps model so it's some sort of a light yeah some sort of a license that allows you to go pursue deals but at the same time you're being a member of the dow has some has some voting say on what if there's conflict yeah some right and some exclusivity over members of another dao that haven't bought in for example i want to talk about how to think about making money as members of communities that are in theory now investing into intellectual property and i want to give an example as a place to start which is there's this exciting idea that if you're good at spotting culture early right like oh i i saw pirates of the caribbean somehow i got access to that and saw it early and i knew it was going to be a hit now that in this new world of web 3 i could invest in that in some capacity and share in the billions of dollars that pirates of the caribbean ultimately made and one of the challenges there is security laws which say that really it's hard to get around accredited investor laws and that if you're not accredited investors sitting at home there's limits to what you can be promised i have an example but actually before i give that i want to ask you maybe to talk about some of the ways you see early investors in these projects being rewarded monetarily or and otherwise by investing in these these kinds of projects well there's certainly the appreciation and the properties if they if they grow which is i think most people are looking at and that's why there's a lot of pump and dump schemes in nfts is that it's just the you know it doubles in value in a month and you do that but ultimately i think long term it's about the brand building it's about building that storytelling and that engagement now there's always going to be a huge market for artists like people that you buy a one a one of one original piece of art and it grows tremendous value but i'm thinking more in terms of kind of pfp projects and uh projects that have uh say 8 000 llamas and i think a great opportunity there is just is building up the franchises building out a story a core story and pursuing opportunities to take it into other areas of media um and so there's there's a lot of areas around that that you can pursue so are we just in unchartered territory where we are basically i want to say like making stocks out of things that previously weren't stocks you know like where we've just sort of collectively decided if the value of a brand goes up owning an nft that's a piece of that brand means something even though legally and technically it doesn't like is that do you think that's where we are and where we'll stay for a long time well i i wouldn't say it's like it's like that because i look at its culture you're investing in culture and owning culture and that has always been in various forms of wine has been a great investment traditionally and that's culture it's a physical product in a bottle and probably stored in a cellar in switzerland if it's valuable but it's a piece of culture art has offline art heart you know physical art has always been a great store of value in culture so it's i look at it as it's really you're investing in culture and that is always proven to be a good investment and there's what's offering with nfts is there's so many different ways to apply the culture than has been before it's not just a solid piece of art that you have to hang on a wall it's something that can be transferable it can be applied in other areas um you know an example i'm going to give you um which i think is kind of exciting i don't know much about it but i've talked to some friends who are in this space is that they're working on developing a content where you can take an nft that you own so you own this this this llama but as you're watching a streaming tv show and this is one of the major streaming services working on this that your nft appears on the show in real time as you're watching it or my daughter's llama is dressed in her outfit and my llamas dressed in my outfit as you're watching the show and every person watching the show sees it differently and that's a whole new way of applying value in this culture that hasn't been done before so that's a new way to monetize that hasn't been done before what streaming platform is that can you say i can't say and it's years away it's years away but there literally are is a team working on this right now i think what feels unchartered like unchartered territory to me and the reason i'm pushing on this like have we just made everything a stock now even when it wasn't previously and i have a lot of different my my head swims with some of the stuff because i can be overly logical like but like where's the where you know where's the exact value like help me understand it you know like i think people are very skeptical of of blockchain and nfts or bitcoin they're like but it doesn't actually it's not actually worth anything i understand um is owning a collectible like what are what are the most valuable pirates of the caribbean collectibles valued at right now my guess is actually you haven't made 100x your money or 10x your money maybe even by owning that maybe at its peak you did but right now probably owning a pirates of their caribbean collectible is not going to be worth tens of thousands of dollars is that true that's true yeah and what feels like might be different here is that this is different than just owning a collectible we've decided that you somehow own a piece of this brand like owning a stock that's a piece of coca-cola except a stock has sort of legal ties to the to the coca-cola brand and you do technically own a piece of that business in a weird way and have we just decided that that now applies to brands and if you own this nft and the brand gets big enough that means it has value does that make sense as a question and is that something new that's happening in your mind well i think what's partially new here is the transferability that if you purchased a trading card let's say you had a lebron james tops trading card or pick any famous athlete it's a physical card you probably put it in a plastic protective sleeve you probably have it if it's really valuable in a safety deposit box it's not easily transferable whereas with an nft it's easily transferable especially as the marketplaces like coinbase come online and open c gets better hopefully these markets become more fluid and liquid and easier to move and i think that's what's really different and new you said that garyvee right now is the gold standard and what he's doing is amazing you also said though there are other teams emerging to maybe stand shoulder to shoulder with gary vee and compete in that space is there anything you can say on what those teams are who's stepping up and are these teams that are new or coming from the traditional web 2 world now entering web web 3. well i think these teams are coming from all places that's what's great about this is that blockchain can attract and support talent coming from multiple areas from from tech from film and television traditional media kind of where i'm coming from it can bring in talent from even from sports and other areas so what's awesome is that it's coming from all areas and i think the key thing is really just thinking smart about the space operating in a way that is very consumer friendly or audience friendly and a very and this is a key part very legitimately and honestly that there's too many scam projects we all know this but over time it's as a young industry very immature industry over time scam projects get pushed to the edges they never go away entirely this is true in every industry but they get pushed to the edges to the margins and the cream rises to the top exactly and so and these people are subscribing these top projects can come from many places and so i've got my eye on a number of different nft creators and teams that i think are really exciting now their projects might not be the most exciting or the biggest in the world right now but i think these are teams that are thinking about it in the right way and are potentially um going to do great things and so and they're all doing all different things well i will ask you for the specific at the end of this episode so folks have to stay to get your nft buying advice okay i you mentioned this this dow example that i think is really cool of a new model that could emerge me in my never-ending quest to be given a firm answer about how i'm gonna make money on something and not just like you're buying culture and like someday it'll have value which by the way i love and i'm in this space because i love that but like there's a practical like logician in my mind that's like that's bs what the heck does that mean and so i here's here's been my kind of thinking on how you get around these security laws while also promising people potentially very tangible value and i think i'm going to be talking to a project soon that i think is employing this model we'll i'll talk to them more about it but basically you own the ip of your specific character but there's a central team that owns the ip as a whole as we've been describing and then you lease your specific character in some way back to that central project and you're saying i trust you to create some awesome storyline with this set of characters and then if that project essentially goes on to make a whole bunch of money and becomes the next pirates of the caribbean or whatever name some massive franchise you get royalties back for that but the argument is you're not getting royalties just because you bought this right so it's not a security you're getting you're being paid royalties because you've leased this to us the central project that seems really interesting to me and a way to fulfill this fantasy of like buying into pirates of the caribbean early and actually getting uh a claim to their whatever many billions of dollars earned what do you think of that yeah i think there's tremendous opportunity there it's like saying that you're going to rent jack sparrow to disney yeah yeah that would be awesome or you're going to rent boba fett to disney i own jack sparrow and i've now given it to disney to use in their project like holy that seems massive and what's interesting with that model is that so you've got a project that's say our llama a trivial mama example and all of a sudden a studio shows interest and says hey i want to do a movie around llamas and so you work through the dao or the organization and say okay well they want to the story that they're coming up with uses these 10 characters out of our our project these 10 llamas in our project so those 10 llama holders can participate in that revenue stream but the project as a whole perhaps everyone benefits because not everyone's going to have the same chance to get participate in those projects but maybe a revenue part of it the revenue comes to the whole dow the whole collective but then the individual project holders might get a little bit more so you have a kind of a split revenue stream where okay everyone benefits but those whose project whose nfts were used benefit a little bit more because they you know theirs were the ones that were chosen and for whatever reason that's a criteria but i think that's a lot of potential axiomfinity is a game

to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index

do you think that looks like bullish bearish give us the deal well i'm on twitter on the record saying this so i'll say my exact quote was disney's future in the blockchain is potentially spectacular and um i still stand by that today i think it is potentially spectacular if they get all the pieces right and they think big enough the biggest risk risk and i don't think disney would fall into this is thinking too small that thinking oh we're just going to support a show on disney plus or a franchise coming out of the movie studio with an nft collection they need to think much bigger and for me what that would be is the disney theme park blockchain theme park so imagine if and i'll just kind of give a hypothetical example i don't know if it's even possible but imagine if with the l2s coming online later this year disney forks zk-sync and creates their own dedicated disney layer 2 blockchain with zero knowledge roll-up technology behind it so that keeps the transaction costs low and fast and you can build out their collectibles keepsakes pfps one of one original limited art editions nft storytelling all of that in the disney blockchain but because the layer two is built on ethereum you still potentially have the chance to move from the l2 to l1 if you buy say a an original image of darth vader one of one that could be worth thousands or well even beyond that you can then move that from the l2 to the l1 if you want but it's so it's built on ethereum and preserves the security of ethereum it has the transferability around ethereum but you keep the transactions low i think that thinking big like that is going to be why would they want to fork it and have their own their own l2 as opposed to just using one of the existing l2s uh i think because it'll be a little bit about this is now this is centralization but it'd be around the control they would have the control of the technology so it can be set up to serve the disney consumer and this is going to be a huge use of the blockchain if you think of how many millions of people could participate through a disney blockchain so it needs to sort i think they would set up their own but you want that transferability the community would never allow a disney blockchain and it kind of defeats the purpose of a blockchain they just set up some servers or something so i think it preserves that transferability and what the blockchain offers but it also lets disney set up their their area of it to to then be able to say it'll be the disney magic chain or something um something like that it makes me think avery who's the president of vayner nft when i spoke with her you know she advises clients on what blockchains to use and she talked about flow and she said there are times where they would recommend flow for folks who want a closed ecosystem and have enough market power to drive folks to their specific blockchain so flow obviously is partnered with the nba for top nba top shot and the nba is a big enough name and brand that it has the power to drive folks to their own blockchain disney of course this makes sense to me in the sense that disney is obviously also a brand with enough force and power to command their own chain and get people to go specifically do a chain that's theirs and what's different here is that now with the l2s coming later this year that the l2s now offer a lot of what the benefits of what flo offers and say palm offers it offers that but you can go to ethereum and you get the benefits of the security model of ethereum you get the benefits of that ninety percent of the nft activity in the world currently that social signaling benefit which i think is huge that ability to show it off in your open sea wallet yeah so if you know if he does want to do if disney were to hire me back to be head of nfts or blockchain for them uh what i'd be saying to them is you have to look at all the options of course but let's think really big not think small and let's think about how do we how do we allow our customers to our audience our disney families so how determined internally the disney families to participate in a disney blockchain but still be part of the bigger world of nfts and i think that future is on ethereum and the ultimate way to do that do you think disney gets on discord and i guess this is actually more question about discord because when you talk about expanding the fan experience which i think is a no-brainer for why nfts will be everywhere right because for concerts for everybody a lot of the ex the experience as a community you get on nfts right now it's all on discord do you think that will last or is disney setting up its own like fan center like their own blockchain they have their own place where you go as a fan of disney to interact with others like where does where does that fan experience extension happen i don't think discord the way it's currently set up would be the disney experience that they want i agree i'm not saying that they won't go there wouldn't go there but it's just you know they're they're very methodical and they're experts at really trying to understand their customer and what that experience is like and i don't think discord offers that experience i could see them setting up their own sort of system because this is a new kind of community it's a new way of engaging a community it's a new way of participating in a community and they have to address that so they will have to do something but discord is probably not that solution unless there's a new plan for discord i'm not aware of so i've seen them building out their own kind of community moderation building system you have said to me i feel like this is deeply controversial but maybe it's not and i just don't know enough that star trek is the most mismanaged franchise like you said in hollywood but it was a grand pronouncement about how star trek is wildly mismanaged and i think they are getting into nfts they are talk to me about what they are doing wrong as a franchise what you see them doing wrong on the nft side talking about this bode bold proclamation of yours okay yeah and i'm obviously i make no friends at paramount or viacom with or cbs with this uh statement but yes uh i think the statement is that star trek is the most mismanaged franchise in the history of hollywood and okay even bigger than i gave you credit i stand by that um and i'm i'm actually personal friends with some of the filmmakers who have worked on the movies so i i may have some tough conversations coming up but um uh and here's why star trek is just a tremendous history it's just tremendous content storytelling it's more of a television based history than a film-based history so when you talk about that home for it it probably is in the tv space but the problem that has happened with how paramount viacom cbs and these entities have shifted over the years back and forth sometimes back and forth in the same year is that it's been traded around that no one really had that long-term vision and plan there was no franchise management team to support that property at a critical time that say 2007 2006 when the last round of movies started to really think about that long-term vision and then so it got bounced around and traded between is it movies is it tv and the way that viacom was set up was that it meant it got bounced between cbs and paramount and the teams that managed it shifted in new management has different ideas and so it just got it just got bounced and that's why i think it's the most mismanaged because they've missed so many opportunities so many chances to grow that brand and franchise now in recent years they're doing a better job but it's still there's still no cohesive management of the mythology of star trek um from a long-term perspective now i am aware that they do have a franchise lead position that they're hiring for at vicon so if anyone listening to this is interested in franchise management in star trek um i do know they have a position that they've been trying to hire to be that franchise head so maybe there is a good future there but it is such a strong brand i can't it does it will come back i believe it can and will come back it feels like there is a truckee out there or many of them for whom that is like a dream role but yeah it really needs to stop and have a centralized home and that's one of the things that disney did well and this is part of how the franchise system is set up at disney is that whichever division of disney originates the property owns the property long term so hannah montana was a disney channel property the disney channel franchise team owns it and manages it across all applications forever it is so interesting to me that what you're describing is that centralization and that that's what's been lacking in this context uh i'm sure that didn't go missed by many people but i do want to flag that because i think it is interesting and it is this trade-off of centralization and then obviously the dream of decentralization but how is there coordination and what it's really maybe a better way to think of is what is the coordination layer how are you communicating and so a lot of the things that we did in my first two or three years at disney on the franchise team was to set up those coordination and communication structures just how do we talk to each other how do teams that traditionally have never even really met like meet on a weekly or monthly basis to talk about how we're going to develop the property so i think there's potential there to keep this idea as decentralization but still have a vision for the property that's that can support it long term while we're on the topic of controversial hollywood statements uh you think that sony should sell spider-man i went and saw spider-man last night it was great it's as good as people were saying i stopped my eyes out because i'm a crazy um why should sony sell spider-man another comment that's going to come back to haunt me at some point in the future yes so what i've said is that sony despite and now this is actually great context with the monster success they're seeing with the current movie should sell spider-man back to disney and so the question is part of your long-term plan to get hired at disney yeah i don't i may have just made some friends at marvel here's the logic sony does not own all the rights to spider-man they don't own it they rent it from marvel and so when they create a production this current movie let's say they invest 250 million dollars into production and marketing they are investing in someone else's property marvel is the one that ultimately benefits from the goodwill and long-term value creation of that investment now what sony gets is they get the immediate box office so and they're going to get great money back from this current release it's highly profitable probably they're going to get great revenue back but they don't own it they don't have the long term they're investing in someone else's property so what would be better for them is to sell it back to disney and now is a great time because they could sell it probably for a wild number probably more than a billion dollars and that gives them a fund to grow and develop franchises that they own that they own the publishing rights to that they own the toy rights to marvel owns the toy rates to spider-man and sony just gets a feedback for like their creative contribution and so i believe he better just to say it's almost like that and i don't think this is true but what they say that columbus got to the americas and burned his ships to motivate his crew whether that's true or not i don't know but it's that idea that sony needs to take that step make the money on spider-man that they can and take that investment and create something that they own and really can grow and become the fear future and what's happening is what's called the red queen effect they keep investing in spider-man and they keeps doing great well enough but it's not enough to get them ahead it's just enough to keep them in the same place but they're running faster and faster to stay in the same place and what's happening is their competitors are getting ahead and so collectively spider they sony slowly starts falling further behind even though they're making tons of money off of it so i think it's time for sony to say we need to either get serious into this franchise game invest in our own properties that we own or decide what else they're going to do i want you to know that all i'm hearing you say when you talk about all this is taylor swift is totally right she deserves to own her own masters it's completely unfair that she's had to work for years to build her brand only for other people to own it i'm partly kidding and i'm sure like the two audience members who are into nfts and also as into taylor swift as i am are like oh yeah i love that and everybody else is like what are you talking about um i i find this so fascinating i hope other people find it as interesting as i do like the the strategic side of managing entertainment and i think it has so much relevance for the nft space and as as we all now fancy ourselves like ip investors understanding these calculations feels deeply deeply relevant to picking good projects from an nft perspective absolutely and for the for the nft projects that have these opportunities coming to them to take their their their creations into other areas it's important to keep your eye on this that be careful of the rights that you're giving up because you might think that you've got a great opportunity in front of you right now but long term it's not it's going to work against you and so i think being mindful of those rights and what you're giving up with these deals is really important um and i think this is actually good maybe a thing with apes is that's really good is that the way that apes is structured if caa sells an apes movie to sony for instance what does sony own other what can sony owned from that like they can't own the apes because of the way the apes are structured so it's going to be very interesting as these projects come in and start developing of what are the studios going to buy what are they going to own what are they creating and how do those relationships exist and none of that's been written yet it's all going to be brand new how is hollywood thinking about viewing the blockchain nfts are they put off by this idea that you're going to have individuals who own the rights to apes is that going to stifle this industry because they're like we don't want to buy that project because we can't own it fully like are they even thinking like that yet where what is the perception as of right now traditionally i would say yes but in the modern context let's say in the streaming world context so from say 2019 forward where we've now shifted to the streaming world i'd say no i think that they are so desperate for good content good ideas that regardless of where it comes from they will find a way or try to find a way to make it work that if the apes is the amazing idea that netflix has been looking for netflix will make find a way to make a deal work or apple will find a way to make a deal work or disney will do that so i don't think that they're turned off by it at all i think that this is a whole brand new source of storytelling and content that they haven't had access to before so i think they're probably thrilled i am certain that probably in every every production team in town in la probably has someone looking at the nft space for projects i am certain of that obviously to me one of the benefits if you are a streaming platform or any content producer right now is that you have a built-in die-hard audience that wants to see their project succeed if you put together a dead fellas movie there's a built-in audience there that is going to be a marketing arm for you that's going to go out on twitter on social media and hype the hell out of that project i'm assuming that's part of the calculation but i'm curious is it really big enough yet for that to be exciting to them at the end of the day there are 5 000 dead fellow holders or how many there however many there are there are 5 000 apes holders that's not really a a scary army if you're these these massive streaming platforms at this point yeah for those of us in the nft space it seems like just there's so much dialogue and volume in discourse around say apes or punks or dead fellas that god everyone in the world has to be excited about this right and the reality is how many people are in blockchain probably 10 million i think is the estimate i've seen and how many are not all of those people are on nfcs yeah yeah you say three million so you're talking the early early early adopters so yeah you're not going to have that mass volume of cont of of discourse that would say dead fellas fans are going to drive this movie um so that would definitely be in the consideration so they're gonna have to build on the film side or tv show side marketing to drive that audience um so you're right they're not gonna choose a project based on oh it's coming with a built-in audience that we can leverage like the harry potter book was great because it had millions tens of millions hundreds of millions of people who loved those books right when they made those movies and they came over to the movies they were able to convert them that doesn't exist in nfts yet and it's not going to exist in nfts for probably a decade until there's hundreds of millions of people on the blockchain and so these projects will have to succeed based on the core idea is dead fellas just an amazing idea that translates well and has a mythology that can be told in a tv show or a film or a publishing project does woody's have that so that's what's going to be what has to drive it is that core idea of the of the world and the story and the characters so this is so interesting because as this circles us back to the very beginning of this conversation when you said blockchain and nfts will stand shoulder to shoulder with tv and film the the red flag that comes up for me or the skepticism that i feel is around the fact that what people do fall in love with it feels like is stories and that was part of that question i asked around like does it have to be a story right a picture of harry potter even a cool nft picture of harry potter is gonna elicit very little in me whereas the books i you know literally could cry thinking about them because i love them so much right so what you're describing it sounds like is most of this will be there'll be nft projects that do create lore that aren't necessarily published books they're you know written out on a desk somewhere and that'll be what spurs this but that there is a potential or i guess it's a question there is a potential where when there are enough people native to the blockchain and on there you maybe have a property like a hello kitty which you've actually given that example to me before where it just starts as a i think it just starts as like a character or a visual that people fall in love with and there's enough love for that for some reason that it spurs everything else yep is that fair yeah i think that's very fair and killer kitty is a great example and that starts off as a piece of art and it just becomes a cultural phenomenon that just drives all kinds of other opportunities and yeah they then grow into stories so i do think that there is potential for nft projects just based on the value of the art and the uniqueness of the art and the direction to then inspire bigger things and more things so i do think that that's very possible the two big questions i feel like we've all been waiting for the first one i would love to know if there are artists that aren't currently in the nft space that you think absolutely should be or project creators or who who should be entering nfts that isn't in it currently yeah there's a designer who i've worked with in the past named nick yarger he was from he now lives in the pacific northwest he's from southern california he was the creative director at billabong and quicksilver i think he worked for tony hawk as his head of creative for a while he worked with shepherd fairy for a while and has this amazing art style that's driven by inspired by tattoo art and the southern california beach skate scene and i think there's just a tremendous future for him in nfts and i've tried to encourage him to like get in get into this so now we'll publicly encourage him you'll send me a link to his site or something his twitter and we'll post it as part of the show notes so but he makes his living day-to-day as uh working for he has actually just founded his own ad agency so he's doing graphic design as an ad agency but he can easily transfer over there's another um poster artist who i love named neil williams who he's a gig poster artist he does rock and roll posters foo fighters black keys are some of his clients so when you think of the poster art that gig art neil williams has done a lot of really top bands and has just a really unique style that i think is really really cool and fun and i would love to see him get into the space something i've said on this podcast before and that i've actually said to friends of mine and i'm curious if you're gonna agree with what i am about to say i think you will is that there is we need more writers in the blockchain in the nft space and i think because the outside world thinks these are just jpegs and they're just like visual and it's just art a lot of people don't realize that what the vast majority of these projects are going to need to stay relevant long term are stories or good stories which means writers i am so i'm this is a i guess a shout out to all the writers out there if you're already listening to this podcast you probably don't need to hear this but tell your writer friends to start looking into the blockchain because all of these projects need people to write stories for them most of them do not have writers on staff agree with that statement john 100 and 500 000 i've seen so many projects struggling on the writing side and looking for writers you look in other web pages and you can see if you know a writer please send them our way and absolutely writers is where we really need a lot more creative contribution to the blockchain it's definitely the next kind of big push that has to happen okay so you have seen and in some cases overseen some of the biggest most profitable franchise intellectual properties in the world what are the projects that you're eyeing in the nft space right now that you think have the potential to become those next major ip franchises i wouldn't put it the way i've become the next major ip franchise but what projects do i really am am i inspired by what do i like about the team that just has a great feel a great idea now they might not become the biggest projects ever but i just think there's great team there and that team will go on to either build something great or do the next thing that would be great and couple of dead fellas certainly is very inspiring i i love what the dead fellas teams are doing the woodies i think woody's have a really good view of just a long-term slow build project perspective that this isn't a pump and dump or this is a very drawn out slow term they've been very thoughtful about it i love savage droids i'm an investor in savage droids which is one of the block block projects just because of the deflationary aspect of it i think there's just some really great thinking that's gone into that and it's another project i admire i've obviously invested in that project i like grim syndicate which is on the solana chain and it's really more just from the art style i just love the art style of grim syndicate in a project i'm eyeing right now i don't know much about the project itself but the artist behind it is someone i've actually been following in the real world for some time and it's his first move into the nft space and the project is called crypto monster lab i think it's going to launch here actually in about a month so maybe it's a hot tip take a look at crypto monster lab but the artist is a peruvian artist named santiago usada and i've actually worked with santiago we commissioned some work from him in a prior job that i had and so i've just been a huge fan of santiago's work it's like this very approachable friendly wood cut style and i think it's a very kind of it's the kind of it's the kind of nft that you're going to give to your child so i've set up an nft wallet for my daughter and when i see art that i just think that she loves or i love that speaks to one of us i'll buy her an nft and put it in her wallet and when she turns 18 she can go off to college or wherever with her nft wallet and i think santiago's work is just perfect for that i love it we will link to all of those below my grandmother when i was born started giving me disney stock for every birthday etc which you can imagine as a kid you're like what the heck is this crap i want a toy and of course now as an adult i am so grateful for and and disney's done very well for me so i appreciate that um i don't have like i don't have like a ton of disney money that sounds like i'm a trust fund kid i'm very much not but yeah my my daughter's and my daughter's nft collection is bigger than mine right now oh that's awesome i keep seeing projects i just love for her like unicorns or skull bunnies and i just throw them in her nft wallet so i love that idea cool cats actually flagged out when i interviewed klon who's the artist for cool cats and he said one of the earliest ways they resonated with people were families who felt like they could they could actually involve their kids in the cool cats project and that pride or them you know board apes isn't necessarily accessible to a kid to some extent that you know there's usually mature themes with some of these projects and so that was a way they felt like they were able to differentiate was that family-friendly aspect yeah my daughter will just sit here with me as we're looking through different nfts and she'll say i like that i like that and depending upon how old is she uh she's six she's in first grade so depending upon gas fees i'll i'll add it to her wallet and that's actually one of the great things about l2s i think that's going to help is that you know it's hard to buy a 100 nft and then pay 150 dollars in gas fees but we're trying to i've been trying to bridge now these i'm like trying to hop from l ones to l twos and i'm like this is expensive too you know like i'm like it's getting it you know it all it all is expensive right now but i don't know bigger bigger brains than mine are working on how to limit that so i'm optimistic we'll get there well this has been awesome john i honestly i'm i'm sure we'll have you back at some point maybe to even do a deeper dive on l2's because i know you're doing work on that side of things as well and is there anything you want to close with anything you feel like we didn't get to talk about advice for people who are either building a project that are trying to you know create lasting ip or investing in it or just anything in general you think that should be said that we we haven't covered you know i think just that i think we're all in this beginning is still the very early stages let's all support one another and try to build great things and just the future's going to be awesome if anyone wants to get in touch and has any questions i'm happy to within certain limits them some free advice or consulting if they really care about kind of ip and nfts and cool well thank you so much john again this is great and i really appreciate you hopping on and spelling this out for us and again we'll we'll check in again as this whole space is evolving and see see if it plays out as as you at least or sort of both of us imagine yeah great i'm excited to come back [Music] hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now
