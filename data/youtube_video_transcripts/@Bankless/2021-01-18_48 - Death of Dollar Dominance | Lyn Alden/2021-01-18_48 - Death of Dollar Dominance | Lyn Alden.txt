[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this was a fantastic episode with lynn alden what were your takeaways yeah lynn alden has just been the rising star i would say of the second half of 2019 and get definitely going strong into 2020. she said she got uh got notoriety when she started talking positively on b about bitcoin on macro podcasts and that the the feedback she would get when she would talk about bitcoin and micro podcast was way stronger than this the typical feedback as you would imagine bitcoiners tend to be like that and so she has just gone around the gamut with uh just producing content that is very macro focused using bitcoin as a frame and positioning bitcoin into the macro context we actually got her on a pod got her attention when we were talking to her about she had some questions about ethereum and kind of how nodes work and centralization questions kind of the typical questions that you get if you uh find yourself inside of bitcoin circles and that actually that conversation led to this conversation here on the bankless podcast we do touch on that subject at the very end but something that we have in common on the bankless podcast with lynn alden is discussions uh about the concept of the fourth turning or peoples and societies just perception shifts or some sort of crisis event where people choose to just perceive value elsewhere and access order in the world from uh somewhere else that's from their previous institutions lynn alden is privy to that conversation and she speaks uh in in similar terms with the fourth turning as with ray dalio's long-term debt cycles and so we get into that conversation with her about how this money foundation is shifting beneath people's feet and that is creating a tumultuous societal environment in this present moment that was my big takeaway ryan what about what about you well yeah i just think the listeners if you guys are interested in trying to figure out how to position yourself for the next decade both in terms of investing but in terms of kind of life and in terms of crypto this is definitely the episode to listen to glenn has a fantastic mental model that i think will prove to have predictive qualities for it uh and i also think david was really good to discuss with lynn sort of the the ethereum uh perspective as well we kind of you know challenge uh some of her ideas on ether as nasa and d5 so make sure you guys listen to the end and if you want a full debrief of our after the podcast conversation just with david and i where we talk about the episode that was and we dumped sort of our thoughts out that is available for full subscribers on the bankless premium feed we will include a link in the show notes to that if you are a bankless premium feed subscriber david i've been enjoying these debriefs it's it's kind of good what's your take on them yeah it's been pretty fun because we would have these debriefs anyways after the podcast as soon as the podcast was over like we would hop into a discord calls discord has a great calling feature by the way and we would just talk about the podcast for for 20 30 minutes and then we realized that people really want those conversations and so those are some of the conversations where you know not only did i learn a ton in the actual podcast recording with the guests that we had on but i also learned uh a lot with the discussion with you about how to you know integrate that into you know other theses that we have like the bankless theses the the the triple point asset thesis depending on whatever the subject matter is so that's actually where a lot of learning happens for me as well and i'm i'm pretty happy that we were figuring out a way to share this with the banker the bankers oh gotta cut that out the bankless full subscribers yeah just like you guys we are figuring this out as we go i uh commented recently on twitter this very much of what we do with like kind of education around cryptos like sort of like three-year-olds teaching two-year-olds like we're all just figuring this stuff out as we go um so this conversation with lin is a key part of that and before we get to that conversation with lynn we want to tell you about our fantastic sponsors ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today bankless nation i want to welcome lynn alden to the show of lynn alden investment strategy she's quickly rosen risen to fame in the bitcoin universe for some sharp analysis on long-term macro trends and she's got a ton of data to back up her analysis her her blog is one of my favorite places to hang out to understand macro and economic trends and because global macro events have such a strong interplay with crypto we wanted to bring lynn on to help us understand the big picture here lynn welcome to bankless how are you doing today hey i'm good thanks for having me lynn some people thought that our financial system sat atop a house of cards before covid hit so our first question to you is is our is our global financial system in a precarious position right now uh in a sense i mean it depends on what part you're looking at i would say it was in a more precarious position right back before the great financial crisis uh and that's where we saw a lot of the kind of the internal bailouts happening there uh because if you look at for example uh you know how much bank reserves you know banks had relative to their liabilities uh that's actually you know when they hit an all-time low since then they've been a lot higher uh so it's kind of like the core banking system's already been built out uh but now we have kind of a more broad kind of social issue wealth concentration high debt levels all sorts of things like that and so in many ways what happened uh you know about 12 years ago mirrored a lot what happened in the early 1930s uh after the you know the famous 1929 crash uh whereas kind of the environment we're going in now uh looks a lot more like 1940s you know hopefully without you know the war that they had uh but the basically in terms of a physical environment like a massive kind of spending environment and kind of a broader bailout of society and that so so that kind of one-two punch uh kind of a private debt bubble and banking crisis followed by like a public uh debt bubble and you know that tends to be more inflationary but then aside from that we also have for example the way the global monetary system is constructed that's a whole nother beast entirely and so you know if you go back you know before 19 1944 you had you know a variety of different gold standards uh and then from 1944 to 1971 you had the bretton woods system that eventually broke down uh in the late 60s and it kind of officially broke in 1971 and then since then we've been on the petra dollar system and signs are starting to show that the petro dollar system's starting to you know basically fall apart as well uh and so that's somewhat different than the debt problem uh but you know it's all kind of comes to a head probably here you know over the next 10 years as we sort some of this out so does that mean to say that you actually thought that the financial system was more precarious before the 08 crisis and the 08 crisis reset ourselves to to some degree and we're actually perhaps in a better place than we were pre 2008 i think it depends on which part of the system you're looking at and so for example in terms of the way the global monetary system is constructed so uh you know the whole way that the international countries do trade with each other and what currency they use that's in a worse state than it was 12 years ago however if you look at for example the domestic u.s banking system it's more capitalized than it was back then and it's because it basically imploded about 12 years ago and due to those bailouts it's at a much higher level of capitalization now and so by that particular metric uh it's far less fragile and that's why for example in this crisis despite the fact that this was a much bigger economic impact we haven't seen a lot of bank failures like we saw back then because that was specifically a banking failure whereas this is a broader uh solvency issue so it really depends on what what aspect you're looking at this broader solvency issue that you're talking about where we start to get into kind of like what is money and reserve currency status and that sort of thing is it just a harder problem to solve like more difficult than what we faced in 2008 uh yeah i think so because you know what we faced in 2008 uh basically there was a handful of actors that could be billed out and of course there are all sorts of issues like that we saw occupy wall street and other sort of kind of push back against that because you know you had people lose their homes and they you know they did generally didn't get bailed out but then you had the banks that you know were going to lose their homes but they they're the ones that often got build-outs and so but in terms of basically how they capitalize the system uh that's the easier problem to fix uh whereas how to uh you know basically restructure society is a much harder problem and if you go you know if you go back in history uh you know after you get the banking crisis that later part actually tends to be the hardest part and so that's kind of where we are in the cycle and it you know it feels a lot different so a lot of people you know they fight the last battle so that you know they always think that the next recession is going to end up being like the previous one before it uh but it ends up being you know basically imploding from another area and so rather than having another banking crisis this time we had you know a much different area was impacted it was the it was not the you know the leverage in the bank system that was the issue it was some of these other broader trends so so many people and perhaps we could call them doomers um if if some people would call them dumers think that uh there was going to be some sort of event uh pre again pre-covered that would destabilize the global financial system and it doesn't matter what that event was and it was going to create this a financial crisis no matter what the actual pre-crisis was and so now with kovid we are seeing that there there is a health crisis yet the uh the vaccine is starting to be rolled out uh it kind of feels like we're maybe in the sixth or seventh inning of a health crisis yet some um some of these people some of these doomers might say that we are actually just in the beginning of a of a long-term financial crisis and maybe you don't feel so strongly about maybe the the crisis word but i i have read some of your writing that you do believe that we are in a very transition phase a phase change the transition uh period where we are going from uh one one spot to to the next what are you seeing ahead of us that we are transitioning into and what are the kind of the the macro forces behind that transition yeah so i i think you know kind of the main crux of it is that in the 2020s i expect a significant currency devaluation uh because we're at the point now where uh you know you know if you look back for example in the 90s you know they they you had the implosion of long-term capital management you know basically you had you know systemic issues among hedge funds and they basically had a bailout of that you kind of kicked it up a level then you had the equity bubble uh in the late 90s right after that uh and of course when that you know imploded they they cut interest rates and they kind of kicked that up to the housing level uh and then when that all blew up uh that's when they they they transferred the leverage to the the sovereign level and so at that point doesn't really have any further to go other than a currency devaluation and so that's generally what you see at this stage in the cycle and there's a couple ways to accomplish that i mean they you know basically they can run massive fiscal deficits the central bank buys a lot of the bonds to finance those deficits and then if interest rates try to rise to compensate for any inflation that can happen they can potentially lock yields below the inflation rate and even right now for example at the treasury markets you know pricing in two percent inflation uh but the yields are like one percent and so you anyone holding treasuries is currently you know slowly losing purchasing power and of course there's different ways to measure inflation so it could be faster than that so and that was somewhat different than we saw back in the 2010s decade that was a more disinflationary decade because you didn't see a broadening you didn't see a rapid increase in the broad money supply instead you saw a rapid increase in bank reserves which are more about capitalizing the bank system under the surface uh whereas now you're seeing it at a you know broad money supply so the amount of currency and circulation the amount of currency that people hold and you know in deposits and banks that's all rising rapidly which is a somewhat more inflationary outcome uh but of course we also have this big deflationary shock in the form of people you know they're not traveling they're not spending on things and so you know we're kind of held up in our homes right now still to some extent uh but you know as you look out you know deeper in the 2020s we kind of have our the situation now where we have structural fiscal deficits in many places in the world and high sovereign debts uh they can't support positive real yields and so people all around the world have a store value problem uh and then there's there's deeper issues for some emerging markets and you know you know the way that energy priced around the world uh because we have kind of these dynamics of of the global reserve you know petrodollar system that's starting to kind of have issues around the corner and the main issue there is that for example all these foreign countries have dollar dominant debts uh and that so whenever they can't get dollars you have a problem uh but in addition the u.s banking system uh you know even though they were well capitalized uh they ran into issues back in 2019 uh because they were such an oversupply of u.s treasuries they're basically forced to buy and so i think if you look at say doom and gloomers they're always talking about a crisis around the corner i think one of the key things you have to take into account policy response that happens and so for example you know some of the more sophisticated analysts say here's a problem and that's why we expect a response to happen and so for example uh there were starting to be a lot of uh signs of financial stress under the surface in the u.s banking system in 2019 and that eventually manifested itself with a spike in the repo rate in in september 2019 and for people that don't know what that means that's basically an overnight lending rate between banks and it just kind of sprung a leak and literally tripled overnight and so the federal reserve had to come in they ended quantitative tightening and they started doing quantitative easing and basically expanding their balance sheet again to push that leak back down and then of course in early 2020 we had a much bigger issue and if you look at you know of course we had all the coverage stuff we had the shutdown we had this you know massive thing happening but for people that were following bank liquidity uh you know following kind of you know some of the financial markets you know behind the stock market the actual kind of debt markets and stuff uh what you had happened was you had to scramble for foreigners to get dollars to service their dollar dominant debts and in order to get those many of them had to sell treasuries right so you have foreign exchange reserves all around the world that hold treasuries and so they started selling some treasuries in order to get dollars but that rendered the entire u.s treasury market illiquid and so the federal reserve had to come in and buy a trillion dollars worth of treasuries in three weeks and basically reliquify it and so you can read all the the federal reserve like meeting minutes i mean they had emergency meetings to try to you know stop this and i think i just basically think that one of the main issues that people have in terms of doom and gloom is that you always have to take an account the policy response so that basically left unaddressed was a doom and gloom scenario but they have taken account what happens when it's printed trillion dollars and that that opens up of course its own set of issues uh but it's not the initial crash it's what it's what happens later and that's why whenever you have these kind of deflationary debt-based shocks instead what you know instead of all kind of unraveling like a house of cards usually you get an inflationary response and then it usually kind of grinds itself out through inflation you know later in time so so lynn i i want to jump in here because so your prediction when david asked about what are the 2020s going to be like you use this term currency devaluation and then you made the the apt point that everyone always thinks the next crisis is going to be similar to the last crisis that they lived through or even the one before and the trouble with something like currency devaluation is we all know all listeners like they felt 2008 at some level right you know most of their kids are like a little bit older but i'm i'm guessing the vast majority maybe 95 of our listeners today lin they have no idea what the 1940s felt like right and the type of currency devaluation that you're talking about um you like in a bit more to the 1940s rather than kind of the 2010s or maybe even the the 1970s can you paint a picture for us of what you expect in this term currency devaluation in the 2020s what you actually expect that means for i guess ordinary people living and investing and trying to save money in this world what were the 1940s like that are going to be similar to the 2020s yeah sure so if you look at you know over the past century the united states has had three uh inflationary decades uh or two of them so far and you know potentially but like like moving into a third one here uh so if you look at the 1940s uh you know they'd just come out of the great depression right so you had yeah this big kind of deflationary impact uh but going into that you know in the 1930s there's a big private debt bubble and that all unraveled there's there's far more debt there's business debt there's financial leverage and a lot of that unraveled it was a big deflationary shock uh so what the what the you know the united states government did was they devalued the dollar relative to gold so you know the dollar was backed by gold and they changed it so it was backed you know like uh you know one dollar is worth less gold and that helped the banking system recapitalize uh because they hold gold as reserves and they you know a lot of their liabilities were dollars and so if you if you change that that ratio for how those work suddenly they have more dollars worth of reserves because their gold reserves are worth more dollars and so that was a you know a devaluation but it wasn't very inflationary because again that was mostly with inside the banking system and so all that did was kind of undo a deflationary spiral it wasn't until the 1940s that you saw actual inflation and that was because the u.s government started to run massive deficits like you know 15 20 25 deficits a year uh and because there's so much treasuries issued to fund those deficits the public couldn't buy them all so you had the federal reserve basically print money by treasuries and because sovereign debt was so high so federal government debt was over 100 of gdp uh you know when he started to see inflation they couldn't raise rates because it would just it would you know would render the us government solvent because when you're running when you have 100 debt to gdp and you're running 20 deficits you can't have high interest rates on that and so they just said no no we're going to lock yields at 2.5 or less and we're going to buy any treasury we need to in order to maintain that peg so you had inflation going to the double digits even as interest rates stayed at 2.5 percent and so anyone holding cash or treasuries uh you know you got all your money back nominally no one defaulted on you if you were holding that safe paper but you lost purchasing power compared to commodities so so let's talk about that for a minute because like i said none of our listeners have lived through that right so um like t-bills are a safe bet right now that's kind of common common knowledge but what you're saying in the 1940s is they were not a safe bet you could end the 1940s by storing all of your value in u.s t-bills essentially and have a lot less value than when you started the decade what was the move to make in the in the 1930s and in the 1940s as kind of an investor that's just trying to to store wealth and store value through those decades who were the winners and the losers uh so most of the moves to make back then would have been basically to buy equities or to buy commodities and that's because of course throughout the 1930s equities were very cheap because you know growth was slow everyone was pessimistic and when you're you're fighting a war not many people are buying equities and so they are very cheap there and so is basically the right move was to buy equities by commodities because those were all in demand and as the war kind of went on you had of course you first you had commodities spike in in price and as the war ended the the stocks did very well and so the worst move to make was basically to hold money in the bank uh or to hold treasuries uh because even though you did get all your money back there was no nominal risk it's not like that the us treasury defaulted it's just that you know you got all your dollars back but at the end of the decade they lost roughly a third of their purchasing powers you could buy about one third less of a home you could buy a third of the amount of copper you could buy what you know there's different ways to measure it some things are more or less uh but overall is about a third of your purchasing power which you know over a decade is terrible i mean over a decade you expect to grow your purchasing power uh but without you know with those kind of paper investments instead lost about a third of it and you think lin something like that could happen in the 2020s so i have a thousand dollars and i want to store my wealth for the decade at the end of my decade my nominal value may be maybe higher but my actual purchasing power might be 70 percent might be 700 rather than a thousand at the end of the 2020s you think something similar could happen i think potentially i mean even if you look at over the past uh decade if you held for example t-bill so the short end of the treasury curve you lost a few percent of your purchasing power compared to cpi or compared to assets like you can buy a little bit less house you can buy less you know of apple you know apple's market cap whatever the case may be you basically can buy less stuff than you used to the one thing you might be able to buy more of is certain commodities like oil for example because you've been in a commodity bear market but you know in terms of official cpi which of course has its own flaws you can buy less stuff with your thousand dollars held in t-bills because it just failed to keep up with inflation but of course that was a very it's a very small loss it wasn't a very large loss now in the 20 in the 2020s i do think it could be more significant i think at the very least you're going to get another one of those decades of just you know gradually losing purchasing power and it's possible like that you can get more like 1940s or the 70s and you know in terms of losing 10 25 maybe more lynn i think it could be really helpful to take a pause pause for a moment and define different types of inflation for our listeners because they're when we people say inflation they end up in perhaps an argument that it's more of a semantic argument rather than a fact-based one maybe you could uh for our listeners give us your mental models about how you can define inflation in different ways and in what ways are those definitions useful yeah so there's one core way and then it can manifest manifest itself in two ways and so the core way is an increase in the in the broad money supply and that's basically that there's just more and more dollars out in the system uh and so you know in the 1940s and 70s the two inflationary decades you saw a big increase in the money supply and you know in the past few years again you've seen another big increase in the money supply and that's why i think we're leading up to a more inflationary decade now where that inflation manifests uh can vary based on what the fiscal policies are what the you know the the kind of economic environment is uh and so if it man itself manifests itself in consumer prices or commodities that's when you get what is kind of more commonly thought of as inflation and that usually comes about because you have some sort of commodity shortage or you have rapidly rising wages there are a couple of different ways that can happen uh and so the 1940s it happened due to very large fiscal deficits that were monetized to fight the war uh in the 1970s it happened because you had the dollar go off the gold standard and then you had oil you know oil scarcity because opec was squeezing us and so you had that issue there and so the other way it can manifest is in asset prices and so if you don't have uh commodity shortages and you don't have rising wages we still have an increase in the money supply then sw has is that the money supply the money velocity decreases and that money kind of just pours into financial assets so stocks uh houses gold uh all these you know late you know in this decade cryptocurrencies uh all these different kind of anything that's kind of somewhat scarce so it could be fine art it could be wine it could be classic cars all those things go up dramatically in price and so for example if you look at the the price of a super bowl ticket uh you know the past 20 years that's gone up dramatically even though it's the same venue and it's the same you know sporting event uh but because it's a scarcity and so anything that's really scarce uh that will go up uh even though you won't have say increases in you know the cost of bread or the cost of copper something like that so we've had we've had um over the past decade we've had um definitely this asset price inflation we've not seen the the cpi related consumer price index related inflation uh that you talked about and we've absolutely seen the monetary supply inflation we can include some links to to some graphics in the show notes particularly with with kovid but i would say lynn that um it seems like the investing world in the financial world is not blind to this necessarily but it is probably a common belief that if you want to um like hold value during this asset price inflation you could buy things like real estate or you can buy things like uh equities and stocks um i i heard you keep making the the case with the 2020s like the the 1940s of things like that are scarce things like commodities right those aren't necessarily equities those aren't maybe it's maybe it's real estate to some level but do you think that that that paradigm that i think is is probably a common belief that hey if what you say it's true the 2020s are going to hold a lot more currency devaluation um that inflation will manifest itself in asset prices so i better hold a whole bunch of stocks essentially and and real estate right that seems to be what wall street's thinking anyway do you think it'll play out like that and did it play out that way in the 1940s i think it'll play a little bit different and so for example if you look at the 1940s like i said before the benefit the stocks had was they weighed into that decade at very low valuations and so when you had an increase in the money supply and you had their earnings go up you had a lot of room for those stocks to go up in value and you know whereas if you look in the 1970s for example stocks went into that decade at very high valuations and so when you had inflation you had rising interest rates which was different than 1940s because in the 70s debt was low and they were they were able to rise uh interest rates to fight inflation and that's that's a killer for stock valuation so that you know stock valuations went near record lows uh so in this period we're of course entering this with extraordinarily high stock valuations uh real estate's more mixed i mean if you look at for example a penthouse in manhattan it's very expensive but the you know residential house in many areas is not particularly expensive so it's kind of a mixed bag there i think kind of if you go forward uh looking at commodities that's that's kind of a more kind of high probability bet on inflation uh and then you know same thing with digital assets and things like that whereas i think some of those traditional assets uh they're they're far less certain you also have to kind of break it down by sector or geography so so we've had a very kind of a sharp period of u.s equity outperformance compared to the rest of the world and particularly growth stocks and that's because you've been in this kind of disinflationary environment but if you have that reverse you start to have kind of more money flowing to say the working class or middle class maybe green new deal whatever the case may be starting an actual increase in cpi inflation that's when you would generally see value stock outperformance compared to some of these growth stock outperformance and that's of course that's what you also saw in the 1940s and 70s if you look at under the surface what the index was doing you saw that kind of rotation happening and so i would expect to see more international equity outperformance and value outperformance in this decade which would be the opposite of what happened in 19 in the 2010s it's kind of interesting because what you're saying is like um people thought that this that what you're saying was going to play out actually in like 2009 2010 you know with uh broad currency devaluation gold price shot up and it didn't play out that way why is this time different uh so a lot of it's because the broad money supply is going up this time and so back then bank reserves went up uh but not broad money supply so if you look at broad money supply it didn't really change if you look at you know where it was in 2006 where it was in 2007 8 9 10 11 there wasn't a big change you just kind of kept going up on this normal trend instead the bank reserves are going up underneath the surface which just recapitalized the banks what we're seeing now is is that you're in addition to seeing quantitative easing you're seeing the federal government hand out checks to people they deposit them in the bank and you basically get a rise in the broader money supply uh combined with the fact that you know back then we're at the kind of the peak of a commodity cycle so we were kind of had we were in a period of oversupply for commodities whereas you know outside of oil and gas we haven't had a lot of kind of commodity production uh come online in the past several years and so we're looking at potentially more scarcity for things like copper uranium all these kind of other commodities that are important for key industries uh so i think that 2020s could be more of a you know combined with broad money supply and some degree of commodity scarcity

one of my favorite topics in the crypto industry is and i think almost everyone talks about this especially bitcoiners is that the the powers that be mainly the federal reserve but then also fiscal policy from uh from congress is going to be forced into a corner to issue new currency and i want to turn the conversation to uh the the triffin dilemma and the relationship between the us dollar and the petro dollar and why why we almost are forced into a corner to issue new currency and i'm hoping you could frame this conversation in a way that um connects manufacturing inside the united states to the relationship between the primacy of the dollar as the the reserve asset of the world yeah so if you go back to the bretton woods system uh there are a bunch of economists that point out in the beginning that that system would fail uh it just because of its own kind of instability and so the way that system worked was that the united states dollar was backed by gold and all other currencies in the world or most of them were you know pegged themselves to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate the problem is that over time uh you know the united states increased the amount of you know treasure dollars in circulation they increased their treasuries uh but they didn't increase their gold reserves and they actually drew down gold reserves as people redeemed their dollar for gold and so the time you got into the late 60s you started to see a period where um you know gold was lower uh and dollar you know dollars liabilities were much higher and you know the international community started to realize that and they said okay we want to take the gold and eventually you know nixon had to go off the gold standard because it would have just drained all the gold reserves and so that system was just inherently unstable now in the petrodollar system we've kind of moved the instability to another area and so the dollar is not backed by gold anymore but instead it's kind of indirectly backed by oil and the way that works is because in the early 70s you had that chaotic period of all these all these currencies were floating exchange rates a big mess no nothing was backed by anything and the united states made a deal with saudi arabia and the rest of opec and said okay we'll provide military protection we can do trade deals but you need to price your oil only in dollars so whether we're buying it whether europe's buying it whether japan's buying it whoever's buying it only sell to them in dollars and so that makes it so that those other countries if they want to buy oil they need dollars and so either they can sell their products and services and dollars so they get dollars and buy energy or they can exchange their currencies four dollars so essentially the the world the us in one one stroke made us dollars the unit of exchange for the world and they used that leverage of the might of the u.s military to get that done yes right to protect oil exports yeah but then like the bretton woods system that had kind of a fundamental flaw within the system and so that makes it so that the whole world needs dollars everybody needs dollars uh now if you look at most countries uh they you know if their currency gets too strong it makes it so that their their imports are you know they have really good importing power but their exports become less competitive they start to get they start to get a trade deficit and eventually what happens is they have some sort of financial crisis recession whatever the case may be and they usually end up having a significant currency devaluation and that makes their egg you know it's really painful when it happens uh but then it makes their exports more competitive and it makes their imports uh you know weaker they they can't import as much and it kind of forces them to self-correct so in order to in order to keep the dollar stabilized we need to continue to issue new dollars because of how much global demand there is for dollars because it's denominated for oil purchases for gas purchases but then that means that because the us needs to export dollars it's making big purchases of the same goods and products that are made inside of america it's purchasing those things from external to america so that it can export those dollars to keep that dollar price down which is actually harmful for local domestic u.s industries because as a result of needing to export dollars we've kind of neglected our own industry is that the right take yeah basically it's forced us into a position where we have a structural 50-year trade deficit and so the dollar never weakens enough uh to make our import export balance uh more appropriate and so our our manufacturing capabilities are always kind of uncompetitive compared to the rest of the world and so you know to some extent you've had that happen to many developed markets to emerging markets uh but for example if you look at germany if you look at japan uh they they have current account surpluses i mean they're still able to sell a ton uh because they don't have the same issues the united states has with this manufacturing base and so you know unlike europe unlike japan unlike china we've basically exported a lot a large portion of our industrial base uh to the rest of the world and it's starting to hit ahead that's why we're seeing more rising populism things like that it's so interesting here because like people would say and i think rightly so that the us having its dollar as the world reserve currency is its superpower but you're you're saying at the same time it's it's also it's kryptonite yeah i think you know one way i phrased it you know because people often describe it as an exorbitant privilege and in the 1970s it was i mean we were in a cold war with soviet union we wanted to have as much international leverage as we could uh and but then it you know focus on who wins and who loses so if you're united states and you if you work in finance healthcare technology or government you don't really get any of the side effects you don't really get any of the downsides but you get all the upsides of of living in the hegemon of having a strong dollar uh you know you basically all upside little downside however if you if you work in manufacturing uh and some other fields uh you know you either lost your job or your wages went flat for like a decade because you're always at risk of being outsourced to china or mexico uh and so sure some things got cheaper for you because they're made in china but also your wages suffered uh and so we've had that kind of separation between you know people that work you know in either like higher margin industries or you know or you know financials and things like that versus people that make physical things we've had that really kind of a gap and so i think a lot of people that are in that other group uh you know are more oblivious to some of the stuff that's happening to people that have been more affected lynn i was a big follower of andrew yang in this election season and andrew yang ran on a platform saying that donald trump got elected by answering to the needs of the people who worked in manufacturing jobs in the midwest and he would go through just this stump speech of you know these states like pennsylvania wisconsin just all these big manufacturing towns that overwhelmingly went for donald trump because they lost their manufacturing jobs now when you when we talk about the the petro dollar and the need to export our dollars in order and at the same time neglecting our own manufacturing my brain goes to the fact that the the primacy of the dollar is actually the ins it was one of the main incentives behind putting donald trump into into office do you accept that connection i think so and actually if you look at for example some of the states that flipped right so trump's uh victory was a surprise for a lot of people but for example some of the you know the midwest states that are that are somewhat more traditionally blue a couple of them are swing states uh a bunch of them went red which surprised a lot of people uh but that's actually the hardest hit region uh by this this whole uh you know problem and yeah i think trump spoke to them in a way uh that many other politicians were were avoiding and the way of course it worked out over the next four years is actually the trade deficit got bigger uh and so none of the actual kind of court issues were addressed uh but at least they were spoken to and people heard that and and therefore you know it it it gave them hope you know that maybe the system's starting to turn and i think that there were already some uh kind of gear starting to change you know we started to see rising populism in a couple different forms so you saw you know you saw the tea party you saw occupy wall street uh we had the rise of trump uh on the you know the democratic side you had the rise of bernie sanders compared to some of the establishment politicians uh and so we started to see that you know there's because populism isn't just right or left there's multiple types of populism and i would even argue that the cryptocurrency is kind of a techno populism it's busy people rising up against the established system and saying we want self-sovereignty we want privacy we want to just go go our own way and so this you know there's there's you know ways that are more sophisticated than others uh and different political persuasions but they're all forms of populism pushing against you know the established system that is no longer working for a lot of people so let's make this connection how how does the relationship between the petro dollar and wealth in the wealthy inequality in the united states how did the how are those things connected yeah so as i said before basically it makes it so that the united states never closes this trade gap in a way that most other countries do so in most countries if their trade deficit gets too wide some sort of crisis ends up devaluing their currency and kind of self-fixing that however the united states because there's kind of all this external persistent demand for the dollar it never kind of realigns uh consumption and production and so we always have this persistent trade deficit and so you know for literally 50 years straight ever since the early 70s we pretty much every single year have a trade deficit and it's the most part gotten worse and worse uh and so that's put a disproportionate pressure on our you know manufacturing workers uh both skilled and you know lesser skilled workers across the across the you know kind of the spectrum there uh but however if you work in technology if you work in finance government health care things that weren't outsourced as much uh then you benefited uh then of course there's always fiscal policies like you know who you're taxing uh you know united states is the highest care per capita spending in the world so that that hurts a lot of small businesses that hurts a lot of people that have to pay their own health care uh things like that so moving forward into the 20 20 decades we've talked about the the perhaps the perceived likelihood of further dollar devaluation and aligned with that i think also comes with an assumption of increased asset prices because devalued dollar means that higher asset prices how do you think that this is going to impact social social dynamics moving forward into the 2020s decade because not only is are we talking about the removal of you know stable manufacturing jobs but we're also talking about um you know if things are inflating away and amazon stock goes you know 3x over the next year yet the average wage of the american individual is roughly around 60 000 well they're making the same nominally but they can access you know one third of the size of the american economy that they previously did like how are you perceiving changes in the u.s dollar with social dynamics moving into the next decade uh so in inflationary decades normally growth stocks don't do very well it's it's you start you know you don't see at you don't see price appreciation across the board now if you have extreme inflation like if you have argentina level inflation uh then yes every stock is going up dramatically because if you're getting like 50 inflation here uh but let's say you're getting 10 inflation right so you're getting a higher degree of inflation maybe five ten uh you know up to 20 spikes of 20 percent uh like you've had in in kind of developed countries uh then normally what happens at that point is that you get certain types of assets going up and other ones going down and so you know stocks that are priced like 50 times earnings that are extraordinarily highly valued uh based on the premise that interest rates are going to stay at one percent forever uh you know those that tend to get uh you know decreases to their valuations and therefore their price and so that you know that could take the form of that stock going down or it could just go sideways for a decade uh and so you know example like to use that in 1960s you had something called the nifty 50 which is like you know these 50 big blue chip companies that people said you can't go wrong if you invest in these companies you're going to do great and they were companies like coca-cola disney you know things that are well known xerox back then and of course those companies absolutely dominated the next like you know 30 40 50 years they did they did do phenomenal but their stock prices got killed for like 10 to 15 years through the 70s uh because they went into that decade extremely highly valued based on the premise of super low interest rates uh whereas you know some of the the commodity stocks the real estate that's the kind of stuff that went up in price a lot uh and so you had that big rotation from growth stocks uh to some of those value sectors uh and so the way i would have expected if you were to see you know 3 five six percent inflation whatever the numbers end up being uh i would expect to see someone a rotation where you see more international stock performance you see more value stock performance you see higher commodities uh higher real estate at least outside of major cities uh but you could for example see things like apple amazon uh you know some of those trends sideways you know be choppy and you know you could have kind of the s p 500 not particularly do very well for like a five year period uh even though you see uh those other areas going up but that would actually be close to my base case so lynn this whole debt monetization cycle it's it's it's safe to say the the average individual living society doesn't really understand what you just talked about right um and i tweeted this out recently i feel like everyone's angry at each other and i wish we were more angry at the underlying system which is i mean this this anger the the political anger the social unrest the wealth inequality is all a result of the underlying monetary structure that we have in place and it's it's almost predictable from that perspective so i feel like the first order of thinking is i'm angry at everybody else right you took away my manufacturing job and so i'm i'm voting for the populist candidate right second order of thinking is like no this anger is a product of our system and if we could change the system then um like we could change the everything um but there's also a third order thinking here that i want to ask you about which is like um maybe this just has to happen like maybe this is what human society has always done where we've had these debt monetization cycles and every every once in a while every few generations possibly we have we have to have the reset we have to have the the year of jubilee and because human nature doesn't change um this is going to repeat forever can can you talk about these cycles that we've seen in in history and maybe weave in a little bit with david and i have talked on on the program a little bit um like the fourth turning uh and uh some of these things from from a social perspective that um like we we often see repeating do you think this cycle is just uh inevitable essentially that we're just gonna keep repeating this whole thing and there's nothing we could do to stop it and so we just better like get ready and brace ourselves can you talk about that i think it's nearly inevitable to some degree uh but i think you know society can mitigate it based on you know how knowledgeable they are kind of how cohesive they are uh and so you know if you look i think the fourth turning is a great book because that you know that shows that roughly every four generations you know just just when just when a generation's kind of old you know no one's alive from the previous crisis that's when they have the next major crisis and so uh you know they point out that every every four generations roughly 80 years or so you tend to have a really big shift in in politics you usually get a rising populist movement you get a big change in how things work and that you know that the system that kind of comes from that could take a darker path or it could take a positive pass based on based on who won uh and if you actually go back and look at the fourth earnings they're all long-term debt cycles it's you know there's he that book focuses on the social political element uh but for people like me that focus more on the financial element uh another way of saying it is that they're all just kind of you know debt bubbles that are you know multi-generational debt bubbles rather than just a cyclical debt bubble there's another book called the lessons of history uh it's like a hundred pages written back in the in the 1960s and that literally documents this going back to uh 2500 years ago in ancient greece and they showed that these these debt monetization cycles uh you know that you know multi-generational cycles that can be 50 to 60 70 80 years uh they do keep happening all throughout human history all sorts of different monetary systems all sorts of different geographies it's almost inevitable because you kind of have that pendulum swing back and forth where you get you know more and more wealth concentration kind of gathers and you know as you get more wealth concentration that enables you to influence politics more uh and so that gives yourself more and more power and it kind of has that kind of virtuous cycle for that group uh until uh the the people that are on the wrong side of that uh you know hit an absolute breaking point they push up against it and then either one or two things happen either you have an outrage revolution uh or the you know they they kind of want to mitigate that ahead of time so they know no don't burn everything down we'll give we know we'll rearrange some things we'll fix some things and that kind of shifts some of it back and so some of the most successful societies have kind of managed to thread the needle where when it gets to the point where the you know the pitchforks are coming out they rearrange enough chairs to kind of level things out again and kind of restart another cycle whereas ones that don't thread that needle very well end up getting totally you know overrun and they kind of rebuild up from there and you examples like that would be you know the french revolution or the russian revolution uh whereas you know for example the 1930s united states was one of the ones that was able to thread that needle in such a way that you know the system kind of kept going with less extreme of a you know fluctuation although we did suffer suffer a war in the 1940s possibly as a result of this populism and authoritarianism that resulted from it yeah and a lot of that was because you know some of the what was happening in europe some of those places threaded it less well and so you had some of them kind of go down that darker route uh and then of course the you know the whole the war in the pacific was a whole another thing going on uh you know you know leading up to that united states was involved in japan we kind of forced them to open trade that gets into colonialism uh but basically that was a whole bunch of different factors but yeah that shows that that was kind of an issue where multiple countries were going through the cycle together uh and they all handled it in different ways so you had uk handle it in one way you had germany handle it another way you had united states handle it and kind of as they came out of the system some of them were better positioned than others based on how they handled it and of course who won the war gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemini since i first got back into crypto back in 2017 and

that's what i hear you uh speaking about with with this topic as well and what's interesting is that you know the the fourth turning talks about the stakulum which is also you know 80 to 90 years long and that's you know kind of an interesting coincidence that those things are roughly the same uh spans of time and they are both predicting a crisis and a rebirth after the crisis that's that's interesting to me what i what i see as evidence today is that both in 2020 both the social left and the social right rioted for different reasons right the social left rioted because of the black lives matter movement the right rioted because of you know a populist movement to keep donald trump in office and actually broke into the state capitol that's a crazy event and i actually think it's crazier and not yet talked about that for for completely separate reasons both the left and the right took to the street in the same year and do so do you see this as perhaps validation of ray dalio's long-term debt cycles and the fourth turning theory i think so i'm in the fourth turning pretty much said that would happen uh and and you know as i point out the fourth turnings all aligned with with you know long-term debt cycles that that dally would recognize uh and so you know all those kind of forces they all have you know what you said before is they blamed each other and that's of course because the underlying problems are very complex and multi-variable uh and a lot of people want to you know have a simple explanation it's their fault or no it's their fault and we kind of have this kind of us versus them mentality uh and so different cultural groups interpret the problems in different ways uh and so that can manifest itself you know through social issues uh but a lot of the underlying causes is due to you know really kind of big divides in terms of wealth concentration people having trouble paying for health care people having trouble you know just kind of maintaining a status quo and so for example there's there's charts that show if you look over the past 40 years you've look at the median male income and so you know the the the middle 50 percent uh male and they use male just because it keeps kind of a trend line because women economics were different 40 years ago but if you look at median male income and you look at you know the key expenses like health care transportation uh housing education that used to be a smaller percentage of his income but then over time those grew a lot more quickly than his income and so now it's at the point where they they take up all his income and he has no income left for anything else and he can barely pay for those things and so once you kind of have that crossover point and people are just kind of in debt and they you know you know they have like fifty thousand dollars of student debt and you know they just lost their job and they're being told they you know they can't you know by the government they can't you know say open their business or you know whatever the case may be that's when they say okay i'll just i'll grab my pitchfork and you know because i don't have anything i'll go i'll just go you know mess around because the consequences are lower when it seems like no matter what you do you can't make ends meet and you don't have a job because you lost it because you were to manufacturing yeah so lynn i feel like this is building to a crescendo where we start talking about crypto because i think listeners want to know okay lynn if everything you're saying is true uh and it looks like it looks like these cycles are repetitive and they may have some predictive powers then how in the world do i position myself going into this decade so i i want to take that as the context that we've talked about but let's talk about this populist social movement and i like your lens on it you're framing of it called crypto because that's what we're a part of so bankless is uh about using crypto as tools and decentralized finance tools to live a self-sovereign life without a bank we don't need an institution it is a in some in some ways a populist social movement in the way that you're saying and there's a store of value aspect to that there's also the ability to do things within a decentralized economy that that maybe someone would prohibit you doing outside of that economy so let's get to to crypto is this the reason is is crypto well positioned particularly maybe bitcoin we'll get to ether in a minute too is crypto really well positioned for this coming decade what's your take on it i think so because it's harnessing uh you know decentralization through technology uh and so for example if you look at the genesis block of bitcoin it references a bank bailout right right right in the genesis block and of course uh you know partially that's the just time stamp the block to show that there's no pre-mine but it's also clearly a cultural message towards what's happening in the world uh and so uh you know we had this kind of way to kind of go around the system in a way that would have been much harder before and so for example if you look at united states history uh from the 1930s to the 1970s it was illegal for americans to own gold which is funny to think about like they were like no no you cannot own on penalty of jail uh this yellow metal that's harmless you just can't own it because it just we don't like how it competes with the dollar system uh and so this is basically attempt to make an international network uh that basically says you know governments can try they can make it illegal uh but they're gonna have a really tough time stopping the actual underlying transactions from happening and of course you had a bunch of other digital assets come in its wake uh and you know they all basically you know i think a lot of them are scams but a lot of them are attempting to give tools to people to you know kind of figure out what works what doesn't uh to go around kind of the existing systems as much as possible an example for is stable coins right so you know basically depending on how they're structured like there's a difference between say you know tether or die but you know you have kind of a you might have a trusted third party at one point for custody but then the actual trading of them can be permissious permissionless and so there's you know there's all these different technologies they can let people kind of go around existing systems in a way that they couldn't do before lynn reading and understanding your analysis about you know the last hundred years of of macroeconomics uh you are frequently given out the line you know history doesn't repeat but it rhymes and you've also said the line well it with regards to the covid economic crisis quote unquote this time it's different and i think one of the big things that's different about this time is that bitcoin exists like we never had bitcoin in 2008 and well maybe we did technically it came like you know six months a year later but it wasn't really mature to the point where it is today you know now bitcoin is like almost a trillion dollars in market cap you know it's got its network effects how will the decade the next decade be different because bitcoin exists as an option you know i think it's tricky because the last time you if you go back to find a decade it's kind of like how this decade is shaping up to be you know even if you just put aside kind of speculations of social political issue just look at the fiscal situation in the monetary situation uh the 2020s look a lot like the the 1940s so far whereas the 2010s look a lot like the 1930s so even just looking at things in number terms we have to go back to 1940s to find a similar situation in terms of physical deficits fiscal debt uh you know persistently low interest rates uh and so you know back then people didn't have a lot of options i mean you didn't you didn't have the internet obviously you got your information at the speed of newspaper uh and so you didn't know you you couldn't just go up in real time and look at what inflation is doing and be like oh maybe i should get out of bonds or you know you you couldn't do that whereas now you're in a situation where people have all this real time information they have social networks that are telling them either information or dis information in some cases but either way things are circulating a lot faster and so people are going to interpret that in different ways and so i think a lot of the reaction functions can be a lot quicker uh and so and you know those could be positive you know interactions or negative ones and you know i think i think digital assets are one more tool that people have now uh for example to opt out of a system uh and so yeah you know back then the tools were limited right so gold would have been the obvious one but that was banned uh and it was actually hard to enforce so even though uh it was illegal to own there's actually rather few uh you know kind of charges against people for for you know basically very few people got in trouble for it because it's not like they sent people with guns to every home and checked everyone's gold it was just so uh you know kind of going into this decade people have all these different stores of value they've gold they've you know they can do commodities they can do it you know art wine houses uh crypto whatever the case may be for you know what they analyze to be the best but i think digital assets give people a international network effect to basically go into in a way that uses 21st century technology and kind of goes around a lot of the impediments that existed before can we take a quick side uh quest here because i i'd like your take on this lin um so some people are skeptical that the final boss government will allow um crypto holders to essentially keep their crypto and you've referenced several times the 1930s of course the us famously banned citizens from holding a certain amount of gold and it's interesting that that wasn't lifted until the 1970s which is which is very fascinating so can you talk about this of of course there are ways that um you know it it it's difficult for a government to confiscate uh private keys right at the same time for a network like like bitcoin uh a massive amount of liquidity actually happens in regulated um crypto banks as we might call them a coinbase or a binance and that that that certainly provides a a choke point potentially for a a government who who doesn't want you to store your value in this uh foreign asset any takes there on how the government might stymie uh this you know some people we've had in the pockets like ben hunt for instance not he'll say something like hey you're never gonna get it away with this basically big government is going to come and take away your crypto and relegate you to some sort of side uh like you know sideshow and have you lived there but you you're not going to do anything large scale with cryptocurrencies you can't assault the government's position on money you can't take that power away from them any thoughts here yeah i have a couple of thoughts i think you know one is there's a common thing that argues that the bigger they get uh the more likely they are to be blocked whereas i think it's actually in some ways the opposite the bigger they get i mean then you start to get more attention but if they hit a certain level of escape velocity uh the games kind of want and and so if they get big enough they're actually really hard uh to ban and we've seen some countries for example try to ban digital assets and then backtrack on it when they realize like okay so all the innovation's just gonna leave their country and people are still gonna use it anyway and then they're it's just you know it's so they're like no no actually we were just kidding we just want to regulate a little bit come back uh we promise we'll be nicer and so you've had some countries kind of backtrack on that uh and so i would argue that i i think it's it's you can have a spectrum of regulation right so you could have on one extreme outright banning right so you say you have united states and europe and japan i'll say we're gonna ban it uh that's an extreme outcome uh now we've actually seen moves in the other direction so for example we see that you know banks can officially you know custody uh digital assets uh we've seen more acceptance of stable coins uh and so they are they are trying to integrate that into the system because they've seen that outright blocking it just doesn't work because they don't want to fall behind in terms of of integration or innovation we've seen for example singapore's largest bank is getting into digital assets they want to custody things like fidelity's doing they want to have a you know exchange for accredited institutional investors and so countries don't want to miss out on this on this pie uh and so go ahead this is this is kind of our argument to to the ben hunts i'm wondering if you also agree with it basically the the the game theory means that no single country can actually ban uh something like a crypto and i i think i've seen you tweet recently that uh even even russia the central bank is starting to acquire more gold than us dollar type reserves you know it would be an interesting counter play for a country to start stacking bitcoin or ether or cryptocurrencies right while another country bans it would be like an interesting game theoretical play do you do you think that sort of prevents single country bands i think that's absolutely what prevents it and rush has been one of the examples that flip-flops on it and so now they're looking into potentially you know allowing certain custodies of digital assets in 2021 you know their main kind of you know partially state controlled cent bank uh spur bank uh is really interested in getting into certain types of digital assets including stable coins uh and including potentially custodying you know other existing assets uh and so uh you have that kind of game theory going on and then in addition uh you know if you start to get the donor class heavily invested uh then it's game over because politicians are heavily funded by you know donors so for example if uh you know if if digital assets are small things that only retail invest in you know i think that there were periods in history over the past decade where governments might have been more successful trying to kill them if they moved quickly enough like if you had a coordinated ban uh it could have prevented it from growing to a large degree but once you kind of hit escape velocity uh and you have like you know stanley druckenmiller says the own some and you have fidelities cussing it and you have you know you know a nasdaq listed company owns a billion dollars worth of it that's really hard to say we're going to ban that now so instead they say okay we're not going to ban it but we want to we want to try to track it as much as possible so we want to kyc it we want to we want to have control over the gateways for it we want to regulate it but i think they're past the point where you know they can easily ban it i think that i think they're starting to realize that as well so writing in the coattails of the technology that bitcoin you know provided to the world a global public uh layer of value transfer are stable coins and i think that's a very interesting conversation to have in a world where you know dollar demand is global maybe it's maybe it's declining in the face of alternatives maybe it's not but yet ethereum and the payment rails on ethereum for stable coins offers some very interesting you know global liquidity for dollars how do you think stable coins on public blockchain infrastructures how do you think that will um manifest itself in the next decade well i expect to see significant growth and of course because people they want to have a unit of account uh but they don't want to you know they don't necessarily want to have something that's volatile and so for them stable coins are one of the the major things and of course they can use that to arbitrage differences in prices and other digital assets between exchanges uh you know they can get around certain kind of uh you know gateways that exist now uh and so we kind of see this you know historically you know a lot of the financial pipes you can call them or you know basically all go through new york and we're seeing over time that you know first of all more countries are at the state level are interested in going around those systems so for example you see russia are starting to price their oil in euros against the kind of 50-year petrol or system and going around some of that to make themselves as sanction-proof as possible you're starting to see china roll out central bank digital currencies because they want to build to buy their commodities in their own currency with some of their trade partners and we're starting to see a private proliferation of stable coins uh which can can go around existing bank systems uh and so as as you know the world gets more decentralized over time in terms of financials uh you know whatever tools that people have available to them they're going to use and so i expect to see a growth of stable coins so lynn we actually got you on this podcast after a back and forth on twitter about um the details about the ethereum protocol um you had you had some some criticisms or some questions about um ethereum and it's its ability to be decentralized so i actually kind of want to pick up where that conversation left off and i just kind of want to start the conversation off of what questions about ethereum do you have like or or what do you question about ethereum well so i get a lot of questions you know for example i've i've been investing in bitcoin uh since april 2020 so when it when it it dipped down and had that big liquidity crash uh i bought i bought a you know decent chunk of it uh then dollar cost average into it so i i'm pretty bullish on bitcoin at this stage and so naturally i get questions uh from people like you know do i invest in all coins do i invest in ethereum and of course ethereum's as the second largest one and the only other one that really has some degree of a network effect uh that's of course the one that people ask about the most i and so my answer so far has been no i don't invest in ethereum uh because even though i think that the platform's enabling some interesting things i haven't seen a really strong case for the kind of the risk-reward ratio of owning uh ether uh and you know there's a variety of reasons for that and i think that the main thing i would point out is that it's just you know you can argue that bitcoin is essentially a finished product i mean they're still doing updates they're still doing security updates privacy updates over time but it's no longer a period of rapid change so you can argue that you know maybe in 2010 when they fixed the initial inflation bug maybe as a finished product then or you can argue you know 2017 after segwit uh maybe since then it's been a finished product but either either way you want to define it it's not in this period of kind of rapid change and we're starting to see for example some development and ecosystem like you know newer hardware wallets bitcoin only hardware wallets uh you know kind of security solutions uh some things happen in the lightning network uh and so there's there's still development in the ecosystem but the base layer has pretty much been sorted out uh whereas ethereum uh you know it's a newer technology uh and and of course now they're switching to ethereum 2.0 which is a very long process and so i'd argue that it's still in the alpha development stage let alone beta and so basically investors would be going into something that's still in rapid change and you know depending on what exactly you want out of the protocol so of course ethereum enables a lot more things than bitcoin on the base layer uh but they have to make certain sacrifices to do that and so the big question is are those sacrifices worth it uh if if it works out for enabling certain things does that necessarily mean that the token appreciates in value and so i think i think there's still a lot of questions there for people that want to get into ethereum because there's a lot more moving parts that have to come together in the next several years for that to have a high probability of appreciating in price i think there is an element to what you say lynn about the um the age of these projects right it's almost like a a 10 year old versus a five-year-old and that you know that happens to be their actual um like one is is much more you know developed and mature and the other is uh is still growing um but both of these systems haven't yet become become teenagers i want to ask before we talk a bit more about ether too to get your full take on this what do you make of d5 and i i will tell you you know dave and i have been around in the space for a while through 2017 the space when um ethereum launched and basically the sentiment at that time behind bitcoin proponents maybe you know some might call them bitcoin maximus was basically like bitcoin would eat up all of the use cases and this thing that you are creating called ethereum would never work because the smart contracts that you're envisioning uh have no use no utility there there's absolutely no value being being created you're creating goldberg machines right this was part of the criticism back in uh 2015 2016 when ethereum launched and yet and yet now we see a blossoming d5 industry with all of these decentralized protocols things like uniswap just in the past year surpassed coinbase in terms of uh of a volume trading volume a project that's 18 months built on a protocol with like 120k grant and like a handful of developers quite amazing what do you make of this defy thing lin uh so i think there are a lot of uh useful cases for it and i think that the one i always mentioned stable coins right so if you go back to stable coins that's the most obvious use case and lately we've seen as you point out the rise of decentralized exchanges and then of course as after that then you have a lot of liquidity providers for those exchanges so people that want to borrow or lend earn a yield or you know use leverage uh to kind of support those exchanges and so you see a lot of different projects i think you know on one hand it's really interesting uh because i think you know if people should build whatever they think will work uh then people can test it and the market will decide whether or not it wants it and so on one hand you know executing lines on of code on ethereum is more expensive than a centralized system uh but if some if some things benefit from decentralization uh then maybe it'll work over time on the other hand you know they could be you know to go back to the bear case it could be that you know it works for a period of time uh but then say they say that you know throughput to the system is too limited it gets too expensive people lose interest and kind of go somewhere else after time and i think that's what that's sort out i think if i would express a concern about defy is that it's somewhat circular and so there's a lot of use cases about you know trading crypto tokens uh providing liquidity earning yield on crypto tokens uh gamification of crypto tokens uh but so far there's you know and stable coins i think are the big exceptions they're the ones that i think have the most demonstrated use case uh potentially outside of the of the kind of the the crypto universe uh whereas i think become more sustainable um if they can kind of go away from the somewhat speculative routes and so of course there's they're very good in the area of speculation and of course whenever we see a bull market it's very well i think the big question is what happens after a couple of these cycles you know will these cycles you know with bitcoin for example each four year cycle is much bigger than the one before it and so it has these boom bust cycles but it keeps building on each other and i think the the big test for d5 is as you have these boom and bust cycles really keep building on itself and growing up larger and larger or will it kind of go through the sine wave and kind of stagnate and kind of go through these kind of you know maybe it's too circular maybe it's too expensive or maybe it does take off in a way that that you know some of the bears uh think it won't yeah so one of the common criticisms of the the d5 and ethereum since day one you know plagued by the branding the the negative branding that ethereum got in 2017 with like the ico mania where people would just issue a token tell you that we're gonna do something with this token and then the token would pump and then people would exit the space you know very very bad stigma not something that we consider sustainable we i see it much more sustainable nowadays with d5 as people are building out protocols and applications first and then tokens second but still i will absolutely admit that this is absolutely like financial ex engineering experimentation going on like we are learning about what this like open sandbox of financial innovation is is something that we've never really had before as a species we never had the ability to have open source financial engineering one of my favorite lines about this industry is that uh we are trying to speed run the history of economics money and finance over the last you know millennia and we're trying to cram it into as small of a time period as possible right you know bitcoin is we've invented money with bitcoin and then on ethereum we are inventing financial tools like we have yield curves starting to develop we have money markets starting to develop we have loans and credit um and all of these things that you know we've created over the last thousands of years we're cramming into as short of a time period as possible and as a result of that that's where you get the speculation from because you know there's no way that you speed run through ten thousand years of economic history without you know significant upsides for the people that figured out what sticks and what and what doesn't stick um that's that's what gets me really really excited and i would i would totally uh as somebody who comes from the macro perspective ethereum obviously i would say is too young right if you are trying to preserve wealth and and not gamble and speculate i would say the things going on in theory might be just too um uh to too young to do too juvenile not not yet mature however framing this back into the original conver or the what the conversation that led into this was was the conversation around the fourth turning where society is looking for alternative institutions and in a time where trust in institutions or at an all-time low the promise of defy offers trustless institutions and while they are kind of you know largely based on financial speculation and getting rich quick and pumps i think there's a larger broader conversation you know maybe it's not yet manifested in the real world but but you know people like me like me and ryan who are kind of idealists see this as a potential future of you know large scale social scaffolding using you know smart contracts on ethereum which run in a trustless fashion or trustless manner that's our bold case for ethereum as as as people remove their trust from previous institutions they need a place to deposit that trust into and we think you know bitcoin is a great receptacle of that trust but bitcoin does one thing and one thing only which is transfer bitcoins whereas ethereum and the actual like erc 20 token represents more modular or more flexible ways of capturing that new trust that's our kind of narrative i kind of want to want to get your take on that yeah so i mean the way i look at it is of course innovation's a good thing you want to have this camera explosion of innovation like just kind of how like the internet in the 90s uh enabled all sorts of you know trial and error things that were things that didn't work things that became overvalued that you know for example cisco became radically overvalued in the late 90s uh and the actual products went on to work for decades i mean it is it was a very successful company uh but people still lost a lot of money if they bought it in 1999 even though it did it did go on to pretty much manifest all the stuff they thought it would do and so there's somewhat of a separation between uh you know what what price you're paying uh versus the actual underlying utility uh that that thing will provide and so i think there's you know overall i would say that it's good that people are experimenting seeing what works at you know as we go through cycles we'll see what works and what doesn't i just think you know a lot of investors kind of come into a space uninformed uh and you know they risk getting scammed they risk having issues and i you know even for example and this is unrelated to ethereum i just see i've had this massive uptick on twitter of various uh you know fake accounts trying to scam my followers of bitcoin for example and and even just that even just tricking them into sending them bitcoin is is just a nightmare uh and it's something i have to report a new account like every three days uh and so and of course when you have this broader defy movement you have underlying protocols uh that you know they some of them are don't have good security issues some of them are just kind of you know as you point out scammy things in the in the ico era or you know exit scams uh basically all these ways where the founder riches themselves and so there's a lot of land mines and there's you know the very high failure rate in that industry and so i think you know i think that there are areas where very informed people can can you know make speculations or dabble in things but i think the broader people have to be very cautious with that area and investing in alpha products and and kind of make sure they know the risk award of what they're getting into and know some of the downsides related to security or you know kind of the the problematic incentive structures that can exist for some of the founders and things like that yeah i totally agree one one thing that we often say on bankless is that um this is this is the frontier it's kind of like like heading west you know right on kind of a the an oregon trail type of uh situation there's lots of ways to die there's lots of ways to get your money stolen like you could get dysentery be careful out there absolutely um i i want to jump to like kind of uh uh the potential here back to what what david was talking about in the potential of d5 this whole internet of finance type thing let's imagine for a second um and i fully admit that it is it is still early we're only five years into this thing um but two years ago we had less than you know 10 million locked in d5 protocols now today we're here we just we we just went over 20 billion right um so there is some trust being deposited into these d5 protocols and let's say this thing does play out in a way that it becomes kind of the the internet of finance right um david and i think that ether is also a candidate for a store of value in the same way that that bitcoin is a candidate for for stored value and as ridiculous as that might seem to someone you know coming from kind of macro or the outside before paul tudor jones uh you know makes a big purchase or microstrategy makes a big purchase of ether on their balance sheet as ridiculous as that sounds uh right now um that's the way bitcoin sounded back in 2015 right like so five five years ago too so can you talk do you think that that is a possibility in in kind of your macro mind maybe for you you have to wait a few cycles to see defy how it plays out to see ether transition to proof of stake and the whole eth2 thing kind of come together but is it a possibility in your mind that ether can become like a bitcoin and be a reserve store of value asset in similar ways it already is that for the d5 economy but even as the defy economy grows could it become that i think it's the possibility because to say otherwise would be trying to prove a negative which i don't try to do but it's more like looking at probabilities and so if we look at ethereum for example uh you know they've had different changes to the monetary policy over time and you know now they're potentially going to roll out this this partial inflationary partial deflationary monetary policy uh and but you know we'll see if that sticks right so it's possible that they introduce that and then they find out they have to change it again so i think if you get to a situation where that you know eth2 has been in place for you know three four years you haven't had the monetary policy change once in that time uh and you're starting to see kind of use cases that are maybe less circular less about speculating and crypto tokens about as more about providing actual utility uh to you know kind of a bigger percentage of the you know the kind of use case of the foundation uh then sure i think you could see appreciation uh and of course you can see appreciation before that if people front run that or if you have these speculative boom bus cycles leading up to that uh but i think you know until you get to that point where you have consistent monetary policy and non-circular use cases to a much larger degree uh then i think it's it's kind of still in that that early alpha phase and so i think a lot of things have to go right in order for me to for example look at ethereum as a store of value uh rather than as a speculation whereas bitcoin i think has crossed a line into of course it's still an emergent store of value so it's still a highly volatile project uh but it's you know it is it's essentially a finished product in the sense that it's it's out and it's getting updates but it's no longer an alpha or beta development uh and so you know again i wouldn't try to prove a negative uh i just think that there's still a lot of work to do uh you know for ethereum one of the frequent questions i hear about when people try and get into this space and and understand something beyond bitcoin because you know while bitcoin is complicated it's also relatively easy when compared to other things in crypto and especially some of the crazy stuff going on on ethereum you know the the narrative behind bitcoin is simple you know hard cap and you know monetary supply uh four year cycles and of have issuance having on ethereum it's different like the and the reason why there's no uh monetary policy on ethereum is that the goal of ether the asset and the monetary policy of ether the assay is to support ethereum the network and all these d5 protocols like uniswap or ave or compound or anything that is meaningfully built on ethereum needs ethereum itself to be secure in order for those things to run and so the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is that the bitcoin blockchain and the bitcoin technology is meant to serve btc the asset and the ethereum monetary policy is an ether the asset is meant to serve ethereum the network ether is only valuable if the ethereum network is strong and so as many things in the ethereum ecosystem the developers are interested in tinkering in order to find the best you know value peak you know the best of the the best optimization for both the network and the monetary policy and so they are willing to you know increase inflation decrease inflation implement this burning mechanism because if they get things right then ideally that would incentivize a lot of development on ethereum because of the assurances of long-term security over the ethereum protocol now me and ryan are particularly bullish that the actual optimization of the ethereum protocol using tinkering with the ether monetary policy actually does create long-term value capture into ether the asset but that does require some sort of belief about the future right some sort of speculation that this is actually going to play out um so lynn i'm excited to see your you i'm hoping to see you watch ethereum and kind of see that development ecosystem grow and and hopefully that the ether the asset you maybe i'm hoping if if mine and ryan's thesis about ethereum plays out that it will be included in you know non-sovereign store value assets alongside bitcoin that is our long-term perspective here is that there are two major crypto monies you know one is a digital hard cap ultra secure proof of work blockchain and one is a you know flexible monetary supply network that hosts you know orders of magnitude more economic activity that we than we see today uh do you see for example um ethereum moving outside of the financial speculation realm and getting into industries that are non-financially do you see uh you know say tens or hundreds of billion dollars of economic value being captured by ethereum and like what would some of the use cases be yeah absolutely so i recently put out a piece on coindesk uh titled ethereum is the last bastion for yield and i think yield is going to be the killer app that ethereum offers to the world as yield is disappearing from you know from almost every market everywhere as we've talked about in this podcast you know yield in treasury notes are drying up yet people are getting anywhere between you know 10 and 30 apy on their dollars in different uh in different applications right i just onboarded my father to put a couple thousand dollars into ave so he could just like get some of that yield and so he took money out of bonds and he put them into you know money markets on ethereum and if you want to keep your dollars denominated or your value denominated in dollars you can get 10 between like 10 and 20 percent you know pretty consistently if you are willing to expand your asset denomination into perhaps both dollars in ethereum liquidity providers to uniswop received a 35 apy on a hybrid 5050 ether position by supplying that liquidity and collecting fees and so i think the very first initial use case that we are going to see really mature in ethereum and in the short term the short term being you know one to three years is that people are going to come to know ethereum as the place that receives yield that's going to be i think the biggest driver in the short term and then the other big driver is just asset issuance ethereum is a place that democratizes access to assets right um ryan and i we not too long ago minted 50 tokens and made them redeemable for 50 t-shirts and you know that's not going to upend the financial system anytime soon however it is pretty cool that you know these two podcasters minted 50 tokens that represented assets that we fulfilled claims on those assets that people would burn a token and we would send them a t-shirt i think that's a very early stage of something that could be much more powerful but really the powerful thing is that ethereum offers you tools to create scarcity and so this kind of feels like an oxymoronic statement but but i'm behind it 100 is that ethereum um makes scarcity abundant as in everyone has access to scarcity tools and i think that is something revolutionary that i think we just need more experimentation and development in order to really see that feature manifest into something that the whole entire globe can get behind yeah i think it's good that the tools are available and i i do think people should experiment to see what sticks one thing i point out about yield because you know one thing there's a lot of people are interested for example coming from the stock world a lot of people are interested in you know high dividend stocks for example that you know because especially because treasury yields keep going lower and so people that are 50 67 years old they want that income from their investment but one of the traps they fall into is that they'll buy the highest yielding you know kind of stocks out there and of course those are the ones that you know they're not having consistent earnings to cover their dividends they might be over leverage uh and so it works really well for like five years and then the sixth year comes along and say oil price goes negative or something implodes and and of course that's when you you lose five years of of kind of value accumulation uh in like a three month period uh and so you know if you look at say the long long-term history of the treasury bond for example there are periods you know we talked about earlier in this podcast there are periods where inflation is much higher than the yield you're earning and there are other periods where uh your yield you're earning is much higher than inflation uh and so one of the whole you know the way that fiat currencies work is that the reason people want to earn yields of course is because the the currency is losing value over time and so you have to earn some sort of income or yield uh to basically compensate you for that inflation whereas if if hypothetically if you had a more deflationary situation yield becomes less important because the actual underlying value of the item goes up over time and that's why for example you see people owning things that might not earn income that still store value like for example fine art or fine wine or collectible cars is because even though they don't earn a yield they go up in value and so i would just recommend that people be very careful about chasing yield and just kind of emphasize try to always emphasize chasing total risk adjusted return in in whatever form that may be and whatever asset class that may be because just because you're earning yield doesn't mean that you know the underlying thing is safe doesn't mean that it's gonna you know persist over time and if you're earning yield you do have to compare that to the underlying say inflation rate of that particular token whatever the case may be because a lot of people they might be happy you know there are certain say in the 70s you might have been happy earning say eight percent on your treasury but if inflation's 12 then it's not exactly as good as if you're earning five percent but inflation is only two percent uh and so that that'd be the concern i have with kind of yield focused uh things uh because you know for example as a stock investor i often like dividends because it basically means that the the companies returning capital that they did they feel that they they don't have the capability to invest for high returns so they invest the capital that they can they give the rest back and so there are there is a place for yield and dividends and things like that uh but i just think investors have to kind of you know keep in mind kind of the ups and downs uh you know that's why i'd view it and so in in the bitcoin ecosystem there's less focus on yield because it's more about owning a you know a token that you know ostensibly goes up in value over time i i think that's a great point lynn and we definitely like um risk adjusted yield is really what you need to be optimizing for when you're looking at yield one thing that's different um from kind of the the ico speculation of 2017 is we would argue that there is a new type of asset being bored here so a new asset super class essentially which is the crypto capital asset so this is sort of you know in 2017 you had all of these icos and their uh value accrual mechanism for their token was basically like oh yes use me as an arcade token i'm your chucky cheese token and when you're in my ecosystem when you're in my arcade then you use me instead of using dollars right which is obviously a fairly flawed we call them futility coins value accrual mechanism right this time you have something different you have what we would call the crypto capital asset so you could think of like a a uniswap possibly if it transitions from like you know it governance to a fee structure where owners of the uni token actually uh receive a portion of the transaction so a portion of revenue portion of profits in some ways from every from all of the unit swap activity right you have something similar playing out with ave and compound so what's being birthed here is essentially you could consider it like defy uh bank stocks essentially and that is different than 2017 that that means there is of course all of these like even bitcoin goes through speculative mania's right but the speculative mania happening in d5 this cycle um simply the last cycle but more pronounced is actually being used to prop up an entire banking protocol banking layer here with real tokens that have cash flows crypto capital assets defy capital assets that is one thing to pay attention to um as well as as you're looking to the space do you think do you think there's anything to that partially i think you know for example i i do think that if you have tokenization that looks more more like equity uh then basically what you have is you know kind of a technology transfer from uh you know how how equity is currently managed now like if you own stakes of equity how do you manage that like you know is it stock certificates or whatever the case may be versus owning tokens they give you access to ownership of something that they can generate value uh and so i mentioned before that you know singapore's largest bank was getting into it uh they're also interested in getting into tokenization of different assets and so uh you know something that might not be publicly traded could potentially issue tokens that represent ownership stake in that thing uh and so i do think there's you know potentially a space for that um you know but i guess one thing i'd just be cautious about is you know say you have a bank that you know they they take depositor money and then they they put out loans to people it could be that they want to you know take out a loan to buy a house or could they want to take out a loan to start a business uh and so you have that kind of that lending environment uh that's for real productive use so it's going to basically fuel people's lifestyles or their business uh prospects now on the other hand if you had a bank and all that bank did was say lend to speculators in the stock market so you have some people depositing their money in and then you had that bank was just lending to people uh to kind of speculate uh you know and then say it's it's speculating on shares of other banks that are doing kind of the same thing so you have a group of banks that are speculating on each other and so my concern there is that if you know in order for that system to become sustainable uh more and more of that kind of equity-based uh thing has to be towards non-financial or non-speculation things rather than kind of this big circular speculation thing so i think there's something there i think people should explore it i just think it has to become more and more sustainable if it's going to you know kind of become a more permanent feature lynn i think you are right there and certainly right with the bankless nation we we definitely believe a real economy is going to be built on top of these uh financial tools uh as well and we do think bitcoin and ether are going to be important assets um lynn you've taken us through so much like it's great to hear your your your macro mind on all of this stuff uh and it has been a pleasure speaking to you thanks so much yup thanks for having me fantastic all right bankless listeners we're going to leave you with some resources in the show notes as we always do um first thing you should do is read one of lin's articles recently about the petro dollar system we will include a link in the show notes to that it was absolutely mind-blowing uh article and covers a lot of what we talked about today um secondly we will include a link to lin's monthly macro newsletter i think there's a a free version of that and also a subscriber-only version of that you need to check that out just fantastic insights i'm a subscriber to that as well that would be the second action item lastly david we're in a bull market we need some bull market reviews of this podcast on itunes do we not absolutely we are looking to climb the itunes charts we are trying to scrape our way to the top of business and investing categories we are not there yet and the way that we get there is those five star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts it would be a big help to grow at the bankless nation guys risks and disclaimers as always none of this was financial advice we have no idea truly what the 2020s will hold but i hope you got some insight onto what they might hold today bitcoin is risky so is eat so is crypto you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
