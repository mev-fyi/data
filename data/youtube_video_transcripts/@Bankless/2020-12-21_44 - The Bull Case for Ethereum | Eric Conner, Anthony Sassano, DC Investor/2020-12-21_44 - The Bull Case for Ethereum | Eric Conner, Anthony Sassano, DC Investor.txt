if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at y earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing bankless nation we've been waiting for this episode for a long time we have got the three most bullish people we could find other than david and myself about ether on today we've got eric connor anthony cesano dc investor these folks were bulls when it was not popular to be bullish eath they've been through the tr the trenches of the bear market we are out the other side in what looks to be the beginning of a bull market and we are here to talk about why they are bullish ethereum the network and the asset gentlemen fantastic having you on bankless how's everyone doing doing great fantastic thanks ryan doing good thanks for having us guys you know what i'm going to start actually with uh dc so we want this to be kind of a canonical ethereum episode that people can refer to and uh that provides some context on what ethereum and ether actually is could you kind of start us off dc what is aetherium to you how would you explain it to someone off the street so well well off the street is a tough ask but i'll do my best and i i always the way that i think of ethereum is that it is a it's a network that provides a programmable and globally shared ledger of record so it's kind of like this it is this database for really important fiduciary grade data um which everyone in the world can access and anyone can write to permissionlessly and in a censorship-resistant way so that at its most at its core that's what it is but the real question is what does it allow and i think what it allows is it allows this economic coordination across anybody anywhere in the world and and that's a really powerful concept and and you see that embodied in modern day defy as well and as far as the types of properties that ethereum has and what it could mean i think ethereum will become home to the world's most important digital assets the ones that really have financial value and most importantly it's home to ether which i believe and i know we're going to talk about today is going to become the world's most important programmable decentralized asset in fact i think it already is and that programmability is why i think eth is also going to emerge as a very important macro asset alongside bitcoin as we've already seen and i think it's kind of in a class of one or two and we're already seeing that with billionaires piling in to to to bitcoin and into ether and now we're seeing cme future so the path for ethereum looks incredibly bright dc do you think it's hard for people to get their like heads wrapped around with with bitcoin there's just one name right you say bitcoin it's a network it's also an asset but with ethereum you sort of have to explain okay well there's this thing called ethereum the network and just as you've explained it and then there's this other thing called ether the asset and both are important is the ethereum narrative just like hard to understand or do you think this cycle people mainstream investors will begin to understand why both the network and the asset are important yeah i mean i do think in some ways the narrative is certainly harder to understand than bitcoin and bitcoin is a pretty simple narrative it's a scarce supply censorship resistant digital asset and i think ethereum has some of those same properties as well but ethereum does a lot of other stuff and i think the concept of like what is a smart contract and what does that enable is difficult for a lot of people to understand unless you get into the technical details so at its core you know when i really think about it i view ether as programmable money and and and i think that you know i've i've discussed it that way with some people outside of the space and i think that resonates with them it's this decentralized programmable money where you can run applications that no one controls and you can manipulate that value to do all kinds of incredible things i do think that the space is also going to become more sophisticated during this cycle just i mean it took people a cycle or two to really understand bitcoin let's not forget that and i would argue that was really only in the 2017 cycle that people really came to understand what bitcoin is prior to that it was kind of more of a play toy for nerds and i think ethereum has been at that stage but we're about to hit this moment where ethereum is going to enter the zeitgeist during this cycle and i'm really excited about that eric let's turn to you next because you've been in the ethereum space since you know since day one right and ethereum you know every everybody has their own perspective or angle to understanding ethereum and why it's valuable and why it's so cool so what's your angle like what does ethereum mean to you and why is ethereum so awesome i think what dc just said is important to understand and like i'll go you know yeah it's been six seven years on the ethereum journey now and i think what we've realized is it takes narratives a while to not only be realized but to take form so bitcoin's been around over what 10 years now or something like that and they kind of went through these at first there's like peer-to-peer cash and then like it's gone through these like seven narrative changes one of the most fascinating things to me about this current bull cycle we're going on is bitcoin has seemed to have won the digital gold narrative and i you know that's that's cool we're here to talk about ethereum though but what what can we learn from that it's that that narrative and dc was just talking about this was not really understood until basically today it took them four or five years to figure that out and for you know the mainstream to adopt that and i think ethereum is two to three years behind in the d5 narrative and i think personally that the d5 narrative is 10 to 20 times more powerful than the digital gold narrative but it's also a little bit more complicated right and i've recently been saying and tweeting and thinking about you know how do we explain ethereum to people i think of it as think about the internet but the internet for finance and eth is that money used on the internet of finance and i think as we kind of hone in on to this narrative and a lot of people will say you know it's complicated to explain which it is you know why isn't the narrative perfect yet it's because we're still pretty young right and like even once you find that narrative you need to kind of like have other people understand it and you know sell it maybe not the right term but you do kind of have to sell it to people that don't understand it right so i think you know to me i've said before multiple times when i first saw ethereum this concept of d5 this concept of financial money you know being transacted easily across the internet was what captured me it wasn't the world computer maybe that's 10 or 20 years down the line um but i think ethereum's growing into its own and that we've we have found our narrative we're kind of like you know sculpting it now and like soon we're embarking on the early stages of pitching it and what it is um and you know it's not just a marketing tactic like it is powerful being your own bank having someone not tell you what financial transaction you can do or you know and not like shutting you down or whatever like that is extremely powerful there there was debates on twitter today about what is cypherpunk i don't think bitcoin cipherpunk at all i think cyberpunk is having true privacy solutions being your own bank bitcoin offers none of that they can be digital gold that's fine they're layered two is banks but ethereum's looking for something bigger it's just going to take a little longer to get there and i'm totally fine with that anthony so eric's saying so so dc that uh ethereum and ether is sort of a maybe a cycle behind bitcoin in terms of its narrative understanding maybe three or four years would you agree with that and what would you add to the the definition of ethereum and ether yeah i would totally agree with that and i think it's not even just in terms of like narratives and awareness it's also in terms of in terms of like i guess price and market cap of these kind of assets too it seems that if uh you know you just looking at the charts seems to be following you know bitcoin's last cycle and it's just it's crazy when you look at it like that because the you know the supplies of the coins are different it's not like a one-to-one mapping right but magically the prices are similar right um and it seems like we're just one cycle behind uh in terms of like i guess price but awareness as well and i've been saying this for for a little while now but i think you know bitcoin owns the macro narrative right you know when you think of crypto as someone outside of crypto you're thinking of bitcoin that's the first thing you hear about it's the first thing you're going to go and investigate you're going to learn about and it's a much easier thing to wrap your head around right but then once you venture into crypto pretty much everything is happening in ethereum right bitcoin becomes the boring asset or the boring network within it within crypto uh if you want to get involved and get more excited about something then you venture on to ethereum then you fall down that rabbit hole and you have defy right which is just another even rabbit hole within the rabbit hole so that's kind of what i've been uh kind of explaining to people especially newer people that i talk to is that get to learn about bitcoin get to know bitcoin understand what it is and then go and venture into ethereum and you'll never go back like i i don't see how you can fall down the ethereum rabbit hole and then go back to to being only bitcoin after that um you know maybe there's a few people that have done that but the majority of people that i talk to don't um and that's just better that's just going to increase the awareness of ethereum and increase kind of like the the social consciousness of ethereum and we're going to have more and more people being evangelists for it and then it goes from like bitcoin being the only kind of thing that the media talks about um the mainstream media at least to to ethereum being alongside it and i think we're already seeing that happen dc and they say uh kind of mentioned that these billionaires are investing in btc right these funds and everything but they're also investing in eth if you had told me a couple years ago that this would be happening for btc i would have said yeah that's that that that makes sense right i can kind of see that for eighth oh god no no two years ago it was viewed as a joke right as an asset because we just came off the ico boom it was a bear market it was getting kind of like destroyed in that market and if you told me that billionaire fund managers was going to be buying eth alongside btc that would have been a crazy notion so i guess i think we've already come so far and i think that it's not going to take us as long as it took bitcoin because we have that that kind of infrastructure already laid out that consciousness already laid out you know crypto to the mainstream is now becoming like an inevitability it's not like will it work is it a fad or stuff like that people are accepting that they were wrong about bitcoin right they were wrong about um a bitcoin going away and going to zero and they're capitulating and i feel like that's going to happen with with ethereum a lot quicker because people aren't going to get the wrong idea they're already going to accept that these networks can exist and then once they say ethereum they're not going to have those initial doubts anymore they're going to be like okay this is like bitcoin but you can do all of this stuff with it so i think yeah we're one cycle behind but it's going to be faster to play out at this point so each of us have mentioned price a few times and in kind of your intro anthony uh you were talking about price maybe price being sort of a market cycle behind uh bitcoin but some would argue that like in ethereum the price of eth doesn't really matter and i think there have been elements of the community even the ethereum community that have argued that over time like anthony don't worry about like don't be focused on price price doesn't matter for ethereum it's it's about the technology it's about the network what is your response to that does price actually matter and if so why yeah so if we take this price doesn't matter to its logical conclusion and you think you know money doesn't matter right money doesn't buy happiness money isn't isn't important right that that make that makes sense to me but my my pushback is that the the money within the ecosystem uh as the number goes up we have more money to build things with right we saw after defy summer there was a couple months where a lot of people made a lot of money and then uh it was funny i was talking to eric about this on on ether podcast like we were talking about fundraising you know multiple projects fundraising every week after that happened right and why do you think that happened because people had more money like it's not it's not a hard thing to grasp if people have more money if people feel richer they will reinvest that money they're not just going to sit on it like some dragon hoarding it's gold like a and i think you know that that kind of plays into uh basically number go up being so important for for the ecosystem um just for that reason alone but there's also a bunch of other reasons right like the security of the network goes up if its price goes up right that's a fact you cannot you cannot argue against that uh in my view right um you know it brings in new users as much as you know for better or worse it brings in new users and maybe they come for speculative reasons they stay for other reasons later on i mean i'm sure i'm not alone in saying this but like i first got into it because i saw the price of you know kind of eat going up and i was like wow okay um i want to buy some right before i even like jump down the rabbit hole in 2017 i kind of bought it and then jumped down right and the reason why it came on my radar is because my friend told me hey you know this thing is going up you should look into it right so that's how a lot of people will get into the ecosystem so if you're a builder right i actually see this rhetoric a lot from like developers and builders and things like that not to generalize but that's who i kind of generally see it from um but if you're if you're that kind of person just think like okay you know how are you gonna get funding for starters for the stuff that you're building right if there's no money around then you're not going to get funding for it right and you want more users to come into the ecosystem so that they use your apps so i mean it it just for me it's like second nature to to to know that that price matters but and i can't kind of square why people just don't think it matters even if you think that money doesn't matter it doesn't matter like you personally can still hold that belief you can think that money isn't everything and that's fine but not everyone wants number to go up just to buy a lambo right or anything like that like you know for me personally i made some investments after defy summer as well like i want to give back i donated on get coin you see so many people donating on get coin the rounds are the biggest they've ever been right in terms of matching so i just i don't see how number go up can be viewed negatively unless you view it with the lens of oh everyone just wants to buy a lambo everyone just wants to be rich and and do extravagant things which i think especially within the ethereum community is not true because we reinvest the money and we see that happening kind of every few months uh when the cycles play out uh so yeah i guess long-winded way of saying that price matters uh pretty much more than anything but not for the reasons that a lot of people think uh it matters a an ethereum or crypto skeptic could illustrate and i've seen this illustration before of ethereum is that it's it's not this like internet native like economy it's more of like this this kind of like private park where there's a bunch of like you know financial fun games being played like it's like it's a it's a casino it's like it's not it's not really globally accessible and you know it's more really really niche and it's not it's not really going to be like this world financial platform it's more of just like this kind of like money theme park that lives on the internet and it's just a bunch of toys that that's that's a a defy skeptic or ethereum skeptics take that i've heard um and the and so i want to ask the question is like when when you know eath price goes up and we're seeing all these seed investments into these d5 projects into these different different ethereum protocols into these uh things that are going on in the ethereum economy what are these things like what are these the every single entity that is uh receiving funds are trying to solve the problem right and so when we view them holistically what are these problems that we are trying to solve right like what what are the problems that ethereum is trying to solve uh dc let's let's turn to you like what are the overarching problems that these people that are fundraising for projects or just building something on ethereum like generalized what is the problem that you know each individual team or project was trying to go after so so i think one of the crazy things about ethereum is the breadth of problems that are being tackled on the platform and some of those efforts are going to be successful some of them are going to be failed experiments and right now we don't know which ones are going to be which but i think fundamentally something that ethereum tries to achieve is to remove this reliance on intermediaries which we have become very accustomed to in our financial lives and other parts of our lives as well and when you think about the the proliferation of entities like banks and how difficult they can be to deal with other financial institutions they can be inherently unreliable and beyond that it can also be difficult to do things between them right and so when you're working with a financial institution in a given type of account oftentimes that account can't quickly talk to your account at a brokerage or something like that right and so you've got to send the money through some antiquated system which can take days or on the weeks if things go wrong in some cases and i think that is a problem because those intermediaries also extract rents in that process and not to say that they don't provide value for service but if we can do that cheaper more reliably more transparently on ethereum then why wouldn't we want to i think the other problem that ethereum solves or or is that it creates this new i wouldn't say it's a problem that solves but it creates this new opportunity with ether as an asset in particular um the world has never seen a programmable decentralized asset with the characteristics of ether and especially when i know we're going to talk later about like eip five one five five nine and fee burn and staking i mean that asset alone is going to create the potential for all kinds of services that frankly we can't imagine yet right i mean who could have imagined even if you read the ethereum white paper would you imagine that something like die from maker would exist you know a few years later based tapping into that decentralized value to create something and transmuting that value into something else so and i want to kind of riff off of what anthony was talking about with respect to price price is important because it's liquidity and liquidity in the system in the ethereum economy allows us to do more things and do more impactful things that are relevant to the world yeah i'll add a little bit here so it's we always kind of think of like what are we building for the end user right and i'll use this i ran across this hacker news um post most people listening probably know what hacker news is it's pretty popular message board around among like developers and i guess hackers right and it was like someone posted like why why does every developer i know these days somehow have a connection to ethereum and that like really hit home with me and i think like when we talk about defy and like open finance and ethereum being open we should also realize that like not only are we building for the end users to be bankless and be able to you know transact however they want but it also gives the ability for anybody sitting anywhere in the world to build a financial platform to build a money lego like there's no barrier for anybody right and like now you kind of be need to be connected you need to know like some accredited investors some vcs and raise some money you need to like have ends in the banking industry now some kids sitting in some random country 15 years old or whatever can fire up a piece of code and it becomes an essential money lego on ethereum and i think like that is just as powerful as you know having censorship resistant transactions and being your own bank and things like that and i you know i i think the power we're really seeing is just this like crazy reach that ethereum has dc just said it like we're tackling so many use cases on chain but the fact that anybody can just spin up a line of code no one's telling them no is just fascinating to me i've been thinking about that post i saw on hacker news for the last few weeks and i think it speaks to i really do think almost all like younger developers have some toad dipped in the ethereum ecosystem at this point which is just insanely powerful so eric like as we're maybe getting into d5 a little bit and kind of the the ethereum economy uh it's it seems very much that ethereum's destiny is at least partially tied to the success of of d5 right um there's also some competitors to d5 too right so if you think about uh say the bitcoin ecosystem uh and doing things on bitcoin um a lot of the money verbs as we might call them on bank list that you could do on on bitcoin you do generally through a crypto bank right through like a coin base or a gemini coinbase is now recently launched it looks like the the intent to to ipo that means a larger war chest that they'll have at their disposal um how do you think this defy ecosystem of of startups with some of the strengths that that you you mentioned but also like the weaknesses right i mean these are like small developers not necessarily a lot of budget uh harder in some ways user experience at first there's private key management that sort of thing how can they hope to compete against the crypto banks do you think d5 versus crypto banks do you think defy can come out ahead yeah it's definitely an interesting battle to talk about and i i've always said i think these universes are going to run in parallel for a while mainly d5 versus traditional banks but i kind of i'm putting coinbase in those in the traditional banking industry at this point like to me they're kind of just banks right they're more modern banks these crypto banks um i think you know it takes like having a bad experience in a traditional finance system to really start to understand the benefits of d5 so i i don't think as like you know someone that lives in the us the first world country and doesn't have too many issues with banking and finance right now other than you know i graduated around the time where the financial crisis was going through here and it was hard to find a job other than that you know my banking life's pretty easy now i think we like kind of get locked into this bubble sometimes wait why would someone want a bitcoin as a hedge to monetary policy why would anybody want d5 there's a lot of people in the world that have hyperinflation currencies that have struggle to access a banking system right so i think it's going to start there and grow like you know i guess in the u.s we could have inflation we got weakness in the dollar we're starting to see a lot of like censorship around traditional financial transactions regulations coming in those scenes can slowly creep in and i think it's going to take like the younger generation to realize the benefits um and it's going to be the slow wave right i i don't i've never been one to expect like the next year is going to be like where d5 takes over right i think this is a long play of these two systems running and slowly people start to see the benefits and just with some of the other younger generations finding benefits like technology and mobile apps and all this stuff that we've all witnessed over the last 20 years they're going to slowly start to realize the benefits of you know being your own bank and having privacy and all that kind of good stuff so uh david letterman had bill gates on in like 1994 and there's a clip on youtube where like he's asking bill gates about the internet right and um bill gates is kind of describing like he's like what do you do with the internet bill gates says well like who knows you can watch videos on it you can listen to music on it and letterman says something like like music like do you mean like a radio i mean like i already have that so the audience laughs right but what he couldn't picture back in 1994 is something like spotify the access to you the entire world's inventory of music on demand wherever you want it right uh maybe turning the question to to to anthony's do you think that this is some of the promise of defy too that like we've just invented these primitives that you guys have been talking about these new money legos right and so we have the potential to leapfrog traditional finance and banks and their capabilities with this whole new thing that we've unlocked called programmable money we haven't even seen the full extent of or can't even imagine the full extent of what's possible do you think there's an element of truth there and are there any examples that come to mind yeah i mean i think about this quite often uh and you used a good example there with bill gates trying to describe the internet i think in that moment or around that time bill gates was like this internet thing is going to change the world i just don't know how i know it's going to change the world i just don't know what way it's going to right and i can he couldn't really articulate it too well to people that were still stuck in the old world mindset right it is definitely a mindset thing uh it is something that it's kind of like a virus that needs to to spread to like a mind virus it needs to spread for people to kind of accept a new paradigm and that's what the internet was right and then you know 20 years later it's like oh that was obvious right of course we're going to have music on the internet of course we're going to have spotify you know of course we're going to have youtube which is one of the biggest sites in the world um so i think with ethereum we're in the same position now where we all know that there is something here right there is something special here we know it's revolutionary we see the revolution playing out in front of our eyes but we can never quite pinpoint what how it's going to play out or what's the what the next killer app is going to be right um you know even even like something like uni swap which everyone thinks is obvious you know automated market makers have been a thing for like decades like this is not a new concept right it's just that they didn't work before but now that you have a neutral kind of composable atomic infrastructure like ethereum automated market makers are the best thing you can build on ethereum at this point right in terms of product market fit and you know even uh people that they created ethereum like vitalik right and the core team they would i mean they wouldn't have been able to tell you exactly how it was going to play out like no one saw defy coming but they knew something was special was here they knew building ethereum was going to enable something special they knew that decentralized applications were going to to work and they believed that and they just they couldn't yeah they couldn't articulate it um to to like uh to basically give like any accurate predictions and i don't think we can at this point either give give too too accurate of prediction like we know d5 is going to be big we just don't know how it's going to play out we don't know how it's going to enter into the mainstream consciousness we kind of have you know theories that centralized institutions will build on top of these decentralized protocols which i actually think is how it's going to play out but we can't say for sure if uh d5 will usurp kind of c5 as it's known or tradfi for example um and i do agree with eric that there will be parallel worlds for a while uh people some people or at least maybe maybe even most people will always um prefer that kind of like security of centralization um for example and that that experience but the optionality is there to to opt out of that just like the internet gave you the optionality to opt out of a lot of centralized kind of things right you don't have to use gmail for your email you can have your own email server because it's on a neutral protocol right you can do all these sorts of things you can basically run your entire life you know off centralized institutions on the internet yes your experience may be maybe a bit worse right but you you get that kind of sovereignty back i think that's the same for ethereum and with d5 but i also think that dfi is going to offer a better product than than any of the centralized institutions can offer for the sole reason that d5 and ethereum all the apps and everything are open they will all talk to each other centralized businesses don't want to open themselves up to other centralized businesses for for competitive reasons they don't want other businesses coming in and seeing all their data and being like oh i can see what you're doing okay this is how i'll compete this is how i how i'll out compete you for example so it's just two diff completely different worlds that we're seeing play out and i mean my belief is that d5 wins out in the long run against these centralized institutions it's it's so funny because like like back in um uh 2019 or 18 before kind of the birth of d5 we started to see these use cases take hold this is part of the reason it's been hard to describe ethereum right because you net inevitably say something like yeah this is a you know an open finance open money system and it's going to change everything about the world right and somebody looks at you and thinks like well show me the use cases you're crazy and by the way you have to say like i don't know how it's going to change the world i don't know what the actual applications are going to be but i know it's going to change everything right that's what's difficult about the ethereum narrative sometimes it's it's just such a blank canvas and such um a white like open field of of potential that we can't even predict what the next applications are gonna be sorry i'm jumping in with with some bulkheads featured but david wanted to say something yes the the way i've i've been kind of illustrating the the uniqueness of defy is is as a as a as a platform is that in when it comes to building a money lego builders have two options they can build one brand new from scratch or they can build another one that connects other money legos and that's exactly what anthony was just saying with like all of traditional finance all of centralized finance is a bunch of walled gardens and so they only had one option available to them which is build something from scratch no nowhere in centralized finance is the ability to build a new company that is fundamentally based off of other companies right there's very little surface area for that and that's i think what defy is really uh optimized for is builders who want to build off of other things right like that second option of like i will build a brand new money lego using other money legos and that's something that you i don't think can be replicated based off of uh the legacy market would you guys say that that's one of them perhaps the prime feature of defy that makes it such a um thing that can grow so quickly and i'll start with eric yeah no i would definitely agree i mean if you think about the composability is absolutely insane right the the fact that you can i mean just all right let's take like the yield farming craze which i know has a bit of a you know people are negative or whatever um but just think about the fact that uh uni swap lp tokens became something right so you're you're providing liquidity you need swap right and all of a sudden you saw came along and said hey what if we tokenize your liquidity it seems so simple now but that's not something that existed previously and all of a sudden you're using your pooled liquidity as liquidity and collateral on other platforms and this is growing right like i think soon we're gonna see lp tokens used as like collateral on maker and all kinds of stuff um but the fact that we can just build on top of like so you have your base liquidity all of a sudden you can use that as collateral and liquidity you you like build up right and there's efficiencies gained in all of this so all of a sudden i've provided ethai i can now take that and use that somewhere else that protocol could go take that new somewhere else that doesn't exist in traditional finance right like not that easily at least there's like contracts involved in it take not smart contracts dumb contracts it takes multiple days to like sign this stuff so the composability is just crazy i mean there's obviously negatives to it where like things become too composable they don't think about like oracle attacks and all this stuff so we've seen you know these flashlight attacks and whatnot but i absolutely think you know we should start like memeing this and be this should be part of the narrative but composability is the pitch of d5 it truly is just what i was talking about a few minutes ago how anybody can put a line of code out there and be a part of this ecosystem that is composability right any like you were just saying they can build a new money lego or they can integrate one um this is the power of defy and it's not neces there's two powers there's a anybody can come in and build composability money legos there's b everybody has a trustless you know censorship resistant financial economy so i i think that part is kind of left out of our narrative i think we should start doing a little bit better with that because i think it attracts developers and attract like that really starts making people think uh because  it takes me 35 dollars in two days just to send a wire um you know sending heath is like the most simple thing you can possibly do on ethereum uh so yeah no i think that's a very powerful aspect of d5 dc you want to hop in on that yeah i mean i think and i want to talk a little bit about interoperability and and what that really means and i think the way that it's manifested in ethereum very often is an app's functionality is distilled into a token a wrapped token of some type and the fact that you can then take that somewhere else wrap it you could even imagine some of these assets being used you know taken off of chain in some respects and you're introducing certain trust assumptions there but when you think about what that universe could look like and how many of the important assets are already tokenizing on ethereum you really start to see this picture emerge of ethereum potentially becoming this global settlement layer for all of this economic activity and yes there are going to be parts that happen in the periphery on other chains on centralized platforms and so on but at the core a lot of those apps are going to originate on ethereum and at the very core of a lot of them i think is going to be ether because you want to have the most trustless decentralized asset that you can possibly have at the heart of some of these things and so i think that's the long-term vision and i do want to riff off of what you guys were talking about earlier around technology and what what's possible and what where we are right now so there's been a history in terms of you know technological revolutions when new technology comes around very often it's kind of emulating what the previous generations of technology could do it's just making it slightly faster or cheaper or something like that and i think we're seeing that with defy right now or that's how it started i should say it started mostly with services that people can like wrap their heads around okay yeah a lending app that makes sense okay an exchange app i get that but i think where we're headed we're gonna start seeing products that we we're going to struggle to understand in some respects and they're going to be things they're going to be niche products that are designed for very specific types of use cases that we can't imagine and some of the biggest consumers of those are going to be robots and machines and not necessarily humans you know and because they can have accounts too they can't have bank accounts you know and that so that's the cyber that's the cyberpunk future that we're headed towards that ethereum could enable every robot gets a bank account that's right they can make one whether you want them to or not that's a really important and good point by the way is one way this parallel d5 universe wins is on efficiency and cost there are so many humans involved in the traditional finance system that ethereum can just this sounds bad because it's replacing jobs but it will replace and like that is one way that traditional finances realize the power of this is how cost effective it is like the visa ustc news the other day they were they were citing how most customers it cost like up to 50 dollars to do certain transactions and they said on ethereum it cost like 50 cents that's that's a good point like that is one way this you know this ecosystem take that over anthony do you want to riff on that before i ask my next question yeah yeah i mean i totally agree composability is the thing uh it is what made d5 grow so much if you just look at the the data itself right and the growth of d5 during 2020 uh obviously a lot of it can be attributed to yield farming but why did yield farming work well because of composability without the composability yield farming will not have been a thing ever um and that's for the same reasons that the other the other guy spoke about in that we can tokenize these positions use them to you know earn other tokens for example it's like you know it's just crazy right tokenize your lp position put it into a contract earn tokens in another protocol right we saw crazy things like vampire attacks happening where sushi swaps stole liquidity from uni swap and things like that like these are not things you see in the traditional finance system and they don't play out this fast like if there is a it's normally called like a hostile takeover in the traditional system right not a vampire attack but that that takes a long time to play out this played out in a week like if if people remember the sushi swap saga like the main part of it lasted one week right and and this and and it's because of that efficiency as kind of eric was speaking to right it's because of that composability uh the incentives the fact that you can move liquidity as quickly as you can move data um right on the internet it's just it it's insane and i think i mean we are definitely undersell it because it's like second nature to us now we understand it but if we want to sell ethereum to people uh you know using those examples is is the first place to go i think but at the same time you know maybe not a lot of people think about the inefficiencies of the traditional system until they're exposed to ethereum i actually think that's another thing ethereum does is it kind of exposes all the flaws in the old world to people and they're like okay well why am i doing it like this when i can do it like this and it takes power away from the incumbents through that kind of mind virus of there is a better way and i think that's what the internet did as well right to traditional media it showed people was like oh i don't have to listen to like the traditional media i could just go online and and listen to whatever i want to listen to for better or worse right there are there are problems with that too but um so i think that's another thing that ethereum unlocks uh with with d5 specifically uh but yeah composability is is the thing without it none of this would work moving value as fast as data i think is a really awesome line that i think we've all heard before but i think we forget how powerful that is um but but guys let but you know there's a bunch of 20 there's like 30 billion dollars worth of stable coins on ethereum also btc on ethereum is like at all-time highs like why do we need ether like you know we can just use the other monies what what about what about ether um dc let's start with you you're muted dc sorry um i you know i don't view stable coins or wbtc or any other assets as displacing eth on ethereum um i think if anything and we'll start with stable coins they're really taking on some of that medium of exchange role of money and i think that's that's appropriate in the world that we live in today you denominate most people denominate their salary in in dollars or whatever fiat currency they use they make purchases in that currency so it makes sense for a medium of exchange for a lot of different assets to to be done in in in stable coins i also think though that you're seeing you're still seeing ether used as a medium of exchange for a lot of those assets and if you look at like the nft market you know the non-fungible tokens which are like these artworks these in-game items and so on they're tokenized on ethereum almost all of those are denominated in ether which i think is really interesting it's kind of like a native economy to ethereum so i wouldn't be surprised to see more of that but i think what that allows us to do is increasingly use ether as this programmable store of value which i think is really ether's kind of ultimate destiny it's really going to become the store of value and that value through the magic of smart contracts can be transmuted into so many different use cases and i think the other thing is we need to remember that almost all of these stable coins certainly the custodial stable coins have real trade-offs and i think it's easy to forget that sometimes right it's easy to get lazy and just be like oh yeah i'm just going to keep x amount of dollars in usdc well don't ever forget that usdc us usdt tether all of those are custodial stable coins and they're backed by u.s dollars in a bank account hopefully somewhere in usdc i'm pretty confident that they are with tether you know a little less confident but remember that those those platforms can be censored and if you're dealing with really high value transactions um and you want to minimize trust they're not going to be suitable for you and so that's where i think ether still has to play a role in in this actual decentralized economy which i do think credibly is going to take longer to emerge right and we we've been developing pieces and parts of that but it's natural that we go for the low hanging fruit custodial stuff first but as we perfect those models it gives us more insight into how to develop stronger decentralized models so i think it really is a synergistic relationship it's bringing more economic activity to ethereum and i think at the end of the day you'll hear me harp on this the two most important things to me are bringing more economic activity to ethereum and and watching that result in more liquidity for ether if we do those two things i'm very confident that ethereum is going to change the world i i recently tweeted out the question like why aren't you an eth bull yet so that was like last week that of course is twitter so i got a whole bunch of posts right like uh eth has no scarcity all of these things right but one of the po one of the the um replies which actually is a relatively uh popular belief is that eth is maybe the internet of money as as you've been talking about it's been saying defy is the apps built on top so think of that as like the apple or the facebook or the amazon or whatever the wealth didn't go to the internet to tcp it went to those businesses on top it went to the application layer so this one reply says i'm a d5 bull but an eth bear what's your response to that all the people are like yeah permissionless open finance d5 bull i think wi-fi is great but ethi asset meh not so sure about yeah i mean and i understand the point of view of some of those folks they're viewing everything from the orientation of like the legacy system they're not thinking about the decentralized world that we are creating here and i think you know i recently wrote some tweets on on this but the value of an asset is something that is emergent it's not something that you can like dictate in advance right and when the ethereum devs first created ethereum um all the public perception was that eath was gas right and it's like oh yeah we're using ethan's gas and eath is still gas you know it's still but but the gas fees and i do think this is important for listeners to understand um the fee market floats independently of the east price so you know just because east price goes up doesn't mean gas becomes more expensive in u.s dollar terms or whatever fiat currency you're using but i think just being able to kind of think about you know ether is is this unique asset in this ecosystem there is no other asset on ethereum that will ever have the properties of ether and and and i think that when you really want to get at that decentralized parallel decentralized economy that we're talking about ether is going to be at the central center of that has that been fully developed right now no but is it developing i think it's absolutely developing i mean and i think the biggest example is actually in these decentralized lending platforms um where the most popular collateral by far is ether and people are actually depositing and locking up their ether as a store of value literally and they are borrowing stable coins against it and and that and i think that's or they're creating stable coins through maker maker die and i think that is fascinating because it completely changes the psychology around ether from something that you burn as gas to something that you're hoarding and so i go back to my what i was said at the top the the value of an asset is emergent and how people use it in the market and maybe the ethereum developers who created ethereum never thought that people would be using ether in this way but people realized the properties of ether and are using it in this way and i think that is that is fascinating and i think we've again barely scratched the surface of that kind of use case in an older article i wrote about how all roads on ethereum lead to ether um and eric i'm i'm wondering if you want to uh vet that statement yeah no i totally agree and i think it goes with what ryan just asked what dc was responding with and i'll respond to that initial tweet comment that ryan was saying i think it fits david what you just asked but you couldn't use the internet okay let me let me put it this way you can't use ethereum without eath you can't you have to have it for gas it's if you want to go a little bit beyond that you pretty much need it for collateral that's arguable but even if you just want to transact with stable coins you need eve you don't need internet coin to use internet and if you did people imagine what the price of that would be at this point i don't even know right like if you had like the smallest percent of that you would live in a you know if connecting to your wi-fi you had to pay internet coins yeah exactly right so you do need to eat the transact and that will never change there's been attempts at economic abstraction that's not going to happen right especially with proof of stake you are going to have to have heat to transact on ethereum that alone is you know is strong enough and david you're just saying you know with the relationship between ethan ethereum they go hand in hand to me i don't understand people that think of it any differently if you if you are like using ethereum and let's let's say you come into a theorem through usdc right um what are you going to do you're going to start exploring d5 slowly you're going to start to think about okay what are the benefits of eth okay you know it's trustless that the monetary policy is eventually going down to deflationary removing a proof of stake you're gonna start getting sucked into this right you might start thinking about okay there's inflation scares in the u.s or if i lived in a third world country my currency like you're gonna start falling into listening to these type of podcasts and people that are into ethereum you're not gonna just like go on and be like oh yeah usdc is cool i'm gonna start using d5 and keep it like i don't think that's going to happen so i think anybody that's coming into d5 through stable coins and thinking they're just going to stay there is you know delusional to themselves and i think you know the most important part is you're always going to need ease to transact on ethereum if that is it that's already a bold case for eth you know people falling into the trap of realizing the traps are probably people falling into the d5 like realization and you know how valuable each could be and oh hey i could have this asset that you know my government or someone doesn't tell me that i have to have but i could have it and i could use this as collateral and take out a loan that you know people start to realize how powerful that is you know what's funny to me eric is there does seem to be like a double standard in in crypto where no one would ever say that about bitcoin oh like like bitcoin the network but not bitcoin the asset bitcoin the network would be fine without bitcoin the asset yet the standard is applied to ethereum and really bitcoin as an asset on the bitcoin network does the same thing it pays for blocks why do you think this double standard exists um scared bitcoin maximalists i mean this is what i mean seriously this is what like we've all went out and said yeah i mean this is what anthony and i have been fighting with ethub forever now at this point basically it's true though right like the questions that we were just talking about if you said that to someone into bitcoin they would just shrug you off right like oh what if someone come home with usdc and like you know it just doesn't make sense so i this is amazing to me that these are the narratives i think the ethereum community you know anthony was talking about earlier since 2018 we've come a long way and i think people are realizing that is too ethereum as btc is to bitcoin it's the same thing bitcoin is gas money it just is right and like where we jump 10x over that is eth is trustless collateral ethe is the staking asset is gonna be burned uh using one five five nine so we're we're taking those leaps further and you know what the these like flood narratives from maximus they're fine they come and go like we fight them move on um i agree we're one cycle behind but that just means we're gonna go to freaking whatever 10k next cycle and we're at 1k now but that's fine um but they're the same thing at the end of the day and eth can be used for more than bitcoin can right now if you are looking for the front page of defy look no further than xerion.io xerion is your

wallet so check them out at monolith.xyz anthony what do you want to add to that uh i had a lot of thoughts listening to the other guys um but i'm gonna i'm just gonna come right and say it uh eth is the most amazing asset in crypto uh it will get more amazing as time goes on there is a extremely strong plan to make it the best asset and to make ethereum and eth uh into and d5 on all the apps built on top into what i like to call a symbiotic relationship so there are three value accrual pillars for eth right there is useless trustless collateral within d5 or whatever else you want to use it with uh staking right that just went live and we've already seen 1.1 1.5 million eighth kind of locked up there which is a billion dollars worth of eighth and finally erp one five five nine and paying paying gas fees um but i think the payment for gas fees is you know i mean it's bullish because the more use the more ease needs to be bought to kind of pay gas fees but i think it becomes like way more bullish once we have fee burning in place so once we have proof of stake uh a proof of stake networks a normal proof of work with ethereum 1.0 we just have ethereum 2.0 proof of stake network with credibly low issuance less than one percent in the worst case like if there's like 30 million each stake it's still going to be one percent or less right and i don't think we're ever going to get the 30 million each staked um if we did the eighth price would probably be at 10k um but uh so we have that happening right then take all the activity happening on ethereum across absolutely everything doesn't matter what you're doing if you are doing a transaction and you're paying eighth gas fees a partial a portion of that eight is getting burnt right if we can increase the transactional activity to a point where more eath is being burnt that is being issued a year it becomes deflationary there is no other asset that can claim that within crypto uh a lot of i mean assets that have viewed historic values within kind of like the meat space like gold cannot claim this it is not deflationary it becomes the world's best store of value uh in my view um out of absolutely anything right so once we have those pieces all in place and we are we are doing that that is the ultimate bull case and that's exactly why i keep buying eth even at these prices right i am not buying just for today i am buying for the future because that is a future that i'm extremely confident in that's going to happen so to go back to the original question about things displacing eth that's nev that's not going to happen just because foreign assets come over they fill other niches like uh what fill other use cases like stable coins obviously took the medium of exchange use case away from eth which is a good thing we don't like you know like is money but it is not like great money right it is not stable so it's not it's not like the best money that we can have on the network so a usd stablecoin kind of fits that right wbtc is collateral i mean that's centralized collateral and that's fine right that's just more liquidity as dc was saying to come into the ethereum ecosystem and as i said once we have fee burning in place all of these assets just increase ethereum's network effect and increase its value because it's burning eve so yes you're a foreign asset but you've got to pay taxes to the network right if someone is using that asset you're paying you're essentially paying taxes to the ethereum network right through burning these fees and you're um and you know it's funny because if there's people on the network that don't even like as an asset well too bad if you want to use our network you need to uh burn eat and you need to accrue value to eat so that's like the whole bull case there and to me it's obvious and as i said like still buying eighth based on that thesis what you described sounds like an extremely um you know disinflationary austrian style economy which always like blows my mind when bitcoiners who would subscribe to like austrian sort of scarce money principles completely reject eath's role as a deflationary currency i don't understand it blows my mind but we don't have to solve that today this is the book just i mean it's just like everyone has a bias right um you know and it's all it's all human psychology but i think the more middle of the road bitcoin is from what i've seen the more centrist they see this vision and they they kind of like understand it and they think that fee burning for a network token uh so like the the protocol token of ethereum um makes a lot of sense and and and accrues a lot of value i am 100 sure that um you know bitcoiners would love to have fee burning in in bitcoin for btc but they know that it that bringing just bringing that up as an idea would be kind of like sacrilege it would never happen because bitcoin's too ossified right so they push back against it they're like oh if we can't do it then it's a bad idea well looks like we're gonna do it guys and you can keep dealing with that as as you like yeah they're not going to do it they're not going to do anything until they have to add inflation yeah and then and then do we have bitcoin anymore really a whole separate can of worms but i will say you know i i'll say that what we're creating in ethereum is not for bitcoin maximalist it's for everyone else in the world and i think that's really important to remember because a lot of the narratives that have been pushed over the past couple of years around ethereum and ether as an asset they're not going to hold up for all of the new entrants that are coming into this market and when they take the time to understand even now with ether's pretty modest issuance which is which is fairly actually on par with bitcoin um more or less um you know it's it's it's already a lot better than fiat currency first of all but once they understand this concept that anthony's described around fee burning and as the network is used more it's burned and and because of perpetual issuance security will always be guaranteed um that's that's when the sophisticated investors and you already see some of the sophisticated investors like raul powell and some of the people that he advises they're paying attention to this stuff right the people who are bringing millions and eventually billions of dollars in this space are paying attention to this stuff they're not just going to be told the maximalist drivel that has been perpetrated for the past two three years and take it as sacrosync so i think that that is a huge opportunity for ether as it starts to really go mainstream yeah i i think that's an a plus point to be honest i don't think ethereum should fall into trying to be bitcoin it like the narratives can be different we can do things different there there's no reason for eth to try to fall in the footsteps we get we'll be fine on our own speaking of not following in the footsteps of bitcoin uh and i do want to turn to what anthony accidentally gave was the uh future road map for the rest of this podcast with his recently bowl case i want to turn to staking um and so here here's the the pessimistic stake on take on staking and maybe you guys can answer this no one wants yield on a volatile cryptocurrency like staking doesn't have mass appeal like who who people that are interested in yield aren't interested in earning earning it denominated in this volatile crypto asset that they haven't heard of before why why does staking have mass appeal um let's start with you anthony i mean a billion dollars worth of eighth once yield on their eighth so i think we can throw out that argument especially i mean no part of that argument especially because that eighth is also locked right so you don't need like not not all of it but like a lot of it right is locked for one to two years so you don't even have exit liquidity on that right unless you do some fancy things like with with um derivatives but most people aren't going to do that i i assume so like we've already seen such a strong outpouring of support for each staking right and people who want to stake for various reasons not everyone is like a profit maximalist who's going to min max their profits and like try and optimize and squeeze out every last cent right people are humans are different humans have different ways of doing things they're pragmatic creatures they're going to do what makes sense in their position right so you know i have a few friends who would never touch defy yield farming but they went straight into staking they didn't even think about it it's like staking is what i'm going to do i'm putting my ether in there that's it right and they have their own reasons for doing that so i don't i mean and it's the same thing with like i think with bitcoin mining too or mining in general like why mine a volatile asset right well because that you know you you get to a point where you're where it makes sense to do so because you're profiting from it outside of your expenses too right so i mean i don't think that the volatility of the asset really matters too much and it matters even less for proof-of-stake because you don't have those exorbitant ongoing costs as well right you can weather the storm much better in a bear market for eth right even if eighth price drops a lot your ongoing costs are a lot less so you can weather the storm it means you don't have to like dump lots and lots of teeth to cover your costs you don't have to like do all these sorts of weird hedging and and kind of like worrying about things so i i mean i don't think the volatility matters too much and i think we've already seen evidence of that um and you know i believe if there was a two-way bridge between ethan and e2 we would be at a lot more than 1.5 million each staked uh probably up at like five million or something something crazy um so yeah i mean that's that's kind of like my view on it eric i know you're uh running a validator or two uh i'm gonna throw that over eric i know that you've gotten into uh validating in the ethereum world why what makes you so uh bullish about today is goddamn one more time here we go eric i know that you've gotten into the world of staking and tinkering with your validators what gets you so excited about the concept of staking ether yeah i mean there's a lot of depth to this question and like what anthony was just saying too and i think you know we we need to realize we've been talking about very nascent technologies right like we're talking about investing in something that over the next i don't know 20 30 years like we're already what six seven years in this journey it's doing very well i think it could do much better over the next coming years um so why does staking matter right you can take an asset that you're taking a risk on you know um volatility and all of this is actually something that attracts people to crypto you can take this and apply like a traditional finance thing of dividends to it so not only are you kind of investing in this and and you're probably okay at this point with it going up and down like you know 80 a year or whatever it might be you can also earn yield on that so that is something that attracts traditional finance people you say to someone hey so let me just take an example i've talked to a lot of family and friends about investing in crypto over the years i'm not someone that goes and reaches out to people and says hey you should invest in crypto if someone comes to me i'll respond to them it's much easier for me to pitch hey you can invest and also earn a dividend or yield on your crypto than just saying hey you can invest and it might go up or down now it seems a little ridiculous to say that given that it's only like 13 at crypto can go up and down so much but i've realized how valuable that is to people and just knowing that you're going to get some type of return on top of the crypto which they think is hard to value has been a nice pitch for people to get in um so for me personally i'll say one more thing it's obvious there's a lot of tax reasons for this you go into crypto it's going up and down it might go up a lot in a year to cash that out at least in the u.s you're probably paying anywhere between 25 to 50 in taxes you take that eath and instead you just hold it you stake it you earn a yield on top of that yes you're paying yield on that but you're not paying on the sell amount so i think there's multiple facets to this i think it attracts people to say hey look there's this dividend you can get that it a lot of people like that um and also if you are a long-term investor it helps you like avoid taxes and still get some profit out of eth there's something about that passive income element that you're talking about eric right like we uh like um we did we did kind of a show and just with the youth calculator to figure out how much it would actually take to retire on eath where you just have enough eath in capital and you're producing enough eth from a yield perspective to just cash it out and kind of ride each year in in retirement and i think people i think you're absolutely right that's probably an underrated aspect of of staking i mean people buy rental properties they do all sorts of things that that um like might make different levels of financial sense but they do it for this passive income aspect so one putting on my bitcoiner hat because i'm good at that uh dividends or yield from ether is actually dilution right we are diluting people that are not staking for in favor of the people that are staking and so the the bitcoiner criticism would be like well that you're just creating yield from senior edge you're actually just diluting away the values of other of other people's ether for your value of staked ether making ether not a very compelling asset to hold because you if you aren't staking it you're getting diluted how would you guys let's start with you dc how would you um how do you respond to a criticism like that so i think the first point in a proof-of-stake system is that issuance is is far lower than it would be in a proof-of-work system and and you do have i mean you do have a for you you have a form of dilution even in a proof of work system in the sense of if there's if there's issuance of supply without a burning mechanism that's introducing new supply and guess what most miners are just dumping it so for all intents and purposes that that is creating that dynamic but i think another important and and the sister kind of proposal that's going to be baked into eth2 is there's going to be fee burning in eth2 and that fee burning actually creates a mechanism by which it creates a benefit for all eath holders and i think that's critically important to understand so yes if you're staking your eth you're going to earn a reward but remember that in this fee burning model fees are going to be burned and there's going to be 200 eip 1559 as well and as those fees are burned the ethereum supply will contr contract or it will stay relatively stable you know there'll be periods where we'll oscillate a little bit but the expectation is over time that the ethereum supply stays stable or declines and as that supply declines all holders of youth benefit from the economic hardening of the asset so it actually creates the fee burning is actually a very democratic proposal in that respect because it distributes a benefit to all youth holders you guys want to rip on that yeah i mean i i'm not gonna claim to be a master of like economics or anything like that or like um totally understand the intricacies of how a fiat system works but i think uh to dc's point i mean i described before right how eth can potentially become deflationary due to fee burning and all that good stuff and you know dc mentioned that under proof of stake the issuance is much lower than in a proof of work system but the the thing is is that we expect each to to go up in price right maybe not to go up 100 a year into perpetuity or whatever you know but we do expect it to keep going up right as as the network becomes more valuable um and and and it obviously won't go up forever but if the if the overall issuance is 0.5 right for the whole network but the eth price goes up much more than that then do people really care that they're being diluted right i mean i wouldn't like why would i care that i'm being quote unquote diluted people care about it with fear because fear is pegged and stable right and you are getting kind of like inflated away and your dollar is worth less it has less purchasing power but if it's going up right and it's going up more than the new issuance in terms of like percentage-wise then your purchasing power goes up and that's what really matters it doesn't really matter about the there's more tokens in circulation or anything like that so yeah that would that would be my main pushback as i said i i'm not an expert on all the intricacies here but that's how i understand it and that's how i think a lot of people will view it as well i also i want to add a thought and this has been really i've noticed this in the market really in the past few weeks is we're seeing a lot more stakes ether tokens as well that are going to be hitting the market and and the demand for that is frankly a lot higher than i thought it would be and and the space has emerged way faster than i thought it would and i'm definitely not going to make any recommendations to use any of those because i think there's a lot of risks with that and your basic most of them follow some kind of custodial model some of them are decentralized pools but you could actually imagine that a lot there's a whole bunch of you that get staked and even if you're not running a validator you might be holding staked either and and i think it's i think it's actually going to get easier and easier to run validators over time and to do more of these decentralized pools where even if you don't have 32 eth you can still stake guys ready to move on cool all right so we've been dancing around the subject of eip155 one five five nine so let's just go ahead and dive right into it uh and one other thing that fascinates me about eip1559 is not just the the fee burning but the combination of eip1559 and sharding like what happens when we both get scale and also fee burning and this is a something i i don't know the answer to and i want to pose to the group if we increase the amount of block space we'll increase the amount of block supply which means we'll probably burn less fees at the start but does that scale that we have from shards from having 64 shards does that increase the potential of total fee burn over time uh eric let's start with you so this is one of my favorite questions in the space right now and i'll say i don't know the answer i don't know how this is going to play out but traditionally it's been the bullish case that there's demand for block space if your block space is filled up that's bullish the reason for that is no one has actually scaled no no blockchain in demand has scaled ethereum and bitcoin are in demand they haven't scaled yet we don't really know how this is going to react when we scale so let's say we increase ethereum's capacity 64 times right we're not really sure are we going to get like two times the current demand or 64 times the current demand and neither of those cases is bearish and the old world view of block space needs to be in 100 demand right because in each of those cases ethereum is more in demand so now let's put this in the one five five nine use case where one five five nine is burning fees if block space is pretty full we're burning more yes we would want a more in-demand blockchain but just being two times more in demand is not the worst thing right you're still burning a little bit more i truly don't know how this is going to play out um we saw like today uh average gas price was like 330 gray which is insane most people using d5 i think we're paying 20 to 30 for a transaction so the demand is there in high demand times you know maybe tomorrow the next day it calms back down to 20 or something like that i don't know what it is right now let's see 74 so it's still super high um but i think this old narrative of you know and i've pushed this narrative on ethereum so i'm not going to lie i'm part of this but this this current narrative of block space needs to be in demand for the asset to be bullish is going to get thrown out the window when sharding comes along and when layer 2 comes along because what actually matters is how many people are using your blockchain and we just like kind of package that in this weird narrative of oh we're limited so you know people we're at x amount of users that's our cap that's bullish it's actually more bullish if you're under your cap but you're doing five times as many users 10 times 25 50. we've just never seen a blockchain actually do that yet because the ones that have promised it don't have users and the ones that have users haven't scaled so this is going to be one of the more fascinating things to watch for me in this space the interesting thing about all the scaling too is like more transactions probably more users more users exposed to ethereum what asset are they going to want to buy eth right so that also has a like some sort of um like byproduct effect but i want to ask you this eric because probably the biggest criticism i've seen about eip 1559 is that it's not here yet you know like there's some doubt that it will ever come to ethereum and i want to ask that question so if we define ethereum as both like what we probably all do both eth1 and eth2 that is ethereum it's the ethereum network what is the probability that we don't get eip 1559 because it's not here yet i would say if if you asked me this question six months ago i would say 25 today i'm going to answer 95 so i think um tim biko has should be championed among the entire ethereum space for taking the lead on one five five nine you know all the client teams and everything the ef everyone's helped here and i think finally the community has realized we're all on the same page tim roughgarden's report came out and i think that flipped some of the naysayers i think this is going to happen i actually will go on record and say i think it's going to happen in 2021 as well um so there's been a lot of bullish momentum around one five five nine last few weeks and i think it's like a lot of things coming together so there's not just one happening but i just want to throw a shout out to tim because i think you know anthony and i talked about this last week on the podcast but it's not that we have a lack of like genius people in the ethereum space to make this stuff happen we actually have a lack of people that are capable of coordinating people to come together and build these things um and i feel like tim has done that with 1559 and i i'm very bullish on it getting in at this point anthony i want to ask the next question to you how does eip-1559 change the characterization of ether the asset like what is ether the asset before fee burning and what does that what does the addition of fee burning how does that change ether the asset what does that change it into yeah so i think i described this a bit before how it kind of may you know potentially i'm not i'm not going to say that it's 100 going to be net deflationary at all times but it potentially turns you know eth into this net deflationary kind of asset um and you know fee burning isn't anything new there are there are apps that use this you know make a dow being the famous example and they're actually criticized for this right uh where that that that people believe that the fee burning mechanism of make a dao doesn't actually make sense um but it make but people the same people praise ethereum and say a and and 1.59 and say that it makes sense for that and david you put out a tweet the other day and you were kind of having trouble you know squaring this in in your head but i think it it i mean i don't think that if eighth was just a token that was burnt and that was all it would work right the thing is is that is a lot more than that you know whereas the mkr token really isn't right and kr's not a store of value right it's none of that stuff um whereas eth is right um is used to stake empower isn't so if you do those kind of comparisons there then you can kind of find the difference and why fee burning makes a lot more sense right but on top of that ethereum as a network right is a lot bigger than than maker as a protocol um so if we're looking at the fee burning so you know there's just there's not going to just be those who who use the maker system paying um mkr fees and getting those burnt it's going to be absolutely everyone on ethereum doing anything that's going to be paying those that that fee burning um so yeah it has to be taken as a holistic thing it can't just be looked at as you know one five five nine comes in we burnt each number go up no because i mean each number went up before we had even staking right we only had eighth as i guess you could call it like gas or eth as um you know emergent story value all that sort of stuff uh and we and then all those use cases come together and then feed burning just reinforces that and adds another value accrual pillar for eighth dc if somebody wants exposure to ethereum the economy does fee burning allow for that to happen in in either the asset or is ether the asset already tracking the ethereum the economy or how do you how do you think about whether or not fee burning enables ether the asset to be more reflective of ethereum the economy or not i i think it does to an extent because i think certainly the more economic activity there is on ethereum the more east is going to get burned under a feed burning mechanism and i you know i was thinking about eric's response to your question on on how sharding will affect things and and i agree it's hard to predict but my general hypothesis is there will never be enough ethereum block space on l1 no matter how much you have it will get used up and when if you're talking in order of if you're talking an increase of even 64x which and i think most of the current proposals aren't saying we're going to make it 64x overnight it would be like a roll out process where you're adding shards as capacity as demand comes online but basically i think a lot of activity realistically is going to eventually shift to l2 anyway and when you think about that that enables even more transactions and so i mean the goal eventually is millions of transactions on these additional layers and what does that make that makes those layer one commits by those layer twos even more valuable in terms of the block space that they're willing to pay for and how much they're willing to pay so i think that if you're interested in ethereum as an economy as a platform ether is still the best way to gain access to to that investment upside and it's the most diversified way because i mean while i think defy will continue to be a big driver and i do think there's some great d5 projects which i'm invested in there's going to be other things that come up like the nft economy which is actually denominated primarily in ether as i mentioned earlier there's going to be all kinds of other use cases we don't know which project token is going to necessarily do best over five years or 10 years i don't even know if any of these projects will necessarily be the ones that are dominant then i do know that the network will still use ether and i do know that either it will still be the hardest uh you know with eip1559 and the most ubiquitous and the most used and useful asset on the platform there's a bunch of debate as to how do we get access to exposure to ethereum right and we have that the dpi token which is the tracker of d5 it's like a d5 index and then there's been debate as to like does ether get you a share of the ethereum economy does it give you upside exposure to the growth of ethereum uh eric how do you see the relationship between ether the asset and ethereum the economy yeah i mean as far as like getting exposure to ethan d phi i i would still pick eth first um i think you know earlier we talked about cycles right so it starts with bitcoin is in a mature cycle youth to me is in a mid to mature cycle defies in a young to mid maturity cycle so if if you it all depends on like your risk tolerance how old you are how much you have to invest how much you have to lose like all these things right so if you want exposure to eth and d5 it's ethan like dpi right um but as far as like i totally agree with what dc just said if you want just true exposure to ethereum it's eth right it is always going to be used for gas it's always going to be the base collateral it's going to be what you use to stake so if you're looking for just a safe let's put these in huge quotes safe first like you know traditional investments right it's eth um if you want to add a little riskier portfolio something that sure maybe you could go to zero maybe we're all crazy there is the one percent scenario where that exists right um you hop into uh d5 pulls into actually you hop into you know wifi or whatever your favorite defy coin is these days um put that as a part of your portfolio but if you want exposure to a new financial economy to defy to a trustless financial internet just hold eth you're not going to be disappointed maybe you're chasing some things one day or the other but trust me you're not going to be disappointed in that eric i think you made someone's head explode when we just called ether and bitcoin the uh the conservative less risky assets right right but it's all relative it's relative to the rest of the crypto economy i i think yeah i mean i think on the risk thing i think that's a really good point but you know i think what the reason why it takes uh big money so long to come into things is because they don't like risk right they want things to be quote unquote de-risked and i guess btc is at that point now for a lot of people right where it's like you know it's it's it's not going to zero we're confident in that we're confident that the narratives make sense and that you know everything around it makes sense we're gonna buy it because we feel like it's de-risked ethul as as eric said it will move into that on the maturity scale over time and then d5 will as well but it's it's it's not like rocket science like if you're investing in an early stage company no matter if it's like a defy kind of company or a traditional company or whatever um it's still risky right it's a risky venture there's the same set of risks uh so you're you're basically taking on that risk for higher potential upside uh and you know it's it's very hard to outperform the the the indexes in the traditional finance system just like it's very hard to outperform the kind of i guess whatever on indexes to encrypt though btc and maybe potentially the d5 pulse index as well so it's just it's literally always all about risk and that's how you should manage you know yourself and your investments and that's not investment advice but i think that's just common sense this has been a really awesome conversation about ethereum the economy and ether the asset and i think we would be remissed if we didn't talk about nfts because that is a whole its own conversation in of itself we've dedicated entire podcasts to this we'll probably dedicate more entire podcasts to this but it definitely belongs in the conversation of what ethereum is as an economy and i and i think uh dc out of the three people here you are the one uh most focused in on on nfts although we all are in some respect so i want to start with you with that this conversation what are nfts and as a tool for ethereum what do they allow ethereum as an economy to do yeah so um you know nft stands for non-fungible tokens and that's in contrast to this concept of fungible tokens so i think it's helpful to define by exclusion a little bit so fungible tokens are like ether or like die or even like usdc and other tokens where it doesn't matter if you get one or the other they're all basically equivalent and can be used for the same purposes nfts are different in the sense of each one that is tokenized is unique in some way or it has or has the ability to be unique and i think we've seen nfts emerge in a few different areas that are interesting and fundamentally i think there's three areas that people should be keeping an eye out for so first is like artwork and gaming and i think that's the easiest to kind of understand at this point everyone's seen these nfts on wearable and other marketplaces like openc where you can go on and you can buy um ownership rights to a digital artwork now of course anyone can view the the gif or whatever file format backs that but you're the one that owns it and you're the one that has the right to kind of sell that token to someone else and there's some exclusivity within that and i think that's why these things have value which is also why i think the traditional art market has value and i think the other side of that are these gaming nfts which are also super exciting and we see that in games like axey infinity and gods unchained where these are in-game items that you can basically use as part of the game in some cases you can level them up you can you can meet them with each other and create new nfts you know cryptokitty style the first nft game um but there's a ton of potential there and some of those axes are going for huge amounts of dollars i mean i think there was one that sold for like a hundred thousand dollars and we've seen crypto kitties go for huge amounts too so they border this line they bridge this gap between like a piece of artwork slash status symbol and an in-game item and i think we've barely scratched the surface there a second category i think is going to be around like access rights and having an nft in your wallet allows you to do certain things it's like a membership token right and i think there's a lot of value to that too because you could imagine someone issuing a membership token limiting the amount and saying we're only going to have a thousand members but you can sell your token to whomever you want and you gotta you gotta sell the whole thing you can't sell like a part of it um and i think that is that's a very interesting set of use cases that i think will also see a lot of activity on and then the third is really around kind of financial products and some people don't think of nfts within that context but we've seen in the urine ecosystem they put a lot of effort into kind of thinking about how to create these unique financial contracts which are insured and are tradable and they're nfts in the sense of they have to be unique because each contract has unique properties but that's another fundamental use of nfts so i and i think a lot when a lot of people talk about nfts they're just talking about gaming but you really need to think about all those use cases and i think in order for nfts to really take off on ethereum that is where we need some ability to scale and i think we are seeing some roll up centric solutions like gods and changes rolling out immutable x which is going to be an nft focused l2 and that's going to be available for others to use so i'm really excited to see what happens in this space yeah to me the way i see nfts is is exactly how you uh described it at the start where like first there's cash in monies and we call ethereum the internet of money but i also i rather prefer the term internet of value because if you have just money like you're not then we're not talking about specific assets right your your house the deed to your house is a real world nft right it's it's very unique it is registered to one specific thing and it's not cash and so as ethereum as an internet of value especially when we start to integrate the conversation of like more economic activity plus eip1559 having having like this surface area of nfts where any type of asset can be represented any unique asset can be represented could add just more overall transactional volume on to the ethereum economy eric anthony either of you want to riff off that so yeah it's the financial internet david get with the new memes come on oh that's that has not heard that one that was news no no i i totally agree with you and like just i'll just say quickly um i think where we were talking earlier where we're burning transaction fees and why do you need to eat it's these use cases that are going to branch out from ethereum nfts we're going to branch out and all of a sudden you're like wait people need yeast to transact to get nfts wait we're burning each like all of a sudden these use cases count up and the amount of burn to eat the amount of eve people need to accumulate to use ethereum starts going up so i i totally agree it's not just it goes beyond and we're talking about now the financial internet and probably even going beyond that once you know i i i on the world computer but we could bring that back someday when we're ready um so i think we'll get there but these use cases just start blossoming and you start realizing how important ethe actually is yeah i i'd basically mirror exactly what what eric and dc have said there um i think i mean it's going to bring in a new cohort of people nfts for sure we're already seeing that right with people doing collaborations with nifty gateway i'm sure many of the people that came in and saw what he was doing did not know what crypto was beforehand did not know what ethereum was and any of that sort of stuff so i'm bullish on that now you know on that bringing a whole cohort of new people because i mean you know d5 is fun and everything but it only i mean the deep in the weeds defy stuff only attracts a certain kind of person one that like he's happy to take on a lot of risk right do a lot of speculation and everything like that at least d fires that exists today obviously we want to get d5 to a point where it's like you know has all kind of the economy running through it and it appeals to everyone but that's not what it is today whereas you know nfts appeal to a whole entire subset of people that are in the art ecosystem the gaming ecosystem right interested in like insurance products too i mean you know nfts we we saw you could tokenize insurance uh positions right and things like that so um i'm just really bullish on that how about interested in collecting uh figurines and things i mean you could tokenize the i guess like the ownership of them uh that would that would work uh to represent i'm just looking at anthony's shelves of figurines behind it on a zoo background here um well guys this this has been fantastic and i i think we kind of want to end with this because um i think we're all like bitcoin hit all-time highs um ethereum ether is back over 600 in price like um the highest price it's been two years two and a half years something like that yeah two nine years i feel like we all realized that we have come out of the the bear market right we're kind of on the other side right now we're on the ascent um last time we had an ascent like this was ethereum of uh 2017 and now we're ethereum 2020. i guess my question is what's different 2017 versus 2020 what are some of the the new strengths we have the new weaknesses what's kind of different about this bull run and the ethereum of 2020. maybe we'll start with you anthony i think everything is different uh i think i'd like i i can't really like i was in in ethereum in 2017 throughout the whole bull market then um i can't really find too many similarities uh i think maybe the community is quite similar in terms of like the the the core community in terms of their values what they want to see happen and everything like that but the network has evolved to to kind of like be a home for so many new use cases i mean maker dow didn't launch until december 2017. so essentially we didn't really have anything really d5 within 2017 right that we know as d5 today the main use case was icos right um which obviously ended very badly for a lot of people and ended very badly for the eighth price after eighth went up uh because of that so i mean yeah without going into like everything that that that has changed i i do really think that that it's a totally different game now uh everyone that was in ethereum in 2017 that that may have left and comes back now will see that and be like wow this is like nothing like i remember for good reasons it's not like we got worse we got like so much better right and we became a serious kind of financial network rather than a play thing or a casino because really i believe that 2017 ethereum was a casino even though people like to call d fire casino that's nothing compared to what happened in 2017 right um and all the speculation that went on then i think back then the price got way ahead of where the technology was you know people legitimately thought eth2 was launching in 2017 right and bought eighth because of that and that was another hype narrative at the time so this time we're delivering all the things that were promised back then right and more so yeah total just totally different ecosystems you can compare absolutely everything that happened and and find a difference there eric same question you yeah i would say i think we earned this like so the famous metallic tweet is did we earn this when ethereum went above or around a thousand last time i think we earned it this time i truly do believe that like i think we've built very cool products products that can be used by people across the world you know innovative products interesting products um i think we have years to go still but i i think we can say at this point we've earned it and i i think you know looking at each price 652 right now who knows what it is when this podcast goes out um probably anywhere between 400 and a thousand but um i i do i feel good about looking at it now truly when it first went up to that 1400 i i you know it was it felt like just pure speculation and all that and i think this feels good and i think i don't i'm not gonna i'm not a price predictor i don't know where it's going but i think we're building something great here well eric we're definitely getting to price predictions so maybe you should start chewing on your uh answer for that question soon but uh well while you chew on that answer i want to turn to dc and get his take on that on the same uh same question yeah you know back at the height of the 2017 bull market the most exciting thing was like crypto kitties and that was all the rage and just think how far we've come since then in terms of impactful apps and by the way i think cryptokitties was actually really cool for its time and very innovative and chartered a lot of really interesting things in the nft space but d5 in general did not really exist in the way that it does today and i think anthony touched on this too like during the last cycle eth was really being used primarily as that medium of exchange to buy tokens and being being stuffed into project treasuries just waiting to be sold basically in a lot of cases and i don't think that was really the most compelling and most valuable use of ether as a financial asset i think what's really different to me this time is how eth is being used as a financial asset now which is increasingly as the store of value you know two years ago or three years ago ether to most people was still gas and that sometimes mle money now ether is on the verge of becoming a macro asset that's being sought after by very wealthy investors to diversify their portfolios into alternative assets and soon they're going to realize it's something that's becoming more scarce and can generate income so you know to me it's really the emergence of ether as a financial asset that i think is going to be the defining feature of this bull run you know dc before we get to price predictions for everyone because those are fun for a lot of people listening especially because i think this this bull market will will play out over months and people might refer back to this episode they weren't around in 2017. this will be their first crypto bull market right you guys have been through bull markets what advice do you have for someone who's going through their first bull market what would you say to them what would you say to a younger you i'll start us off and i think that um it's important to keep your head on straight and it's important to not take on risk that you can't afford to take on and i think that's really important because it can be very easy to get caught up in the hype as things are going up in value and honestly no one knows really where the top is or how far it will fall and when it will fall you know people don't know exactly when those things will occur but at some point if this builds up like other cryptocycles it will have a huge blow off top and you know you need to keep a level ahead and certainly you know for me ether is a long-term investment i want to stake as much of it as i can i want to keep it because i know it's going to be over multiple cycles that we really established the value of ether but you need to be careful especially if you're if you're getting in now i think this is a great time to be paying attention first of all i think if you're coming in a year from now it's probably going to be a lot more frenzied and there's going to be a lot of people making promises on projects you know and ethereum's a permissionless platform too just because something is created on ethereum or any other chain doesn't necessarily make it good anyone can build anything on ethereum so i think be careful for people who are trying to depart you from your money again eric how about you yeah i would say this is a game of survival survive in advance survive the years you know take some profits every once in a while there's nothing wrong with taking some fiat profits and you know making your life a little bit better but hold on to your eth don't lose it don't leverage totally agree with dc don't overextend yourself um survive in advance okay anthony yeah i mean i i'll say the same thing practice good risk management um i think you know actually in 2017 i didn't actually get too ahead of myself i held most of my eth and i didn't speculate with most of it um i maybe use 10 of my stack or something to speculate um on icos and things like that but in general yeah practice practice proper proper risk management don't feel kind of regret when you see you know you you put money into something and then it goes like 10 times for example right and then you say to yourself i should have put more money in right don't let that take hold because then you'll do it on the next investment and you'll get wrecked right so be sure to always uh be comfortable with the decision you're making at the time and and and understand that yes you know you're investing in something and you're investing in it because you believe it can go up but you also realize that there's downside involved too and it can go down right so you don't want to over invest and overexpose yourself to any one investment um you know depending i mean as eric said before in massive quotes the safer investments within crypto obviously btc compared to the rest of crypto right but that's the safest investment and it's not even an investment the savings place to be is cash but there's no there's hardly any risk there right um unless you talk to bitcoin as i say cash is gonna he's gonna collapse but um yeah just in general manage your risk um and don't get too ahead of yourself and don't let fomo take hold because fomo means means wrecked really in my eyes because you don't think straight and i you know we've all been there you know i'm not going to say that i'm like the perfect risk manager or anything like that but um you know prepare yourself for what's coming because the frenzies i think is going to get quite crazy um as we as we move into this new bull market turning into the last question i want to ask before we get into price predictions it's it's often said that ethereum and ether is just one cycle behind bitcoin and i think that's a pretty easy thing for people to get their heads wrapped around but also if you peel back the layers there seems to be some d incongruencies with that because in this current cycle for bitcoin is the time it's the cycle where a lot of big institutions are putting their balance sheets into bitcoin and now we are also seeing that with ether at the same moment of time and that's ether ahead one cycle ahead of bitcoin and then at the same time you know ethereum has development like we have this whole eth2 thing there's just at some point in time like this whole like one cycle behind bitcoin i think is going to run out so like when when ethereum when you guys see ethereum and its trajectory as an ecosystem how how do you guys see like is is are we able to actually like quote unquote skip ahead of cycle or what does like the future adoption of ethereum look like especially in a world where you know 2020 just shook up everyone's mind about how the world works like how quickly could we actually see some of these things adopted um eric i think you've been through the most cycles out of all of us so let's start with you yeah i would say it could happen faster than we think and i i do think what happened in 2020 with covet and all this stuff like remote life remote banking this plays into the ethereum narrative right there's no doubt about that um and yeah just because you're one cycle to behind doesn't mean you can't hop five cycles ahead right that just means like your narrative so far hasn't been adopted it hasn't been understood that's fine like we're on this podcast helping the narrative right let's not kid ourselves we're trying to like push this along and you know make people understand it but i think we could accelerate way past and i i think you know i said earlier bitcoin has done a good job at capturing the digital gold narrative to me that's boring i think we can blow 10 100 times past that um and that could happen all at once but you know you never markets are never about fundamentals of the present markets are about fundamentals of their current cycle so markets go through cycles right multiple year bear cycles multiple year bears bull cycles and bear cycles you build your narrative and bull cycles you talk about them you build on them and then it happens again right like this is every market not just crypto so um we'll see where the ethereum narrative gets us at the end of this cycle we're very very very early in my opinion still in this cycle as maybe not price but narrative wise we are um so i think we could hop ahead do i think we're you know i'm not going to make like flipping price predictions i'm more going to talk about does mainstream understand the narrative of ethereum versus the narrative of bitcoin digital gold do i think we're going to get there this bull cycle no uh that's not a prediction of where price is going to be i think next cycle is where a theorem takes over and i think that's because bitcoin's kind of the gateway drug that you know brings people in and oh this crypto thing and they start to learn but um i think each time the china's next bull cycle anthony i was waiting for eric to drop the f word and he said flipping is it is it possible this cycle anthony oh man i'm gonna i mean i've always believed in it um but i mean it is something that i'd love to see happen but i wouldn't put a high kind of probability anytime soon just i mean simply because of the the amount of money pouring into like bitcoin as opposed to ethereum right um you know i mean maybe it could briefly happen during some really crazy mania but in terms of like a sustainable flipping right where eve is literally number one and it shows no signs of being you know re-flipped by bitcoin for example i i don't see that happening for quite a while uh bitcoin has a lot more momentum behind it a lot more years under its belt as eric was saying with kind of cycles and things like that um i think you know i actually think ethereum like what i was saying earlier is going to play its cycle is going to play out a lot faster than than than bitcoin has just because it's later on within the kind of overall crypto cycle for example right like bitcoin is the gateway drug and then you know once you have one drug you you know you're more prone to trying the other ones right um so it's it's the same thing here and that's what i was saying at the start where i was like you know once you're outside of crypto bitcoins what you hear about you know it's what you come into it with but then once you're in crypto you discover ethereum d5 default tokens all this sort of stuff and you're a lot more uh comfortable getting involved with that once you have entered through through bitcoin so yeah bitcoin took what 11 12 years to get to this point where it is today ethereum's gonna do it in one to two i reckon in terms of like getting uh that mainstream consciousness in terms of uh those big fund managers right they're already allocating to eth um and i believe that uh they're not gonna any other assets that they consider i mean i i can't see any other asset that even comes close to btc and ethan in terms of like appealing to those people so yeah it's gonna happen a lot faster even though i still think you know ethy's one cycle behind bitcoin it's just it's not gonna take like many years as it has for bitcoin dc you want to riff on that yeah you know i i would echo what the guys have said here and i would also kind of you know i'll i'll frame it this way i really think bitcoin has helped prime the environment um for for the crypto revolution and in a lot of ways it's proved the value proposition of the entire asset class which is really all about digital scarcity and i think it it took several cycles for people to understand that because it's completely counter to everything they've ever grown up with in this digital revolution which really started in the 90s everything's copy paste most people grew up most even most most nerds like you guys grew up downloading illegal software you know because you couldn't afford to buy it or whatever you know i mean that's the whole mindset of of how a lot of people viewed digital digital um assets was they're all copy-pastable so the idea of digital scarcity took some time for people to understand but now that they understand that i think that sophisticated investors especially at first are going to very quickly grasp the value proposition of ethereum and they're very quickly going to see the value proposition of d phi and i think even in d5 you're going to see legacy institutions and turn to it not because they're just trying to draft off a hot crypto narrative you'll see that too but because it's cheaper in there because they can offer services that they couldn't offer before so i think there's a real value proposition here and the understanding will come as people start to see the value in these products so i think we could definitely move a lot faster than bitcoin did over say 10 years gentlemen this has been great i think eric is still preparing his answer so we'll start with dc price prediction oh man i don't know the top of the cycle i don't typically give price predictions i want to start with a 30-second anecdote so i was at a blockchain i was at a blockchain conference in dc in april 2017 and bitcoin had just retaken its previous like all-time high fairly durably it broke through like a thousand you know the previous high back in 2013 14 was about a thousand and so they asked the audience what are your price predictions and and one guy at the end of the year and one guy was like 2 000 someone else was like 5 000. so one person said 10 000. and everybody looked at him and gasped and so so i think my broader point is bull markets can get a lot crazier than you think they can and and and they they also might not all fulfill all of your hopes and dreams but i'm going to put out a range of somewhere between 4 000 and twenty thousand wow each price four thousand twenty thousand yeah anthony in most of those numbers yeah can you top that anthony can you meet that can you be more bullish anthony i i have not been shy about my price prediction for eth for anyone that follows uh me on twitter especially of uh ten thousand dollars and i have on chain proof of my bullishness because i created a set on token sets called the eth maximalist set on in january of this year when eighth was basically so creating that january of this year i don't think people understand how um how hard that was to do because eighth was in the low hundreds and 2019 was a terrible year for eighth it basically returned like two percent on the year or something so i created that in january saying this set will basically sell all of its eth only when it gets to ten thousand dollars and obviously i was called crazy back then i'm still cold crazy now we're up at the 650s right um and i i mean i'm gonna be called crazy and then one day you know i believe we're gonna get to ten thousand and people gonna be like wow wow you were right and i'm no longer crazy so when i i i can agree with um dc that we could see a 20k as well because of the craziness of bull markets but in terms of like i guess maybe a conservative estimate ten thousand dollars is what i've stuck to um and what i've tried to like i guess kind of meme about but and i actually believe in it right i i don't say it just to just to kind of like um you know get engagement whatever i say it because i believe it and as i said i have on-chain proof that i've believed it for quite a while yeah anthony has been the person beating the east to 10k trum when it wasn't a popular thing to to i remember talking to anthony way back when saying like you know eth is never going to go to 10k that's way too high and then all of a sudden when d5 summer came around i re i saw my like mental modeling around the price of ether shift i was like 10k is way too low that's how it happens hashtag wrote to 10k is that the right hashtag anthony yeah let's see i gotta i gotta start using it more i'm actually curious to hear eric now because eric actually i don't know if he's gonna i don't know if he's getting ready to sober us up or like yeah i mean i guess i'm right there i guess i'm the bear in the room here so i'm going with 2500 and so i i think every cycle that goes on in crypto it's gonna be harder to go higher and higher uh the markets are more mature there's more shorting options there's more you know options in general too short long whatever straddle whatever your position is um i think when eth went from six dollars to 1420 there was no way to short it it was pretty much just a bulls game right and i don't think we live in that world now i'm not expecting bitcoin to go to 500k like some people um i'm also not expecting the same downside that we saw recently so i think that the floor is moving up i don't think we're going to see 90 retraces in bitcoin and eats like we saw in the past so just because i'm saying 2500 for this cycle doesn't mean that we're going back to you know whatever 200 and waiting three years i personally think we're past that but i think the market's a little bit more mature now where we're not going to see these absolute insane rallies so i'll go with 2 500. there you have it guys that that is so bearish yeah our our three bulls you bought at 30 cents yeah well okay there you go you know cool way to end the show 2500 to 20k is the prediction from our three eth bulls guys uh i think this episode delivered what we promised i think we were a bit bullish eve this is not the episode to listen to if you're trying to stop buying eth someone recently tweeted this out that um like they every time they listen to bank list they have to buy more eath and i feel like this is not going to help that individual i feel sorry if they've got a house they're probably going to sell it 2500 is bearish somehow [Laughter] well guys it's been a fantastic year and um we are looking forward so much to 2021 some action items of course this is not financial advice but maybe you should consider some eat for your portfolio obviously of course guys number two enjoy the holidays catch up on some previous

itunes how are we doing with those five stars david we are not at 200 yet and that is our near tomb goal we want 200 five star reviews because let's be real here if we get five star reviews more people will listen to the bankless podcast and more people will specifically listen to this episode which will make each 10k just all of us an assured reality so if we if you could go to wherever you listen to your podcast and give us those five star reviews so we could get east to 10k that would be uh greatly appreciated by everyone here you heard it it's a pre-wreck all right guys wrists and
