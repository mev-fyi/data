foreign what's up coordination how you doing on the Pod today we got Tim dobbinschutz who is a pluralistic freelancer and engineer seeking tough challenges a blogger that has been writing about things like soulbound tokens quadratic voting Harbinger taxes why has he been writing about those mechanisms well Tim shares the goal that we have on the green pill podcast of creating a more pluralistic regenerative ecosystem in web3 and so we talk a lot about the mechanisms that he's written about on his blog and also how those could be used in order to create a more regenerative world so Tim is just kind of one of these like deep technical thinkers that sees into the future of the technology and is able to transport back some of the ideas about the mechanisms into design criteria that helps the rest of us understand where this more regenerative web 3 movement is going or in a lot of the episode we talk about the Privacy implications of doing soulbound tokens and up building these things and and the ways in which there there are trade-offs that we really need to carefully navigate here so I think that Tim's just really thoughtful really Technical and articulate and that's why I was excited to have him on the Pod his blog he's he's posting like one really thoughtful post per month here and we're only able to go into three or four of his blog posts but really would encourage you to check out his Bala excuse me his blog in addition to this podcast episode so without further Ado I'll give you Tim dub I hope you enjoy working in web 3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much

started hey Tim how's it going good how are you pretty good really glad to have you I know that we've been planning this episode for a while so I wanted to get into identity and quadratic voting and stillbound tokens Harbors your taxes with you um where should we start I see that you wrote this post about the user experience problems of quadratic voting yeah yeah that that might be a good starting point um yeah we I guess we can start from there I think uh I'm working on like a bunch of topics that that all seem to be related to each other and sometimes even for me it's a bit difficult to find like the the common denominator or the thread but that that might might be good yeah I work that way also it's it's nice to work across a bunch of subject matters and then when you have that breadth first you can kind of combine things from different domains and being a connector allows you to kind of see the whole playing field and see through the fog of War but uh yeah maybe let's start with the the threat of quadratic voting and the user experience problems there you want to tell us about that post yeah yeah so um it's essentially all of that starts with a a client that I've been working with and and so I'm a basically I'm a freelancer uh and I was contacted by this um yeah like quite renowned artist um from Germany called Hitler style and um and we wanted to do a project together and then it it turned out that uh like through some you know like we we didn't really like know in the beginning like what we really wanted to do and so we were like thinking of kind of like different projects that we wanted to do I think one was like a more like a more of a game and it had to do with like property titles and so on but eventually they ended up registering the uh the ens domain name of uh the the bundesla in in Germany which is a a German federally funded uh art exhibition Hall and so through that like all of a sudden there was like a conversation started around this idea of what minting and ens name really means and and the powers that it gives you and uh and and like by collaborating also with the like with the curators of the bonus tale then uh basically they they were like yeah but that's actually interesting that you are now owning this ens domain and so you know maybe given that you you have that and that you are going on strike kind of where uh you know maybe we can we can have like a governance uh vote on you know what what should be the future of the the German uh and so um so I think that's kind of how this entire thing um ended up like like started essentially and and what uh what eventually happened is that we had a like a recording in in um in a TV studio where we had three different governance proposals similar to how you would do it on snapshot.org nowadays with like a with a Dao we have that uh we had these three proposals being like um you know presented by by three different parties there is the there was the department of decentralization that is organizing uh East Berlin then there was um someone from other internet uh which is kind of like this Arts and Technology research uh group and then I think the last uh party was uh to put the the like institutional like the institution itself uh and I think it I I think it it must have been there like president or or CEO or whatever um that was also making a proposal and after having uh you know after after everyone making their proposal on stage and we had this also uh you know live streamed on the internet through YouTube um the audience had the choice or had the chance of um doing a quadratic vote on the on the proposals that they they like most and and that's kind of where where I I was involved the entire in the entire project where um I basically I was developing this uh quadratic voting application and can we just back up for a second talk about why quadratic voting so quadratic voting is is known to be a way of doing voting where you can express not only your preferences but the direction and the intensity of your preferences and basically the way it works is you get a certain amount of voting credits and then you can spend one voting credit to get one vote you can spend uh I think it's four voting credits to get two votes you can spend 16 voting credits to get four votes so the amount of votes you get is the um is the square of or sorry the the square root of of the voting credits that you spend on that particular issue and so I could vote uh I want to vote four votes for option A which cost me 16 voting credits one vote against option b and one vote against option C and in total I have used 18 voting credits so it allows you to you look at the intensity and the directionality of your preferences um I hope I got that right but why did you all choose quadratic voting in this instance yeah yeah I think it was I mean I don't know the the the entire reasons but I think it was it was for for that reason to uh you know I think I I mean I can't speak for he told myself but I think the the idea was that uh we we had read about this concept of quadratic voting and uh you know she's uh she's like uh it's essentially like working also on like critiquing a lot of like what happens in the world and in the arts art world and so on and so uh I I think a you know a theoretical critique on how uh Glenn Glenn will you know outlined this idea of quadratic voting in the book where you know we would have come together created this uh this you know like this paper that basically you know go goes against whatever is set in the radical markets book failed like it didn't feel right and so I think the it was basically an attempt at you know critiquing the concept by uh you know doing what an entrepreneur would do and so essentially by you know building it testing it and and then coming back to the drawing button you know being like okay you know this these are the things that we have learned and and uh and these you know these are the things that worked and that didn't um yeah so I think on on that end I think we um uh it was very interesting because it ended up leading to yeah to this blog post that you that you mentioned right got it and so um I see from the post that there was there was you know several conceptual user experience problems that you ran into during the implementation would be would be fun to unfurl those I'm not sure how many of the audience with has done a quadratic vote.co but or a quadratic vote before but you could do one at quadraticvote.co if you're looking to do a very easy quadratic vote and maybe some of these These Years user experience issues or some some things that we can talk through so you want to you want to take us through this yeah sure so I I think I mean I wanna I think I want to talk about kind of I guess like where I also was challenged as a developer here I think the the mainly to point out in the beginning I think that this is a like quadratic voting is a thing that we as a community have very little experience with also in terms of you know just how how are we building like user interfaces how are we you know laying like outlaying this um yeah the interface itself how you know what what is the mental model that we uh need to you know teach people on how all of these things work and I think if I had to summarize the entire blog post then I think that that's the gist of it is that it's you know you are basically you are exposing people to this very new kind of idea of a voting and then it's also mathematical and um and and that's I think like one of the biggest challenges now in with regards to like the uh to like the individual challenges that we ended up uh running into this there's a couple of them and I basically in this blog post I list them all like one by one uh I I can maybe go like briefly through each of them and um and and we can maybe like dive in Depot on on like things that that you're also interested right I think yeah and I'll just say why I'm interested in this um is that we're trying to create a more regenerative world with higher resolution democracy that leverages collective intelligence and I think that there's a certain like Economist eye view that designs these mechanisms and thinks about how they're perfectly rational sort of on paper but then you put them in front of actual humans which are predictably irrational and are really Guided by the user interface and it's really important that we close the gap between these perceptual problems and the mechanistic things that are in the design so I just want to say that out loud before we go into these things yeah totally totally I think that's a really like that's a really important point and I think it it also kind of touches on the on the first problem that I outlined and that maybe I'm not even 100 capable of of reproducing but I think in the in the radical markets book itself the uh the the idea of quadratic voting is basically derived from this idea of uh you know the categorical imperative um where you know you say basically that a person's Freedom um you know is limited by you know where they are intercept like in where they're basically starting to limit another person's Freedom right so like I think for example like I think during covet and you know with mask wearing I think this uh this started to have like a practical relevancy where you know if you were a you know a fit young person then you know for you potentially the the virus was like less fatal than let's say for an older person but uh you know that that should like in the categorical imperative that morally still doesn't give you really the the like right to not wear a mask because you know mask wearing also means you are protecting the other person and so if basically if you know as a let's say as a young fit person I stop wearing masks and I end up you know infecting other people then you know my my freedom is suddenly limiting the freedom of other people where where for example we are like uh you know you know where I'm like becoming a coming to in close proximity to like a more vulnerable person or something like this and so I think the the uh the radical markets book uh understands the categorical imperative and it's very interesting actually that then you know the what they're basically saying is that you know we we can also codify this uh this moral this moral thing into math and so the the idea here is where uh you know you have this uh this town and um you you know there's a um a electricity plant and it's producing energy but it's also polluting the air where the air is the public is the public good and then the the book kind of the book walks us through this this trade-off between you know people on one side needing uh cheap energy but also they cannot really have like the entire air being polluted and and additionally you know some some people might say that um you you know air pollution is fine if I get a cheap energy and and other people might say the inverse and so and and the the book outlines this example of Niels where uh where Niels essentially uh I I think cannot cannot have that much air pollution because Niels is running a um is running a laundry um and so I guess that's because he needs to hang the the clothes up up in the end so if there's polluted and I guess the closer smelly afterwards or something like this and and so and so kind of given this categorical imperative of um of of you know like you know this symmetry of everyone you know having kind of this the same say in in this uh in the in the public good uh of of air quality I think they they basically derive this math of saying that you know if Niels wants to impose certain qualities on other people that live in the town then you know Niels should pay the quadratic cost of that because basically news is like influencing it you know news is not causing a cost to uh you know to to himself only by for example increasing the electricity price but it's basically increasing a cost to ever everyone that lives in the town because he might have like a very Divergent uh a view on how things should work and so and and so basically they have like this they have like a graph I think you can see it in page 100 I have it here like 103 of the Princeton Princeton press Edition and and so I found that very interesting and I mean it makes to me it also economically it makes a lot of sense actually this and I you know I think at um at a shelling point in Bogota uh probably were so there I think there was a someone speaking on the plurality stage now I forgot the name but basically what they said is something like yeah that anyways like that that this is like you know it's beautiful that we can express basically this categorical imperative of math and so on but I think on the on the other on the other hand and this is what I was trying to point out with my blog post is that this social cost for voting is I mean it's really hard to to describe I think I I I tried it here and and I'm not sure like how how well I'm making myself understood but then also I think it it pre like it assumes essentially also somewhat of like a a very like high density information environment where everything can be boiled down into like costs so like you know for meals that is running a laundry I think makes really a lot of sense to you know to like make this trade-off between smelly clothes and and you know maybe um the laundry electricity costing less and so on right yeah yeah so it sort of presumes Education or a very simple problem to solve I think yeah but it I think it's also it also kind of suffers from looking at the looking at the problem uh very deliberately only in an economic model and for because for example I mean you know in the in the case of um you know pricing again like this uh the production cost of clean clothes in the laundry I think it's easy to kind of get an overview over that right but you might have also people and this goes back to what you said in the beginning where the uh maybe you cannot put a price on for example what what is the value of of clean air like for example when somebody is uh spiritually uh opposed to that I think this um this way of pricing things becomes uh um just much more complicated or if someone for example uh you know um has like a undiagnosed um lung condition and then so so then you know they never end up like uh you know paying for this externality that if they knew they had a a like a lung condition that you know can get worse with air pollution then they would also pay more so I think while I mean it's not really um it's not really a strong critique against um against a quadratic voting per se because these things can also happen with like regular voting I think it points kind of to this um to this uh flaw of of of of thinking everything in in the economic terms and and like in this like closed loop system and so on um yeah although I'd love I I would love to like I know that we're going deep on the quadratic voting uh paper right now but I I think like in order to respect the breadth first nature of this episode I'd love to take a little sample of the harbinger attack stuff and then a sample of the Soul bound token stuff and then we can get into a little bit more of a discussion uh towards the end of those how does that sound yeah sounds good cool uh where should we go next Harbinger taxes sold out tokens or something else yeah we can go to help America Texas okay got it um so how would you explain Harbors your taxes just want to respect that not everyone in the audience knows exactly what those are why they're important and how they work yeah so how about context is essentially a they they are a policy mechanism that allows you to create a type of property that we that were not familiar with necessarily we have I think private property that is is based on private property law so you know like people cannot uh takes takes things from you once you acquire them you don't you don't don't need to like um you know be around uh them you know like you don't need to occupy like a private property right it's it's always belongs to you whether whether you are there or not and these kind of things and then Public public goods are uh kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum where they they really don't belong to anyone necessarily but uh but also we have to basically they then suffer like from from from different kinds of problems as uh as uh private private property and Harvard Texas are somewhat in the middle between those uh those two things so you know where on on one side you have a maybe a an apartment in an inner city that is the private property and on the other side you have something like uh City's air quality then uh a a property that is a a harburger property so to say or I think nowadays we also say it's like a also common ownership um that sits right in the middle between those two things so um I think the yeah where it's interesting is that it has basically different economies compared to private and public goods and um yeah that's I think for me as a as someone that is like implementing um yeah all sorts of different mechanisms to solve uh to solve problems in the crypto space is very interesting the the blog post that you have here says Harbors your taxes can be crypto sustainable business model which I love that you're just taking the shot at something that big and important um do you mind if I take a swing explaining Harbison taxes go for it cool so I think that they're understood as partial common ownership and the idea here is that if you have private property then basically there's a tax levied against that private property every year and you know this is something that if you own a house you're familiar with homeowners tax but with Harbors or taxes you're actually able to set the valuation of your private property and then you pay taxes at that rate but there is a catch and that's that if you set the valuation too low then anyone can buy your private property at any moment and purchase it from you so there's a natural equilibrium between the incentive to set the price low and therefore get less taxes and to set the price um get less taxes um but you also might get your property sniped from you and set it high whereas you pay more taxes but there's less of a chance that someone will take it off the market for you from you so that's that's sort of how I understand mechanistically Harvard your taxes to work but I'm curious to unfail with you how can that become crypto sustainable business model are we gonna like issue nfts to each other and then there'll be Harbinger taxes on those those nfts like how can I fund public goods with Harbors or taxes yeah I think uh why I wrote this blog post the story the story is that I I had a a project and then I had it funded through through grants right funding and so on and uh I got kind of like pushed into launching a token you know people were like yeah now you know now it's the time to like launch a token and so on yeah and uh for me that always felt a bit like Reckless I you I think you also had a tweet where you said uh you know the I think cost of deploying an erc20 is like 20 but legal costs are like 200 000 or whatever right yeah so that's familiar that that just felt like so reckless to me like that or like also it felt like it doesn't just didn't feel right somehow and so basically I I said to myself you know with this project I was like okay maybe I mean I don't want to take all of this like unknown unknown legal risk and so on and like launch a token and I also have like lots of other posts that talk about like how I think you know tokens are not addressing certain things that I I want like I don't know we can go into that later but essentially like I was in this uh basically I I limited my Solutions base and I said okay if I cannot do tokens then we're like in crypto and you know there's like this bull market which is when this uh post was written and I was like what else can I do actually to make money like you know besides like raising a token and the I mean the problem is also you know if you you know if you if it's like some people in in their protocols they put like fees into the smart contracts right and and so there's this idea that you know with like a fee basically then you you know you you create revenue for your uh you know development company uh you know if you put that into the the protocol code but um you know and it's all good and well but the the I think the the dynamic of the space is that it's a it's usually a race to the bottom where you know uni swap was you know the first automated Market maker and then they were like these 10 different clones where you know each one of them it's like just was able to basically remove like such a thing like a fee structure where someone can can monopolize and and extract value from from the code itself so so for me that sounded all of a sudden like we we will never be able to charge any fees for developing uh you know like solidity code and that that seemed kind of I I was like I was like this is like really difficult to work with right and I also don't want to launch a token and and I think with being exposed to Harbor attacks is what's interesting uh about them and why I say they are a sustainable business model is that for one and I'm saying this as not being a lawyer right but like they are I think they are not Securities in this or like equity in the same way that tokens are they are more like a fee mechanism in your in your solidity contract and then secondly if you are able to create a um a market for example where you're like issuing an nft or whatever that ends up working with halberger Texas then the then a like a copycat uh project that wants to you know like Fork your code and potentially like remove you know the the things where you can uh you know fund your fund the protocol development in in the case where you price your property with Harvard taxes they cannot do it because essentially hard worker taxes are this like new universe of property of properties where the the taxation itself is not only a means to uh you know to extract value from from the the operator of the market the harbor taxes are there to enable a like positive externality right so exactly how you explained it in uh you know in the in the case where people are able uh to monopolize property in in in the private property areas or like for example Inner City apartments and stuff like this right where you know you you're like the sole owner of that specific um apartment and you're like you know you're not even influencing basically the price of that apartment like the people that are you know opening coffee shops around your neighborhood they are actually like influencing the prices so on it I think in in that world actually the harbor attacks add positive externality because they make it so that you cannot monopolize on this like unique position that you're in and so you always have to like um basically act in like a possession I think matte private uh from uh radical markets like positional interest kind of way we're always trying to like utilize the the property that you own um like as much as you can and so the so really the conclusion I think of that blog post is that if we can find like digital properties that we can um that we can create these uh Harbor attacks markets then I also think given that there is this like text that is going to some to someone it's sustainable because it cannot be forked out compared to just like a you know like a fee that sends money to the protocol developers because if you Fork it out then you're also losing the property of you know how about Taxation and like is a much better mechanism for pricing right and I just want to like add to this like the moral basis for the tax I know there's a lot of Libertarians out there that are anti-tax and um I I just want to say that from talking to Matthew Pruitt who's one of the sort of authors and primary thinkers on Harvard's attacks the main idea between partial common ownership is that when you're utilizing a property you're um utilizing the public goods that are around the property so the in the example of a house if you're close to a park then um your house appreciates in value because of the proximity to the park and you're utilizing the public goods that are around the park the roads to get there the transportation networks that come to your house the post office um the park the downtown all require upkeep and and so by having that private property you're actually participating in the network effects of the public goods around you growing um in the digital equivalent of this is say you have an ERC 721 or an erc20 and you're issuing a harbor to tax on those then basically the idea is that um is that you're relying on open source software on Guess on Prismatic on the consensus and execution clients on the ecosystem of ipfs that surrounds your token and to the extent that your token is appreciating and really pumping it's due to the public goods that your your token is built upon so I just want to make sure that we articulate the moral case for why harvards or taxes make sense from the perspective of of math Pruitt and you know we can get into you know the debates about whether taxes are good um good or not but uh that's basically the basis for why Harbors are taxes are supposed to basically create a synthesis between public goods which are hard to fund but really important in private Goods which are easier to fund and but also important yeah I I also think that maybe the the uh the name hamburger text is not yeah not very approachable yes probably like I think you could develop something like a harbor attacks uh software by just calling it a fee or whatever and you wouldn't even have I think the in general I think the concept is applicable where you know it could be that maybe one day you are like playing a video game that implemented hamburger texting through kind of like fee mechanism you wouldn't even know I think you just would truck like you would untried at one point I think it would start to understand the Dynamics of like how this thing works and um

we should move on to sold down tokens and we can grasp the whole elephant before I ask you how can we use all these mechanisms to fund public goods to create a regenerative Commons stuff like that but let's go deep until about tokens next yeah yeah I think I think that's the perfect segue between uh how Architects and so on tokens I think the like vitalik I think posted the um posted the blog post called uh Soul Bond around January and then I I got really inspired but then I was also reading at the same time like this book by Glenn whale on radical markets and so on and and I ended up going to if Denver I also saw you speak on stage and so on and I think it actually was you that was mentioning uh this idea of non-scheuomorphic property and it really hit me it was like yeah we don't necessarily need to build in the digital realm something that is either you know a public good or private good we can also build like something complete wildly non-scheuomorphic in the sense that no it's not imitating anything that you know already exists like uh like like for example and for like just to understand like skeuomorphism is this idea that yeah you you basically you're building like this yeah almost like a visual bridge between something that exists and something new so like for example I think the the iPhones uh Notes app was always looking like it had like textures as as backgrounds that were similar to paper and then it also looked like you were like really scribbling and so that was like a classical skeuomorphic uh application compared to I think nowadays notes I think it's like more non-scheomorphic like tries to like under like tries to experiment with the with like what was possible in digital and so let me just gonna be my run down on skimorphism is like the old resembles the new so like my favorite example of this is uh Yahoo and Google both had the goal of uh organizing the world's information but Yahoo Yahoo took the card catalog system and put it on the internet so you had to like browse the directory in order to find your information whereas yacht whereas with Google I could just type in a search term and and find find that information and so by enabling The Primitives of the new to create new things non-scheomorphic things then we're actually able to build more powerful software systems so that's just while we're getting into keyboard physical I just want to make sure that the audience had two definitions for it um but but please continue yeah and so so anyway so like I think during shelling point it must have been or if then well I think anyways it hit me was like just so interesting you know that we are now talking about Soul bound property essentially where this is somewhat of a like you know I I guess a World of Warcraft player ex-world of Warcraft player myself I was like you know because you so basically a soul bound icon and soul bound item in World of Warcraft was one that you would uh obtain from let's say slaying a dragon with like a faulty person uh a raid and you know you had like to do all of this preparation and everything and then in the end I think there was like a mechanism to allocate the the item items that the the dragon uh dropped and then I think the the idea really was that you know you don't want to enable this uh pay to pay to win kind of uh system where someone slays a dragon with 40 people and you know gets this super cool uh sword as a as a loot and and then sells it on an auction house for like 1000 gold and then you know like this person that was never in in that raid like the all this like social uh social and coordinational work to to you know helps later dragon can just like buy that assault on the auction house and like show it basically you know equip it and show like oh look I I slayed the dragon or whatever so I think like so so basically sold one tokens was is like Soul bound items was really a way to to prevent it where you make uh items essentially non-final like the non-financial in a way that people cannot put like a numerical price on on the item itself and so I found that fascinating because I I was like this is genuinely something I've never seen in the real world and and with talking to people uh at if Denver but also talking about like harburg or Texas and harbor property I saw somewhat like of a I saw like a similar problem where you know um where if if you have a a hamburger a hamburger property then they are also then also it starts to um you need to build like a differentiation between you know who is the the actual owner of the harburger property and who is uh just a processor let's say right and so you I think conceptually you can think of this where you know ownership is like this set of all the rides that are giving given to you over like an object and then you know from this like bucket of Rights you can basically pick the you know more individual items like you can say you know there's a right of me you know being able to use an object or there's a right of me being able to destroy an object or to you know lend it out to someone um and and so and so I think like Soul Bond tokens at the time and and halberger property had this sweet spot where fundamentally the harburger property should should not be transferable ever from the owner but only the the user ship should be able to change and so basically I was I don't know I was like really diving I think very deep into like this realm and I was writing all of these blog posts about it and I ended up concluding that it must be where you know uh when when I'm able to specify how a Sol Bond token looks like then I'm also able to build a harbor attacks property which I I think today maybe I'm I'm not that much of a Believer um in in that anymore but it anyways led me to uh to to build uh solventor and maybe just to give you a rundown of what sober and tokens are so uh I think if you ask 10 people you probably get 10 answers but I think the most uh the most uh prominent answer is probably that of whatever is written in the decentralized society paper so um essentially they they're they're almost like a a way of encoding um claims uh into in into a data structure and then you know assigning these claims and and Publishing them uh selectively um I also think but I also think you can frame Solomon tokens as kind of this uh yeah like a different kind of property class so then they don't necessarily have to be uh to be claims um and then I think the maybe the more the most tangible uh framing for developers at least is one where you say you know a sold one token the most simple Solomon token is just a non-transferable token so like an nft for example where uh you can you know once it like it it it's um sent to your account you can essentially um you can essentially never never send it back and I think the name the name then uh start starts to originate a bit more from this idea of uh you know like Soul binding something to to you where similar to how how it works in World of Warcraft you are um you're giving something to a certain account and the the intention is that there is that there cannot be a financial uh a price attached to it because it's fundamentally non-tradable uh with at least the the usual uh ways we trade uh things on web3 I will link the soul bound paper in the show notes right here so that people can read it but basically uh the soul bound toker the paper is called decentralized society and it's all about what if there's this deep interconnected web of attestations you know Kevin attests that Tim is a great podcast guest and you would test out that uh other authors in the ethereum ecosystem have done important things and so on and so forth and you create this sort of web of trust of of these this directional attestation graph and I almost think of it as like page rank where websites that link to each other are kind of voting for each other's legitimacy when you send Soul bound tokens with attached metadata you're making vouches about each other and the sum of this the Gestalt of all these things is we have reputation that we can begin to I don't know solve civil resistance or provide under collateralized loan using the densely networked part of the information and that becomes really exciting to me because once we have the network effects of this spinning where more people are getting soul-bound tokens or other identity markers it could be dids could be things that are off chain then more people will try to consume those dids because they're getting more utility out of them so that's what's really exciting to me about decentralized society and I feel like Soul bound tokens are just a means to that end um and there's some maybe some troubles Troublesome privacy things with only going all in on soulbound tokens um but but that's what's exciting to me about Soul bound tokens I'm curious what about that resonates with you yeah yeah I think you touched on uh I think one of the most fundamental points of the concept when you mentioned privacy and that um that that this is like such a I think a such a challenge such a challenge to that that still like needs proper addressing in the entire um in the entire concept where uh I think people in general are very overwhelmed with the idea of sending and storing data on blockchains and you know I think the norm so far has been that you know we voluntarily upload data to the internet and so there's like a good chance that somehow you can always delete that data by just following through uh you know like you look at the domain name and you find out who's responsible for hosting that server and then you I don't know there's like a legal recourse that you can do and whatever so you always end up being taking like being able to take down stuff right I think in in the EU where I live there's even a like the right to be forgotten which which is essentially like a right you can use as an individual to remove like uh negative um uh like claims about you from for example like the Google search results and stuff like this and I think uh with with blockchains and this is not I think this is not specific to solvent tokens but it's it's generally true for for a blockchain that keeps all the data available permanently is that um that people are now kind of finding out by when we're talking about a tested claims they're like damn this can have like actual really bad implications too where like how how am I able to you know remove a piece of information that I I might not want to have um uh on chain and so and so I think it's useful in this case um to think of privacy as a contextual integrity and I'm I'm not really making this up but this is a like a research paper from uh Helen nissenbaum which is I think quite renowned in the space where basically the I I I'm gonna uh I'm gonna Slaughter I think the the concept but I'm anyways gonna say it like here quickly which is where the contextual Integrity in in a in in a context in a situation is that where the uh information disclosure actually um uh has like an interactive uh component with what you're trying to achieve so let's say if I go to the doctor um and I tell the doctor that my foot is hurting then I'm sharing this information within the in the context and with the Integrity assumption that you know the doctor will use this information that my food is felting to treat the food and that I end up not having a hurting food now I think there's there's like like two things where where these uh things can go wrong one is when the this information then uh you know starts leaking outside so for example if the doctor then tells you know their partner that I ended up having a uh hurting foot right then then I think the the contextual Integrity of you know why I told that doctor that my food was hurting is broken and then uh the the other uh Dimension is where the doctor would use uh that information for like a different uh course than just uh uh you know like treating the the illness of my food that we call so like we basically call that uh the appropriateness and so so I think viewing privacy as contextual Integrity is very useful because at least as an engineer it allows us to make like uh like pretty straightforward judgments on you know things that we we should do and we shouldn't do in terms of implementation and I think with uh the the now the challenging part I think with soul bound tokens or anyways being exposed to this idea that there might be you know cases where we where things are never reversible where once we publish them they will permanently be out there because the blockchain keeps them around this becomes challenging because it's something that we've never had to deal with I think before and so and so like for example like I personally with being a an EIP author like I'm at least for now I think I would like push back for example on vitalik's idea of this uh negative reputation uh red registry even if you can make it uh you know I think like there I think like how italic Transit is almost like in a in a utopic case where you know all of this zero knowledge math and so on works out perfectly and I think in that in that scenario I think uh uh you know the the suggestion of negative reputation is actually not a bad one but I think the in order to get there I think it will take much longer than we we that that we probably have time to actually figure out the the the the Privacy implications and so like being you know um the EIP author of these things I I don't see myself confronted with the technical intricacies of zero knowledge proofs for me it's more a challenge of like telling people hey you know be your Please be aware of not putting like sensitive information on chain and um you know like try everything possible to not uh yeah League like like metadata and stuff like this I think um yeah I mean I think that there's definitely some problematic things there and you know this isn't like a web 2 app where if we make a mistake we can just roll it back and so it Bears a lot of the need to be judicious as we move forward on these things um you know and I'm curious we only have we only have about five minutes left of the things that we've discussed what are you excited about when it comes to funding the commons or creating non-scheomorphic applications with blockchains that you think are really compelling I mean you've kind of got this breadth of the design space What are you really excited about yeah I think I mean this is a not an easy point to make but I think I'm the most foolish I think in general on the blockchain space I am because essentially it's a it's it's almost like a Sandbox environment where we are experimenting with where we are experimenting with mechanism design and with economics and you know now we have even like this almost like this research and development uh Labs like uh like like you know a radical exchange and uh the uh what's the other one comments stack and so on that you know they're like producing this new type of mechanism design so it's like a mix it's not only academic research anymore that publishes books uh books and papers but we're also implementing these things right in in like uh real scenarios with real money and we're like will basically finding out if these things work so I think I'm I'm really optimistic in the sense that we can test some of these new mechanisms out and we can we can innovate and we can we can find data in in yeah like just in the sandbox environment and then still uh we can apply them to the real world eventually and I think one of the uh one of the examples that I I would like to make here is is that of the energy Grid in Germany right now that is under heavy pressure from the you know from from the Russian government that stopped the the gas exports via the north stream pipelines where you know you need to hold a certain uh voltage within the the grid right and therefore the pricing of the utility providers of the electricity actually is by whoever uh provides the the highest price per kilowatt kilowatt hour it sounds a bit Yeah unintuitive but given that you always need to hold the the voltage of the of the grid this is what you have to have to do and so fascinatingly we have a uh a a mayor in the south of Germany that you know their Community has heavily invested in renewable energies and he he goes on television uh talk shows and he says you know we're making a killing with our uh wind and solar energy because the price of Solar and wind I mean we we have invested in these uh yeah you know in these like windmills and so on but we're not paying more like everyone else is paying more by producing uh electricity with gas and so I think this points to to a problem where this uh Energy Mix that we're we're having in uh Germany that although it's uh you know it's um it's Diversified uh we will we always have to pay the highest uh the highest production price um is kind of like puts it puts us into this absurd position where you know the the people that uh that that that produce green green energy make make basically the most amount of money even though they're not really contributing the most uh significant amount uh into the grid and so and now how do I get back to this with blockchain I think the block production mechanism in ethereum is actually very similar to that of uh the energy grid where uh similar to how in the Energy Group we have to keep the voltage at all costs because otherwise it means we would get a blackout also in ethereum uh in the ethereum consensus algorithm we also have to continuously come up with new blocks so essentially we are also having a similar problem where those that Supply the block production have a really a lot of power in you know adjusting like making the prices adjust and making them Skyrocket and so with I think I think with EIP 15 59 we uh now we are for example experimenting with a mechanism that I think went from all the way from the engineering to like I think people in the in the economic space you know review reviewing this proposal and so on into like an implementation every and now suddenly we can see that you know we went from a a like a pricing mechanism for Block storage that was that had like a very variable um uh rate of pricing over time up to like a a algorithm that ends up being not variable at all but in terms of spikes is uh always course correcting to the mean because basically as soon as we go over the normal demand instead of encouraging actually um more Supply through uh through increasing the price we're actually saying we're burning the uh we're burning the Eve that is excess that that we get from that we get from demand and so I think while these two things maybe they are like maybe you know it's like two different problems I'm talking about I think the in in the end like the the economic primitive I think I have pointed out that they are that these two things are very similar and what makes me excited is that essentially we have tested out a thing that uh with EIP 15 uh 59 you know we have tested out a thing in like this sandbox environment where you know everyone that had like opted into ethereum uh you know was was part of it but also you know if it hadn't worked out then potentially I think the consequences would have been uh less fatal than for example if we had tested this out like on the scale of a country where like the energy where we're like testing this on our live energy grid so I think it makes me like incredibly bullish that basically we have this giant sandbox where we can test economic um economic policy and then once we get the clean data and so on we can also apply this to much more critical uh infrastructure and you know this ends up uh I mean hopefully this ends up creating a better and more regenerative uh Financial system but also a world of like regenerative world yeah the way I think of is like first Do no harm so like we got to stop the scams in the ponzis and the rugs create mechanisms that uh where those people can be held accountable or at least you know not get the attention that they're sucking up all the oxygen in the room uh the carbon neutrality has there's been a lot of steps forward with that with the merge and now it's about building regenerative systems that are net positive and so what are the mechanisms for that um we only have a few more minutes is there anything I didn't ask you that that you want to say um I'm not sure we talked about a lot of things um I'm happy to be here and uh to be talking to you yeah yeah I think this is honestly the highest use of my talents in network is to try to figure this stuff out together so appreciate you coming on to talk about the work that you've been doing really encourage listeners to check out your blog which I've got a link to in the show notes it's uh timdob.github.io Tim d-a-u-b.github.io um how can people find you online what's the best mechanism is it Twitter yeah it's Twitter same username um yeah or on my blog there is all the contact information my email and so on great well Tim thanks so much for coming on the pad thank you for for your time and giving me the chance to speak yeah thank you very much peace Jim thanks [Music]
