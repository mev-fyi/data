like i'll call it right now if that's what you want ryan i want it the people want you to call it it's not going down anymore it's not going down anymore hey bankless nation happy first full week of june david what time is it oh ryan it's the friday bank list weekly roll-up time where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless what's going on this week oh man there's so much going on and you and i just had a debate as to whether this is the um the first week of june or the second week of june no idea but we compromised and called the first full week of june which i guess it is um that that is one of the central debates on uh on bank list today but they would also have some is it settled david every single weekly roll up yeah we always end up starting the week like is it the is it the second week of this month or is it the first week of this month like how do we square that sometimes there's five weeks in one month so this whole like first second third week of the month you you think that it actually works well but it doesn't work well at all yeah i mean dave and i understand crypto very well it's just calendars calculators are giving us the prices are hard anyway topics of the week guys uh number one question i think in everyone's mind is is the bottom in we're gonna talk about that david first thing we're gonna talk about the takes the data the arguments suggesting it a hot take from arthur hayes as well and try to answer the question is the bottom in or not at least as far as crypto what else are we talking about david oh of course got to talk about the robson test net which is merged the merge happened to robson the test net uh we got two more tests and test nets to go and then the final final actual merge happening to ethereum we'll probably talk about the timelines because as we get closer and closer with one test net behind us you can actually start to see the merge on the horizon we have all remaining steps left so we're going to talk about the the recap that erupts in merge and also talk about the timeline for the actual merge coming in the future we're also going to talk about the 20 million optimism token fumble some of these tokens were apparently hacked um taken and uh there's a whole story around that and uh also david do you know paypal is allowing users to go bankless for the first time paypal recall they have 400 million users this was like one of those bear market headlines that just kind of dropped i didn't see talked about a lot but uh this is a pretty big deal so we're going to talk about that too of course friday morning make sure you like and subscribe to this podcast you're listening to it on youtube do those two things if you're listening to the podcast side of things make sure you rate and review as david says that is how we get out of the bear market is getting bankless to the top of the charts so uh make sure you do that while you're listening right now david also got to talk about our friends at metamask there's a handy little button in the metamask app either on mobile or the desktop version that some people probably haven't clicked yet what is this button and why should they click it it's called the buy button right and i frequently forget that metadata actually has this buy button and yeah the other cool thing i learned while while doing this is the the buy button works for a lot of different chains uh and so regardless of what train you're on uh polygon avalanche bnb phantom cello you can buy crypto uh across all of the change with metamask it's the easiest way to get ether into your wallet or whatever gas token into your wallet so you can start doing some things uh and uh i think ryan we've been talking about the build market lately it's not a bear market it's also a build market but it's also ryan a buy market at least i'm doing this is not financial advice coming from david but you know you want to be thinking about dollar cost averaging in of course as as you always do and the another buy button inside of your wallet is an easy way to do that so if you want to check that out of course you got gotta have metamask downloaded so go to the link in the show notes get metamask if you don't already have it if you do have it go take a look at that buy button and how quickly you can get uh crypto directly into your wallet without having to go through the five-step process of transferring from bank account to exchange blah blah blah uh david let's get to the market man what's the market telling us uh we gotta start with our friend uh bitcoin it's a choppy choppy week this week uh bitcoin is down point eight percent start of the week at thirty thousand four hundred ended the week at thirty thousand one hundred uh i guess it went up to a couple hundred dollars since we last talked uh but uh thirty thousand three hundred is where it is right now uh choppy week uh barted up bart it down barred it back up barred it back down again and overall just kind of flat kind of flat when when you say bart's people for people don't know what you mean when you say bart's it's kind of like a technical trader type talk what is a bart david because i said i see i see it i think it's i think it's very untechnical but yeah so bart imagine bart's head right bart's head is like this like column shaped thing and then it's got a bunch of jagged lines at the top and bart simpson yeah right and so like you can see you can see the wall it makes on the on the upside it chops around and then it goes down and then of course you also have the inverse part which is the same thing where like it like breaks down really fast and then it chops for a little bit and then it goes back up uh if you if you type in like uh bart chart pattern into google you'll get like actual charts with bart's face like superimposed on it yeah yeah and this works when you're zoomed in on the seven day but also when you're zoomed out right you see bart's at all different timelines and all different levels right bar fractals are everywhere yeah so now you use a part everywhere party week yeah apologies for that guys it's uh bart is now going to become part of your vocabulary are we seeing any bart's on the eth chart tell us the price right now david yeah ether took a little bit more of a hit that seems to be the theme of the last few weeks uh start of the week at 18 30 and we are currently at 18.05 so down about two percent on the week so we talked about bitcoin we talked about youth now let's put them all together let's talk about the ether bitcoin ratio up or down on the week down on the week one point three percent went from point zero six zero two to point zero five nine four i mean one percent crypto i'd call that flat uh technically down but yeah uh flat flat plus some chop this week david are you ready to call a bottom on the ratio that's wha where is the bottom do you think look at the bottom it's either right now or a lot lower one of those two thank you it gets either right now or a lot lower is there a third option even available to us no i think that that makes the the i mean we're testing the lowest that the ether btc ratio has been since it really broke up out of the bear market trend the 2018 bear market trend uh and so like if it starts to go lower than this like it's that's to me a signaling a long brutal bear market which i do not think is coming you think if it goes a little bit lower okay so you remember recall it broke out of this back when we were full steam ahead in the um the bull run in april of 2021 that's where we broke above the um the ratio that we're in right now but it's gotten as low in like 2020 it got as low as uh 0.018 0.017 even uh has it gotten lower no that's that is the lowest well i mean it started lower than that uh but that was the lowest that it got in between the 2017 to 12. i mean we could we fall back there do you think absolutely not get that out of here where's your bottom left no way you can i mean i always i always think the btc ratio is up and to the right over the long time range uh maybe so but if we're in a bear market it it could be hard to tell okay i won't make you call a bottom on this uh in this roll-up but at some point david because you know i love when you call bottoms and then we can just mean that like i'll call it right now if that's what you want ryan i want it the people want you to call it's not going down anymore it's not going down anymore come on you gotta okay give me a number uh what's the number 1.0963 is the number 0.0963 oh excuse me 0.05963 is the bottom that's the number right here yeah you're not even gonna be conservative and be like .05 or something like this no i'm also not a trader so no one should be listening to me for creating advice ever all right well no now you know for sure it's going below 0.0596 guys so there's your alpha uh for today but let's talk about the total uh mark what's the inverse of alpha uh crypto total crypto market cap uh lost a little bit lost 12 billion dollars in the last week 1.312 trillion down to 1.298 trillion uh but mostly flat flat on the weekend among friends who cares uh pretty much flat eh okay uh state of the markets let's talk about the fed because you know people are wondering what the fed is going to do next and there is actually a new set of inflation numbers that are coming out today so we don't have them because it's prior to when we recorded this and those are going to be some numbers to watch i think what's going to happen here is there's going to be a lot of scrutiny with the newest cpi inflation numbers right and so is it going to be down or is it going to be up the medium median forecast apparently is a year-over-year cpi increase of about 8.2 percent so if so that would be slightly below the april 2020 which was 8.3 percent so we're hoping for and i think the fed is hoping for and certainly the the american public is hoping for a lower inflation but even if it was 8.2 man that's not a lot lower just to like a tiny fraction lower and we'll have to see if cpi is higher than expected though david i think you got to assume the fed is going to continue to be hawkish on this market and that means increasing yields uh like in their ford guidance it means continuing the quantitative tightening that they're doing all of its policy actions and what that of course leads to is pretty predictable bond yields go up stocks and crypto maybe they go down maybe they're on a downward trajectory so uh be looking for that those inflation numbers tomorrow because they are kind of the north star i think guiding the the fed any thoughts on this oh got a ton of thoughts yeah so inflation is a lagging indicator uh so we are about to see uh the report for may in the early june but may like ultimately inflation is still always lagging behind the markets like inflation is a reaction to the rest of the markets and not leading the rest of the markets but right now the inflation report is kind of how the markets are interpreting the fed's response uh and so rel talked about this when we had our podcast with him where he kind of thinks inflation's already dead we're just waiting for it to show up in the reports and so like if you are asset heavy if you are waiting for the risk for the bull markets to to resume if you are still into risk assets like crypto you are just waiting for these cpi reports to come in and finally indicate that inflation has actually shown up or the death of inflation has finally shown up in the metrics i mean you kind of wonder how much of the lagging indicator that is yes it's a question of are we lagging it by like one month two months four months like how long do we have to wait for the death of inflation to actually show up in the metrics because we already know that tech stocks got wrecked right like uh arc which had billions and billions of dollars on it is like at a six year low right and so all the inflation which came from asset price inflation it's reasonable to assume that it's already dead because everyone's broke now and so like that is really the fight that's going on is the fed is making uh all of the big gains that happened in 2020 to 2021 it's trying to eliminate those because the people that had all those gains are spending a bunch of money uh and so now that the markets are dead people have stopped spending a bunch of money but we're waiting for the the effect of people not spending a bunch of money to show up in inflation and like all the all the at the people that are just gotten like whiplash by the market and like worked by the market they're like we know inflation's like done because we stopped spending money so like just like lower the interest rate so we can start spending money again uh and the fed's like no we gotta wait for it to show up in the metro yeah and i do think we're living with the fed's decisions you know not just the fed but fiscal policy too of like 18 months ago probably like realistically maybe stretch as far as 24 months ago that's what's showing even the fed was like yo we waited way too long to raise interest rates and like that's why and so like the markets got way out of control uh which makes it way worse on the downside just dude it was just last summer where on bank list on these on these uh weekly rollups we were talking about the feds and powell kept saying it's transitory and we were sort of laughing at that like transitory like what what are you even doing uh right if we were smarter we would have realized that that would be a top signal if we're laughing about how it's not transitory and we're just waiting we're waiting for the fed to figure it out like we kind of could have connected the dots that like all right as soon as the fed does realize that they're behind the curve by three months they're going to come in hot and destroy the markets if we were smarter we would have figured that out yeah well i guess we should be central bankers david maybe in another life uh let's talk about this the uh s p trading range this looks pretty party too this looks pretty choppy what chart are we looking at here yeah so this is the s p since may 27 to where we are now june 9th how many days is that like two weeks uh and so you can just see this is a 2.5 band from the top of the yellow box to the bottom of the yellow box that's 2.5 band and you can see it touches the bottom ones top ones bottom twice top once more uh goes back to the middle touch at the top again touches the bottom again touch to the top again to where we are now so like it's touched with the band of this 2.5 range a bunch of times without going anywhere uh and so like a very tight band of activity with a lot of chop uh and to me what this is is just like the market is just confused and waiting for information it's waiting for data uh generally when you see like these tight trading bands people kind of meme and mean this is like oh it's a coiled spring it's gonna explode don't really know which direction it's going to explode in but like when we know that may cpi reports are coming in in a couple days like maybe that's the information that the market's waiting for and it will make its decision as to be bullish or bearish on those numbers guys this is chop season we're seeing it in uh equities we're seeing it in in crypto as well we're just chopping bitcoin and eth you saw it too that's what those barts are it's kind of the choppy action but david let's just zoom out for a minute and and take a look at this um this bear market uh and this is relative to uh historic bear markets at least from an equities perspective the s p 500 bear markets and their current uh downturn declines in duration that's what we're looking at and we're looking at all of the major bear markets from i guess you know the turn of the the um 20th century up till now and if you look at what we're doing here is we've been currently in a downtrend for about 96 trading days okay and uh we're verging on negative 20 in the s p all right that's not quite historically that's not quite bear market territory yet i mean historically at least according to this chart the the line is drawn at below 20 so um if we are trending downwards into the bear market like we probably have more to uh to go but what's interesting about this chart david is the slope of the line looks a lot like the 27 20 uh 2007 the 2008 uh crash looks a lot less the slope of the line looks a lot less like covid which like hit us and it was a very rapid descent down but it was relatively fast and the recovery was fast like some might say v-shape at least in the assets and equities market this looks a little bit more like 2007-2008 so you wonder if it's going to be as prolonged you know 2007 2008 was close to 300 days of uh downtrend before it started to turn around what are some of your thoughts when you see this market when does you see this chart yeah when we talk about financial markets timing is always tricky it says current downtrend 96 trading days well the s p actually hit its peak really at the end of the year like the peak of the s p was like january 2nd december 31st and then it went down like a lot it went from 4 800 points down to 4 200 points in march and then in march middle of march it went from 4 200 up like rallied up from 42 to 46 but then it went from 4 600 points to where it is now down to like 41.60 i got even a little bit lower but like the peak of 4 800 points of the s p actually happened over six months ago so this is uh it depends on where you actually mark the top and i think this this current chart is marking the top in march but we were actually way higher in december and january and so you could actually in theory double that current downtrend of 96 trading days uh to be something like i don't know 365 divided by two um but yeah that's my take there uh it's actually been down for a longer amount of time that wouldn't change the current downtrend actually no it would actually so it would go from 4 800 points down to 4 200 points uh and so that would be more than more than 20 so again it depends on where you count it yeah this is all true and i think we're we're going to this level of depth because we want to get here to this question the question on everyone's mind is for crypto anyway if you're a crypto investor is the bottom in yet that's the big question uh is it in yet guys i asked that question on twitter it put it the same way is the bottom already in here's the sentiment at least among people that follow me on twitter who are probably uh slightly in in the bullish camp like up over optimistic camp and uh 27 said yes the bottom is already in and the remaining 73 said no the bottom is not already in i do think that is the consensus take in general most people do not believe the bottom is in believe we still have a ways to drop from here i'm probably more in that camp but i'm not ready to like trade on that at all like uh it could go the other way as well i would definitely say that twitter polls about markets are inaccurate by their very definition uh like i i there's been a ton of like twitter polls i've seen like hey like guess the top guess the bottom like twitter twitter polls don't get market predictions right like and very very i don't think they get market predictions right but i think they get market sentiment generally yeah seriously yeah so the the the information here is like this is sentiment not accuracy of course this is engagement of sentiment not like i don't think there's a seven i don't think this means that there's a seventy but if i ask about the same if i ask the same question is is the top in yet and i asked that question in like december of last year i bet i would have gotten yeah people would have said no the top's not in we got it's you're consensus is always biased towards whatever the momentum is at a given period of time so when consensus is saying one thing i think you have to look at what the contrarians are saying and arthur hayes is certainly contrarian sometimes he's wrong a lot of times he gets it right and this is his take in an article he published his take is in summary that the bottom for crypto is already in but let's lay out the case that he makes a little bit he starts this off i'm going to read a quote to you uh from the article but the the tl dr of this portion of the article is everyone is broke right now okay everyone is feeling broke whether you don't have a lot of assets or you do have a lot of assets people are kind of feeling broke and he says this the median yearly income for americans is approximately fifty thousand dollars you know you've printed too much money when the median house appreciated more than the median income that means you made more money sitting in your lulu jammies and going to work assuming you own a home woe to the pleb that rents not going to make it uh now that's kind of the tone of his take and inside of that he shows this graph from bianco research what are we looking at here david yeah this is u.s real average weekly earnings year over year so real average weekly earnings not nominal average weekly earnings so this is uh growth there has been wage growth in nominal terms as in like people's number of dollars that they are making is going up but the value of dollars is going down bigly uh and so this is a chart going all the way back to 2007 so it even has the 2008 financial crisis worked into it where uh weekly where weekly earnings wage growth was down like 2.6 over time and so people were making negative 2.6 in the bottom of the 08 crisis uh we are down 3.4 so real in real terms people's wages have gone down 3.4 percent as of recently uh because of the loss of value of the us dollar and how wages have maybe they've gone up in dollar terms but not in real terms uh so like lending itself that like people are losing money like the state of the economy is people are losing money people's savings are being depleted uh people are making less money they're having to spend more money uh and so like people are broke people are broke is this crazy is in every graph i see of this sort of thing you see this whiplash right so like prior to people losing money like you know uh actual real wages decreasing like three to four percent they were actually increasing from 2020 to 2021 at rates of like four to seven percent so the whole story here about you know like the fed intervention and monetary policy is whiplash right right everyone's feeling rich you know 18 months ago now everyone's feeling poor and that happened historically fast was historically volatile it feels like a uh a really sick ride we would never be able to get this data but it'd be nice to like the counter factual universe that we would love to see is like what if the fed did nothing for covid like and we it didn't jump to seven percent wage growth uh in april 2020 and then it didn't fall down to negative 3.4 percent uh wage growth in april 2022 like if the fed didn't do anything what would that whiplash look like and also like would we have been able to fight kova just as well like having that counterfactual universe to compare against would be awesome but we don't um but like the whole like austrian take on the economy of on economies is that uh human manipulation over the monetary supply is just bad for markets and like you can kind of see that here like went up and then it went down and there's whiplash and whiplash is bad yeah absolutely uh we're definitely suffering from whiplash but what does this mean for crypto back to the question is have we bottomed yet arthur hayes actually says we have and he gives a three-point checklist as to what he looks for at the bottom number one he says all of these things have been hit by the way number one bitcoin ether move increasingly in a less correlated fashion versus the nasdaq 100 that is starting to happen david uh crypto assets being less correlated number two the current price levels are very close to the previous cycle's all-time highs what's the all-time high for eth from the previous cycle david 1400 yeah and what about bitcoin 20 000. we're about that right i mean we're close we're not quite that but we're getting closer to that and so that's close to being hit we're like 30 higher than previous all-time highs exactly yeah um number three he says the mainstream financial media gloats about how stupid and greedy clubs are who attain short-lived wealth investing in crypto so the kind of articles like uh yeah haha jpegs they were always a meme uh we told you stable coins would never work uh aren't you crypto investors really stupid we're starting to see some of that sentiment in mainstream media i don't pay much attention to it because it's just kind of noise to me but like i think that is happening so he says three strikes all three of those criteria have been hit uh you're out and so um he he says that this is his bottom checklist but he also says it doesn't mean prices will automatically resume a quick ascent back to like 70k bitcoin and 5k eth the one thing he's looking for is some of the political and macro economic picture to coalesce to come together and he thinks u.s elections will be a big catalyst for that so the question in my mind is if we're in this this bart season if we're in this chop season maybe the bottom's in or we've gotten really close so is this actually an accumulation season that's the question should people be accumulating here or uh should they get ready and wait for the next leg down what's what are your thoughts here yeah interestingly this uh end of this article it really is reminiscent of our conversation with van spencer that we had where vance is like yo there's got to be like a big massive liquidation event in order for me to like really be confident on the bottom right like we the market trends toward peak drama and we haven't seen drama yet but then you responded to the people you said right and you responded to vance like well wait a second like there has been sectors of the crypto industry maybe not the crypto industry holistically that has puked right like a lot of nfts are down bad like tara literally went to zero alt layer ones are down like 98 we're about to see a thread that talks about how down bad parts of the crypto industry are uh and the only things that really haven't puked are the blue chips right like bitcoin and ether are like down like 60 60 and 65 respectively uh which is would be a historically not bad crypto bear market um but kind of what you would expect from a more crypto immature crypto industry uh and so this this conversation as like do we need the big liquidation candle that we are used to for crypto markets is still like kind of up in the air and arthur is saying no no we don't need that big liquidation candle in the big blue chips uh because you know other the drama has happened elsewhere he's also saying if you want to be sure he's predicting that that central banks in monetary policy will loosen because again everyone feels broke everyone's in pain and so um the the treasury and uh and the fed essentially become a one during times of uh huge economic stress and so um he thinks that there will be a massive quantitative easing and that powell and you know the central banks of the world will start to project that signal that probably close to kind of election time or shortly thereafter and so if you want to be certain his advice is look for that signal because it'll be loud and clear i think it's a pretty good take and i really enjoyed this article so we'll include a link in it in the show notes but david could you also give us a state of the bear market the snapshot in crypto this is a thread from jason choi that i think is pretty useful for us yeah so he put six tweets together that covers different sectors of the crypto industry uh starting with d5 and so he says d5 has been the most painful trade in the past year looking at the dex vertical alone we have we've had the most prolonged bear market out of all the verticals 400 days since all-time highs for a lot of the dex tokens which includes uniswap sushi swap uh balancer bnt uh average joe cake swap crv uh average average time since all-time high is 400 days that's been that's been since defy summer uh and like uni down 88.6 percent sushi swapped down 93 balancer down 91 uh cake swap down 90 curve down 92 percent you know these look like uh 2017 ico numbers ryan like where are things like like pretty high 90 is a big number that is one tenth of the previous market cap uh previously was so that that was a d5 decks trading uh and then he continues with d5 2.0 he says d5 2.0 was hit the hardest relative to all-time high across virtually any category with a median drawdown of 98 ryan don't let the numbers uh fool you the difference between being down 90 and being down 98 is an 80 difference wait no it's a 90 difference it's a 90 difference and so if you are down 98 down 98 you are down 90 more than if you had wood been if you had just been down 90 so like d5 2.0 is down 90 worse than d5 1.0 that includes alchemics ohm butterfly time uh time is literally which is zero uh curve uh and and toke curve survived at like 85 so that's pretty good uh toke down 95 percent alcohol makes down 98.5 percent again that is painful i own three of these tokens ryan oh cool how much pain are you in oh i'm fine uh again most most are eath bags um so you know i'm just i'm used to going down big big numbers in bear markets that feels like home uh jason fitness continues going interestingly long centralized exchange short decks might have been a good trade sex tokens sex as in c centralized exchange tokens were amongst the most recent as a hard seed david you don't need to do this moving on these sex tokens were down not so bad so uh ftt down 69 percent nice uh bnb down 56 percent uh huobi down 74 percent median down 71 percent uh so not so bad if you are a sex token i'm going to keep on to layer ones fat protocols seem to be hold the most weight still as uh ones continue to be among the most liquid and defensive assets no major layer one drew down more than 90 90 except mina the average for the uh layer one trade is down 85 percent ether is down 63 from all-time high avalanche down 84 ftm down 90 solana down 85 percent uh algorand down 89 percent near only down 74 uh and i think winning this whole entire trade is other than ether of course because it's got that an extra cycle is a sadly tron but i don't count that it's not not not legitimate near and uh adam seem to be the outperformers here um performers losing a lot yeah um wow yeah you know but i don't see max payne that's what's interesting is i don't i still don't see max payne among the layer ones i wonder if we get there first 90 down 90 i would definitely call max payne yeah but you just said the difference between 90 and uh you know 98 is a whole hell of a lot right i'm ready to as soon as i see like a median drawdown of 85 percent uh i'm like you can start calling bottoms there in my opinion you think so yeah i i wonder how far eath goes down that is the big question uh how about the solana ecosystem yeah his last tweet uh just highlights the down badness of a lot of the tokens in the solana ecosystem the tokens of the solana were a median drawdown of 94 from the top uh this is likely because of just the illiquidity of many tokens um in this election this looks like the ico market this is that looks like the icici yeah indeed crazy so a lot of pain that that's the uh the sum up here definitely um i think this uh this meme sums it up fairly well david it's a contrast of 2020 versus 2022 what are we looking at here right so this this isn't just a meme even though it is a great meme uh the the top panel is a guy closing his eyes throwing a dart at a at a dart board and he goes me trading in 20 20 20 2020 and quadrupling my money and then me trading in 2022 and declaring bankruptcy is the bottom panel um but like again this lends itself to the fact that the source of inflation was asset prices and this is instantiated in this meme this like this isn't just a meme this is evidence because so many people liked this meme uh if you could just throw a dart at the dartboard and quadruple your money in 2020 guess where inflation came from it's from the people who quadrupled their money by doing no work uh and now people trading in 2022 and declaring bankruptcy which is the second half of this meme is like well there there's nothing you can do in the markets without you losing money uh and so you know this is a symptom of the money printer and then this is a symptom of raising interest rates to correct for the overzealous money printer uh so all those like money printer go bur memes uh if you are somebody who is experiencing pain you can blame the money printer go burr era of uh monetary policy because well this is the thing so in the first panel the guy's just throwing a dart at a dartboard right and it's easy easy money right the second panel is he's he's got like six computer screens open he's like freaking like typing on it he's like in in the zone trying to actually get some get some alpha and generate some upside and instead he's declaring bankruptcy to me this is just a difference between the easy money era and kind of the the tightening errors all monetary policy effect that's what's crazy about it uh meanwhile we are continuing to burn e it's looking pretty bullish on that side of things even though the market don't care about it uh read out this uh anthony sessano tweet here yeah layer twos on ethereum have burned over twenty thousand each since eip155 went live repeat after me layer twos are not parasitic to the ethereum or eth and then here we have a snapshot from ultrasound.money website nfts have almost burned 90 900 000 eth defy a quarter 750 000 eath layer two is coming in fourth after mev at 22 000 eath uh a very long shot away from the amount of beef that defy or nfts have burnt but the idea is that nfts in d5 move on to the layer twos and so layer twos i think can definitely become number one openc has burned over a billion dollars because of each transactions uh because of how computationally intensive nfts are eric connor gave out this interesting tweet that kind of really puts this into perspective ethereum is currently burning 2.9 million ether per year after the proof-of-stake merge hits mainnet east will become deflationary as the supply shrinks massively at this current pace of 2.9 million eath burn per year we will hit one ether in all of existence as in we will have burned every single ether in existence in 40 years uh we are not getting to that point that's not how it works but it's illustrative of the crazy rate of eat burning that we are currently doing and so like it's much more accurate to say like ether is burning at two percent per year because then that establishes some sort of equilibrium over time but like illustrating this as if at this current pace we will burn literally all ether in existence at 40 years is illustrative of how much ether we are are burning in this current state of ethereum and also just like how quickly the supply is going to go down in the next five years versus the next like 50 years right and so with the you at this person going through what is a bear market while ether is being burnt massively is this is the early opportunity of ethereum itself where the ethereum supply is going to get cut in half over the like next 50 to 80 years and you get to buy it in a bear market right uh and so when there's this exorbitant burning right now going on uh to have where the trajectory is so high of the burn rate that we delete all ether in existence that is a buy signal in my mind yeah deleting all there someone once said there is no supply floor that became a meme and that's definitely true of uh of eth and what's crazy here is um i actually like in 2017 to 2018 crash uh basically we saw block space demand completely dry up like it kind of evaporated and went away and we're not seeing that with ethereum this time around like block space demand has definitely gone down but it hasn't dropped to zero in fact block space demand like gas fees are still pretty high on ethereum right now yeah and uh you know so block space demand is still high where it's evaporated it's very much in kind of the alternative layer one uh ecosystem and to to a lesser extent i guess like you know layer twos and such and you know the polygons of the world uh so that to me is a bullish indicator guys we have so much more to cover as usual coming up next we're going to talk about the successful dress rehearsal for the merge the robson merge we'll give you some merge updates including maybe our greatest our latest thoughts on a timeline for this thing what else are we covering next david we got the 20 million tokens for the optimism fumble between the optimism team towards winter meal we will cover all of those drama and details because it like this story unfolded in like three different phases when three different directions kind of crazy and then of course the crypto bill uh there's a big crypto bill that got put out we got the details we're getting run through and and tldr all of the uh details from senator gillibrand and lummus's long-awaited crypto bill so all of that and more is coming right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eath in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only syncing provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrarum or boba networks and we're merged ryan we're merged at least the robson test net has merged into proof of stake format so there's there's a number of test nets in the across the ethereum ecosystem there's three big ones and robson is pretty damn big and it successfully merged so this is the first dry run the first dress rehearsal for the proof of sake activation merge on the robson test net robson used to be proof of work and now it is proof of stake grind so here is a picture of just a bunch of the ethereum developers uh taking screenshots of the robson merge uh and all the the statuses around this here's the nimbit twitter account putting some cool art into the actual blockchain uh with the famous panda the panda is now the meme for the ethereum merch because there's this meme about like one polar bear and one black bear touching fingertips and they merge into a panda bear it's like the consensus layer and the execution layer uh and so here here is another meme kind of illustrating the trajectory of this uh this is coming out of preston van loon where we have private test net miners the miners those private testnet miners are dead even though it's a test set it's never really live in the first place uh robson miners the proof of work behind robson those are now dead and then we have the grim reaper going for what's next which is the sapolia miners that is the test that's coming up next uh sepolya is also proof of work and will soon be proof of stake once sapolia gets merged and so we have all these test nets and they're getting merged one by one by one and ryan when we run out of test nets to merge with proof of stake guess what happens next oh i i think it's the main event i think it's a real deal the real deal maynet uh this was uh from an article from cnbc they said ethereum just completed a successful dress rehearsal they called it for the most important upgrade ever dress rehearsal david very specific language very specific language do you think of that well i think that's the metaphor that you use with tim baiko uh when we live streamed with him on on tuesday uh that episode is already on your rss feeds if you want more details on the merge uh but there's no way that they also came up with the phrase dress rehearsal and published an article like 12 hours later i think someone dc tunes into banquets it's got to be right so hey cnbc it's great that great to have you listening to bank list we'd love to be on cnbc to update you on the crypto roadmap sometime but uh that's really i think a good metaphor for this it's we've got three dress rehearsals and then we're gonna have the actual performance that that we're staging and like there's two more left two more dress rehearsals left but how did this go how did drops didn't go was it a success was it a failure was it somewhere in between yeah so uh when we were talking to tim baker we were like okay the the reason why we don't have a merge date is because it's not a date it's not a binary yes or no it's more of a vibe and so like as if the developers feel good the client teams feel good the community feels good the surrounding infrastructure around the merge feels good everyone's vibing then we can come up with a date uh and so danny ryan who coordinates these things uh says the robson merge was a major in all caps success if this were mainnet i would be jumping for joy i don't see danny ryan using emojis often and he uses the celebration emoji saying congratulations to everyone involved and then he'd highlight some of the actual issues that did show up so we can speed run through these 14 of validators had a down time at the time of transit of the time of transition nine percent is a nimbus team config issue fixed with a cli cli change and redeploy basically as soon as you reach like start and stop your miner or your node it works again one point eight percent is a known con currency bug in nethermine required a reboot for some nodes and then two point five to three percent nimbus basu websocket problems swapped to use http these are all developer talks but all of the percentage of nodes that did not successfully merge it was all very trivial and they were able to restart themselves and get up to merge so the issues that were discovered in this dress rehearsal were all trivial which is exactly what we want there's no way that zero issues happen we're trying to figure out what issues are going to happen and the more trivial they are the better they are and what danny's saying is like all the issues that were discovered were super trivial and would not prevent an actual live merge happening uh if uh if this were if this were a real merge it would have been a success so guys the dress rehearsal went well that's fantastic you know welcome to good performance good performance yep and so uh we'll talk let's talk about the merge odds though this is uh poly market which is a prediction market uh in in crypto and d5 and they're estimating the odds so people are actually betting on this by september 1st the odds of a success uh eth merger 28 by october 1st 65 by end of year 90 percent to me david this feels about right although i am a bit more bullish then yeah this feels like it's leaning bearish i think these numbers are bearish i think they are contain uh taking in that uh these are we found a bug numbers in my mind well give me your take then what do you think the actual number is going to be i think you uh it says by end of year 90 by october 1st 65 percent i think by october 1st 90 and then by september 1st 65 interesting and you bump those numbers out for you guys on on you know a weekly basis as things happen but this is the overall schedule for the merge i think this is important for people to understand what would you what would you highlight from this of course we have an entire episode on this that came out on tuesday of this week so if you're looking to get all of the details listen to that episode but what uh what's the highlight on the next steps to happen to get the merge to completion david yeah so this is a fantastic infographic illustrating what comes next first we have the client releases on the very far left the blue uh with the blues like the off chain layer uh robson seporelia we're already down on one of those and so each one of those things gets merged and then then we the once all those things gets merged and we're all happy about it on the an all-core devs call a ttd will be selected a total terminal total difficulty it's like a block height it's like a blocked number but it's something else but basically for all intensive purposes it's the same once a ttd is selected by the all core devs that is basically picking a date for the merge so when the ttd is selected it's like picking a date so we will actually have a date where we say hey the merge is going to happen at this particular date and then some client a software gets releases for uh for the consensus layer an execution layer clients called bellatrix and paris and then eventually those get activated on the beacon chain on the proof of stake chain and once those get activated then when the ttd number gets hit these new activated execution layer and consensus layer clients start listening to this and then once the ttd gets hit that is when we merge and 12.8 minutes after that point we will have successfully finalized the first merge blocks and made us a proof of stake network my favorite part about this is like once you deploy the uh you know the bellatrix and paris client releases for both the consensus layer and the execution layer so it's basically the proof of stake and proof of uh work networks then it's just a a shot clock like then there's just a timer it's a countdown and everything is automatic after that so like you push it out there and then within like a week maybe two weeks uh we're just counting down the time drum roll for the emergency actually happen it's crazy it's gonna be a lot of fun though guys we're gonna have a lot of fun this summer it's early fall sometime soon hopefully halloween halloween i'm gonna drive everyone oh my god i'm calling it everyone for everyone in the ethereum community during halloween is gonna dress up like a panda and i had i just had that idea right now and i bet you that's coming uh so i'm calling that if you guys want to get all of the details from the merge and the remaining steps between now and the merge we did the live stream with tim baiko who's privy to all these information and all these details uh and so that again that podcast is already out on the rss feed it's also up on the youtube uh and that i believe will conclude the merge section last thing on that is uh one of the downstream effects after the merge effects is going to be an absolute monster decrease in electricity used by ethereum so like it's basically all of it is going to go away going to evaporate and that is uh crazy to think about because right now ethereum consumes somewhere between 0.1 to 0.3 of all of the world's electricity right now let me repeat that this is less than bitcoin you know not a lot less than bitcoin but a little bit less than bitcoin right now ethereum proof of work consumes 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent of all of the world's electricity output that's a lot and that is going to go away after proof of work almost like a light switch it's no longer going to be needed because you'll no longer make any money consuming that electricity in the form of ethereum block rewards so i you kind of wonder what effect that's going to have maybe to the power grid or maybe to kind of like you know mainstream news will anyone notice that decrease but it sort of means that bitcoin will now have to sort of stand alone as the sole proof of work chain the sole juggernaut proof of work chain i i do think a lot of scrutiny will come bitcoin's way as a result of that whether you agree with that scrutiny or not uh certainly the narrative is is coming and uh well in fact we're gonna be talking about some new york legislation that dampens uh what new york uh can do with with proof of work uh a little bit later but any thoughts on this david yeah well i mean if the it does indeed start to make news that like ethereum turned off all of its miners and like redirected all of that electricity consumption back to the grid and for then there was some fallout as a result of that for better or for worse like maybe there's like a grid surge and that happens or like electricity prices get really really cheap in some corners of the world where ethereum miners are hooked in like it just highlights the fact that bitcoin is the last chain standing that is consuming energy uh and i do not envy the bitcoin ecosystem to having to fight that fight as like justifying their like i mean you think 1.1 to 0.3 percent of electricity consumption by ethereum is like high if your bitcoin is like 0.5 and higher like tbd like how to calculate these numbers a little bit up in the air um so fighting that fight that the political fight the fight for hearts and minds while your blockchain is consuming a ton of electricity not exactly the best place to be yeah i i'd rather not be doing it that's for sure uh but let's talk about this so a 20 news item number two yeah 20 million in op tokens um hacked stolen what happened here david what's the story yeah so uh optimism in the winter mule team uh were uh made it made a deal where the winter meal team would liquidity provide for optimism tokens and so to carry out this engagement and the optimism gave a temporary grant of 20 million op tokens to send to winter meal as part of the foundation's partner fund uh winter meal provided an address to receive these tokens and this was their multi-sig address on the ethereum layer one however the accident the whoopsies that happened here was that winter mule's multi-stick address the gnosis multisig they they used one of the very very old versions of the gnosis multisig that has since been updated and as a result of that quirk the address on the ethereum layer 1 is not the same as the address on the ethereum layer 2. uh so if you use a if you make a gnosis multistick now it would be it will uh would be the same address but winter meal was using a very old multi-stake contract and so they they made an assumption that it would be the same address and it wasn't and that resulted in the op tokens going to a multi-sig address that had not yet been initialized and so the there was an attacker that i think basically just like spammed the initial initialization of a multi-stake address until they got the right one giving them control over the 20 million op tokens as soon as the attacker got their hands on the oh the 20 million op tokens they sold 1 million of them and have also delegated another million of the tokens to a delegate and then also sent vitalik another 1 million tokens and so this person yov.eth said the plot thickens as i'm writing this explain it to me the italic the attack attacker delegated the 1 million oop voting power to me thank you for delegating hint no i'm not the attacker and i don't know who it is uh and then bam tag from yearn says the attacker just sent 1 million op tokens to vitalik.eth interesting like why 1 million why not all of them like i can't i don't actually know how many uh tokens the the attacker has left presumably presumably 19 or 18 million now one quick note i think david you kept saying a winter winter mule it's a winter mute i believe winter what is winter mule that sounds familiar to me though but it's not these guys and what is me who are winter mute and like what's going to happen as the outcome of this like who's actually going to pay for the 20 million op tokens who's going to suffer that loss yeah apologies winter meals yeah winter mute is going to be buying tokens off of the secondary market to replace the the losses right now just 1 million tokens have been sold and so since the op token is still so young there's not much issued that actually didn't impact the price but winter winter mute as a result of their trading profits is committed to buying back the tokens that they admit that they lost um kane uh there's a lot of people like pointing at winter mute saying oh my god this is amateur hour like like you gotta check your addresses how could you do this how could you do this kane put a thread together that i thought put things into perspective which makes a lot of sense to me kane says loving the reply guys in this thread saying oh my god how could you do this well i'll tell you exactly how you do several thousands of things with correct assumptions and then one of them is an incorrect assumption seeing the funds in your address is not sufficient as a test and then it continues i can think of at least 50 different times something like this has happened within the synthetic community the correct way to test the transaction is to ensure that you can move the received tokens but like zero percent of people do this almost anyone who's been encrypted long enough has a story of incorrect assumptions leading to the loss of funds i have made this mistake um just recently i called a function named burn on one contract when it was supposed to be another contract i had 20 tabs open and the sequence of transactions was 20 transactions long resulted in 10 million die burned what i didn't know that sorry sorry that sucks sorry my conclusion after years of watching this stuff this stuff happened is that it's not possible to avoid every mistake but communicating them transparently and quickly is the optimal approach and that is what i will give a ton of like credit for towards the winter mute team they didn't hide it they immediately owned up to it and they have also committed to rectifying their losses and they committed to all of this stuff before like crypto twitter got like all up and uh up in arms about the drama about it so uh i think this is gonna be just a very small hiccup in the very long story of both winter mute and optimism well um speaking of a long stories david uh we've got our news big news item number three which is the the bill a long-awaited crypto bill led by uh senator gildebrand and senator lumus is being put in front of congress and i think we've gotten our hands on it at least a draft version of this where they're calling it landmark legislation to create a regulatory framework for digital assets and lummus has been a long-term advocate for krypto of course she's a republican gildebrand uh i i believe is also a you know crypto advocate as well and so this is a bipartisan bill i don't know what the chances of this going through are in fact i think we're gonna have um senator gildebrand on bank list tomorrow to actually ask her about this but let's talk about the meat of what actually is inside of this bill because this is maybe i think the crypto industry is hoping for some clarity that's what we've been begging congress to do so even regulators like hester purse uh and you know the former cftc chairs have been begging congress to do is just give us clarity just tell us like what uh what you expect out of this space come up with some sensible regulation what does this bill include what are some of the main provisions david yeah i've pulled out some of the the most relevant parts of this very long bill so i'm going to speed run through all of them i'll also type this type the section numbers if you guys want to check them out yourself section 204 decentralized autonomous organization specifies that certain decentralized autonomous organizations downs are business entities for the purposes of the tax code this requires that a dow be properly incorporated or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction as a decentralized autonomous organization which may include an llc corporation partnership foundation cooperative or other similar organization basically telling dallas that they need to register somewhere uh kind of taking the d out of dallas so kind of don't really like that yeah it's not awesome it's not it's not awesome but it does also give them optionality and clarity in some respects although it's not the most ideal form section 206 internal revenue service irs guidance this requires the irs to adopt guidance or clarification on long-standing issues in the digital asset industry including disposition of forks and airdrops merchants acceptance of digital assets digital assets mining and staking charitable contributions legal characterizations of pay of payments table coin as indebtedness uh so there is that section 2208 digital asset mining is taking declares that digital assets obtained from mining or staking activities do not form part of a taxpayer's gross income until the disposition of these assets taking yields not taxed until you sell them that is awesome all right so so both those uh both of those are very good things so those are very good things irs giving us guidance they haven't given us jack around guidance like you have no idea how crypto assets are treated everyone's just kind of guessing so that's good it's something we needed but this is crazy so you're saying staking income is not ordinary income under this bill you pay zero taxes on staking income until you sell it wow this would be this would be a congruent with other jurisdictions around the world i believe germany uh treats things this way but that would be uh shocking to me if the irs took this sort of position but it's not them i guess it's congress making them do it um incredibly bullish what else we got david section 403 cftc jurisdiction those the previous ones are all big deals but this is also a very very big deal the cftc shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any agreement contract or transaction involving a contract of sale of a digital asset that is offered solicited traded executed or otherwise dealt in interstate commerce the lummis gillibrand grants the cftc exclusive spot market jurisdiction over all fungible digital assets which are not securities uh section 404 also very related digital asset exchanges creates a pathway for digital asset exchanges to register with the cftc to conduct trading activities similar to the digital uh commodities exchange act uh awesome so the cftc is crypto uh crypto and cftc big handshake unless they are securities so if it is not if a cryptocurrency is not a security it becomes under the jurisdiction of the cftc giving the cftc prime control over regulation over the crypto industry uh we like that clarity we like being able to pick one just one entity and say you're responsible for regulating crypto which definitely tells the sec to back off regulating crypto and gary gensler to just cool your jets bro yeah i think that's uh so it's very clear to me that under this bill and everything i've said that that ethan bitcoin will be treated as commodities under these provisions the still the outstanding question is what else is a commodity and how does something that's a security become a commodity is is there a path to that i'm not sure that that's clarified but seeing the cftc take a more active role in this is a is a big win in my mind right and then the last one i want to highlight section 601 issuance of payment stable coins the lummus gillibrand requires a bill requires all issuers or pay of payment stable coins to one maintain high quality liquid assets value at 100 of the face value of all outstanding payment stable coins two provide public disclosures on assets backing the stable coin and their value and three have the ability to redeem all outstanding payment stable coins at par in legal tender if you have been paying attention to what circle has been doing they have been doing all of this stuff for the last six months front running what is they expected to be these requirements the last part of this section is really really cool ryan establishes a detail optional process for depository institutions banks and credit unions to issue a payment stablecoin banks can issue stable coins credit unions small banks big banks have been given by this bill the green light to issue a stable coin huge that is really cool that's really cool yeah that is really cool now so i if i take all this in its totality the la the last thing i'm worried about in the stable coins thing i think it's really good for uh you know um centralized stable coins like tether or usdc or something new to to follow these guidelines i hope this does not preclude the dies of the world or even the experiments like like fracks that would be dangerous territory so for me that depends on on the fine print um but if i'm zooming out like the dao thing is not great uh but the tax implications are incredibly good and the cftc taking a more active role in and rather than the sec is also uh bullish so i like this is more bullish than bearish uh to me to the crypto industry the big question in my mind though is can they actually pass it with this congress at this point in time when nothing actually gets passed so we're seeing some movement but i wonder do we have to wait until 2024 to actually see this get passed we actually had kevin o'leary you may know him as mr wonderful the shark from shark tank he is going to be coming out the podcast is coming out on monday he was actually in washington talking to legislators talking to people in dc about this very bill his emphasis david was like hey if we're gonna concentrate on one thing get one thing right let's get the stablecoin piece right this section 601 i believe would be his emphasis or focus so it could be the case that maybe this entire bill doesn't get approved um you know this entire bill doesn't go through but a section of it does in a smaller version of this bill and maybe that's the stablecoin section maybe that's something we can all put you know start with and actually get some clarity there before we we get into the other areas so overall i think this is a good step it's bullish it's certainly not perfect but um i'm excited about it coming up next in the next part of the show there's a ban on bitcoin mining in new york we got to talk about that as well as the fight over the apes uh there was a fight over the episode so where the board ape ecosystem is going to go so we got that answer now as well as paypal allowing 400 million users to go bankrupt so all those details and more coming up right after some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrarium and d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home all the wild d-fire protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrary has never been easier especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrary through all the exchanges including binance ftx hobie and crypto.com once inside you'll notice arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas feed if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrum dot io developer to start building your dap on arbitrage if you're a

that you use follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence [Music] hey guys we are back uh some bullish news this is the kind of bullish news that happens the bear market and the market does not react but i get this paypal is now allowing external transfers to non-custodial wallets or custodial wallets outside of the paypal ecosystem that is huge uh realize how massive paypal is today 400 million users they have 30 million merchants and this puts all of those users all of those merchants on the path to going bankless why because now you can withdraw your bitcoin ethereum bitcoin cash and litecoin to other wallets and exchanges previously you couldn't do this a couple weeks ago we talked about how the way robinhood was allowing this for their users now paypal is allowing withdrawals for their users as well and i gotta imagine deposits so this is super cool david and i think you know opens the door for many more millions to go bank list when they are ready to take custody of their private keys or move it outside of the paypal network it's also cool to see a network like paypal wouldn't do this unless they had to and crypto is is kind of forcing uh you know networks like paypal to do this sort of thing because people want the ability to access their own private keys we want to take custody of our assets we want the ability to to go bankless so i think this is super bullish the table stakes uh for fintech companies just always gets higher and higher and higher for getting involved from crypto first first you have to provide access to crypto assets then it has to be well now you have to withdraw crypto assets for you to even be considered and then soon it's going to be like well you have to be able to let me get yield defy yield inside of your app soon it's going to be like well i need to be able to take eth inside of your app and all of a sudden all of these fintech front ends are just going to become uh front ends for d5 and growing out the d5 mullet so that is the story here all right moving on to the battle of the apes apecoin dow officially favors remaining within the ethereum ecosystem yay decentralization the final votes reveal that 53.6 not that much over over a majority 50 53.6 of apecoin voting participants have agreed to stay within the ethereum ecosystem uh the immutable zk roll of player 2 uh actually made a proposal for them to go on to that zk roll up two this is not that all that the apes have done is they have voted with a snapshot vote using the apecoin that they decide that they want to stay within the ethereum ecosystem uh and so they don't know where to go i think i still i believe want to migrate off of the ethereum layer one but as a just a temperature check the apes are staying inside the ethereum ecosystem and so i much agree with this choice uh nice choice apecoin you gotta put yourself nexa where the epicenter of economic activity is and that is of course on ethereum um look how tight this vote was though it's not it's a tight vote it's a tight boat yeah i wouldn't be surprised if they changed their in it you know in a few months we'll see what happens that is not the only metaverse uh story of the week elluvium the uh the big game from kieran kieran warwick kane warwick's brother uh the eluvian land sale got concluded all last week all land plots apparently sold out that they sold 20 of the future ethereum land an absolute insane amount of money was collected from in a bear market sale 72 million dollars for 20 of the eluvian land that is nuts that is an insane market cap on the total supply of all eluvian land which the game isn't even out yet uh this was done on immutable on immutable x and so that got around all the gas wars uh and so uh big big success out of the eluvian ecosystem 72 million dollars who is buying media first land in this bear market ryan and this no in this economy and this is in this economy you're buying your virtual land what's going on d-gens are still d-genning i guess or maybe look maybe this is going to be incredibly valuable i i've heard great things about eluvium the ecosystem oh people may be bullish alluvium land but they are not bullish diablo immortal which is some sort of diablo i guess game you've told me david this is mobile first so i i know like both of us are former diablo players i think you got into diablo 3 a bit more than than i have oh there's the game right now you started on mobile i was a diablo to you uh aficionados spent a lot of my uh youth inside of that game buying yield farming before it was yield farming yeah exactly but never made a cent on it it's a little bit different than the yield farming we do today but i've just been seeing all of the spillover from the gaming community of hatred for this game right like one of the lowest reviewed games in history people are calling it predatory what are some of the uh the issues that have surfaced and can nfts fix this david yeah so in the diablo subreddit there is a post that is uh voted 20 000 upvotes saying uh banned diablo immortal from this subreddit for predatory gaming monetization uh so like diablo only the the diablo community is banning a diablo product saying that this is ridiculous i hate it that much they hate it that much for like you know micro transactions and freemium and this guy ryan john adams tweets it cost 110 000 to fully gear up in diablo immortal as in it's a freemium game so if you want to buy all the goods you got to spend allegedly a hundred and ten thousand dollars is how much it takes to like max out your stats uh and you don't even own your stuff we've turned video games into rich kid country clubs wow that's a great metaphor do nfts fix this or do they make it worse uh now nfc talks about that and there's a take later on in the take section that this is going to be relevant to but like nfts could make it worse or they could make it better it's up to the technology but at least it provides an option right and so this is like what's been going around in the nft crypto twitter world is like nfts have the ability to fix this where you can allow people to buy and have the same sort of monetization but at least they get to own their own assets and maybe we like tamp down on the egregiousness of a hundred and ten thousand dollars to max out your character yeah so there's a huge difference a hundred and ten thousand dollars like that is just revenue to right does blizzard still own dude leaves your hands blizzard yeah yeah it's just like it's all revenue on blizzard's side right uh it's very different than somebody paying like 110 000 in a game for example i'm saying that that's an egregious amount of money but they're buying it from another player right right so so blizzard doesn't generate that upside it's some other player that got in earlier or did more within the game it's the players that are actually receiving this economic return that's a completely different model than what we're seeing in uh diablo right and like you can just imagine how much more adoption there will be where using the 110 000 number one player pays another player 110 000 for their items and then blizzard just takes like a one two three percent cut on that yep and because players are not feeling just like extracted from and they're actually able to make money because some player made a hundred and ten thousand dollars it on boards a ton of more players and that's like one of the very basic ways to integrate nfts into games van spencer talked about this on our podcast with him uh but it's like you know you can give out nfts for free and have them be like valuable in the secondary markets uh so nfcs do fix this once we figure out the form factor for nft such a it's such a cool model that no one's tried like axi was silly like you had to pay to mint that sort of thing but like you know vance's concept is no all the minting should be free and then the game publisher just makes money on the transaction fees why don't we try that i think we will see those experiments in the future so we got a fix for you guys uh diablo immortal uh you know people who were enthusiastic about that game but found a predatory i think nfts are coming to fix some of that uh what is budweiser fixing here i'm seeing some horses on screen david dude budweiser's is killing it in like the nft world the branding world budweiser is now the official beer of zed run and zed run is a is a bit like a metaverse horse racing like ecosystem right so they rate you the horses are nfts and you can bet which horse is going to win which like wow people love to gamble right and i'm a big fan of like like you know those horses are like brutalizing in real life right and so for just like animal rights let's just make nfc horses in like the metaverse and like we'll race those things rather than like making actual horses race anyways uh budweiser is like a sponsoring the whole this whole virtual horse racing ecosystem uh and so there's a bunch of a bunch of horses that you can like purchase or bet on uh and uh yeah so budweiser like sponsoring i have never felt the the need or the interest in betting on horses until now this is pretty cool yeah yeah i mean if we wanted to ryan banclos we could buy a horse if we wanted to we could have the bank you want to buy a horse a bagless horse yeah uh isn't there is there some like um vitalik uh yeah yeah there's there's the bloodline yeah right yeah i i don't know how to find it i have not explored this website anyways i think this forged from fire horses is vitalik oh my uh uh well budweiser uh coming up next uh i think you guys remember uh when i talked about how uh the spongebob squarepants nfts were coming to ethereum versus with uh this ip they remember this yeah very excited yeah so we're getting closer ryan uh nickelodeon nfts uh nickelodeon underscore nft twitter account so the 90s called they want your attention back if you're reading this you're early hashtag nickelodeon nfts uh and so like all the 90s kids who like have crypto money now uh they're gonna have some nfts that they can purchase and like like i said like you're talking about yourself aren't you i might be buying the spongebob nft like i might do that um everyone hands off i will outbid there there's going to be a forked show it's just good bankless spongebob edition where david just steals his spongebob nfts yeah no that's exactly right anyways so uh call to action for anyone that enjoys nickelodeon and nfts uh plan on which nfts that you want to buy as long as it's not spongebob save your money save your eat guys it's gonna be a big one uh on the um the regulatory front uh the new york mining ban that this has happened this is the headline new york just passed a bill cracking down on bitcoin mining here's everything that's in it we won't go through all of the details but david this is the first state to actually start to institute a um a ban on carbon-based power sources bitcoin mining being the the primary one targeted what do you make of this yeah so this the author of this is uh mackenzie sigelos i actually met her at east denver so shout out to her she's a fantastic well-researched high good intent uh uh reporter so i can actually trust her as good signal here um in the article it says following an early vote in albany on friday lawmakers in new york pass a bill to ban certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources the measure now heads to the desk of governor kathy hoechel who could sign it into law or veto it if hotel signs the bill it would make new york the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure according to perry anne boering founder and president of the chamber of digital commerce industry insiders also tell cnbc it could have a domino effect across the u.s which is currently at the forefront of the global bitcoin mining industry accounting for 38 of the world's total miners if it passes it would make the eunuch the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure i said that twice do you know what though david texas ain't doing this man it'll just move over it'll move down south right i don't know like there actually is a ton of energy in pennsylvania um and there's there's a bunch of data centers in pennsylvania so it actually makes sense for bitcoin miners to be there but like technologies like clean energy though it's not actually i don't know i don't know yeah coal energy and that sort of thing but yeah other states will be happy to pick up this slack i don't think that this is a a thing unless you get this instituted federally and do you think that like congress or you know through executive order there's an appetite to do that no no definitely not um there's there's so much there's a decent amount of lobbying power and like no one really has it out for bitcoin mining all that much just new york new york has always proven itself to be like a very hard state for crypto companies to operate in anyways i live in new york now all right so maybe you can change a few things around there or maybe not i don't think you're gonna you know come down on on one side of the proof of work uh you know proof of work debate but um that is increasingly a debate that bitcoiners will have to stand a low on as we alone on as we made that point earlier in the in in the show um david some raises this week the first one block flag it's a one billion dollar valuation and that sounds like a lot but it's actually down from their previous range so we're starting to from their previous race so we're starting to see the the bubble i guess deflate a little bit from private markets we've certainly seen that in in public markets um prices going down and what's this uh euler finance they just raised as well a 32 million i believe what is euler finance euler finance is a money market like compound an ave but also like rory and it kind of combines the best of both worlds between compound and ave slash rari rari where you have fused pools where you can make up any market on any parameters but then compound and ave have the benefit of like a shared central liquidity source euler gets tries to do the best of both worlds uh and they have raised 32 million dollars uh there is an article that i'm releasing i'll talk about this more in the rollup for what i'm bullish about there's an article coming out on bankless on wednesday that features eight projects that i'm excited about eight projects that i'm bullish on uh euler is one of them and so if you want to dive down the euler rabbit hole that article might be for you awesome uh also some jobs that might be for you of course we have the bankless jobs board i'm going to read out a few of the jobs from this week this is david's first time dancing in new york city maybe about to see that i got i got to talk about the the twitter specialist coming up first on the banquets drops is the bankless twitter specialist if you understand and know how to work and manipulate the twitter algorithm we want you and so if you're a good thread or if you're a good tweeter and you know how to get a thousand likes uh apply for that job okay uh now now he's gonna get to dancing uh also a research engineer at blockchain capital a tech lead at swell network a solidity developer at unlocked a senior product designer at streams a business development lead at goldfinch associate business operations chain link developer evangelist at argent as you can see guys crypto industry is still hiring if you want to check out those jobs go to the bankless jobs board palette dot com slash jobs or submit your resume to the talent collective uh go check that out we want you to get a job in crypto dave we're gonna have to burn through these things because we got to be quick but did you know that gracedale might be getting ready to sue the sec all right so grayscale has this product that we've talked about before it's called g g d g btc uh which is basically a trust that holds bitcoin it's kind of like a a pseudo etf but it's way more expensive like higher management fees kind of trades off the actual price of bitcoin it's kind of a crappy product compared to what an etf should be to no fault of their want to make to no fault of their own they want to roll that they want to convert that to a fully fledged etf but guess who won't let him the sec won't let them so grayscale this time is a tweeting out as we enter the final month before response is due so they just submitted another application to get the sec to approve their etf they've retained donald b uh valeri is that what he says anyway he's a uh former solicitor general of the united states and apparently people who are inside he's a lawyer a badass lawyer okay uh this is jake travinsky strong move grayscale means business the sec's deadline to approve or deny the application to convert gdbc to to etf is july 6th no doubt it should be approved i don't see how the sec survives a legal challenge if not especially one led by dan verrilli spicy spicy gearing up gearing up and so crypto is taking it to the courts this was another uh tweet that i saw sec lawyers are starting to quit because gensler wants to litigate cases not settle here is a former sec lawyer who actually quit he says this i like to try cases but i also like to win i was looking down the pipeline at the types of cases the sec is going to bring and not seeing a path towards victory on the sec side of things said a former sec official wow it could be that some in the sec maybe gary gensler are overstepping their bounds and this is going to be settled in court so uh crypto is lawyering up and i'm here for this fight i think it's a good thing i think we need to do this i love it i don't usually like to feel sharden freud even though it's in the name that you do enjoy it but like i feel an insane amount of shot and freud over the demise of the sec well it's not just look man the sec should be doing things of yes yes exactly yeah i mean to uh obviously to clarify and look the truth is we should have had an etf product for bitcoin forever ago a long time ago and it's hurting every week that goes by every month that goes by it's costing retail millions of dollars the fact that we don't have this uh david jay-z and jack dorsey teaming up what are they up to yeah jay-z and former twitter twitter ceo jack dorsey are teaming up to launch a financial literacy program titled of the bitcoin academy for residents of the marcy houses project in brooklyn new york where the rapper grew up they're offering classes ryan from june 22 to september 7th including classes titled such as what is money what is cryptocurrency what is blockchain and how to keep yourself safe from scammers jay-z uh says everyone should be empowered to make informed financial decisions in order to take care of themselves and their families ryan if i had a class that i was a part of in middle school or elementary school or high school titled what is money i'd be a lot smarter by now uh and so like the the conversation the less the class of what is money sounds like the most fun class of all time uh and so some some underprivileged uh kids in uh the uh are gonna be able to hear about what is money and skip over boomer finance it goes right into crypto finance nice job jay-z if you want to bring equality to the world you got to start with financial literacy and this is this is how you started education that's why we do what we do and i'm glad you know jay-z and jack dorsey are teaming up on this one uh david did you know chipotle you can now pay for a chipotle burrito and get the guac if you want uh with eth all right with bitcoin with dogecoin with 98 different digital currencies it's pretty crazy you know what wrong chipotles i just consider that adoption so let's just like wrap this up like i think we're done here this is yeah we made it we made it so like here's the thing it was never about buying the uh you know starbucks coffee with bitcoin it was it was the burrito burritos burritos now we made it it's burritos every chipotle i actually want to try to to do this and maybe i'll uh i'll tweet it out when i do just uh just you're not gonna spend your eat on a burrito bro ah dude it's guac it's burritos are my thing i know i don't know what your like food is of choices but like if there was one food item that i had to eat every day it would definitely be kind of that tex-mex combo of like rice beans maybe some protein maybe that's not what i've expected i'm learning something about it yeah well what's yours probably is you're going to get a skirt steak skirt steak okay like where can you get that at like fast casual though like i'm talking like the fast casual fast food level of food you're not gonna get steak at uh yeah i will not get fast food today that'd be agreed just i'll have to think about that uh maybe we'll talk about that later in the show anyways coming up next sorry to disappoint you ryan i have to think about that answer uh coming up next questions from the nation such as advice for dropseeker somebody asked us some job advice so we're gonna answer that also op token value beyond governance and if we have time to get to it how to convince friends and family to be bullish on eth explain like i'm normie the bull case for eth is a question there and also followed up by hot takes from crypto twitter so that's what's coming up next don't go anywhere but we have to get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the brave

you want to get in the weekly roll up get your question in make sure you respond to the tweet we have we we put that out on the bankless hq twitter every wednesday here's the first question david i'm going to throw this at you this is from willybillyboo.eth nice.eathandle as well willybilly what advice would you give to someone trying to get into the industry with minimal tech skills for example i'm an educational psychologist but i'm trying to find a path forward in crypto not sure where to start so from one psychologist to another psychology i guess you're not a psychologist but you minored in psychology david what advice do you have for willy billy boo yeah really billy boo uh so yeah it's like the way that i i answer almost everything you don't have a tech background can you write well because if you can write well you can do so much in crypto so many people need good writers who can communicate well communicating crypto is hard that's why bankless is what it is because ryan and i have figured out how to communicate crypto with metaphors with connections with getting people to understand complex topics quickly if you have those skills write more and so that's how i got my foot in the door as somebody who's like tried to figure out how to get a job in psychology and was like well crypto's way more interesting i don't know what to do i'm not a developer maybe i'll have to learn how to code i just started writing and that snowballed from there so whether you can like tweet very well or you can write a blog post right very well or if you can be a technical writer if you can communicate or just like be a good communicator of a project that project will hire you uh so learning to communicate in crypto native mediums like on twitter and articles short form articles how can you how can you collapse as an insane amount of information into a short as uh as short of a paragraph or sentence as possible and still retain all of the alpha is an insane skill that almost everywhere in this industry needs so not sure where to start start making content communication is a skill that crypto needs desperately for sure uh david here's another question uh this is from rick letona.lens that lens nice handle rick i i hear from time to time that the op token that's the optimism token will have value beyond governance when they start to decentralize sequencers but i'd be lying if i said i understood that fully can you explain it explain why the op token has value aside from like responsibility token or governance a token why do you think it might have value in the future david yeah so this system of opi token gaining value actually is also related to eventually the ethereum layer ones because the the layer two for optimism plus the ethereum layer one are going to exhibit the same pattern so this is a lesson that works beyond optimism and is generally part of optimism's vibe of how layer twos can provide a business model to open source so all layer twos they have blocks based sales uh people pay transaction fees to get into the block uh and that transaction fee is eventually going to go uh towards the op stakers because optimism will be a proof of stake network where you are staking op tokens to be a block validator just like you are seeking uh ether to be a block validator on the ethereum layer one what happens is that there is a system like kind of like a pyramid of transaction funneling that begins in these things called uh sequencers and the the job here is done by what are called searchers searchers go and they search through the mempool and they sequence a bundle of transactions and so these are like kind of like mev bots uh people the searchers will look at all the different dexes on a particular blockchain and they will order transactions in a way that benefits them some mev and they will put a bundle together and these bundles are generally going to be optimized for like dexes or some other specialists will specialize for uh borrowing and lending protocols and mev borrowing and lending protocols there's going to be all these specialists that bundle up transactions in ways that they are very very tuned to extract mev from and these specialists are going to bundle up transactions and they're going to send them to the builders and the builders are going to basically bundle up all the bundles so the builders bundle the bundles uh and then the builders accept the bids from the searchers to accept their bundle and then the builders put a whole entire block together and then the builders send a bid over to the op token staker saying hey here is this block that i've constructed for you using all of the bundles from the searchers and then once this block is is uh this block comes with a bribe towards the op token it comes with like a payment like a tip to bribe the op token stakers to accept their particular block because they want their block to be accepted because they get mev out of it and so they pay a bribe to the op token to accept their block so what this does and this also again is go the part of the future roadmap for the ethereum layer one is this basically takes the entire value of the economic activity on a layer two or the layer one and it puts it into the proof of stake asset being the op token and so that is the path forward for not just the op token but for basically any like uh layer two that wants to follow this path and also for ether on the layer one so rick that is how the op token will have value beyond governance uh if the community gets it there to that point in time uh that is i don't think it's actually codified anywhere but that's kind of the vibe of optimism yeah so the short answer to that is whether it's the optimism token or any other layer 2 token the answer to the question is what's the value it's a maximal maximally extractable value it's it's that thing david was saying called mev and that the thesis is assuming like um high market competition at the searcher level and at the builder level all of the value is going to flow up to the stakers of that asset in this case the op token stakers and of course governance handles this there's some public goods funding associated with the optimism ecosystem but that basic principle follows to all layer twos and also follows to um to stakers on ethereum so if you're selling blocks this is and you're staking this is essentially the way you're going to make money in the future uh david this last question here how can i convince my wife to let us move more of our savings into eath smiley face this is from nx uh n1x but seriously how would you explain the potential upsides of a larger eth allocation especially pre-merged to someone with a very limited knowledge of crypto i'm going to take a you know a counter take to this i want to hear what you say but here's my counter take you can't i don't actually think you can explain it all right so i think that and what it can boil down to someone who hasn't had spent the time to actually understand um why money exists why it's valuable why if there's value but all of the things you're learning on bank list it often collapses to like hey this thing's going to be really valuable because i said so and because i like i think it's very difficult to distill your thesis into anything more than like trust me it's going to be valuable in you know a year's time two years time five years time that's my take on it i actually don't think you can tell someone why it's valuable they actually have to do the hard work and find the conviction themselves but why do you take a stab at this answer david yeah the explaining crypto to people that don't get it is certainly an art uh and so it really depends on where this person is in their like crypto perception like if they think crypt is a scam you have to start the conversation at a different place but let's let's go ahead and assume that this person doesn't think crypto's a scam they do think it's real they just don't know how or why or like the details around that the way that i explain ether is that like in the traditional stock market in traditional equities market a lot of people just like ignore all of like the trading of which to stock to buy and they just buy an index right they buy the s p what you have to do is you have to explain how ether is basically an index for the entire ethereum economy that is based on top of it which is true uh so transaction fees from nfts transaction fees from d5 when somebody mints a token that puts transaction fees on ethereum when they do anything on ethereum if you use ethereum at all you pay transaction fees in ether and then that ultimately becomes part of the ether value proposition and like you actually don't even have to explain like oh transaction fees leads to upside in ether this way you can kind of just like explain that at the very high level when when people use ethereum more they need ether the currency more and ether as a currency and the more that ethereum becomes useful a lot of that gets imbued into ether the asset people accept that on face value so i think all you have to do is say like ether represents an index for the entire ethereum economy so you don't have to buy this token on ethereum you don't have to buy that token on ethereum you don't need to like diversify across like the whole entire ecosystem because ether itself is an index of the entire ethereum economy and the ethereum d5 economy is like not 85 90 of all of defy and so you can tell them you can get exposure to so much by just buying ether because ether is an index of the ethereum economy and the ethereum economy is massive yeah i think that makes sense and then you also have to explain why you think the ethereum economy is the one that's going to win kind of the power law above other alternative layer ones because then my next question would be like oh cool so i should buy ether but then i should also buy like tron and cardano and like solana and polka dot and bitcoin too is that what you're saying so you also have to um you know talk about that too right uh yeah i i think that's actually explained you the answer would be like ethereum is the longest standing smart contract platform that's gone through multiple cycles so it has stronger it's been around for longer so you can have better assurances that's going to be around longer than all the outlayer ones and so you can feel better about that position i just think people are going to hear that and just like maybe i i don't know it you have to develop the conviction yourself is also my takeaway so like oh i agree with you that's the best way to explain it it's it's um it's hard to get there just from hearing it once from one individual so i don't know if this will work in your marriage uh my friend yeah good luck with your wife and one ex okay good luck with that uh anyway david let's get to some takes of the week uh this is from metallic um he says this is a great example of why i'm so proud of optimism for adding non-token governance the citizen house optimism explicitly has goals other than just to make op price token go up and the only way to do this long term uh is with explicit representation of non-token holder interest he's talking about the ability or that the citizen house which is not based on the amount of tokens you have but based on you as a unique individual identity uh in inside of optimism so can you explain what his take is here david yeah there was a proposal inside of optimism to use the op token as the gas payment token on the optimism network and like all the token holders like yes this is good we like this this increases the op value and then the citizens house was like guys this doesn't really make any sense like optimism the token's not a currency like maybe it provides a short-term price increase but it doesn't do anything in the long term and so these long-term thinkers that aren't thinking in price token number go up short term that the token house is are able to balance the incentives and this has always been the idea of the dual house model the short-term incentives of the token price of the token holders because they want the token parts to go up but the long-term people that understand the five 10 20-year vision of optimism and making sure that the choices that we make even we can definitely like lean into like making the token price go up as long as it doesn't get in the way of the long-term vision of optimism and so the citizens house uh balances off like the short-term degens of the op house so it's like it's like the short-term house versus the long-term house and vitalik is just giving props to optimism for having this long-term house uh balance off the short-term benefits of like the d-gen token holders that's really cool i didn't realize that that that's what was going on here here's a take you want to read it out and explain it yeah so somebody tweets uh bitcoin is digital gold ethereum is blank and jake bruckman we've had him on the podcast he answers ethereum is analogy resistant and i love that tweet ethereum and ether breaks all previous models what is ethereum is it gas is it a store value is it a money like it's all of those things and so in order to understand ether and ethereum like it doesn't work as an analogy you just have to under it's like it's a brand new thing it's like it's never been seen before it doesn't fit into any pre-existing models people that try and place and bucket ethereum into a model are really just like doing the whole blind man feeling an elephant thing uh where they're just trying to measure one aspect of it and so ethereum is analogy resistant i think is a great take there you go and n1x explain that one to your wife just just tell her it's uh analogy resistant that's why we're going all in how about this tweet from zora nft is the medium not the message interesting nft is the medium not to me the message i have to think about this but what do you think it means yeah i think this we can continue this conversation off of the diablo nft uh conversation uh nfts that nft is a standard it's a token standard erc721 is a token standard and so it is the medium of a message not the message itself so nfts can be good or bad they could be stupid silly little jpegs of like weird goblin things or they could be actually like revolutionary and actually innovative and so when the gaming world comes and says get your nfts out of our games they're not hating nfts they're hate con they're hating on the container that the nfts are they're hating on the message that they're containing in this particular moment in 2021 crypto the message that is being contained by nfts how these nfts express themselves and what they are will develop over time so nfts the container will stay the same but the message that it contains will develop and evolve and iterate and eventually win the hearts and minds of all over the world that's cool that's cool very cool uh ryan this is yours you want to read it out for us yeah i uh this is comes from a book you know the marc andreessen podcast he recommended a whole bunch of books and i've been making my way through them the first book uh that i started with was a conflict of vision by uh thomas sowell and um he really talks about the these two kind of visions that have classically been at play in all um political philosophy right since like the 1700s onwards and it was crazy to me david how i i see these two conflicts of vision play out in crypto and also between like crypto advocates and crypto skeptics and it really hinges on the question of what freedom means and what equality means and the question of like does crypto bring equality some people will say yes it does like us for example and some people will say no it doesn't and the reason why these disagreements occur is because we actually have a different vision in terms of what freedom and equality actually means so i tweeted this that one person will say crypto gives us a fair and egalitarian system another person will disagree they'll say that there's wealth inequality of course it's not free and egalitarian but that's just because we mean different things when we say free and equality so crypto people we generally emphasize a quality of process right so do i have the freedom to fork to run a node to get my transaction in at the market price that is freedom if i'm treated equally as all other participants if there's no bias if there's no special interest that's why we emphasize algorithms rather than humans we want ungovernable systems we want equality of process all right so that's what we mean often on bank lists when we say words like freedom or equality but others are like uh hold on that's not actually equality that's not actually freedom that's kind of like some like crypto speak garbage uh because equality of outcome is what actually matters and they'll point to things they'll say look at the distribution all right go look at the ginny coefficient of bitcoin who owns it a whole bunch of whales same with ethereum other networks are even worse and who actually cares david and ryan if anyone can tr tr transact on the network because it costs like 50 to transact on ethereum at rush hour times and no one can afford that the 99 can't afford that so you know what's actually a better solution maybe something like china oh what china has going on which is a cdbc that's actually banking the unbanked providing some value to them remember our podcast with richard turin david where we talked about all of the people in poverty in china that were getting access to banking services through a centralized cbdc they'll say that's way better than your ponzi games and your fake moralism around decentralization but the reason that this debate happens is because there's a difference we're talking about a quality of process and uh some of the detractors and scepters are talking about equality of outcome and this is a debate that i am i'm learning now and digging into this that's gone on for centuries um people have uh had this debate between like you know people like uh adam smith and hobbes on one side of the debate quality of process uh and people like godwin and rousseau on equality of outcome opportunity and i think it all hinges upon this debate um so really good uh i i think um mental model for me to understand in this book a conflict of visions i'm curious your take over uh over some of those things you don't have to read the book to get those takes i kind of summed it up but uh what do you think about this yeah it just reminds me that something like 90 of debates ultimately settle down to becoming a semantics debate where like most people agree even though they're debating because they actually haven't agreed on the terms and so like people that debate about certain things they're actually debating just like difference in emphasis or there's like difference in what some words mean and so it sounds like a lot of these things is like well we could actually could agree if we were actually in agreement as to actually what our vision is for a particular thing yeah that's the thought that came to mind yeah i i totally agree and i also believe that like the blended systems actually provide the most resilience because both both of these visions do have some some merits and what you're really trying to do with like a system like ethereum is try to find the right mix right so you can't go extreme on one side or the other uh anyway um it's something to think about what are you bullish on this week david okay ryan i'm i'm super excited about this okay so i'm right i've been writing this article i know i've been teasing it to you uh it's like uh i don't know what the title is i'm trying to think of a hotter title but it's basically eight projects that i'm bullish on in the build market uh and so there's like a bunch of different projects that are behind the scenes some of them have already gone to mainnet some of them are about to go to mainnet but it's like projects that most people i don't think have really heard of and so i've written this article that it's like a complete like concentrated download of all the things that i know about that i don't think the rest of the crypto industry has really like caught up to yet it's all of my alpha it's all of my alpha it's all the alpha i got it's eight projects summarized and distilled and the bowl case is explained uh and so like there's a bunch of different ways to get value out of this article that's coming out on wednesday so like if you're a big spiffy hedge fund investor you'll be able to get a pulse for the the directions of the general crypto startups uh to start the the startups that i'm talking about are like some are in the d5 space some are in the layer two space uh some are not even on chain at all uh some are in the nft space uh and so like another way to get value out of this article is if you're on the hunt for airdrops probably almost every single one of these except for maybe an exception here there is going to have a token i've gone and for every single project i've gone and found all the open job listings so if you are looking for a job there is a job in every single startup that the that they have available and overall if you're just like trying to look for new sectors of crypto to explore and just like get downloaded on information and get a better view of what crypto is all these things are in this wednesday piece uh every single piece every single project has uh additional resources that i've labeled beginner into intermediate or expert for uh diving deeper and going down the rabbit hole uh so like i've said uh this is just like the most concentrated amount of alpha that i can like get into one single article uh so ryan that's coming out on wednesday and that is what i'm excited about that's awesome man i i think this is also a a template for what people should be doing during the the build market right the bear market it's an opportunity to breathe but it's an opportunity to go research some incredible projects that are still building and uh there's opportunities whether you know it's your your resource your time capital working there or whether it's like your actual capital to kind of get in and invest or you know whether it's just uh messing around in the ecosystem this is what everyone should be doing so you can all look at david's eight projects but you can also like come up with your own list of projects as well maybe some of these are on your list but maybe some of these are new directions that you're able to explore so it's a cool template uh there too but david where can people find this because people are listening on the podcast and they're probably like okay where's this gonna be is it's gonna be a podcast or where where can i find this this is not gonna be a podcast you are going to have to put on your reading glasses this is coming out on the newsletter is a newsletter with links and stuff and so that's coming out on the bankless newsletter so there is of course a link to like and oh so like and subscribe definitely like and subscribe but also subscribe to the weekly newsletter that comes out at a bank list and then this one's coming out on wednesday awesome cool man ryan what are you what are you bullish on i have eight things i'm bullish on what are you bullish on yeah i'm just i'm bullish on these dress rehearsals man i'm i'm bullish bullish on the merge okay so we just saw the dress rehearsal it went well like we just we we went from proof of work to proof of stake like we did that the entire ecosystem did that uh and uh it went well and that to me feels like we are right on the cusp of this thing it's feeling more real than other we've got a second and third dress rehearsal for the merge coming up but what i'm seeing out of the the core ethereum community is um i've never seen it so galvanized like there aren't any detractors about the merge you know remember with things like eip1559 some people are like oh this is terrible let's not never do that let's not do this there was some detractors in the past we've had other contentious issues inside of ethereum this is not contentious at all and it's because it's part of the the core social contract that we all signed up for when uh we first you know learned about ethereum which is this migration from proof of work to proof of stake and all of the benefits that it accrues including monetary system benefits efficiency benefits uh removal of uh electricity usage all of these all of these different benefits and they're all coming to a head so um what's crazy to me is i think we're actually going to be like this is we talked to tembayko about it and we're like tim are we really going to be changing engines mid-flight here is that the analogy you should use he's like that's exactly the analogy right that you should use so i can't believe we are about to change engines mid-flight right the pitcher 747 we're going into the engine we're swapping that out we're putting another one and we're in mid-air we're not on the tarmac we're not on the ground doing this we're in freaking midair and so that's crazy to me but the crazier thing is like david i think it's actually going to work like i think it's just better to say like damn that you're putting a really dangerous image in my brain right now no i think it's gonna work that's what's crazy about and that's what i'm so excited about so we are simulating doing that in midair right now and um yeah the after seeing the first dress rehearsal uh go live and work it's made it all feel more real yeah uh tim baiko an interesting perspective that we had out of that show is that like he said 50 percent of the complexity of the merge is because we don't want to turn ethereum off to install the install the engine and then turn it back on again like we don't want to land the plane add the new engine and then take off again we want to do it in the air so nothing gets disrupted and like that level of commitment to ethereum uptime is why the purge has been so complex and i kind of forgot like that that there's a perspective to have yeah absolutely all right david you ready let's get to the meme of the week man meme of the week yeah mr depp you're down 95 have you ever considered selling no i can't that's a no i love it oh my god uh johnny depp from the trial i love like the moody music and uh that's exactly how i feel no i i i can't celebrate also the uh the for the podcast listeners just missed they missed like this like groot smile that he says like when he's asked like why don't you sell he's like i i don't know but he's like smiling about it like i can't tell yeah that is exactly the vibe exactly the the mood during the bear market i'm feeling uh all right guys that's it that's a wrap been the weekly roll up for uh the first full week of june we hope you enjoyed it as always
