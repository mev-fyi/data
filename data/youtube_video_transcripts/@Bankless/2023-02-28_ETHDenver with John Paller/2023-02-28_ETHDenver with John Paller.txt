foreign ation on the Pod today we have John power who's just on the podcast a few weeks ago uh representing opolis regen web 3 employment this week we're talking about East Denver so Colorado has a hub for regenerative crypto economics Biddle week which is a hackathon that happens in Colorado um shelling point near day all of the side events to ethereum John Sutter philosophy on regen event building and then Spork dial which is kind of a co-op that produces East Denver that you get membership in by joining youth Denver so I think it's kind of a fun episode for thinking about local activations that are regen and it's also the second live episode that we've done together so a little bit of an experiment and I hope that you enjoy working in web3 is awesome but working outside of

gotten bigger this year and uh it's really cold in Colorado so I feel for everyone it's only going to be cold today you know tomorrow's gonna be 55. yeah okay so the weather will will improve but I I I paid to have it improve I said it's okay if we have it sort of cold Friday yeah but like we're gonna we're gonna improve it tomorrow for sure well we're showing Colorado for sure you've done a really great job of making Colorado A Home of a regen web 3 and just importing people into web3 so I gotta say Kudos Denver's growing a lot over the last couple years I couldn't have done it without you man I mean in fact I can't even take credit for the Show Colorado meme that was you back in 2017 yeah I remember me and you at it was either a boulder Meetup or a Denver Meetup we were talking about this you know the idea that Colorado actually has a social and cultural vibe that fits the web three yeah ethos and we're like well we should just make Colorado the epicenter for this and then you came up with the Show Colorado thing and I just put it into the Lexicon and here we are man yeah 2023 now it's long that was what six years ago yeah um yeah it's granola over the last six years and uh so how big is Ethan we're gonna be this year well so we're at the bit of week kickoff we're expecting a few thousand people today um over the next 10 days I would expect we're gonna see probably somewhere around 30 000 people um it'll be definitely north of 20. uh it's always hard to predict with free events you know especially if they get freaked out by some cold weather who's going to actually get on a plane or not but we've already seen thousands of people in town and uh yeah it's gonna be I mean we're gearing up for the world's largest ever produced web3 regen event so it's going to be something I think I saw you tweet sometime over the last 24 hours that you Denver is gonna add something like 100 million dollars to the Colorado economy yeah yeah I mean it's funny there was a comment on there asking well yeah it's like four thousand dollars a person it's like well have you looked at what airfare is if you looked at what hotel rooms cost like have you looked at all this not to mention what sponsors are putting in to side events and parties and all these things I mean every venue in this entire neighborhood is rented out multiple times it's really hard to get a hotel room I gotta say it's impossible to get a hotel room I can't even get hotel rooms and we've rented out everything I mean everything is booked so um yeah we did we did some we put together like a pretty simple model based on how you typically like estimate these things and you know if we have 25 to 30 000 people in town it's it's not it's a pretty reasonable estimate to say that you know somewhere around 100 110 million in overall economic impact and then there's sort of spillover from that I mean when you have direct span and then there's indirect spend and I mean there's there's a bunch of different ways to look at it but it's it's a huge number it's a huge number well what I'm interested in is the symbiosis between the local government and the local economy in the web 3 community and I think Governor polis uh who who I know the that you know and have done some work with has really been embracing the web 3 community and it feels like it's a model for other jurisdictions to become friendly to Innovation into web three uh not only see their local economy boosted by events but by innovators moving there permanently to uh to to innovate in spending in their local economy yeah I mean at the end of the day the Governor's job is to create economic stimulus and vibrancy for its community that's what that's what they're supposed to do um there's an office called oh edit which is the office of Economic Development International Trade which is actually part of the governor's office and um their entire mandate is looking for ways to stimulate Innovation spending investment growth both here and even creating Partnerships abroad so the web 3 Global nature ethereal nature fits well with their goals and you know the fact that we've been able to like also create a physical presence here more so than just you know a conceptual one is something that that I mean it aligns perfectly with what they're supposed to be doing so it's not you know something we have to convince them oh this is good for Colorado um it hits all the bullet points it's Innovative it's um and Innovative not in just a broad sense but in in a in a sense that's really good for communities like it's good for the average citizen um the average citizen doesn't have a clue about most of this stuff yet but you know as we continue to experiment as we continue to um you know practice our trade and figure out you know how to you know what the recipes are you know more and more you're going to see more and more people participating and it's just going to be it's a network effect kind of thing yeah we're just in the early stages and you know Governor polis has been you know Visionary and instrumental in allowing this and and sort of supporting it from an executive level because from his View um you know this is the kind of Legacy stuff when you talk about creating a new paradigm of you know we call it a new paradigm of politics you know it's it's uh sort of progressivism and a technology sense meets sort of self-sovereignty and and you know egalitarian systems I mean it's it's a really interesting kind of new thing well that's what's interesting to me about Colorado is that it's libertarian in the sense of not really favoring a lot of big government but it's also very Progressive in the sense of uh I mean Boulder is just one of the most Progressive places in the country and so that intersection I think is where I I find a lot of people in the web 3 kind of vibe with those two political axes and it's a really interesting mix because you know in the typical libertarian sense I so I refer to myself as an egalitarian libertarian which means I believe in you know equal footing systems that give you know people open and and fair opportunity and then the outcomes are really up to the player right you know let's build better games that allow people to participate let's remove barriers to entry let's give people Big Time upside and then let's get out of their way you know instead of the nanny stayed sort of we're going to fix your life stuff for you on the one end or the you know don't tread on me stuff on the other end I think it's I think it's a third Paradigm if you thought about those as the the binary option you know left and right let's think about this is up it's pulling the rope from the center in that tug of war right so it's it's it's kind of picking from The Best of Both Worlds into a new thing and I wholeheartedly agree with you I mean the um it the the the social sort of pieces of the libertarianism and the progressivism are an interesting mix and you don't see it around the country much I mean it's definitely not a New York thing yeah and it's definitely not a San Francisco thing you know Banking and VC culture are very different yo this is you know an opportunity opportunity I see within web three people who recognize the need for public goods and regeneration but they don't trust the government as an institution to do it and so what if we could build smart contracts or networks that are able to do that and and I guess it's with that as a platform that I don't ask you about the regen Meme and your embracement of the regen I mean yeah you know you said Colorado is a hub for region economics in what way has the region mean proliferated East Denver and and you're thinking about this space well I mean uh East Denver is now the world's largest regenerative economics live action experiment I mean we've literally taken the event itself and put it into a regen game I mean the sport token sporked out you know all of the incentives the game design the economic distribution The Cooperative legal framework everything is is experimenting with a new way of creating engagement value um for the average person that might be interested in coming to this you know the the traditional quote conference Vibe slash Paradigm is a cost center you know you come you spend a bunch of money uh marketing dollars on the p l and then you go home well wouldn't it be cool if we could create a regenerative game out of that so that we could actually accrue value from the efforts that we put in and then distribute those back after we've all put in our expenses I mean it's the beautiful circular life of regen games I mean that's that's exactly what we're doing so so let me just say that back to you in in in the in the way that we've defined regen I actually got uh regen defined or refi defined on coin market cap and what we said was it's a system that goes up in capacity over time and we're not just talking about financial capacity but like intellectual Capital yes and social capital and material capital and all those things and so when I hear you describe that Vision basically what we're talking about is the export of biddling of software which is intellectual Capital to the world and then also the LCA uh framework in Colorado the rich Spork dial is incorporated is a public good to the space of of legal uh Innovation and then um it it feels like the fact that all the sponsors and the participants actually get to participate in the spork Dao create sort of like this virtuous cycle that perpetuates it through year over year so that's how I would like Define it in terms of how we've defined regen and refi in the past and I'm wondering how that resonates with you I mean that's yeah you know to me you could call it a bunch of different things positive some games is the cinnamon cinnamon synonym for it because there's incentive instead of this sort of scarcity landscape where we're you know somebody's going to take my idea I don't want to collaborate because some games right where it's it's you know there and the underpinnings of all that is fear you know it's you know capitalism 1.0 is underpin on fear and it's it's ironically done a lot of good for the world in terms of like you know getting people out of poverty and sort of beginning the curve but we need to evolve to something more sustainable so we have to evolve to a place of abundance mindset Community is the new IP in web3 so we don't have to worry about as much about like the the stealing of ideas because it's really the execution of ideas and the community is not going to support people who steal things and and do things nefariously I mean there's there's some social overtones that that sort of police indirectly a new paradigm of how to do business and those that collaborate are rewarded and those that that contribute value in a multi-layer way are rewarded so when you look at each Denver and the amount of biddling and creativity that's been expressed in the space I mean we've had thousands of projects come out of the event over six this will be our sixth year and it's really quite beautiful because they people can do it in a way where they can they can just do it without economic barriers without fears without concerns because the community is here to support them and and not just extract from them so you know there's a whole bunch of things that you have to do to set the table to make this work but in the end it's a fantastic way to experiment frankly as we refine these next Generation games because I don't think anybody's really you know built the template yet you know if you look at the capitalism model you've got a Delaware C Corp and we've got the recipe like you raise Capital you sell 20 of your company you build it to a strategic exit or an IPO right right rinse repeat rinse repeat this is how we build value we're gonna do that same thing in the network State we're going to do the same thing in the regen State and we're going to have a way to build exponential value distribute that value to communities which is again the new IP and they'll have incentive to do it because the contribution of their time attention and creativity will be held in these networks and then represented by these Community tokens that create that vibrancy and and return of value to them at some point in the maturity curve the vision that comes to mind for me is the Nathan Schneider exit to community meme where 100 instead of selling to Wall Street you're selling to the community that's actually attended um and so um yeah I mean I I I want to I want to talk about middle week and I want to talk about the actual like object level stuff that we're doing on the ground yeah could you maybe touch on stuff on sportdowell real quick and how how that works yeah this is the year of the sport right this is the year of the sport so this is the year we're gonna really get into the explanation of the sport Dow and and how ownership works you know how membership Works what the spork tokens use for um all of that stuff because you know I think some people know but I mean even if every person who showed up to Ethan last year comes this year over 50 percent of the people here are going to be first-timers so most people don't know much about this and so we want to make sure that they understand it so sportdow is a limited Cooperative Association um Incorporated here in Colorado um it's it's you know Spork Dao is a community event Dao or a digital event cooperative and it's owned by its community so attending eat Denver people who show up as part of your application process you signed a membership agreement if you opt in it's an opt-in thing you don't have to do it but as part of that you become entitled to participate and receive Spork which is the unit of account that we use to distribute value back to the community when the time comes if and when there's profits and things like that it's called a patronage distribution in terms of cooperatives and it's a fun way to think about a Next Generation event experience because it's like when you come it's kind of like REI for events I'm an owner you know I'm actually part of the I'm not just a consumer I'm a contributor an owner and ultimately a receiver of a portion of the value that not only I contributed but lots of other people as well yeah I mean it feels like the opportunity to be part owner as a contributor is one of the big memes and ideas behind web3 you know Airbnb couldn't do a distribution to their hosts of their token or their stock and Uber couldn't do it and I really think that this is one of the most regenerative things that web3 can do for the world is make turn us from consumers into citizens and part owners of our economies and I I think it's the most important thing in fact I would say I would go so far to say this is of all of the tools that we've created in web3 smart contracts Dows nfts the most important thing is the coordination mechanism of a community token now how the design of the community token is executed is Paramount and this is why I'm so excited about Colorado co-ops yeah because the legal rapper that makes it not a security and it really helps sort of like give Clarity to Regulators about what you're using it for so what we use it for is the unit of account that the Dow uses to determine how much of the profits a member is entitled to if and when there's a distribution of patronage right okay so there's also a voting component at some point with governance but like that's down the road but right now it's just that unit of accounts so if you own a bunch of spork and you're staking them which is something we're launching um at eastender here you'll be able to is it an announcement is that just a casual Alpha League that you're gonna move fast okay cool let's make this work stake your Spork you're going to want to stake your Spork for sure because that's basically putting your marker down saying I'm in on this thing I've earned these sporks so every person who's attended eat Denver historically has has had the ability to probably got a nice little airdrop list like with the attendees for the last five or six years oh my God we have over 40 000 unique holders of spork I mean it's a pretty cool Community I mean to get an Engaged community of forty thousand unique holders is not an easy thing to do and win three oh but you know also just like the template I think of providing value first and then generating that value or that list through the value yes and seeing who's engaged in then doing the token distribution is just the way that all projects should do it in the future you know it's it's easy to say it's really hard to do yeah but um but we have the Good Fortune of having other reasons why people want to be here right so it's not like we had to convince them about a token or something else I mean we don't need to and and we're happy to you know let the the idea of Spork and and the demand for Spork and um all of that mature over time and and take our time because like we we have again the Good Fortune of having thousands and thousands and thousands of people who are engaged in the value that we create aside from that this just happens to be you know a cool like oh really like I actually get a wait let's like I get a particip it's a free event and I get to participate in like the ownership of this like how does that work it's pretty cool so you know again it's a big experiment um you know it seems to be working but you know it's not none of this is mature yet and we'll just see how it goes right okay I got one more question about this worked out and then I want to talk about bid a week yeah why why is Spork so it's a spoon that has little the four prongs yeah the four okay so the four prongs of the fork what are the four prongs the four prongs of the spork are community um eat Denver buffcorn ventures in Colorado Jam okay so we the meme of the spork is you know if you think about the buffer corn is the merging of the magic of the unicorn and the strength of the buffalo in simple terms so the youth Denver mascot is Buffalo half unicorn and you know how many times you ever seen a unicorn collaborating with another unicorn like never that you never see I've ever seen a unicorn actually now that I think well now you gotta really screw up the joke um the point being is like even conceptually unicorns don't hang out with other unicorns unless you're my little pony you can ask my daughter about that but Buffalo but Buffalo do right so the community Vibe of the buffalo with the magical Fantastical nature of the Unicorn makes for some fun memes so um yeah yeah I also gotta just so everyone knows who's not local to Colorado the Buffalo is a symbol of Colorado I think the CU their mascot is the Buffaloes yeah um okay got it yeah so the spork is something similar so in terms of web 3 or just protocol talk there's this thing called A Hard Fork which is usually a contentious Fork of code so in the Bitcoin Community back in 2017 they they forked from you know BTC to BSC and whatever else right or BS very contentious very uncollaborative now certainly you know that's fine you know if people want to do that I I guess I'm I'm fine with that's kind of the point of Open Source is being able to Fork communities and yeah and do I think it's great but one of the things I love about the ethereum community is it's so much more collaborative so they were calling some of the upgrades of um the ethereum protocol back in 2017 softworks so then I just uh it kind of just sounds like a spork to me yeah and so I started tweeting about that and like and then you think about the spork you know and it's it's this uh you know beautiful utilitarian tool that you know if you think about it I could dig with it I could eat with it I could probably even fight you with it I could do a bunch of things with it and it's very versatile so this in combination with the Bittle meme which is the the sort of expression of creativity of one's personal self right you know it's a use your Spork to Biddle you know it's meme Central over here if you're listening on audio only John is has this work in his hand he's just gesticulating with it um but I do think the coolest thing is the so bufficorn Adventure is Colorado Jam which is um a hackathon for the Colorado Lottery that you all ran out here East Denver that's just one of the entities we did we did the the Colorado we did the game jam with the uh with the lottery it but the Colorado gym generally is use cases that might be of interest to the state infrastructure or the state communities that's still legitimizing for the technology oh yeah of course I mean we get to Pilot all sorts of interesting things and talk to different state agencies and governments and yeah you know I mean so far it's it's we're still looking for you know governments are not really set up to apply web 3 Tech in their existing game so you're like the structure the talent prong of their yeah we basically provide the the the talent to be able to like quickly prototype and yeah and experiment because you know if you're trying to do it from inside the state you can't do it yeah so we fund it we do it we have a lot we have all the creative license and freedom to kind of execute how we see fit and then we we demo and pilot and we're experimenting all the time with things I just think it yeah well so the neat thing for me is it so it seems like with sporked out you're not just getting upside in you Denver when you when you have ownership uh and you're not just getting governance in that but you're getting it on all the different prongs of the spork I think and so that's that's what's cool is that like as an attendee of ethender I don't think I yeah I would even know that uh until the year of this work and that's all explained to me and and exactly to just an attend an event and provide value to the community and have Venture scale upside and buff record Adventures exactly that's cool it's really cool I mean none of this has ever been done I mean the closest thing you could say is it's kind of like taking South by Southwest merging it with y combinator putting it in a co-op and tokenizing it and there's what you got right and you're you know as an attendee as a biddler as a contributor you become an owner and the more you contribute the deeper of ownership you get because as a biddler for example you're going to get a much higher distribution of sport tokens than you do just as a general attendee yeah as a sponsor you get a higher spark token distribution but not even as high as you get as a biddler the biddlers get the most because that's the highest value contribution you can do is to Biddle because we then invest in those projects and that's the vehicle of return value because ultimately those Investments the sport down makes the buffcorn ventures makes come back to the spork holders in terms of returns again regen games right so we've created the cycle of life for you know your attendance your consumption Your sponsorship your billing and then through investment and helping build these things into reality actually returning that value to the people that invested time attention and resources beautiful well um I think that I've got at least I think I understand the hyper object of East Denver hyperobject being something that you only see a part of when you look at it from a certain angle and grasping the whole object yeah I'm grasping your whole Vision so like anything else to say about like The Meta level Vision before we get objects no let's let's get into bitawig I think that's the the thing that people really want to hear about bitter week and the eat Denver main event and let's talk about shelling Point let's talk about near day let's talk about side events bit of week uh generally this is gonna I think uh By the time everyone's hearing this it'll be Tuesday um it's Friday right now so just for context here we're at the main stage at the biddleweek Hub which is on at Great Divide Brewing um in Rhino on Brighton so this venue will still be open next through next Wednesday co-working lounges chilling chilling all sorts of stuff going on here um this venue is actually about as big as any other hackathon venue I've ever seen uh the stage we're on right now it's no Sports Castle I'll pour one out for the sports Castle yeah no that's true yeah no I mean for for what it's worth this we've never done anything this big in Grand for a bit a week before yeah it's always been sort of a you know we've tried to accommodate we've tried to kind of offer a little bit of here and there but we've taken it to a whole nother level this year we actually have three venues yeah so it's this one the vibe hotel has a stage in it and the source hotel has a stage in it so there's activities content meetups mini Summits happening today tomorrow Sunday Monday Tuesday and Wednesday through next week until the main event venue opens next Thursday that's the National Western Complex in rhino yeah well um quick show for shelling point which will be on March 2nd and is the region yep event that get coin puts on and and I think that you have helped so I know I'm just Affiliated from Bitcoin it's down now um but like back when I was kind of a spirit animal still but we'll let that we'll let that slide I could be the buff Accord like yeah of half half program I can give you a buffcoin to ride and just into get coined out okay um well I guess what I was just gonna say is that um in 2020 uh we had this crazy idea that we were going to run this side event at East Denver and we called it sustain web 3 at that point you know everyone was focused on open source software and you kind of gave us the space to prototype it and every year Well it evolved from sustained web brain to shelling point and then like every year it gets bigger and more regen and so I think it's it's neat that you're letting other people sort of swim in your wake of running these events and and and grow their own communities and it's not just selling point but it's also I know that near is hosting a bunch of events there's a bunch of other people that you're I mean there's over 300 side events between Hacker House houses side like official side events parties dinners I mean I we've we've seen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them so my philosophy on that is the same as as everything else it's it's positive some games right like a lot of people believe that they've got to protect their space right and we've said well look you know we have a responsibility to execute a good product and if we do if we create a good experience for people there other people are going to want to come in and sort of draft on that and we can either embrace it or we can hate on it and we've embraced it because again and we're trying to contribute to success and to see it as a competition especially at the early stages of web 3 I think is a mistake we're not competing with each other we should be competing with you know darker forces that are in the traditional world or just existing models that need Reinventing or people that just have a resistance to this kind of stuff we should not be fighting with ourselves I think that's the wrong way to see it and it's not living the ethos you talk about collaboration we talk about positive sum Regen we got to do it in all areas of our lives and this is just happens to be one of them so Biddle week is a oh it started as an open source calendar where we just were hosting something to let people because we didn't want to have like an official blockchain week boring corporate stuffy thing but now it's turned into a huge open source calendar where people can do whatever they want and we're happy to support I mean we've got a big infrastructure that we built so you know part of the reason why we wanted shelling point to to become shelling point was because you know there's a little bit different angle and vibe that you guys bring I've already got the infrastructure built yeah so you don't need to recreate you know a million dollar event we can do it for a pittance of that and you know share the wears of a great Viewpoint that otherwise wouldn't get produced yeah yeah well I mean I think that I can't speak for Bitcoin but I'm thankful that you uh you've created that shelling point to create a shelling Point uh happy to do it and I just want to comment on what you said about the culture and not being sort of corporate and stuffy uh you gave me this if you're watching on video you can see it but if you're on audio only I'm wearing this sort of tie-dye uh velor psychedelic uh thing and I think it's a simple manic of your culture that you all create a new weird vibe and meme every year embrace the weird we actually say this quite a bit you know I think a lot of quote conferences have this sort of like template of how you need to be you know it minimums the the Silicon Valley dress up which is the jeans and sport coats and t-shirts right and like I got a patagonally vest in my bag but uh right because it's cold as AF in Colorado yeah it's pretty cold today but remember it's gonna be nice tomorrow you're not gonna need it but you know for us it's like embrace the weird you know it's like everybody's got their own self their own creativity and you know we just don't want anybody to feel like they can't be who they are so we we lead the way on that I mean we literally have buffer corn onesies that you can buy this year right so um little hint on that little Alpha drop if if you happen to be dumb enough to buy one of those from the Buffa swag store and you wear it to Opening Ceremonies you get a freaking sweet present and you're not I'm not going to tell you what it is but you're going to want it so a little Alpha drop to the listeners there if you happen to be like I said ridiculous enough to go buy that thing and where its Opening Ceremonies that's the key you got to wear it to Opening Ceremonies and you got to listen for the call there's going to be a call to action of sorts okay hint hint all right next Let's uh I'm I'm teased I'm I'm intrigued that is fun um yeah so where the buffer corn uh onesie if you buy it to the opening ceremonies and you get a gift and then then the opening party let's talk about that so the opening party's uh being hosted by near uh sponsored by shelling Point sparked out eat Denver yeah um Mission Ballroom I think Mission Ballroom it's gonna be fantastic so that kicks off good venue oh my God it's I mean it's just around the corner and it is the Premier venue in the end and probably in Denver when it comes to like throwing like parties like that and um it's gonna be off the hook so thanks to near uh thanks to Ilya thanks to yudira who's producing it so Shameless shout out for them they put in an amazing amount of time contributing to the east Denver Community yeah um you know a lot of people think well it's ethereum you know like it's actually kind of more like evm Denver nowadays like the ethereum um attraction is something that a lot of these layer to subscribe to as well I mean it's it's the virtual machine that's the most complimentary yeah they're not competing yeah uh you know I used to give Ali A bunch of crap about that it's like all your ethereum killer is like no dude he's like we're we're we we understand like exactly what this is going to be and how we need to interoperate and I think it's a very smart thing to understand collaboration is the key it's a multi-chain future yeah and we Embrace that too we've got I think nine layer ones or ten layer ones coming um and a bunch of layer twos or most are almost all of them evm then so that's the distinction almost all of them okay I mean there's maybe like one that's not yeah and they even say they've got evm coming so it's on the road yeah everybody's everybody's doing ebm so uh so get weird um wear a buff according to the opening ceremony come to the opening party yeah what are other highlights you got from uh one other on Tuesday night so if this is dropping

profile picture on Twitter yeah that's right okay yeah got it yeah so bbp the bufficorn Biddle Brigade is the the 10 000 nft pfp there's many reasons to want to own one of those um at the event there's even a private buffcorn Biddle Brigade lounge with claw machines and other fun tomfoolery things that are going to be going on there there's going to be private swag drops we even have rare swag that you can't get unless you own one yeah um your slide game is pretty strong I gotta say you can't see it if you're what if you're on audio only but there's a lot of fun weird swag that you all have invested in and I think it's culture it's culture it's it's fashion it's culture it's you know fashion is a representation of culture right so the way I see it is they eat Denver sporked out brand and the the way we physically and Visually represented is important it's just talking about it is not enough you know you've got to really think about how do you um give people a piece of the culture to put on their bodies that they want to wear right so it's got to be reasonably fashionable it's got to be comfortable it's got to be you know corporate swag's terrible typically well it's part of participation is is kind of getting into the swag yeah and when you can meld that with with everyday life and culture with with clothing and articles that people actually want to use and they want to wear then you win right and we've we've been very good at that we I see our swag all over the world when we travel yeah to different places swag is one of my metas also so I've taken inspiration from you and uh with the super modular my new company is called super modular since it's Affiliated from Bitcoin and I'm gonna try to compete one up get coin on swag and then we'll have to try to one-up Spork down anything good luck with that but again it's not competitive if you want help I'd be happy to lend a little creative eye now we got to merge the buffer corn which is a unicorn and a buffalo with a get coin robot which is a robot learning to love so Aruba corn Robo yeah robot I don't know we'll figure something out there um well is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say any any other highlights of Youth Denver look I I think the thing that is uh most important is a lot of people think that the main event is really the only thing that you need to come to it's not to see Denver it's a whole it's the whole I mean it's become I mean bit of week so if Denver is just like the beacon chain of all of the different ones yes and and like so check out the bitaweek counter to eatthember.com there's stuff all over the city go check it out like come to the bitter week Hub you know there's co-working Wi-Fi snacks drinks the lounges all sorts of cool stuff that like you know it's not stuffy it's casual you know there's there's people that want to meet and talk and hang out and just and if all you do is come and people watch you're gonna get your fill of that too yeah well there's plenty of Colorado to enjoy skiing and breweries and all that kind of stuff lots of Colorado fun although I will say please enjoy responsibly it is very dry out here drink lots of water elevation pace yourself if that gets to you um the beer is stronger if you have ipas and if you're into like marijuana gummies like please pace yourself actually yeah my first year at Ethan where I cleaned up puke of a major project founder that like had too many I won't say who but like yeah I remember I remember that and and yeah I did buy memory so now I now I'm trying to tell people to be responsible yeah word of warning the the marijuana gummies are a lot stronger than you might think they are yeah well they're well labeled in terms of they are but but when you're at altitude and you know all all the other physiological things that happen when you're at altitude just pace yourself be careful and hyped up about East Denver for all yeah I mean you know there's there's all sorts to get over your skis if you're a noob super easy again the altitude is a big deal and a huge factor in that for a lot of people coming from sea level so I think it's it's uh you know it's just one of those things just you know just pace yourself there's a lot of time if you're in town now you know take the day to acclimate you know kind of ease into the pool because you know you got plenty of time you know I'll be around um all week at bit of week so I'll be actually uh hosting the Buffalo laughs event on Tuesday evening and um yeah I'll also be at uh The Source hotel pretty much all day on Tuesday for the future of work Symposium in the morning and then the uh the Dow thing in the afternoon I think you're going to be there too aren't you for that uh yeah that's the pin yeah so anyways yeah I mean I think that the thing is uh and at worst tune in to live stream yeah everything's being live streamed september.com you can grab the various feeds on you know on the links it's all being streamed on Twitch everything will be updated um to YouTube within you know certain period of time so you'll be able to go back and watch various talks or if you missed something um but yeah I mean we're trying to canonize all of this and and provide as much free access to to learning and wisdom and creativity as we can weirdness also weirdness we're expecting pushing probably 400 hours of Total recordings in in content so I mean it's a lot more than any one person could possibly consume but um there's something for everyone I think that's a great place to end it John your force of nature thanks for doing this thanks man good to have you brother thank you looking forward to the whole whole bunch of events this year thanks and uh yeah I look forward to getting weird with you man
