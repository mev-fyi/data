crypto is going to outlast any Administration any any official who you know has the wrong idea or whatever and so we can go through good good periods and bad periods as long as we keep building and then the people who are engaged enough on the Civic side who want to do it that's great the people who just want to build that's also great we need both I think we'll get there eventually welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless everything you wanted to know from the coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong including his Reflections on 2022 and his outlook on crypto moving forward that is contained in the conversation that you're about to hear a few benefits some takeaways for you an index of things we talk about number one Brian's Reflections on 2022 how bad of a year was it what was learned number two the regulatory situation that faces America right now in crypto how did SBF infiltrate our Halls of power we ask them that question and how do we undo the damage and win over our legislators number three we talk about base chain this is the new layer 2 Chain that coinbase just launched in the absolute worst regulatory environment we've ever seen why did they do this uh number four does Wall Street even understand crypto do they understand coinbase we talk about the fundamentals and finally number five we get to one of my favorite Parts in this whole conversation towards the end which is Brian's best advice for the settlers and the builders who are sticking around during this crypto winter David this was an exceptional episode what should listeners pay attention to for me I think the the thing to pay attention to is to try and listen to this episode viewing the force for the trees as it relates relates to Brian Brian arrived on the scene in crypto 2011 and started making coinbase in 2012 and ever since then he's been fully committed to like building out coinbase laser focused as the high highs of crypto came and then the low lows of crypto came and then that cycle repeated like three or four more times until where we are today Brian has been with his Builders hat on focusing on making the best product possible at coinbase and so just zooming out and viewing Brian as a builder who is able to make it through the the waves of the market cycles and wake it make it through the scams of Mount gox to to FDX and yet be unfazed and just put on the hat of responsibility for stewarding this intro this industry into where it needs to be into the long term I think if you you can probably listen to every single sub part of this episode and still see how that there are certain qualities that people have that make them just really able to survive in crypto and I think we're just really fortunate as an industry that we got Brian in the industry in 2012 so early and to be an Exemplar of these characteristics to be a really good crypto person and a really good crypto Builder uh I mean I just have a ton of thanks for it for Brian and everything that he's done uh and so I I think you'll also be listening to that in this episode yeah and also in the debrief because David one of the things I want to discuss with you during the debrief is how not a diva Brian Armstrong actually is which is actually uh pretty satisfying coming out of all of the like egomaniac maniacal Founders and and scam artists of 2022. so reminder for bankless citizens you have access to the debrief which is our episode after the episode that David and I record with our thoughts on what we just heard in the conversation we just had if you would like to upgrade to become a citizen of the bankless nation there's a link in the show notes where you could do this also David we uh we joke during the episode that hey we should turn this episode into an nft fun fact that's actually happening yeah he didn't catch on that joke no uh so we turn our Monday podcast into nfts we will be releasing this as an nft there's usually a launch at uh 3 P.M on every Monday so this will become an nft and release this for the bankless nation I'm actually really looking forward to emailing Brian and say hey Brian remember that part about the US turning this podcast into an nft well we would like to airdrop you one of the 100 nfts that we're about to make by the way that wasn't a joke that happens I I don't know if it's legal will allow that

Armstrong on the podcast and he is the CEO and founder of coinbase of course coinbase started in 2012 as just a custodial Bitcoin wallet back then uh oh my how far we've come it's grown into a massively successful publicly traded company that we know today serving a lot of crypto listeners uh worldwide the last time we had Brian on the podcast actually was an interesting time it was November of 2021 what a different world it was back then versus a just over a year later the beginning of 2023 we've got a lot to talk about including FTX including catching up with coinbase products including 2023 Brian it's great to have you back on Bank list how you doing I'm doing great thanks for having me back guys all right let's uh pick up where we left off last time all right it was a different world back then um 2022 was in some ways what we feel like is crypto's Worst Years I I don't know if you share that because I know you've been in uh some pretty bad years even before we got into the space and you've seen seen a thing or two but what did you learn in 2022 and what are kind of your Reflections do you agree that it was one of our Worst Years uh is there ever any Silver Lining there and what did you learn yeah I'd say 2022 is definitely a pretty bad one I mean it reminds me a little bit of the mount gox era where similarly the market came down a bunch of people lost some money every the only thing it seemed like people were asking me about or talking about for six months or 12 months was Mount Cox Mount Cox Mount Cox and we had to kind of go it was the industry was so tiny back then but same thing we had to go out there and educate the world and let people know that it's not all Bad actors there's a lot of good people trying to build in this space even if the headlines are disproportionately about the Bad actors and then you know funny thing happened I think like about 12 months went by and then people sort of moved on and they stopped asking me about it as much I don't know it took maybe 12 18 months something like that and it was just kind of gone from people's memories so I'm hoping something similar happens here we've got a little ways now before we get to that 12 18 month Mark but that's what a lot of my time has been focused on is getting out there and trying to educate the world remind people that this industry has a lot of great companies and and people in it and we're not going to let the actions of any one bad actor uh call the entire industry into question what were some of the learnings from 2022 in your mind every year presents a new set of of learnings what were some of the lessons you took coming out of that year yeah well I mean so one was that I think we grew too quickly at coinbase um in the upmarkets I always try to remember that it's Never As Good As It Seems right and then down markets you have to remember it's never as bad as it seems so I think I you know I I probably got a little too caught up in the moment just like everybody and it felt like we had a line of customers out the door you know our biggest challenge was really just how do we even onboard all of the people trying to use our products and so it was easy to just keep adding more and more headcount and I think um the culture of a company is really strained a few sort of more than double head count in a year it's got too many new people who are training the new people who just joined and the culture gets kind of diffused you know decision making is unclear who's in charge of what communication breaks down too many too many too much game and telephone and so um we definitely exceeded that a bit in 20 um that time frame around 2021 2022 early 2022 I think we hit almost 3x or something like that over a 12-month period so that was probably too much I would have I would have changed that in hindsight but I think the the big things we got right which was we always were a company founded uh that focused on compliance and trust and security and we invested a lot in doing those things the right way and that's not always the fastest way and I have to say it was definitely very difficult in those moments where we saw companies um like FDX come on the scenes and just rock it up and you know um he was kind of speed running the uh the elite conferences of society and all the introductions and everything and part of me was thinking man I've been working on this for 10 years this guy just kind of is coming moving so fast after two or three years like how is he doing it maybe I'm maybe I'm the one who's got it wrong um well it turned out he was kind of you know um doping I guess if you want to make that analogy and you know using customer money would in an ethical way so that wasn't great you know I think I guess the major lesson I learned from that is yeah it's Never As Good As It Seems like if it seems too good to be true maybe there is something that that probably is and keep focusing on what we know best I mean of course we want to move fast we want to execute but we're also we're not trying to get rich quick or cut any Corners we're trying to make sure this company is around for generations to come and we can serve as this really important you know Foundation to help people get Fiat into crypto but then also to use crypto in all these different ways and we can talk about how we're decentralizing more of coinbase over time you know some people have sort of incorrectly felt like oh coinbase is like just now pivoting to compliance like no we've even 10 years ago when I founded the company I realized okay we're gonna have to go get money transmission licenses and you know have compliance teams and you know the centralized actors of crypto are going to be regulated they should be regulated like exchanges custodians and stuff and so that's how we're going to build trust in this industry and make sure it stands the test of time I like the rest of the industry definitely want to move on from Sam bickman treat and FTX but I just got to ask a couple more questions on this front as he was as FTX was peaking and everyone was just like loving the product and uh Sam bakeman freed was a hero among uh many different camps outside of crypto did it like make you like question yourself it's like wow FTX arose so fast uh like what were you thinking about like Sam bakeman free was he like this insane operator or did you start to get like your hair stand up on end because something like felt wrong what was your intuition as this man seemed to be invincible yeah well you know all of us are driven by ego to some degree and I like I'm no exception to that right and I think I always try to pay attention to where where is my ego getting involved and where is it where am I using good judgment um and so I think there were definitely there were moments where I was like man why is this guy getting so much attention so fast um where you know we've been trying to work on this for 10 years and it and it did feel a little unfair or something like that but then I would always the thing that I think actually caused me to be a little bit blind to maybe it was too good to be true is I always felt like that's just your ego talking and like you know get back to work like don't you can't you can't ever compare yourself to other people just try to do the best that you can and so I basically try I chalked up a lot of their success to just um I I don't know like it I wasn't going to let my my ego get involved now in hindsight maybe I should have looked more closely at some of those things and I have to tell you if I ever see anybody again who moves that quickly and suddenly is on the cover of all these magazines with people proclaiming them as the next Warren Buffett like it's definitely going to cause me to be more discoverable yeah one of the differences I really appreciate just the the wisdom that you have around from just being in crypto throughout all the years and understanding like just the the machinations of the crypto cycle and what'll what'll it'll do to you like the the bottom is always not as bad as it seems the top is always too good to be true et cetera um but with Mount Cox like coinbase was a very young company during the mount Cox era I think something just like two years old at the time there weren't a lot of other structures to get torn down as a result of Mount Cox to fall down fast forward to where we are in 2022 though like there's a lot of structures in crypto there's a lot of big businesses and now all of a sudden that's the big difference that I see is that when FTX Falls um now we've got much more of a mess to clean up with Mount gox like we could kind of just like forget about it like we'll just wait this one out this one doesn't seem like we can really weigh this one out this means like we have to actually fight against the regulatory backlash that Sam bankman freed has left us so how has the FTX collapse in sandbankment free collapse impacted coinbase as a business like how have you guys had to deal with this what's the backlash that you guys have gotten yeah well I think you're right we're not going to just going to sit back and wait for the the winds to blow this over there's a lot that is in our control and we don't want to feel like we're we're victims are helpless um you know I think luckily coinbase uh just for I'll talk about there's different orders of ways to look at this so the first order effect was literally like what what's the counterparty risk you know there was contagion there was um others in the other dominoes that fell as a result of FTX obviously going down and one thing I have this was sort of a learning going back to your prior question was that the importance of risk controls inside these companies is incredibly important and um you know we had an incredible Finance team and CFO and leader who built a risk function within coinbase over the prior years and they were essentially underwriting every counterparty that we where we were storing funds with various things to operate our business um and we were at some point we here during the crisis we were actually underwriting some of these things daily even Bank partners and and things like that as you saw with silvergate having issues so that's kind of taking some of the best practices frankly from traditional financial services and for the centralized actors in crypto I think some of those those skill sets are actually really really needed um so that was that was one of the first things but I guess just zooming out what can we do how can we actually proactively sort of counteract this this narrative that's developing out there which is that um crypto is something that needs all this regulatory Crackdown well I think one thing is to say look we agree with it right like the centralized actors again they should be brought within the regulatory perimeter there's there's a misconception I I'm very surprised to hear this but occasionally I'll interact with people in DC who still to this day believe that everybody in crypto essentially doesn't believe in regulation they don't want to do kyc AML they're all trying to Skirt the Rules and from where I'm sitting it's almost like impossible to believe how could this be true because for 10 years we've been working on this we've been saying this but you know you just have to remember these people are busy they're not in crypto every day they they only hear things you know anecdotally through their friends or through the media they're living in a little bit of an echo chamber sometimes and so just even repeating the very basic messages like that in on the East Coast or in DC when we interact with folks you can't kind of underestimate the power of that now I think going beyond that and just showing up and having these meetings and you know building the relationships and I'm spending more and more of my time on the East Coast um the other big thing I think we can do is we need to activate our user base in crypto and you know there's some really great polling data that's come out recently which shows that about 80 of Americans are feel that the financial system doesn't work for them right and it's too slow the fees are too high it doesn't serve everybody equally and so there's a real interest in sort of updating the financial system if you will and I I really believe crypto is the most important technology that can update update the financial system so you've seen in coinbase's messaging externally internally we've started to go out there and tell that story a little bit more that's a message that I've seen is resonating with people who are you know kind of crypto Skeptics or they're on the fence they're they're they're thinking about crypto as being a financial product and they're like this is some unregulated Financial product and the point we're sort of making to them is no this is this is a technology it's a technology that can improve uh Financial Services in a variety of ways but it's not itself a financial product per se um and so what we've been doing is um another thing we've been doing is we put out actually this uh this post crypto 435 people can can Google it what we're trying to do is get the the community of crypto holders out there organized and say let's elect leaders in the United States who believe in crypto they want to make sure that this technology is the Innovation potential of it is protected but it's all also we protect against Bad actors and there's a sensible regulation for centralized players in crypto that could help make that happen um you know I'd encourage anybody to kind of go Google that crypto 435 and it's little it's simple things it's like let's get donations even like 100 bucks from you know a million crypto holders or something or show up at Town Halls ask these questions um these kinds of things can really move the needle and if we elect representatives in a democracy who believe in our our values around economic freedom um then all of these regulatory challenges are going to end up in a good place eventually well let's let's talk about this so the analogy we've used at bank list like it really felt like this in in 2022 is um some of the kind of the scammers in the frauds of 2022 had this gigantic house party right and uh they destroyed everything like the furniture's uh torn up like plates are smashed you know biggest craziest house party match there's a fire like the cops show up it's it's a complete mess and now they're gone but we are left to clean up after this party and I want to get a sense of of the magnitude of of backlash that you guys might be seeing in DC and we as a crypto industry now now face it feels like everything got a lot more hostile uh sometime after November of 2022. we've talked about things like operation choke point which is this some strategy to kind of like choke out the banking sector in the U.S um there's like increased scrutiny on this industry and it feels worse than it's ever been at least the U.S I think you know in Europe and other places people are still sort of moving forward um can you kind of just describe what it's like are you feeling that too and like if so do we deserve this like is this uh something that we caused well as an industry I do think we deserve a little more scrutiny I mean that's probably fair to say but um yeah I mean look there's a lot of people who they are only tangentially aware of crypto right and there's also frankly a lot of people who um a lot of what they think comes from media headlines right which in the crypto that's actually increasingly becoming sort of an unpopular uncommon thing most people have sort of realized that there's each media organization has sort of their own objectives they're trying to push in the world and they're almost more like lobbying organizations in a way and so they're getting their news from other things but that's not true of the majority of people especially I'd say people over 40 or 50 in the world they're they're still they grew up in a world where traditional media was like the main thing that they consume so um there it's it's very simple it's like if they see bad headlines they start to get more skeptical if they see positive headlines they start to get more optimistic and so that's not really fair it may not even be accurate but it is what's happening and so um as we get the media sort of our messaging out there we need to make sure we're we're using New Media like channels like podcasts like you know bankless um YouTube Everything Twitter blogs and but also engaging with traditional media channels because sort of some of these Gatekeepers policy makers Etc they're a different generation they're an older generation and they are still using some of these traditional media channels and it's very interesting to under to sort of get a sense of what kind of messaging really works with with those folks right you know for the crypto native audience probably like a lot of your listeners this messaging about like economic freedom and decentralization and you know like technical audiences especially I that's the kind of thing that resonates the most with me when I read the Bitcoin white paper in the back in the day for these audiences that are older they're non-technical they're not really in crypto necessarily for the same um you know uh religion or something like that that we are but they resonate with these messages around um you know the the financial system needs to be updated it's slow it's archaic the code is from 40 years ago like the laws are from 100 years ago and that message is actually pretty widely agreed by 80 of Americans um you know I'd say for Democrats they they're interested in a quality of opportunity they want to make sure people get Fair access to financial services that resonates with them I think for um Republicans you know there's often an argument just about um you know actually economic freedom does resonate with with uh Republicans and also just sort of like in a pro business like National Security type argument they they're saying hey this is a major Tech Trend we need to have this industry built in America it can't just be pushed offshore just like what happened with semiconductors and 5G and now with AI like they're like this is critical infrastructure to be built in America we need to support our American companies so you have to sort of tailor the the message to the Right audience but um this updating the financial system argument is the one we've found that work that works best in the broadest audience that's great yeah we'll come back to this but I think there's also like huge wins for for the US in terms of exporting its monetary policy and exporting the the Dollar by route of stablecoin but but we'll get there one one question that because you've spent some time on the east coast in DC now one question that's I I'm still perplexed about is how in the world this is our last question on SBF I promise but like how in the world did this guy get such influence in America's Halls of power it was like reports of like one-third of Congress had received donations um political donations from SBF he clearly had the attention in in DC like how is this game played and because if if it can is just kind of a money game that doesn't actually not make me very optimistic on um like the Democratic process and the systems of of control and power in in the US but you've seen this from behind the scenes and like how is this game played Brian and how did this guy get so much influence in our Halls of power you know I've asked myself that same question and frankly it's funny I I feel like I show up and I and I um I'm pretty easy to get along with people once they meet me they're like okay this guy's clearly he's trying to do the right thing and maybe I agree with him or disagree with him on some stuff but he's just like a legitimate person trying to build something in the world he you know I'm an engineer by background like I I sort of just if people ask me a question I'll like sometimes all I know how to do is say the answer um I think that SPF so a few things one he had an I think he had like an incredible passion for policy actually he was spending an inordinate amount of time in DC I think that um he also the shibboles right which was the quote that he put out there he basically started saying what they wanted to hear now it wasn't really fully authentic and so that ultimately blew up in his face but he basically was framing these things in a way that they was music to their ears for some of them I guess maybe more on the Democrat side and I think they got duped by it and it wasn't even authentic if you look at some of his texts that got released and everything like that so was that an effective strategy in the short term maybe but it ultimately totally blew up in his face because you just can't be inauthentic with people that's like that's one of my learnings if I disagree with somebody I'd rather you know I'm not going to be a jerk to their face or something but I'm I'm going to say what I actually think in a polite respectful way because if if I say something I don't believe like they might leave the meeting feeling good but then a week later or a year later when they realized I didn't even believe it they're just going to feel even worse and so um in a way I don't think I'm like I'm not sophisticated in how I play the game I'm actually playing a very simple game which is just I show up and I say what I think but I think that's actually the right solution long term that it's not a game at all I'm just trying to be an authentic person um now by the way I don't think donating money I don't know how much his donations move the needle it's definitely raises some big questions and I hope some of that money gets clawed back in one way one way or another um I don't think donations are entirely bad I think you know the crypto Community actually if you look at um the banking Lobby or you know the oil and gas or any of these other Industries the motion you know the entertainment industry or whatever like they actually do put a lot of dollars behind um their lobbying efforts in DC and it's not all just companies doing it by the way it's it's the individuals it's it's people so there's something like 50 million people in the United States now who've used crypto I mean imagine if we only even just got one million of those people 150th um to become a sort of politically active or donate 100 bucks to the right candidate in their jurisdiction um and in every Congressional race when there's an open seat or whatever there's going to be somebody who's more crypto positive and someone who's not and we've actually started building some of this stuff into the coinbase app so people can go look up in their area you know what what's the rating a through F of the the people in your in your area I think if we can get just a million people in the crypto space politically active you know show up to the town halls donate the money um you know like tweet about it and like build this movement it's going to be incredibly powerful um DC does not yet I don't think they don't yet respect the crypto Lobby they don't realize how big of a movement this is in the United States it's bigger than some of the biggest ones you've thought about some of the most powerful lobbies we actually have more people in crypto um and they don't realize that yet oh my God where do I sign where like where do I send money like seriously um if this could be organ organized and aggregated in an effective way and maybe we'll talk about some ways coinbase is doing that like I we would be happy to provide be a megaphone for this this is for us this is about um like it's not a it's about crypto but like you know I also live in the US uh so does David we care very much about the US like protecting these digital Liberties in the 21st century and so I think you'd have uh we would have a large Collective of not only small donations from a large motivated population but the idea of like a crypto kind of um you know movement uh and a Lobby group that is kind of bottom up from the from from the people but like your comment on the long game you still think it's worth playing Brian you still think over the long like in the long run your strategy of just telling people what you think what you believe the truth like reminding them is an effective strategy that this is not a dead end because I think there's a certain segment of of listeners out there bankless listeners who they've just given up on the political process they've just given up on kind of regulators they've just even given up on like voting they will not show up town halls because they no longer believe that the process works and they'll even point to things like 2022 SPF right he had it was pay to play it was just you know lining politicians with with money and like the longer the long game you're playing sounds nice Brian but like it doesn't work it's not effective these politicians are corrupt you seem more optimistic than that can you give us the uh the case for why we should be optimistic yeah I mean look I understand why people are um cynical about it it is it raised a whole bunch of questions about the process and does it work and if if not where um there's a really great two by two graph that I love that shows up sometimes I think it's from Edelman but it shows um sort of trustworthiness and competence I believe and it sort of Compares different you know government and ngos and for-profit businesses and um for a while there was sort of nobody in the top right quadrant who was both trusted and competent and slowly people have started to view um and government's not there by the way it's viewed as not trusted and incompetent if you believe this survey um business is sort of increasingly moving into that top right quadrant if you look at their recent data and I think business basically some you know for-profit businesses have a role to play as champions in this space of helping organize um individuals hoping craft policy um you know we don't ever want to take credit or like inter you know inject ourselves into the Democratic process because I think there's there's a line you can cross there as just one private company but if you're talking about the individual citizens the voters I'm talking about there's 50 million you know people who've used crypto in the United States I'm talking about the people here in a democracy the government works for the people not the other way around right so democracy is is it's slow I think that um that's probably the biggest frustration people have is they're you know they're saying this is so obvious like all my friends are using this I'm on Twitter every day like how do people in government not get this and then in DC they're sitting in a different world there's a there's an age generation gap there's the type of media that they're consuming Gap now but the good thing about America America has many flaws and it's slow and bureaucratic in many ways and it there's you can be wrong for a long time but what eventually ends up happening is that sentiments shift in the U.S um a new a new generation of people emerges they get people who run for office the vote the electorate the voters you know um change and basically America has this kind of self-healing system imagine how bad it would be if we got someone anti-crypto and they were dictator for life or something like at least we can just wait four years or eight years in the worst case or something and get a new crop of people in right so that's that's very slow by technology standards but in terms of governments in the rest of the world it's it's not bad and so um you know crypto is going to outlast any Administration any any official who you know has the wrong idea or whatever and so we can go through a good good periods and bad periods um as long as we keep building and then the people who are engaged enough on the Civic side who want to do it that's great the people who just want to build that's also great we need both um I think we'll get there eventually I want to Circle back around to the original question that Ryan asked which was how did Sam banquin freed get so involved with politics and and Brian your answer was that he was really playing the game uh he was playing the game of politics and and he just by the nature of what happens when you intentionally play that game for playing The Game's sake like that's what happens like you just find you find your way in and I really appreciate your answer of like uh you said that um you're and just a naturally born engineer you see a problem and you state and answer and so what I'm saying is like as someone who's known you and we've uh had like uh an episode and a half of a podcast now and I've also thoroughly enjoyed the the coinbase documentary as well first principles type guy a problem mindset type guy and it sounds to me like you're um thinking of way about Waze at coinbase to funnel those people who care about crypto and crypto values into being able to connect to the politicians that will resonate with those values and as my co-host likes to say if you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values and it sounds to me like you're out you're addressing the same sort of like engineer mindset that you did to build coinbase to also allow for people younger Generations because I'm assuming the average coinbase users a younger uh generation uh customer to connect to the politicians in question that resonate with our values and is that is that my my intuition in this criteria is like perhaps coinbase is it taking an engineering type approach to solving our regulatory Ires I think that's that's a fair way of putting it yeah I hadn't actually thought about it that way myself but you're right I mean I'm just I'm just trying to figure out what is the best way we can get the right outcome and for me the right outcome is more economic freedom how do we make sure that this technology a billion people or more can benefit from it and if there's a lot of misunderstanding and mischaracterization about it out there how do we correct that and I think you know there's many ways to accomplish that but one of them is just we have a ton of people um in in the US and in every country who are now using this they can see the benefit of it and they're voters and so let's have them get organized and make sure that politicians understand that if they want the crypto vote you know they're going to have to understand how to create better policies here right and and you don't just have the people but you also have the money by definition uh and so like connect all the pieces of the puzzle here there's there's Representatives that are uh good or bad as it relates to crypto there's perhaps interested voters that are also coinbase users and by Nature that there's their coinbase users they also have money on coinbase like what is this uh again taking this from an engineering mindset what is this what does this uh look like when you put like there's a feature in an app somewhere right in coinbase where we can look at the politicians and is there like a um send money yeah is there a send money or like uh I don't know send likes or something show support yeah so I mean there's a product created in the top left of the coinbase app and you can go in there and look up the policy um data but yeah I mean we so by the way there's a bunch of um election rules around this too we have to be careful about exactly like you know require requesting somebody donating specifically this candidate right in the app and like we have lots of lawyers looking into this but um you know certainly just making information available to people and things like that is a good first step and that's why we helped create like this crypto 435 the name by the way is referencing 435 congressional districts in the U.S so that's a great place um through a third party people can start and I think yeah like every hopefully more and more apps in crypto people's Twitter accounts like podcasts like this one you know we can get the word out and then if we if we if we organize the crypto Lobby or the crypto um you know user base I think that it'll be a very powerful feature over time so really quick so we get an action item here uh coin coinbase is 435 program what can people go do right now in this and uh how can they help get you know exercise their voice here if they live in the US yeah so I mean look it's very early days today but um first thing you do is just Google it crypto435 and go sign up and then um you'll basically start to get more information over time so it'll be about key races that are coming up um you might see uh a through F Type scores of different candidates based on their public statements of what they've said about crypto in the past or um and then you know there hopefully should be opportunities for people who want to donate to those candidates um if they want to show up to town halls if they want to call their Congressman you know as I when I'm in DC I actually ask people about this sometimes like I'll be in these talking with the staffers before a meeting with a senator or something like that I'm like do you guys actually you know tally up like these phone calls that come in I'm just curious and and they're like yeah actually we do it's like a big part of their job you know and they sort of send aggregate statistics to the um to the senator oftentimes and they'll say all right this week we got you know 30 of calls were about X that seems to be like the top issue on people's minds they're like okay what are we doing about that and it's not like it's not like it's going to change their mind overnight or something like that but it's definitely a way for them to get get on people's radar um so all these things yeah donating calling tweeting um showing up in person and then ultimately like the Voting is going to be what moves the needle into democracy man I just love the fact that the whole point of crypto the theme of what we talk about here is like coordination technology this is good coordination technology and that's really all I'm seeing here is like we PR we have a lucky enough to be uh have a cohort of I'm guessing that the crypto person is the most likely to be a single issue voter and they're going to vote about crypto probably at a higher percentage than most other other people at least for others like single issue voter issues and there have money right and so like the the whole coordination behind this thing I you really just got to give a hand to the fact that like we're built on coordination tools and we know how to coordinate when the time comes so tip of the hat for building the system yeah I mean it's a good chance to try out our our tools here right I mean somebody we should probably do this with a Dao or something like that that would be great um I could imagine people like you know getting sort of like nft type badges around um being a crypto Advocate and like what does that mean um you could imagine um why don't we you know why aren't we raising more money you're like kind of giving giving out nfts for certain politicians to raise there's a lot of stuff we could do that's more crypto native in this space can can I ask you Brian uh just to get more granular on this before we leave kind of regulatory in the US which is like impact on product like so specifically what types of things would you love to do at coinbase that you feel like you can't do in the US right now I know you've made you've written editorials you've made a lot of comments on Twitter about like hey uh Regulators lawmakers just so you know you are pushing this outside of the borders and the geography of the United States with these actions so like granularly I think a lot of people don't understand I don't understand I don't know if you understand yet because it's maybe unclear but like if staking all right coinbase still provides this but uh or staking in general but Kraken it was just like turned off um is staking like allowed for uh companies in the US you have a perspective on that we could also talk about earn we could talk about um stable coins but let's start with staking yeah so you know as kraken's program that they called staking in my view is kind of more like maybe a yield product or something like that but um coinbase's staking program is not a security so we feel comfortable defending that in any way that's needed and we're trying to just work proactively with Regulators to help them kind of um understand exactly what the product is if they want any information that's available on that so staking is is one that's sort of been looked at recently um you know I think another one is just around derivatives right actually like a huge percentage of crypto trading is now derivatives and we've been working with um the cfdc here to sort of get uh you know our derotos platform going that would be in a major a major uh things to be built here in the United States just in terms of like healthy Market structure so so far you've been unable to launch a derivatives Market on the coinbase even though you've wanted to for a while is that the case in the U.S yeah in the US yeah um and I mean also you know by the way I think there should be a robust healthy crypto Securities Market in in the US right um I mean the SEC and the cftc have this kind of debate over what is what and you know that's great we need probably Congress to pass new legislation to sort of help clarify that I mean it's not great it's it's actually been really harmful to the country but we probably need um Congress to come along and pass new legislation on that um but I would love to see if you know the minute that we do get clarity about okay if somebody's little generally raising money for their company or to build something like an apartment complex or whatever they should be able to do that with crypto they should be able to go register that as a security in the U.S and then have um Securities trading platforms and you know broker dealers and all these kind of things that that help that happen and so I'd like that to happen as well um that's something that coinbase has been working on for a while and um hopefully we can eventually get that going in the US but these are examples I think the main the most harmful thing that's happened is just it's not really those are all examples of specific things which we need Clarity that how they can how they can exist with a clear rulebook but the the part that's probably been the most harmful is the negative rhetoric right um you know in most Industries what happens is you you ask the regulator what's what are the rules and then everybody just follows the rules right and if the rules change give us the new rules we'll follow those rules like I think in most CEOs in crypto that I talked to were perfectly willing to do that like just give us the rule book so since there is no rule book people have been sort of um you know doing the best they can in the absence of that Clarity but what's really worst is that we're having this environment of uh regulation by enforcement which is which means not only is there no clear clear rules and there's no engagement with the industry on rule making but just once in a while a random um you know kind of a bunch of subpoenas or enforcement action will show up somewhere at a company and what this this is causing is essentially an environment of fear and a lot of crypto entrepreneurs are now saying okay well I guess I need to build my company offshore in another country because outside the US I mean um because you know the environment is too dangerous in the US they basically can't afford the legal bills um and that's pretty dangerous I mean I think you know and the US is really an outlier here by the way if you look at the UK Singapore Hong Kong all the other Financial hubs of the world are basically saying they're putting they're they're like we're open for business you know we we think crypto is exciting we think it's the future we want the future of this industry to be built here Richie sunac the PM of the UK is pretty Pro crypto you know Hong Kong just passed legislation Singapore I would have met with all the authorities there they're they're like we want to be a web 3 Hub Europe just passed comprehensive crypto legislation so then honestly they're not even thinking that much about FTX um in those regions it's it's actually surprising like this this whole thing with FTX is a little bit of like a scar because he was so active in DC and everyone there is is kind of afraid of being associated with it um but outside the US the rest of the world is saying we want to move forward with this and so the US is actually risks kind of falling behind here well yeah and so what you're describing is what other people have called a chilling effect and that seems to definitely been the be the case that this has this uncertainty this lack of clarity has a has a chilling effect why do you think this is happening in the U.S specifically so our our Regulators just um overstepping their uh their their powers here like do you have any commentary on the on the SEC um you know Gary Gensler has seemed like he's been on a on a war path uh against crypto uh and we have you know when we talk to to folks in the EU um they say hey like we don't have the same sort of Securities issues that that the US has in these jurisdictional things what about it in the U.S is is causing this this chilling effect in this this backlash if we can't blame it on FDX what is the cause yeah well you know look I don't want to comment on anything specific individuals here um but I will say you know for instance in the UK they have one Financial regulator that regulates both Commodities and securities the the FCA the financial conduct Authority and so they don't have this little this Turf battle that's happening in the U.S between the cftc and the SEC right um I don't know I'll kind of leave people's to draw their own conclusions from that but I do think the American system has many benefits but in this case it has some drawbacks too where um the political climate for whatever reason in recently and FDX certainly didn't help has become a little skeptical of crypto now I don't want to overstate that I think it's actually I would say it's a relatively Fringe element almost within the US government that is kind of anti-crypto um most of the people who I interact with there are actually quite reasonable on both the left and the right I would say and actually I'd say there's a general point of view which is we want this industry to be built in America we just think it needs to come in within the regulatory perimeter and have appropriate consumer protections I'd say that is probably 80 of Congress you know um even just people generally who I meet in the government even outside of um the Congress that's that's like the mainstream view I would say so it's a it's a relatively Fringe element that says hey we want to try to crack down on this and like it's all bad bad bad um but what we haven't gotten is you know congression Congress to take action and pass new legislation sort of what happened in the EU with with Mika we haven't had that happen yet and I think there's three three different groups I'm aware of that are drafting different bills and those may or may not come to fruition the thing that's probably holding it back a little bit right now is everyone is just afraid of being associated with FDX so they're kind of like I'm just not going to talk about crypto for six months um and it's it's a little bit of a lack of courage to be honest because you know I was hoping that this moment with the FDX collapse was going to be a catalyst to actually say okay now is the moment to clean this up let's bring it within regulatory perimeter so maybe maybe it won't happen in the next three four months but I think in the next year or two there's a good chance we get some some comprehensive legislation passed how about stable coins uh are stable coins under threat so there's been some action recently against a busd and folks have probably listening have been following that casually but not maybe very closely but is there worry about um something like usdc coming under under some pressure or Fire have we been able to paint the picture of all of the winds that the U.S monetary policy can have through exporting the Dollar on crypto rails right I I um was thinking about this recently we had uh Richard Turin on the podcast I don't know summer like China is way farther ahead than the US in terms of its digital Central Bank digital Central Bank currency right cdbc and the US is like nowhere we're still like the US is still like we're researching it um and here we have entrepreneurs who have basically been like hey we did this thing called crypto to centralize is like open it's the internet it seems to align with with U.S values and by the way our entrepreneurs have come up with you know something that can be regulated on chain called a stable coin like a usdc this seems like a win let's propagate this to the rest of the world you know doesn't America want that to the dollar to to remain uh King and not to be leapfrogged by a competitor in other countries uh currency have we been able to paint that picture or is the US actually coming and attacking our staple coins too yeah well you're absolutely right on the argument I mean the U.S should be if they're not going to go out and build this themselves which would probably be the first choice I think that the minimum they should be embracing Private Industry that's building this in a trusted way um and it's actually almost I don't you know I don't think it's gonna it's funny the biggest thing that they're concerned about is that um there'll be some massive withdrawal from the banks of stable coins and that'll create liquidity issues in the traditional Financial system but what they and I think that's that sort of contagion can be pretty well mitigated with just reasonable risk controls and you know the crypto economy is so much smaller than the traditional economy at this point like it's not actually a threat there a lot of the people there are kind of very um scarred by 2008 and they went through that financial crisis so they're thinking about that from that point of view the thing that they're not quite worried about enough yet I don't think is that over the next 10 years 20 years is the dollar still going to be the global Reserve currency if we don't have digitization of our economy and so they should be celebrating these things like USD coin and and others that are um you know enabling the dollar to participate in This Global digital economy I think you're absolutely right that China is in a place where they are continually pushing their Central Bank digital currency um into more and more aspects of the global economy and This falls into um you know their interaction with Russia and belt and road type initiatives and you know I think we saw an article uh relatively recently that Saudi was going to start to accept like you know Yuan payments for oil and like so China very much has this ambition to plug themselves in as the more of a global Reserve currency because that comes with Incredible privileges and so in a way you know USD coins should be the best thing ever that the from a national security you know foreign policy type thing in the United States and I don't think uh people there quite realize how important it is but anyway I I'm bullish on this I think strictly by the letter of the law um you know USD coin is not a security I don't think it'll it'll have an issue there um and so you know look we have to follow rule of law so does everybody else in the US and so they may have people may have varying positions on it but strictly by letter of the lie I think I think USD coins in a good place unusual up is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody

or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February so despite all of the regulatory overhang all the regulatory backlash just the adverse regulatory climate uh coinbase decides to launch an entirely new blockchain um and so this is excuse me yeah a layer two chain yeah uh and and this is I think where we want to turn this this conversation next and I really just think uh one unappreciated aspect that I've been talking to a lot of people at East Denver um I just came back from East Denver that's left half of my voice there that's probably why I sound a little different um is the the the conversation was that it was a big vote of confidence from coinbase to the rest of the industry saying in light of everything that's happened in light of one of the worst years ever in light of operation choke point and uh what what Ryan and I have been saying is uh Gary the tyrant in light of all of that uh we're just gonna lick our wounds move forward and do something really really cool which is build an entirely new Layer Two that is going to be dedicated to the coinbase be the official coinbase layer too and so like everyone that had this conversation with that you Denver was like yeah I know that that is like the vote of confidence feels very good and it's just a signal of support that you know we're not going anywhere we're here for the long long term and and Brian after talking with Jesse uh it really sounds like the idea of a coinbase chain was accepted a long time ago my intuition is that coinbase knew there was always going to do a blockchain in what form factor it would come in was always when it was going to be a TBD um but eventually the technology emerged that made coinbase comfortable to actually do this and now we have base and here we are can you talk about why that decision was made way back in the day that coinbase ultimately would produce a chain if the technology would present itself like what's in it for coinbase yeah well first of all I really agree with your transition there which is that um despite you know the regulatory climate the negative headlines we have to make sure we're continuing to innovate in this industry we can't become paralyzed um by you know negative headlines or enforcement actions or whatever because that honestly maybe that's what some people want and they think that it's just going to slow this whole thing down and so we have to be able to hold two things in our mind simultaneously which is one we're going to go make those policy arguments we're going to get organized we're going to have the crypto voters get engaged but we also need to make sure that we're building and it's actually hard to build sometimes if you're totally distracted so I've been trying to divide up different parts of the team to go focused on each of those but getting back to your main point um yeah so so base is is a really cool thing we've put out um it's a layer two Solution that's hopefully going to help crypto be much more scalable and usable for eventually a billion people try to get the cost of an average ethereum transaction down to a penny or less um and you're right there was there was a long history of this at coinbase where we actually were looking at different ways you know we saw what other people were doing with their own chains their own coins frankly doing our own coin um we always thought uh you know in some ways it'd be nice but you know we didn't want to make we want to make sure as always we were being compliant and being secure and not doing anything that was like a short-term thing to try to we wanted to make sure it had real value and everything through our customers so it's it's actually funny when we were becoming a public a public company um I actually really wanted to get um like a coinbase coin registered as a security in the US because as a public company we could now officially have retail investors trade our our stock and so um we were gonna try to do a list actually and have it list on the NASDAQ but also on crypto exchanges with the coinbase coin like like a coinbase erc20 sort of coin yeah that sort of thing yeah and it was it was going to be redeemable for like a share of our actual um of our underlying but it would be a registered security it would just be an erc20. and we and we wanted to go do that and we actually couldn't find a way to do it legally in the US I mean the infrastructure around you know broker dealers and National Securities exchanges and everything to trade that sort of asset was not in place yet so that's something still be fun to do at some point and hopefully that sort of infrastructure gets built out as we start to get more regulatory approvals hopefully um but you know in the interim we said all right well why don't we try um we can't do that so let's try to make a just a chain there's no there's no coinbase coin associated with it or anything like that we're not we're not raising any money in it whatever nobody's just totally steer clear of that issue but let's try to make a chain and L2 um and we we worked with the folks over at optimism who are amazing um so it's built on the optimism stack and by the way I want to temper people's expectations this thing on base got like it got so much attention you know we put it out there just kind of on test net to sort of start to get developers interested and um we want to just basically talk to a bunch of developers somehow I can never predict what's going to go viral in the news and what's not it's actually really weird sometimes we put something out that I think is awesome and almost no one talks about it and sometimes we put something out um just as like a preview for developers and we there were some really cool uh stuff that Jesse did around how it you know we got the initial interest and everything so anyway this thing has gotten so much attention I almost want to temper people's expectations a little bit this is going to be a long journey and like there's lots of stuff to build we're working with all the developers out there but it's not like um it's not like a near-term monetization thing for coinbase or anything like that um yeah so hopefully we can we can engage with these developers and keep building stuff that just make crypto more scalable more usable um a lot of these basic things uh are actually really important I mean how do we get crypto payments to be as fast and cheap and Global as sending a WhatsApp message you know it's still too many steps there's two it's too long to get a confirmation um one thing I think a lot about is you know from the average person using crypto when they pull out their phone they hit pay how long does it take for a green check mark to show up on their screen or the other the point of sale machine or whatever it is we need to get that to under a thousand milliseconds like one one second basically where it's like boom and it worked every time at one second that and right now it's it's much longer than that it depends it depends if you know you're trying a different currency underneath and then anyway that's just one use case around payments but we need to get that infrastructure more and more scaled up kind of like when the internet went from dial-up to broadband and uh hopefully this is a step in that Journey you know uh I think part of the reason people were so excited is because it just felt like um the antidote in some ways to 2022 like just the symbolism of it because 2022 is about a lot of people taking shortcuts right and I remember when we had you on the podcast in November of 2021 we asked you that very question it we're like hey binance has a binance chain that's what it was called at the time FTX has just gone ahead long into Solana uh that's what it was at the time and where is the coin chain it like where's the coinbase chain and it it seemed like there was a perception that coinbase was not keeping up and rather than not keeping up it seems like what you guys were doing was um playing the long game because I recall part of your answer was like Hey the Tech's not ready we if we're going to do this we want to do this in a way that is maximally decentralized and we can't do that yet so I think part of the reason Brian this actually took off in in 2023s because like man damn it feels good to be building again and there's no token to shill like we find out that uh Alameda has yeah I don't know God knows how much Solana like on their on there um you know on their balance sheet and of course that's why they want to pump the price of this you know binance has its reasons for for BNB this has no token it's a layer too it's adopting open source decentralized credibly neutral technology so that's why it took off even if the chain launches and like um there's not much there I don't really freaking care this is like a large exchange with 110 million uh customers actually doing the right thing in this space uh that's my that's why I was excited about it and I think that's why a lot of bankless listeners are excited about it yeah well thank you for saying that um yeah I can't tell you we were in so many meetings where you know a lot of a lot of innovation what's hard about it is you have to innovate on the tech but you also have to make sure you're following the law and oftentimes the law is not clear if you're in if you're building something in a new space right so we had so many meetings where yeah we felt that tension ourselves many times where we said man look at these competitors they're just moving they're moving so fast but I think you know we need to make sure we're holding ourselves to a high standard right I don't want to say anything negative about anybody else but especially being based in the US and all the rules that we have to follow we said okay well you know maybe if we can't do that what can we do and so this is a and by the way I think we did move slower at certain times right like a big focus of mine has been um how do we Now operate efficiently at this new size that we're at and we've we've actually reduced our head count a couple times and I think it's giving us a moment you know as difficult as that was to actually operate a little bit more like a startup again um I had a whole blog post on this like operating efficiently at scale and some of the things we're trying to do and since we're not hiring a lot this year it is giving us a chance to really practice operational efficiency at this current size and scale so I'd say it was like 50 we actually did slow down as we grew so fast and we became a little too bureaucratic trying to fix that now and then the other 50 was us again like you said playing the long-term game trying to be you know we're trying to follow the rules and I think we've done a really good job of that so yeah it was a combination of both one of the the main uh big conversations at East Denver was the conversation of well what can base really do for coinbase that the coinbase couldn't do just by building on a native layer to like optimism or arbitrom or a polygon like what does what does having coinbase having its own chain really enable it that the other Chains Don't and a lot of the answers that I give inside of the bankless nation Discord is like well of course when coinbase builds some you know native defy app or or decentralized service they're going to want to build it on the land that they live on that just makes sense but but really like unpacking that even more it's like okay but what what would coinbase build that they could only build if it was on top of their own chain that they couldn't build on some other uh other person's chain so when you envision the future of Base brand what are the products that are uniquely enabled by coinbase having its own Layer Two yeah so this definitely gets a little into the details and I think we don't know all of the areas where this could be useful yet but I'll give you a couple examples um and and by the way a good analogy for this is I think you know Android or something like that right like Android's open source um Google is sort of a major contributor to it um but by having a major open source project that they you know um integrate with it allows them to sort of um have better integration with their hardware and things like that for their phones right so an example in our case would be if we want to make you know USD coin payments um you know fearless or something like that on base maybe maybe that's a way we could integrate that or um you know we're doing a lot of stuff with nfts now right and if we want to get that to be lower friction and fast can can we just have like a default that's on an L2 that we have um you know it's decentralized and but we don't we want to have like a little bit more of you know input on into the direction of it right um what else I mean um anything that would like defy gaming as this comes up is probably going to be something that uses a lot more of the scalability of the network right um either even like future daps that we create you know coinbase is doing more with um you know ens and like how do we make connecting to dapps easier and um all of these things ideally should just be seamless so that people don't ever have to worry about like bridging between different chains or um you know choosing the right token even like it maybe it can Auto Exchange something underneath and so it just it's one more tool in our toolbox that will allow us to hopefully make the user interface so simple that it quote just works um and uh yeah that's like the highest level I could guess I could say about it today you've mentioned uh uscc payments on base uh uh twice now and this is another topic of conversation I've noticed other people have latched on to is like uh the business model behind this is that there's USD dollars or treasury bills in a bank account earning yield on one side and then transactions going around on base the layer two on the other side of things and this is a unique feature that things like Visa or Mastercard cannot compete on uh by in nature of what they are so is perhaps a long-term vision of Base to be uh in competition with the global payment networks that are out there um I don't know if I'd say that exactly no I mean so today actually we're partnered with Visa in the sense that um we have a coinbase card and you know it uses Visa rails and things like that and we also we want to make it easier people to pay for crypto with um credit cards and debit cards and so we do that today but yeah I mean over time I I actually I've I've been pleasantly surprised to see both visa and MasterCard actually embrace this technology they're one of many large Financial Service businesses actually that are already looking at this because I think they they see the potential and okay if we had more efficient global payment rails that allowed funds to settle instantly instead of you know t plus three or whatever it is um that'd be pretty powerful for their business too so um yeah I think it'll be more of a collaborative thing with them um yeah than the other products that come to mind are coinbase wallet and CBE uh how do you is there any sort of synergies between these more on-chain decentralized-ish products and and base like what are the synergies here if any yeah well similar to what I was saying before what I was saying before about different usdc use cases that nfts adapts I mean that that could happen in coinbase wallet as well um our self-custodial product as opposed to the custodial product that most people think of coinbase for um so I think it applies equally across both of those we would want integrate base kind of throughout the stack or throughout the different family of apps one thing that's cool is um you you guys are help helping to develop some public open source infrastructure through this and you know Jesse shared a lot when he was on Bank list last about how you're contributing to ethereum roadmap development items like the upcoming EIP so that is another element that's cool um let me also ask about last time we were talking it was um back in November of 2021 again and it was it was pre-launch of uh the coinbase nft platform and there were some hints there were some rumors that that was that was coming coin uh nfts had a big ear of course in the beginning part of 2022 and then a pretty uh meteoric crash and now they're kind of back a little bit can you comment on like what's the future of coinbase nft do you guys still see potential there uh how are you thinking about that platform in that product line yeah yeah so I mean nft is definitely one of those ones where we probably had too much hype on it when it came out and like you always have to start slow and build so um I'm definitely more in the camp of like you know um soft launch and then you know slowly slowly build but um no and chromeus entity has been going well so actually one of the things we've been doing is is really sort of um aggregating the different marketplaces out there and and surfacing them all in one place so people can just come in and see you know comparing prices it's across the different exchanges and sort of aggregating liquidity which is cool and then I think the main thing that we have to offer there is that you know oftentimes what people are doing is they'd come to coinbase first to buy crypto they would then move it to a self-custodial wallet that had a browser extension um Litecoin based wallet or or metamask and then they would connect to you know an nft exchange or a Marketplace and begin to trade and it was actually what was kind of remarkable is just how many people ended up using nfts given that that was the complicated process that you had to go through and so what we want to do is just kind of make that even simpler and say well if you already have crypto and coinbase because that's where you keep it well it's just one click to buy this nft if you want and so um we're working on integrating chromos nft more directly into our our main app and I'm pretty bullish on nfts over the long term I know that some of the recent you know nfts start to have come up a little bit in the last few months and I know some of the activities been around sort of these Pro Traders you know um like with blur and platforms like that that are kind of um yeah like you can buy a bunch of them in a basket and stuff like that and that's been driving a lot of volume I think that's that's cool and that I'm glad that the market is evolving in different directions I think the part that I'm even more excited about in terms of nfts is basically the utility of it right like um if they're decentralized social where like every post is an nft um if you you can imagine replacements for like you know in web 3 for like Spotify or YouTube or Instagram where every audio or video or text like Twitter you know or whatever or this podcast this podcast yeah why not yeah why not it should be Brian this is going to turn into an NFL oh you heard it here first okay um yeah and then um well I mean concert tickets like you know in-game items and in the metaverse um even just like your badge if you're a company that gets access to somewhere or um these are the things that I think are make sense to be natively integrated into your wallet or your primary Financial account in the crypto economy so um yeah that's I'm pretty bullish on nfts I think they're going to be continue to be really big and just like many things in crypto they had a big run up a correction and now they're going to slowly grow from here and I think um that's still a very exciting space one last question about this base world is a uh the growing sentiment on crypto Twitter I put out a tweet there's like a coinbase there will not and is not be a base token and then crypto Twitter reacts and I just put the Anchorman GIF where he like Sparks up a cigarette and goes no I don't believe you and um I'll just let you react to that Meme if you will Brian um I mean there's there's no base token at the moment so um I don't know I'm driving trouble visualizing it exactly but yes I'll have to go re-watch Anchorman we all will honestly a fantastic movie yeah the uh so this brings me to my my uh the next question that we want to go down is it really does Wall Street understand coinbase at a high level like what does the Trad world really understand about the business models that coinbase is developing I think everyone understands coinbase as an exchange that's a business model that you know the valuation is a tried and true model there's also like the world where the base chain itself has gas fees and coinbase as the sole validator makes revenue from all of the transactions on base there's the CBE staking model uh there's the nft platform like it has so many of these things and there's so seems to be so many like really awesome bullets that coinbase has in the chamber Beyond just taking Revenue that I think crypto natives understand and that make me bullish and and Ryan bullish too but how much of do you think like all of these other like potential business models some are already live today like CBE some of them are potential like bass how much do you think Wall Street really understands about all that stuff well I would say um Wall Street really understands our business from a financial picture I mean um actually if you go read any of the analyst reports on coin stock um they're really good I mean many of them are very good I should say there's probably some there aren't but most of the ones I read are really really good and they understand um the regulatory environment they understand the cyclical nature of of how crypto is going through these you know ups and downs and um they understand I think the long-term potential but they're also investors and their job is to sort of um you know if they think the Stock's gonna go down in the next six months they they're going to trade on that if it's going to go up then they're gonna they're gonna trade on that too so from a from a understanding us as our financial picture as a business and our prospects I think it's generally pretty good um I think you know many of those folks grew up their entire life in the traditional Financial system right so for them they probably aren't quite as advanced in their thinking as your listeners which is that there's they probably a lot of them are still thinking about this oh this is kind of some new asset class it's kind of like Gems or Commodities or gold or something and like you know it's relatively small but it seems to be getting bigger now and I hear about more and more hedge funds are trading it and they're like okay you know we should probably put uh you know one to five percent of our Assets in it or some a lot of um people onboarding to coinbase prime or prime brokerage for institutions that's how they're thinking of it um what they're not yet thinking about it as is okay this is actually creating a totally new set of financial services and in totally new way to build applications on the internet with web you know ens and and uh dapps and web3 and all this kind of stuff and that still probably hasn't fully clicked but you know honestly we don't I'm not sure we deserve credit for that yet because it's a little bit it's so brand new and it's on the horizon and what they're often looking at when they when they is like okay tell me about your products but like really they want to hear about the products which are generating meaningful Revenue today if this is like a pie in the sky thing in the future like that's nice but like when it's real let me know um and I think that's that's fair by the way that's not unique to crypto that's true of like that's pretty much every public company they they hold to that sort of standard so they see the here and now but they don't see the future the potential the future the thing that we're kind of very excited about uh about Kryptonite I remember our last conversation again we talked about well is coinbase sort of a Neo new Financial system or is it tech company and I think I recall your answer being like yes it's like it's like both of those things together yeah it virtual company they're just both right so Wall Street still doesn't understand that Paradigm is I think what you're saying they're just seeing the here and now and also like I'm not sure even like Financial firms understand that new paradigm I'm not sure even the giant tech companies the you know the twitters and the Facebooks uh of the and the Googles of the world understand that new paradigm um and maybe maybe you're right though Brian maybe like um they don't understand it because we haven't earned it yet but uh I I suppose that that is the Hope and that is the um the future potential of everything that we're talking about in the future potential of coinbase as a company yeah I mean if we add a couple more zeros on the crypto economy I think everyone's gonna know what it is and they're if they're not using it their kids will be using it um and so that's ultimately how we we win we got to get more we got to get the use cases going and ultimately get a billion people into the crypto economy or more um at that point everyone will be using it it's kind of it's going to be kind of like the internet at that point it's like it's just ubiquitous Brian when I opened up this conversation I listed off a bunch of things there's CBE Revenue which is alive and well there's exchange Revenue which has always been been there and then there's a bunch of potential other line items right there's the nft marketplace that could be a positive Revenue generator there's based uh transaction fees which could be a positive Revenue generator if in a world where we Zoom forward five ten years or so what are the big like line items that you're bullish on that aren't here yet that you are hoping here like in the world where everything is maximally successful what's left to add to the big ones yeah well trading fees are going to be big for a long long time I think you know but the problem is that they're more volatile right so what we've been doing over the last five years or so is is helping to try to shift more of our Revenue to what we call subscription and services which is a little more predictable right so that's things today it's like USD coin and custody fees and staking and um even things like coinbase card so what's really cool is actually in our last earnings that we shared about Q4 um we talked we shared that 47 of our revenue is now from subscription and services almost half and that's allowing us to build a more predictable business I think that um you know these crypto Cycles are quite challenging to manage through and it's high highs and the low lows and so having more predictable revenue is actually going to help us a lot as a company as operators but also as a public company um one of the areas on the horizon that I am excited about which was sorted to your question is around coinbase cloud and so what we're doing is we're trying to take a lot of these internal Services we've had to build for our own products and we have shared shared services that multiple our products use like you know about how to connect into the blockchains and how to store crypto securely and how to trade it and how to send it and um we're making those apis available to external customers through coinbase Cloud there's a product that we have coming up and I think it'll be public by the time you this out this comes out but you know it'll be called a wallet as a service coinbase wallet as a service so many more uh companies out there from you know Reddit to Banks to you know Starbucks or whoever eventually are going to want to have ways to for people to store crypto um and we want to make it easy for them to sort of uh White Label or utilize these apis so they don't have to figure out how to connect to dozens of blockchains with all these tokens and forks and airdrops and sort of security upgrades and um so just having good wallet infrastructure I think and by the way you could build a self-custodial wallet off of this you could build a custodial wallet off of it um where coinbase is storing it um it's useful across a wide variety of applications and I think that's a nice foundational piece of coinbase cloud we'll be putting out soon and we haven't seen any technology like this like the wallet as a service that sounds like the ability to scale out access to wallets as far as the internet goes yeah well I mean I'm hoping we see it in a show up in a variety of applications so you might you know in the metaverse OR in Shopify or whatever you might just see okay like I've got a stored balance of of crypto now and um or maybe it's it's some it's an nft or something like in Reddit that you're that you're earning um people may want to connect their own wallet a third party wallet but if if it's sometimes easier to onboard you know a billion people if it's like well you don't have to have a crypto wallet maybe it's just the thing shows up in that app the the way I'm thinking about at high level is wallet as a service and I think this will be this will be out by the time uh the podcast is released uh Brian is um it's kind of like a stripe in that it's an API and yet it's a self-contained wallet it's like stripe only it's a crypto wallet and you said it's there's a non-custodial uh version of this which uses some like MPC technology to be you know non-custodial uh is that a way to think about it like straight but for crypto wallets yeah well stripe is an amazing developer tool um company and this is exactly right these are Developer tools uh coinbase cloud is all developer tools kind of like AWS or stripe or something like that um and that's right we it is using MPC uh multi-party computation technology underneath which um by the way is I think that's kind of an underappreciated um Leap Forward again this is one of these things that's been getting built that you know doesn't it doesn't get any headlines but it's actually really powerful because you know this whole world that we're living in where we have a 12 word phrase and if you somehow lose that or you type it in the wrong piece of malware or whatever all the money's gone that's really uncomfortable and it's hard to imagine that getting to a billion people or you know I don't think most people would feel comfortable storing like a huge percentage of their net worth in something like that where like one slip up and it could be gone right so multi-party competition lets you split up the keys you can do you know two of three three or five different configurations um to construct these wallets in in our wallet as a service product and by the way there's a lot of really cool cryptography behind that you know we had to build out a pretty specialized team of people and write some new crypto libraries um just as a general rule that you never want to write new crypto libraries if you can avoid it because you know you want the thing that's battle tested and it's been around and around but in this case nothing existed that that was out there and so we had to write it and we then we did battle test it we got it audited by all these different uh firms like multiple firms who tried to break into it and like and so it's pretty battle tested at this point and I think that's something that really powerful that we invested in so uh Wall Street not understanding crypto fully yet they they do see the here and now um you guys recently acquired One River digital and Eric Peters the CIO of One River was just on the podcast actually um the week before that this is uh released and we we unplanned yeah yeah we had no idea but um it it's interesting because he has served sort of as a bridge to large institutional money I think uh and I I'm curious that perspective because I know coinbase custody what service is like 25 I just read this press release so this is why I know this 25 of the largest hedge funds in the world the top 100 or something like this um at least those that are involved in crypto so what what is kind of the institutional play with with the run one River digital and then in general what's kind of the institutional appetite now for uh for crypto yeah so kind of like what I was saying earlier by the way you know Eric is great we've been super impressed with the whole One River team and as we started to think about this subscription and services Revenue like more predictable revenue streams um and we have a couple different product groups now we have our consumer group we have our institutional group and we have this developer product with you know coinbase cloud and others that I mentioned so on the institutional product we started to think about okay how do we how do we generate more subscription Services revenue and one thing we looked at was this idea of asset management and so um actually in a lot of the big Banks you know Goldman Sachs and and more Stanley and JPMorgan um they actually they do generate a pretty substantial amount of revenue from asset management and it tends to be more predictable than than trading fees and things like that and we got excited um in particular when we met one River just on the quality of the team and and some of the clients that they'd onboarded and things like that and so we felt like this would be a really great matchup if we compare their Asset Management business with our institutional customer base in coinbase Prime and um felt like this could be a pretty cool thing to build out for the ecosystem over time so yeah I mean just I guess to answer the rest of your question um we are still seeing a lot of institutional clients sign up and they're not necessarily deploying a lot of capital in this environment but they are onboarding to coinbase Prime in fact in Q4 we saw an increase in the number of Institutions onboarding into the space and so what the way I sort of took that was to say this is like kind of like a coiled spring of potential where they're sort of saying okay we still believe something's going to happen in this space let's onboard to make sure we're ready when this thing is when we're ready to invest we're not necessarily deploying a ton of capital right now but you know the potential is there for for this next period when the tide turns so uh We've covered so much already in this conversation and including kind of the Regulatory and and 2022 uh and also uh you know bass which is so exciting uh institutions in crypto I want to jump back to something you said close to the beginning of this conversation though Brian that really uh peaked peaked my uh ears here is you talked about this idea of decentralizing coinbase over time so decentralizing coinbase over time what does that mean to you hmm good question I mean so coinbase has always kind of been of two minds because the mission of the company is to increase economic freedom in the world my belief is to do that we really need to get a crypto economy that's Global and it is decentralized that's how we're going to get the real Innovation potential of it but in the early days of coinbase we realized okay well the first step is we just need to get a bunch of the Fiat money of the world into the crypto economy how do we make a bridge to that and that turned out to be a pretty centralized business you know our exchange our custodian Etc that's still by the way our largest revenue stream um and so although we're diversifying it with subscription Services Revenue as I mentioned so we really have um different product groups now at coinbase and they're able to tackle different stages of this Evolution so um you know we're able to get people's money into the crypto economy with our exchanges and our custodian Etc but we're also starting to build the crypto to crypto the more decentralized pieces of the economy with self-custodial wallet like coinbase wallet things like base right even building things which are you know web 2.5 if not closer to web 3 like like coinbase nft we'll probably build more of our own dapps over time we want to make sure we're contributing to the open protocols um like and helping them evolve as well we've done some work there with the developers in the community so yeah I think um it's easy to look at coinbase on a cursory level and say oh it's just a centralized crypto company and that's true of our early of our early products but it's actually more nuanced than that and my hope is we can become more and more decentralized over time so getting into some closing questions here um I'm wondering if you could kind of look long term I think you've been looking at coinbase and crypto long term since you you entered the space Let's uh fast forward to the end of this decade so 2030. what does crypto look like to you 2030 I mean I think we'll have made substantial progress by then in turn in a number of Dimensions so I think blockchains will be more scalable um I think a lot of the usability will be there in terms of you know every time you just send it to someone's ens name or whatever standard takes off like um you know you payments will arrive instantly for less than a penny anywhere in the world kind of those sort of just basic things I think we'll see more of Central Bank digital currencies I hope that the US essentially um grandfathers in these you know stable coins that have followed the rules and and just are backed with a dollar in the US and they sort of become the de facto cdbc of the US I think we'll see more com countries around the world adopt crypto so kind of like what we did with El Salvador and um I think we'll see actually probably by 2030 I don't know I don't know what my prediction is at least at least a handful of other ones if not maybe some even medium-sized ones may even start to adopt crypto as a legal form of tender I think more and more startups will actually sort of like we used to we used to call them.com startups and you know oh you're using the internet.com but now you just call it a startup every startup uses the internet I think by 2030 there's not going to be a crypto startup it's just every startup will use crypto in some way shape or form whether it's to raise money or collect payments from their customers or build their Community or whatever um yeah I hope by 2030 we have a billion people in the world accessing an open Financial system every day um through products like coinbase and others around the world and basically it's just that economic freedom has all these positive Downstream effects in society um with people having stable currency and the ability to earn a living and to get a loan when they need it and just having access to Good Financial infrastructure it can help uplift you know a billion or more people out of poverty and give them more opportunity in life and um we'll probably see a whole another category of applications that get built that are sort of in this new decentralized way on web3 so that's a hope that'd be a lot to get done by 2030 but I think it's definitely possible Brian it's been a 11 or 12 years something like this since since you entered and started yeah ten and a half almost eleven maybe ten and a half okay so you're on your second decade here yeah um is this where you thought you'd be are you kind of surprised at that coinbase is as large as as it is that that crypto is over a trillion dollar asset class or is this like for you right on schedule well I always hope that something like this would happen I mean I I didn't know I knew for sure that there was a lot of ways that it could not happen um but I thought I thought it was at least possible um you know before coinbase I had actually I was working at Airbnb I was like a early employee there and I'd seen Airbnb had gotten quite big quite fast and I was like okay this is at least possible it's in my realm of possibility I you know um and you know one thing that I underestimated was that I thought crypto payments like Commerce things like that happening with crypto would have moved a lot faster I remember in like 2014 and things like that we were running around signing up all these Merchants Online and I was like I was like I don't know within five years you know probably five ten percent of e-commerce will be happening in crypto or something like pretty big I turned out I was way too optimistic on that but a bunch of other things happened that I was totally didn't predict and have took off way faster you know things like D5 and nfts and um I mean even just like the trading use cases and I didn't predict I didn't predict a lot of it so I I was excited about the space and I'm glad that we just started to build things as best we could but some you try a lot of things some of them work a lot of them don't and that's that's just the nature of innovation in entrepreneurship Brian since you've seen almost everything that there is to see firsthand in this industry and we are entering you know more in the middle of a bear market and Bank list got built in a bear Market defy got built in a bear Market uh coinbase got built before I think there really even was a meaningful Market at all uh what advice do you have for the people that are putting on a builder's hat in 2023 um I mean you you started as a builder I think you still consider yourself a builder even though you've elevated yourself Beyond being an engineer for the people who are just now starting their first companies or first projects or engaging in any sort of Builder capacity what advice do you have for them in the world of crypto nowadays yeah well that's exactly right I mean a lot of days and years actually went by where we were just kind of showing up to work every day hanging out with our friends writing some code talking to some customers and there was periods where people felt really down you know in the company and crypto in general I remember people would come up to me and say like what are you going to do now that Bitcoin has failed and I'm like I don't think it has failed what do you mean and they're like oh he doesn't realize that okay I just like move on um yeah and you know don't be in it for the glamor like that you know just build it build something if you like building stuff in this industry um and that's what I tried to do is just like tune out the noise and frankly like if all we were gonna do is show up every day and like hang out with our friends and write some cool code and maybe some people would use it on the internet I thought that was fun I you know I always hoped it would grow and become much more mainstream but you know if I stopped got it getting invited to fancy conferences or you know New York Times wrote something you know mean about me or whatever I I tried not to let it bother me because that's not really the reason I got into it I don't really care what other people think I just want to work on stuff that I think matters and helps the world and I know not everyone's going to like that basically anytime you're doing something that is innovative you have to be willing to be ridiculed for it a little bit um because if it was a Obviously good idea that everybody liked you know someone would already be doing it so that's kind of the nature of of disruptive innovation is it has to it's like Peter that Peter Thiel thing it's like it has to be a good a good idea that sounds like a bad idea it's like most people have to think it's a bad idea but it's actually a good idea it's contrarian um so if you're not working on if you're working on something that everyone thinks is a good idea that's actually probably a bad sign it means you're about to have a correction back O'Brien this has been a lot of fun thanks thanks again for for coming on and sharing with you certainly it's a different world than it was in 2021 but I just want to say on behalf of bankless and and crypto Natives and and people who really care about this community in this industry thanks for not effing it up um like sincerely um very glad that coinbase when there was in the midst of uncertainty and all sorts of platforms were failing and collapsing uh coinbase didn't and appreciate you playing the long game and getting us through and continuing to build with us into the 23rd uh the 2020s and into this decade yeah thank you for saying that we're doing our best and I have a feeling we're going to be sitting here in a year or two and things are going to be looking a lot different so let's keep moving forward to it yeah let's do it uh action items for you bankless Nation want to leave something in
