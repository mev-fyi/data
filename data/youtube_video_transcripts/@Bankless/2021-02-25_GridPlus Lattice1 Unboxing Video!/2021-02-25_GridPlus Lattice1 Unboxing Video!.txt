all right guys i just got my grid plus lattice one let's open it up this is my first unboxing video i'm gonna cut this and cut this ah lovely lovely lovely indeed yes yes oh and then my my safe cards my safe cars i'm pretty sure this is like a private key mechanism let's get that out of there looks like a debit card right looks and feels like a debit card i'm gonna put the rest of this box down and the idea is that uh you can only verify a transaction when you put the card into the slot so it also kind of works like a point of sale system that's something that's in their roadmap right so let's let's uh get this thing hooked into power and also internet and we will go from there it's in here yeah okay this is what i want that's what i want how do i open this okay uh all right we got an ethernet cable to connect the internet and power cord we need both of these things all right all right i got got the ethernet cable hooked up and then i got a power cord and i'm going to just plug it actually i'm going to pull out the card to start because i feel like that's the right thing to do plug the power cord in all right let's see this work how do i start it oh there it goes just goes cool good plus starting up nice oh yeah favorite part favorite part guys get ready okay don't miss this oh all right uh initializing system all right setting up my lattice cool i guess you guys are just going to watch me do this sorry about the glare i have a south facing window loading bar all right initializing system preparing wallet here we go okay welcome to your lattice one setup includes the following steps connect to the internet create a device pin and create my lattice one wallet and then back up my wallet to a safe card all right let's go do all of these things press the setup button you will you will need an internet connection in order to interact with your wallet it is recommended that you connect to wi-fi but you can also use ethernet would you like to set up wi-fi now oh dope i don't even need the the ethernet wallet okay um let's see if i can do this yes yes all right scanning for a wi-fi networks please wait i'm gonna look for my wi-fi network okay well i'm one of those probably guess which one i'm gonna type in my password sound it out loud david right just kidding almost done there is a nice keyboard here it's pretty cool i could get a full-size keyboard right so i've already typed in my password i haven't hit enter yet um but you know if you want when it is much better than like having to press those two little buttons on the ledger over and over again you get to actually get a full keyboard which is pretty dope uh okay uh i have entered my password connecting to my wi-fi i guess i will share my wi-fi name digital nation wi-fi i'm moving i don't know if that's a security issue but i'm moving in a couple months so it doesn't really matter uh okay uh successfully connected so that was really fast uh finish okay so now i'm here i guess this is the main screen um i guess i probably have a software update because i just unboxed this right uh let's set up my wallet oh yeah okay so no wallet manage wallets permissions no wallet uh well i want a wallet so i'm gonna hit the no wallet button all right we're gonna set up my pin not on camera off camera enter re-enter my pin also going to do that off camera enter uh your lattice does not have a wallet yet damn right it doesn't let's set one up let's go press the button uh okay uh generate wallet uh okay so so if if i had already generated one oopsies i accidentally hit a button go back uh if i had already generated one right and so say say like my lattice broke for whatever reason like stolen smashed lost whatever even though i can't imagine how you would lose one of these things you lost it you don't got it uh but you do have your safe key well you could actually restore your entire wallet by by getting a new lattice right and then putting this into this little thing right here i haven't done that yet so i'm just going to hit generate wallet generate wallet generate wallet all right your wallet setup is finishing please wait ah well i will not be using these private keys clearly but uh yeah if you copy it down copy down your private keys uh setting up my new wallet please wait okay sinking wallet okay this may take a few minutes awesome tamper mesh notice how do i get you guys to focus on that important notice please read the loudest one physically secures data with an anti-tamper security mesh the mesh is built to ensure your keys do not wind up in the hands of an attacker if the lattice is opened private keys wallets and secured data will be permanently deleted and the lattice will stop working in case this circuit is triggered backing up your lattice wallet onto a safe card is highly recommended ah well there's why you have the backup of the safeguard do not attempt to disassemble open or service your lattice i don't really feel like doing those things anyway so i will agree to that uh backup onto safeguard question mark i'll do that later i'm to do that later so let's get that part all right so uh i guess this is my address this is my address uh okay yeah there's my address nope all right uh let's let's just send the money let's send some money we're gonna send some money in comes argent all right we got i got two wallets here uh where's my urgent wallet there it is okay uh scan scan qr code i'm going to send point one one ease send one east yep hit continue send okay that's gonna take a second because of ethereum uh but i just sent point one ether here and then we're gonna go send it back we're gonna send it out yeah cool well that's gonna take a second so let's go let's go poke around in some other features of the wallet okay manage wallets manage walls what's that do okay restore wallet from safe card back up to safeguard copy safe card and then reset the whole entire thing all right so first one is is if this is a new lattice i could take my old safe card and then insert it in here and then make my new lattice operate like the old lattice if i had an old lattice but i don't it's my first one um so i won't be doing any of that and then obviously if this wasn't this is a new ladder so at some point i'm going to hit that backup to safe card button and then i actually have multiple safe cards so i can make multiple copies right so i could multi cop make it multiple times that'd be kind of cool all right so on the grid plus uh setup page which is the the on their website uh you actually go here to make transactions so grid plus web wallet looking for my lattice and so there's we're going to go to this new user setup and go through this process all right how do i find my device id on your lettuce lattice one's home screen you should see an item titled device id i sure do look at that oh wow that's very short very short okay device id type that in uh okay do i just create one enter secret all right i'm gonna enter the secret because all right oh it just showed up right on my lattice all right so here comes the secret am 4 rq4 establishing connection with my lattice all right dope all right my lattice says it's connected successfully connected syncing addresses okay lattice is back to normal web wallet ah sinking chain data okay ah yeah there's the point one each that i sent um from my argent wallet a second ago all right let's send it back there let's go hi davidhoffman.eth max uh gay pride guypricegasnow.org um 141 today 141. and then if you wanted to make a transaction like actually like make put a contract onto ethereum you could do that right there right um and oh okay maybe they don't have enough names okay so there uh waiting for signature okay cool all right so this just popped up automatically on my lattice uh and so it's giving me a it's requesting to send 0.9954 to an address and tells me that and tells me the gas limit and great price so i'm going to prove that because i was very very easily was able to consume that information and i do indeed approve of such behavior your devices signing the transaction you have approved please wait okay that's done website ah cool ah my your transaction was signed in broadcast is like successfully your hash is this all right and look at that dope cool and so that's how so like it's cool because you can use your hardware wallet in your browser and then you only just like go over to your lattice when it's time to verify right and so uh like no one can be you have to be home somebody has to be home right and so i might actually be able to like uh be away from my home and then like call call my roommate or you can call up your wife or girlfriend or whatever your partner and be like hey i just like approved a transaction while i'm on the road at this crypto conference can you go over to the lattice and press press approve right um so that's pretty cool because you gotta be by the device uh that's that's kind of nice um so yeah that was that's me setting up a lattice and sending 1.18 there and then 0.96 eth back or 0.096 each back um and then there's some other cool features in the the lattice wall as well like limits uh you can you can turn your lattice like into a smart contract right like not that's a metaphor not not really but you can make uh stronger controls over your account right over your bank account which is your crypto account um there's also a ton more other things here to do as well and one of the cool things about lattice is that it offers like a developer ecosystem so developers can come and build apps for this um uh you connect to all you know other evm chains connect to l2s payment networks uh you know the this what this also looks like is a point of sale right and so like you can hit your lattice one addresses right and then hit ethereum and then this is your new point of sale uh address right so you're serving up coffee and then you can just be displaying this and then you can verify incoming transactions um there's a lot of pretty cool things here uh and so this is lattice1 new standard for security all right so who is this poor like this is a product who is a who's the type of person that would like such a product like this all right so to elaborate uh we have to when you go to the web wall and you make a transaction there's actually the two-factor authentication process and so that was me typing in the secret and so you go to that link it displays a ui and then you have to get that ui to talk to your lattice which is connected to your home wi-fi and so the the lattice and the website passes a secret in between each other like a two-factor authentication and then you can get into your wallet and then you can make a transaction in the browser in your wallet which will send it to the unit which you will have i don't know why i'm looking over there i'm just assuming i would put it on like the center island of my house like i have a i have a little amazon alexa there i probably put it next to my amazon alexa uh or maybe if i'm living with roommates i would put it in my room maybe if i don't want like my hardware my big hardware wallet thing to be located by other people anyways it's like it's like a home base station right it's like you're next to your if you had a landline it feels like a landline actually it feels like a hardware wallet landline that's actually an interesting metaphor um anyways somebody has to be local and so this that is kind of the security mechanism is like if you believe in the security of your house your heart your currency your money your crypto monies adopts the same level of security as your house right that's kind of interesting hardware wallets i mean are kind of the same thing if you assume that they are stored in the house as well but this one's a little bit different because of how it's also connected to your wi-fi there's some unique properties that are involved with that all right so let's talk about price it's on the pricier side um a typical a ledger hardware wallet cost costs a hundred dollars and this costs 350 uh so do you need the lattice and the answer is always going to be the same as when people ask me if they need a ledger and the answer is it should be proportional to how how large of a portfolio you are securing and also how risk-averse you are right and so maybe maybe you only have a medium-little amount of money but you're really risk-averse and you really want the assurances that you will always have the maximum protection right maybe you don't like playing in d5 maybe you want to you know you don't like contract risk and you don't like hardware wallet risk which there is hardware wallet risk like metamask risk um if you are really just self-conscious of that this may help with that um if you are making tons of transactions in d5 and you are a d5 yield farmer and you're playing in the d5 games this is different this is this is generally don't touchy assets or payments this is uh this is like the green goods go uh green goods vault right now and then also payments um it's not going to work too well for yield farming but it could be a place where you like have your green it's like your green god's fault and like profits from your yield farming you could like keep on sending to this one address think of it like a piggy bank right so you make maybe you earn some profits in defy and you want to cash in on those profits you can send it to your much more stronger and secure grid plus from all your profits that's an interesting use case um it is on the clunkier side uh and that's because these guys are just really getting their wallets out the door um for the first time right this has been a long process they've done a lot of refining um and so there's still some some rough edges to that could be smoothed out um and also it's a developer ecosystem and and that's also in its infancy right and so not only uh is the the product it's first generation and that it also doesn't have any builders or it hasn't had any builders yet and and there are there actually are let me share my screen now that i think about it there is a there's a decent number of uh people that have built stuff let's go check that out yeah so there's this uh there's this unofficial um fork of metamask i guess that that are is an application and badger other applications other teams have built something that uh adds functionality natively into the grid plus right and so this is a this cool thing about this hardware wallet is that and this link is web dot grid plus dot io setup um i'm gonna stop sharing now and so what's unique about uh a grid this grid plus is that it's got um these upgrade paths right um and i i guess the ledger does too because you know anything that integrates metamouse therefore integrates the ledger um but the the natively physical aspect of this thing also gives it some unique properties that are also able to be upgraded uh and so it it kind of lashes on to the ethereum ecosystem and so and so i would just expect the ecosystem around this grid plus wallet uh to grow over time if it is indeed adopted uh as the probably what we would call the new layer the new anchor of security like this is the the most secure wallet i that i could think of maybe bitcoiners have struck ideas about stronger um stronger wallet security they are very opinionated about that but as far as i've seen in the ethereum ecosystem this is now like the the most secure you could ever get and so people are gonna want that so that's what it's about cheers
