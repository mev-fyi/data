[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how you doing after this epic episode just fantastic ryan we brought on hugh carp from the nexus mutual project nexus mutual and insurance on on d5 insurance on ethereum it's one of those things that you know when i first saw it i was like you know what that's that's never going to work in my bear market mind i was like that's never going to work like you can't do insurance on defy and you know shame on me for being a bear market pessimist but now that now that the bull market is here and and looking deeper into nexus mutual it just makes so much sense like if you wanted to just like take the the institution of insurance and make a d5 version of it what you get is nexus right and so tip of the hat for hugh for for building something throughout the bear market blood sweat and tears to to build something that he's passionate about that he really understands and then have it come to absolute success over the last few months as the need for insurance on d5 has absolutely exploded you know this has become a basically a trilogy with our d5 builders right these are the bear market builders so at one point during our conversation with hugh he said something that like surprised me i i didn't know but they almost shut down in 2019 like hugh almost stopped working on nexus mutual because he and his team had it he had to do layoffs and it didn't seem like it was going to work out um i'm glad he didn't because now here we are in 2020 and we have a protocol with 230 million in insurance coverage in the d5 market so necessary glad he was uh i guess he persevered through that with his team and kept on building and i think that's a that's a hallmark of the last three guests that we've had on the show these d5 builders uh they didn't quit you know they kept going they had the vision even when no one believed in ethereum no one believed in d5 and i think that's what makes these projects really special um i think nowadays with the d5 bull market and the crypto bull market starting to heat up again we're starting to see a lot of uh fair weather builders coming to the space you know maybe more the tourist crowd and we'll have to see how many of them stick around and stay how many of them have the quality of these bear market builders and who are able to stick it out and build something lasting or are they just here for the gains so really enjoyed the last uh three episodes in in this series it's been a lot of fun and um you know these are these are the protocols to pay attention to there's also something unique here with nexus mutual that's different from our previous episodes with synthetics and with ave right so you know nexus and insurance needs defy or something like it to exist in order to have product market fit right and you know while kane expressed you know his apprehensions and his tests of faith during the 2018 bear market and stani from ave said the same thing they didn't it didn't really hit me as hard as when hugh said some of the things that he said in this podcast right like hugh even went so far to pull out a personal loan to make sure that that nexus mutual would survive and the thing is like nexus mutual could have done exactly what it had needed to have done like gone down the exact same phases of the road map built the same exact things but if it wasn't for other products like synthetics like ave like chain link like maker dow like compound then synthetics wouldn't have anything to have ensured right and so part of this uh this ecosystem is composability and not only did nexus need to make it through the bear market but other projects also needed to have made it through the bear market too in order for nexus to be able to insure them and grow into success later and that's one of my favorite takeaways i think from this podcast is specifically the construction of nexus and how its token model is linked to upside in the nexus system in ways that tokens like the lend token is not so incredibly codified to upside in ave and how the snx token isn't so explicitly linked to upside in synthetics the nxm token has this one-to-one relationship with usage of nexus and therefore nexus needs other applications to ensure so nexus can almost like say like typically they have to hue but nexus can also say thank you to synthetics and and ave and and all these other projects for also making it through the bear market so that it has other protocols to ensure absolutely the ecosystem grows together and it also you know dies together if if that's the case but right now it is growing it is growing fast and this is a new money lego added to the stack the insurance money lego hey david one other thing so listeners you guys are hearing this on a monday so this episode is being published on on that day but we're also putting together a special bonus episode for you guys this week so that will be published on the podcast david what's our bonus episode you want to tease that a little bit yam speaks yam speak the original vegetable the original vegetable farm is finally coming out and talking okay the the media embargo is over uh i i didn't know everyone who put the the yam farm together but i did know will and i did know dan and so as soon as the yam farm came together i messaged them and said hey like we want you on the podcast yeah we got to get you guys on the podcast and uh you know in an abundance of caution and not wanting to appear as like the figureheads of the of the protocol which totally fair take uh they said that there is a media embargo that embargo ends on the podcast on the bankless youtube yam speaks wow i want to hear i want to hear what they say because uh this week is the replanting week where emv3 is coming out and i'm pretty shocked that they put it together so quickly after all of the issues that uh that it had in the in the first version pretty phenomenal i'm really looking forward to hearing what they have to say hearing uh the original vegetable token actually uh speak for itself so yeah really looking forward to this one so stay tuned all right so we're gonna go ahead and get right into the interview with hugh of nexus mutual but first we're going to talk about some of the fantastic sponsors that make the bankless nation possible one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up block folio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do is zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zapper reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswap forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available d5 platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store all right guys let's go ahead and get right into the episode with hugh carp of nexus mutual bankless nation we are so excited to have hugh carp he is the founder of nexus mutual he is the father of smart contract insurance he's an actuary with over two decades of experience nexus mutual the protocol has brought over 230 million in contract cover to the space hugh how are you doing welcome to the nation thank you yeah great to be here guys all right hey first question is d5 safe yet no i don't think so i think we're at the early days um we're getting there in the right direction but um definitely a little way to go in my opinion so like what percentage are we like are we one percent are we 10 are we 30 percent yeah maybe five um i think i think we're starting to focus on the right stuff like um but we definitely have a long way to go education and uh you know stuff that we're doing stuff that other people are doing more open information that people can easily access um that's more readily available that type of stuff um we'll get there we'll get there we want to understand a bit more about nexus and how you are helping defy get there but could we start with some background because i think you have a fascinating background we've had some other uh crypto native d5 founders on the podcast lately this has been sort of a trilogy for us and and uh you're the conclusion hugh but you're the only one that we've met and that we've had on that has a ton of real world i guess almost like traditional experience like you were uh in the insurance industry the traditional insurance industry as an actuary for almost two decades can you tell us about that and how you stumbled upon this whole defy crypto thing and decided to start something here yeah so yeah i've been working in traditional insurance for a while um 10 years in australia and then um quite a bit of time in in london in the uk um so yeah i think um i've always been fascinated by ways of like doing things a bit differently and stuff um i guess um i stumbled i stumbled across bitcoin like many other people did um quite quite a while ago um and oh it really fascinated me that you could do something where like i could send money to you and there was no one else in the middle and like i just could just do that um i didn't really know how it worked from a tech point of view but i found it really fascinating um and then and then after um i put it down i investigated for a while but i put it down um but then i heard about ethereum a bit after it launched um and that's kind of i guess that's what really triggered it for me because if you can you know write an if then statement then you can kind of write an insurance contract and that was my area of expertise and i was really fascinated by this way of coordinating people or a community together um like directly um because actually that's that's really what um insurance is all about um like if you go if you go back like millennia like um it's it's just about a group of people um coming together and sharing risk like you know you had like people um like one of the big examples i guess is chinese river merchants like way back um they used to like share the load of um of their goods um in different boats instead of one of them um capsized or whatever they lost their load then they don't lose part of their own um cargo and so they were all kind of more resilient as a whole and so that's kind of like how insurance started like a group of community coming together and showing risk and it's evolved from there and went through many iterations and things but um but it's and it's now transformed into a shareholder company predominantly um rather than the kind of mutual community aspect and i guess our real um goal or vision here is that you can really do it better if you can use that community approach but now we can have this new tech that could really scale that direct community peer-to-peer approach um so that's kind of like at a very high level from what we're trying to do want to get into some of the just the history of insurance as as you were you're going down that path you but like just one more i guess question on this it's a curiosity point for me so what about crypto first drew you in was it some sort of a you know a hobby or an interest or a you know way that you were brought up we talked to kane from synthetics and he has sort of a a crypto anarchist type of background we talked to stani from ave and he was a tinkerer uh you know his brother uh dabbled in linux uh when they were younger and growing up so he came from a tech background what about your background drew you immediately to bitcoin that first spark of interest and then later ethereum i guess i've always been interested in tech stuff though i haven't done like i have done coding in the past but i'm not a i'm not like a coder or a techie heavily um i'm yeah more kind of on the actuarial side of things um which is more like stats and economics type stuff um i guess i guess a couple of things i've always been interested in tech kind of off to the side but yeah not a massive kind of tinkerer i guess that i guess the aspect to me that perhaps sparked it more was the kind of philosophy and principles behind it my um my dad actually well he's retired now but he used to be um he worked in the insurance industry for a long time as well um but he used to be a uh one of the regulators of the australian um insurance industry and um that perhaps sounds a bit odd but um but the point is that it's always they've always got the the customer focus here and the the individual focus um making sure that it's done right by um the people and protecting them and so it's kind of like i kind of got a bit jaded by the insurance industry as such because um you felt like you were just shifting big money around balance sheets rather than actually focusing on the end customer and here was a technology that you could actually like really just put in the people's hands um and so i guess that's kind of where it's come from so it's more from a philosophical point of view rather than a kind of really tech trigger so when did ethereum come into the picture yeah so um i guess basically um it was pretty much a year after they launched i guess early 2016 um i guess the light bulb moment i mean i was kind of i was interested in space kind of dive back into the stuff there but the light bulb moment for me was seeing the day i'll be drained live um and i thought oh hey here we go um this this this needs we need to do something here we can't we can't just let that stuff happen um i mean you know hard fork or new hard fork whatever you know that's a different discussion but like the if if people are going to adopt this thing we needed to address those types of issues a lot of people couldn't see past the dow at the time though they thought that would be the fall of ethereum and that it would never work i guess you were able to see past to a world where we can have lower risk smart contracts yeah i mean i guess i guess so i mean there was definitely a stage there when everyone thought oh it's you know it's not i'm not going too far from here but i mean i i still fundamentally thought that the tech was like doing something incredibly new that no one else had done before and so to me that had to evolve and and progress from there so when you grew to understand ethereum and the concept of a smart contract did the light bulb immediately go off as with the marriage between smart contracts and insurance or how long did that take to make that connection well um not too long because um a lot of people were just always talking about insurance as like a very natural use case for for blockchain like from the really early days um it's you know it's a financial product um it's about bringing a bunch of people together it's effectively a dao so it like all of the stuff people were talking about um were kind of it fit very naturally um so it didn't take me long and i and to kind of work out that you know there is something here i need to dive in and work out how to do it um and so yeah i guess i started that process so hugh let's go into that a little bit more why is it so obvious for people that insurance and smart contracts are just like this match made in heaven um well in my mind it's basically this fact that insurance is all about risk sharing between people and creating a community that is more resilient as a whole because it can more able to take on risk or downside as a group than you can as an individual and and so if you have this technology that can coordinate people um then then you you kind of like can superjudge this whole thing and so to kind of make that work what you need to do is have um essentially you know a pool of funds and a an incentive mechanism to kind of make sure that people do the right thing with that pool of funds and and so um it's sort of very early like you can coordinate a group of people and a pool of funds really easy like you know the kind of the dow was like a good example of that potentially working really well um and and then if you can put that right incentive mechanism on the top with you know tokens or whatever it is um then that that forms the genesis of the whole of the whole thing um obviously there's a whole bunch of details to work through and how do you make those mechanics work and the incentives aligned and all the rest of it but fundamentally if you can get those two things to work then that's really what insurance is so it seems to be that with nexus and building insurance on on quote unquote on the blockchain that you know you're not disrupting anything in the same way that like maker dao is perhaps disrupting central banks or you know unit swap is disrupting centralized exchanges it really seems to be that when you build something like insurance on using smart contracts that you're just building this age old primitive on this new substrate does that resonate with you i mean it does to a certain extent but you can also do a whole lot more um and i kind of think that puts it in the kind of disruptive category really um i mean you can you can strip out massive layers of cost i mean one of the one of the key things here is that you can actually get a better um outcome for the customers because you have you no longer need that shareholder-based entity that has a potential conflict of interest um and you have a much reduced level of conflict between the members of the mutual because they're all the members and they can all be working together there always will always be some level of conflict but you don't have that natural just are we going to pay this claim or not because you know that's a shareholder profit versus paying a claim um you know and that's largely handled by regulation right now obviously but um we just think that there's a much better way and if you can coordinate this on a community basis you're going to have much more flexibility so we definitely want to dive into nexus and how it does some of the of the things you just mentioned but i think it would be helpful both for our listeners and for me is if we could get a quick history lesson of insurance and mutual funds and i've listened to a few of your talks and you kind of give a nice like account of how insurance came to be so like to the best of your ability can you kind of give us like the early early instances of how insurance came to be in this world yeah sure i'll just pick a few like different points and then we can you know that kind of tells a bit the bull wider story but um yeah so you kind of have these really like small community stuff to start with you know like ancient history type stuff where you know that those chinese river merchants saw um a different community over here that would pull together and you know if someone um one of the like workers died then the rest of the family would get looked after because the elders had some um funds or whatever to look after things and you know it didn't necessarily start as monetary based but um but you know you get food for them or whatever um and so that's kind of like it really started in that local community side of things then then you kind of move into like i guess a bit more advanced when you had a lot of it comes from shipping um and so first kind of like insurance contracts that are closer to modern day stuff um is when you had like um loan contracts or something where you go um here's a merchant that's going to deliver a whole bunch of goods to the other side of the world um and you've got some backers who will give them a loan um to do that and they would share in the profits um assuming it went well but if it didn't um and the ship was lost at sea or whatever then they'd write off the loan and so that's kind of an early form of insurance and that kind of started with like um here the shipping people here are a few merchants that are got some more money and you know it kind of started a very small community level and then what tends to happen it gets institutionalized um and so you put like standard structures in place um there's a there's a bigger group of financial backers that come in um rules start getting set up and it becomes more standardized and you can have a big market type happens and that's kind of how like the shipping industry started and you know that's kind of a lot of where insurance has really come from so i guess the other thread going through all of this is that they generally have started new um markets or new industries um where insurance like it's kind of needed generally starts with the community first um and so you you like the regular industry is not there or doesn't exist so the people that need the cover just band together themselves to do it um and so then and then it progresses into a more regular industry stuff and so that's kind of i see a lot of strong parallels with what we're doing now but the the interesting part is that how that shifts from the community-based approach where it's all done by the community for the community and if there's you know bigger losses than the community wears them if there are if there are not as many losses than the community benefits because you know that they get to share and what's left over um and so then what's happened over time and and even if we kind of fast forward to um earlier this this century um the you you end up with these mutuals that start as communities but then what happens is they get to a point and they get to a scaling point where they struggle to grow because they can't necessarily grow outside their community base because often you will need capital to come in to make it grow further um and so usually the community is not like deep pocketed and so they kind of have they're limited in their growth and also you know conceptually if you've got one community over here and they they want to like share coverage and scale with a different community they have to actually trust each other to pay on the claims which can be a bit of a an issue and so so what tends to happen is these mutuals turn into shareholder-based companies doesn't happen all the time but it's happened a lot and um and what that means is they demutualize they get shareholder equity based capital and the shareholders then go to capital markets and raise bigger capital for equity and then they grow and conserve more people but they've now introduced people into it that are kind of not necessarily there as part of the community they're um to help um you know with the aligned interests that they're the shareholders um and so that's generally how things have worked and so i guess our premise here is that um because we can coordinate people using token um incentives that's much more scalable and so you can coordinate people on a global basis to do this stuff um really efficiently and therefore you don't actually need to inject equity capital at any point you can scale a mutual really really large and the members will be the ones that benefit and so it's really the community cooperative type of approach to to insurance and so that that's kind of the history and the um i guess our view one um how we think the blockchain could really kind of disrupt the insurance world yeah talk a little bit more about that friction between like a shareholder based model and the average individual who's trying to get a payout from you know their their house burning down talk about talk about that discrepancy yeah i mean by and large it works fine i've just like if you're in if you're in a developed nation with a reliable legal system and a good regulator then this all works fine all of the kind of bat there's always going to be quirks and stories around the edges and that's always happens but by and large it works fine the but it only works fine because you have legal and regulatory barriers um in in place and that's costly and and inefficient so there's definitely that conflict of interest but but by and large the customer is looked after because there are protections in place um and so and so i think that that's important but what we're saying is we can do the same thing in a different way in a much cheaper way without that risk um and so um if we get those token incentives right that um that means we can achieve the same kind of um projections but on a global basis and also for people that don't necessarily live in a jurisdiction where you have that reliable legal and regulatory framework hugh you mentioned earlier that there's just a lot of inefficiencies in the current state of the insurance and mutual markets can you kind of elaborate on that as well yeah sure so i think um probably the easiest way to explain this is if you pay a hundred dollars in premium then you expect to get basically 60 65 maybe 70 back um in claims and the rest gets lost in expenses and profit and all the other costs in there um and so that's kind of the um the the kind of tax in the system so we're talking like 20 to 30 percent overhead ish for the industry it's more like 30 to 40 but yeah wow um so it's big um chunky numbers um i mean you know some of that kind of it's hard to get away from but um but that's a big that's a big um target to aim at um and you know there are obviously a whole bunch of reasons for it but um but that's it's not very efficient and lots of paper-based and stuff like that so i i just want to you know maybe uh zoom out for a minute and and talk about risk and insurance right so um i i just started reading have you read this book here it's called against the gods by peter bernstein um no i haven't actually i mean it's been on my list for a while but yeah it is fascinating so it is the story of of some of those ship merchants who basically created some mathematical models and kind of early probability and statistics and actuarial you know kind of tables to um to you know kind of science the the risk out of uh out of markets right so out of you know the first the shipping market and then others uh and it it talks about how um getting risk quantifying risk in actually creating markets around risk essentially is a scalability technology i was thinking about that with the context of of d5 right so defy can only grow so large um you know before it's like essentially hindered by lack of insurance because there's plenty of people who just are going to be unwilling institutions for example um other you know traditional banks they're going to be unwilling to get into defy if it doesn't have a an insurance if if the risks cannot be assessed can you talk about that from a macro perspective i mean do you see basically insurance and the ability to measure risk and quantify that with some market price as a scalability limiter to defy yeah definitely um the simple one is there are a whole bunch of institutions that have a checklist about what they need what needs to happen before they get involved and insurance is just one of them um at really high level like um insurance is actually just fundamental financial infrastructure for economies and you the economies with uh with the highest gdp growth and stuff like that tend to be the ones with a meaningful or well-developed insurance industry it's just that's just how things work like if if you want to develop anything or do anything new or take your risks then that happens much more often when there's a reliable um risk management tools in place and the reliable insurance in place you know if you want to build a railway launch a rocket whatever like no one's going to let you launch a rocket unless you've got insurance in place like um you know things can't go wrong um so um you know this this stuff you know it may be boring and sitting all in the background but it's just has chance to be there to enable um growth of an economy um and so yeah so our view is that ethereum is creating this new parallel financial economy to start but you know obviously hopefully much much more than that and an insurance should be a key part of it well and just to kind of quantify that um it it feels like uh the value locked in d5 can't get beyond a certain amount without insurance like insurance is a necessary part of scaling the system it's a necessary part of of defy essentially growing up so right now i don't know how much we have locked in d5 like something like uh is it eight billion or so yeah eight or nine eight or nine billion and nexus now has about 230 million in cover right uh and a year ago at this time there was like no insurance for smart contracts maybe a little bit i don't know what you guys were working on but it felt like there was almost nothing but in order to get to uh a hundred like we talked to vance uh from framework a couple episodes ago and you know he predicted possibly 500 billion locked in defy um close to the end of this cycle uh and we're just not going to get there unless we have insurance in the billions of dollars it's it's just not going to come so this is this is all defy growing up and we've kind of seen a little bit on the crypto bank side and we tend to refer to exchanges as kind of crypto banks because they're expanding their functionality beyond trading to other banking type features but some of the crypto banks have started to get some pretty robust traditional insurance for their uh multi-sig uh custodial wallets and solutions and it seems like that is the crypto banks growing up can you talk about that for for just a minute like so how uh where are the crypto banks going to get their insurance you know gemini ruled something at coinbase's head insurance for a number of years are they going to just the traditional brokers and and how are the traditional brokers kind of assessing the risk for um you know multi-sigs and and custodial wallets and vaults in crypto banks today yeah they're mostly going to the i mean they're going to the traditional brokers through lloyds or um through other providers etc um the the traditional insurers are you know stepping their toes in in various places mainly with really it's kind of like standard crime policies that are actually just applied to um essentially private keys of course custodial assets um and so and so really that's not too much of a stretch for them from a product point of view and they obviously have to do a bit more analysis and understand it a bit better but um but that's kind of where they're going in terms of the capacity that's currently offered um i haven't caught up with the brokers i know recently but um it's always been a bit of a challenge and for example lloyd's put the put a crack down on things recently saying you know no more cryptocurrency risk in any of the syndicates um but um so there is some capacity but it's not at the billions of scale why did they do that by the way why does the lloyds make a decision uh you know no more cover we're not providing any more is that just a risk management thing yeah it's obvious it's a risk management thing um i also know that some there are some like you know if if you wanted a 100 million line of custody cover which is a relatively small line in itself in the insurance world um then it's actually been broken like between 10 different um providers and that's like just unheard of because usually people any decent provider would go oh yeah have a hundred million um so so you know that to just that's just to give you a bit of a flavor for how and where they are thinking but that they will come and eventually but they need to understand better and there's a long um there's a long kind of education gap there and the market's not quite big enough for them to be interested right now but you know that will change over time so they are it sounds like would you say like they are miles away from doing anything with defy and smart contract insurance if they're just like barely comfortable ensuring exchanges right yeah exactly i mean that's my view i mean they will they get there eventually but um but probably five years maybe um and and actually i think they're more likely to enter um with us um like what you tend to do as a um as a bigger capital provider in the insurance well it's like you find an expert in that particular thing and then you back them they take the first levels of risk and you can help um back it up um and give them more capital to really scale and so that that's a potential option for us in the future so do you think they're maybe a couple years away from starting to do that or um is it close yeah i think this cycle does it happen this cycle um yeah i'm not too sure like it it has it's gonna have to be the right partner and all the rest of it but you know and they're gonna want a few years of claims experience to before they start backing stuff so you know we probably got a little bit yeah so hugh you you said that you know one of the prerequisites for any like significant investment getting into an industry is is if it has insurance or not and do you think that people that that think in that way when they look at nexus do you think that nexus counts like because it's kind of inside of the industry that perhaps they were looking for somebody outside of the industry to insure do you think do you think nexus would check that box in their mind i know it checks the box for some people i know it doesn't check the box for other people um so yeah it depends on the point of view we actually i was talking to a few people recently um like there's obviously there's a couple of swiss foundations around that manage crypto assets for um projects um and then they have some criteria about like investing and taking not taking risk with the funds um and so but a couple of them have got advice that if you put money in say compound or whatever and you also get cover with nexus that puts it at an okay level from a risk point of view um but if without the nexus coverage it wouldn't be so you know that's just one specific example about um how we can help get over some um regulatory um restrictions and stuff well just to make that super tangible right so when you put your money and when any of us put our money in a bank let's say a bank in the u.s for example under 250 000 there's something called fdic insurance which means the government is essentially backing up your savings account right so if the bank goes insolvent for whatever reason if there's a run on the bank they run out of money again fractional reserve system of course then the government will ensure that you get your money up to a certain amount defy if you inject uh funds into compound which is essentially a defy a bankless savings account if you will you don't have fdic insurance natively right so if something happens to the compound smart contract say there's a hack you are out of luck the government is not going to reach in and refund you and that's why something like insurance helps defy scale because when you wrap nexus as part of a compound savings account essentially then you do have some insurance that it is protected against a smart contract hack uh that we've seen you know many times in this space so like that just kind of makes it real what you're adding is not just a savings account but this nexus primitive adds uh insurance almost like an fdic type insurance to the protocols as well is that is that kind of how you see it yeah it's definitely how i say it um on a conceptual basis here's where i get my legal stuff on but um like legally we aren't insurance we provide discretionary cover um which means like the the cover payouts are kind of at the discretion of the the other members of the mutual the via voting etc um but that but conceptually that's that's the idea that's what we're trying to do you know compound's not a bank they act like a bank we're not insurance company we act kind of like an insurance company i guess um and so that's um but that's conceptually what we're trying to do you know um i ideally you know you hopefully have uh we get to the point where you get like a i'm a badge or a token that kind of yeah he represents um oh he he's your he's your argent wall and it's it's kind of it's covered by nexus and that's kind of like here's your bank account with an fdic insurance you know that type of thing and so just to talk about um you wrote an article for bankless i think almost a year ago now where you talked about kind of three categories of risk right um and it it's important to i guess remind folks that uh something like nexus doesn't cover all three categories of risk can you talk about those categories of risk and what nexus would cover and what it doesn't cover yeah sure so um i can't yet put them in three categories basically technical risk of the smart contracts failing that's what nexus covers so that's basically the solidity code if there's a bug in it you know the code was designed to do something it clearly does something different someone could drain the funds or freeze them or whatever that's that's basically what we cover um the i guess the other two broader categories are um basically anything outside the smart contracts um so things like like a governance attack or like an oracle failure um stuff like that um that's that's not covered right now um and i guess the third category is like an economic incentive failure so you know there might be a system that's relying on economic incentives to work so that um the whole system works like it make a dao could be an example like the die peg may fail not because the smart contracts failed but because the economic incentive system around that doesn't quite hold it right um and so we don't cover um stuff outside the smart contracts or those economic incentive values um right now that's we we basically launched something simple so that um we could get it out there test it out and all the rest of it but we definitely have plans to kind of broaden the coverage and provide more complete cover and the bulk of d5 failures so far have they been more in the smart in in terms of total value lost amount have they been more in the the you know smart contract technical hack camp or have they been in the the other categories as well um i think the probably the one bigger one that was in the other category they've mostly been in this might contract technical failure in my mind um so but the other one that hasn't been has been a bit outside was the make it out like black thursday stuff where the the keepers didn't keep up with the auctioning process and and vaults got liquidated below market value and stuff so um that that that one um was a key example but we haven't um i guess the i guess there's always a few times when someone just drains the funds or exit scams and stuff um like i guess that's kind of classified as a governance failure um so yeah i think majority has been smart contract technical risks but there are other things to consider all right so we've been teasing the listeners with a bunch of things circling around the topic of nexus mutual itself and the nxm token so let's go ahead and dive right in hugh what was the first step towards building nexus ironically um legal and regulatory research [Laughter] is it basically how do we do this in a way that just you know doesn't piss off the regulators how do we do this without getting shut down day one okay basically you know um like i i guess i was coming out from one point of view like you kind of have two options you either kind of um do okay from a do it fine from a regulatory point of view or you go full dark mode and just release it right and go full decentralized from day one yeah anonymous founder you are satoshi right yeah yeah exactly and i just i just knew from like immediately that this thing would require iteration and updating and you could never get it anywhere near perfect from day one um and that just wasn't going to be a possibility so to me i went the other direction um and so once we kind of sorted out a router market then it was all a kind of economic design and and stuff like that um before we started coding and then and where did this uh when did nexus start to become uh built when did when did work actually start to to happen um we started we started like putting together a proof of concept um late 2017 um then we kind of raised the seed around early 2018 and um and then launched the protocol may end of may 2019 so um so that's basically the roadmap were you affected by like the the doldrums of the bear market the brutal bear market in 2018 2019 where everyone thought you know ethereum is dead d5 is nothing going it's not going to be much and there was kind of just rampant bitcoin maximalism did you fall prey to some of that uh definitely so yeah we went through some very tough times um we i you know had to let go of half the team um cut down the runway um cut down the cost space a lot so we had more runway um and then basically scroll over the line we were very very close to shutting down um you know going back to all of our initial um seed investors saying you know can you provide a little bit extra didn't quite go anywhere um then then uh um a friend that uh i guess uh ethereum og decided to help us out and give us a little bit of extra money and combined with a chunky loan for myself um we managed to kind of get it over the line and get it to launch um and then and then you know i guess cockroach our way out of it um and um i guess you know things are looking pretty um pretty good now we've got a protocol with lots of people using it and stuff but um i guess early 2019 um there was pretty tough times going on oh my god what so what kept you going well i think i found out that i'm just super stubborn um it's a good time to find that out yeah yeah i think i i got to the point though i felt i just felt we were so close and i'd just be really disappointed if we didn't get to launch like if we got to launch and it just didn't work i'd be like oh okay i've given it a shot nobody wanted to use it didn't work product whatever but i'd just be so disappointed that we just didn't quite get there to give it a shot and so um yeah just managed to get over the line just really and um and we're here here today still so that's that's great well you are here so like can you tell us about the 2020 experience because that's been a little bit different than 2019 hasn't it yeah 2020 is like um i don't know like five years condensed into five five weeks or something i don't know um like just give us some metrics so in terms of contract cover where'd you start the year actually i have it up nexus tracker dot io if you folks want to see it i've got the tracker i don't know who built this but okay so end of 2019 you had a 1.15 million in cover right so that's the the amount that um essentially smart contracts that you're able to insure through the nexus protocol and now here we are i'm looking at it and as of right now there is 233 million dollars that is you have more eath locked in nexus than the ethereum foundation i think or it's pretty close and all of that has happened this year that's like you know my god that's all of it all of it's happened since july basically oh wow so yeah it's it's been a massive three months for us um like yeah we had like um in terms of our capital pool we were sitting around five million for quite a while um we're now up at roughly 80 i think 70 70 already depends what ether is doing right now um and and so yeah it's um yeah we've had massive growth over the past little while basically um the big kickoff has been yield farming it makes a lot of sense when you're earning ridiculous returns to just take uh take out some cover of nexus and reduce that return a bit but be in a much better position from a risk reward point of view and so that's kind of really kicked things off um and and lately the last few days have been um safe mining which is just another level of craziness but um but that's um that's what's been going on recently we're definitely going to get there uh but let's actually talk about how nexus is constructed so what are the what are the core primitives that power the nexus mutual system yeah so i mean if you think about a really high level you've got one capital pool it's basically a pool of eth right now um and then you have the token um nxm that kind of sits over the top as an incentive layer to make sure that people do the right things we pay out the claims that are genuine we decline the claims that are not um we we do the right things from a governance point of view we back the right risks with the right of pricing etc and so so essentially what we have is this one pool that all of the cover prices go into and all the claims go out of um and then um and people can actually contribute ether to the pool and get the token in return and do the reverse as well because you can burn the token to take heath out so there's basically like only a few like money in money out type inputs here into the one capital pool but then you've got the token which kind of allows you to do the different actions um and so the first one i guess uh the most obvious one is actually buying cover say um you actually kind of burn the token to buy cover um you actually don't see that in the background you can just purchase directly if it's with diary then it just does the conversion in the background for you um so that's kind of use case one and then um there are there are three more main functions the next major one is what we call risk assessment where you kind of stake and accept tokens against risks that you think are good so like um you might want to back uni swap or compound or are they or whatever um and then you earn a share of the the cover price that that gets purchased on that um protocol and um and so there's that's that's a key incentive mechanism there and then there's the uh claims assessment which you you stake some nxm again for voting power um in the claims assessment to um approve or deny claims and then as usual governance um update parameters upgrade the system etc stuff as well so those are kind of the four things that you can do so the nxm token and how it comes into existence is is interesting because it's very much unlike any of the other d5 protocols and and their token right and so you know snx is the collateral for synthetics you know the lend token is the future governance token over over ave with potential cash flows that we all kind of assume baked is baked in but the nxm token is different because it has its muc this much more codified relationship between the growth of nexus mutual and the demand for insurance and the value of the nxm token and that comes from the bonding curve and and so talk about the bonding curve and how that incentivizes ether deposits and nxm creation and also how the shape of the bonding curve has changed over time yeah sure so um i guess what the whole purpose of the bonding curve is um is it's a way to manage capital the mutual so so what we want um and what you kind of need is you basically need enough capital in the pool so that you got enough money to pay claims but you don't want too much because that's inefficient um and so you kind of want to get capital in there to back the covers that you've got and then when you write more and more business you want more capital so that you can grow um but you don't want to be sitting on hundreds of millions of capital that you're not using because that doesn't make any sense um and so the whole bonding curve is specifically designed around capital efficiency and making sure that you've got the right level of capital to back the covers that you've got so to make one of the main there's kind of two main elements to the to the bonding curve the first is kind of it's what we call the mcr percentage or minimum capital ratio percentage it's basically like a solvency margin so it's more or less the funds that the mutual has divided by the funds that it needs to back the policies that it's got um and so when we've got excess funds the price starts going quite high quite quickly it's got an exponential factor on on that um and when we need more funds then the price comes down so you know if we have a few large claims for example we'll um our funds level will reduce our mcl percentage will reduce and that will lower the token price and so therefore encourage more people to recapitalize the mutual and correspondingly you know if we end up um riding lots of business and um and that kind of you know leaves surplus in the pool and we've got too much surplus and too much capital then the token price will rise until people um cash out nxm for each so um so it kind of balances things um that's kind of the the um the one metric the the longer term metric um which is the second metric is really just the amount of um capital we need and and so basically this means that over time as the mutual grows like assume the funding level position is flat over time um the solvency ratio is flat um then the the token price is basically driven by how much cover the mutual writes and and therefore um it's really strongly linked to adoption and the point here was really to link the the token price um and use it as a core function for a call sorry it's something that the mutual needs to operate and that's it needs the right capital at the right point in time and that's entirely what the the token is for okay so it's issued along a bonding curve but there's actually two curves to be paying attention to right there is the the um the curve of the amount of capital that is needed to fulfill all outstanding covers if everything in d5 blows up like all at once and nexus mutual has this curve that establishes like the minimum amount of capital that is required so that it can pay out every single claim ever and then there is a another curve that i i believe is 30 percent like tracks that attracts that same first initial curve but it's 30 percent higher that is that 30 percent buffer that and is a is that correct and and then b also is that is it correct to call that the premium um so i guess no one a few counts but um so the minimum capital requirement the whole point of insurance actually is to heavily under collateralize like fractional reserve banking to be honest um because so as you can see at the moment we've written 230 million of cover but we have 73 million of capital so if everything claimed at once we wouldn't be able to pay um and the hot that's that's actually the whole point of insurance because you can't cover extreme events with relatively low cover costs or premiums um efficiently um with um with a fully collateralized model so one for one right so so we have this model which is basically how insurance companies work in the real world and kind of goes you've got these risks they're diversified they're not all going to blow up at once but we've got to make sure that we have got enough that if you quite a few of them blow up you've got it you've got it covered um and so that's that's that's the model that we're operating under um so the bonding curve is actually i mean it's three-dimensional if you want to call it that way um there are you know there's the the solvency ratio and then there's the the other demand to it so um the other element to it the longer term so um but it it's really just one curve i don't know if you want to call a three-dimensional one one curve or a lot but um that's kind of how it works so the reason why i think this is so elegant is because well hey i just love bonding curves they're they're one of the coolest pieces of defy infrastructure uh but it's it's a dual purpose curve in the sense that like if you want to become a member of the mutual right like you purchase nxm by depositing ether into the curve and then that increases the value of the nxm token kind of in the same way that uniswap work works right like if you pre if you purchase ether with your die in the uni-swap dipole the price of ether goes up right and and the nxm on the bonding curve does the same thing with more ether deposited into uh into the pool but you can and then there's like a fork in the road as to like who you want to become do you want to be someone who backstops the nexus mutual by adding capital to the pool and then if you if you do you keep the annex m token or you can therefore instead become a person that purchases cover and instead of receiving the nxm token you burn the nxm token and that burning event is the purchasing of cover right and so both both participants put ether into the pool one keeps the nxm token one burns the nxm token and the one that is burning the nxm token is purchasing cover for some contract somewhere and the burning of the nxm token means that there's more ether in the quote-unquote treasury right more in the curve and there's less nxm tokens and so the remaining nxm tokens for any of the individuals that just want to be a part of the mutual their nxm token has a claim on a greater share of the ether in the in the treasury right in the in the mutual is that all of that correct yeah exactly correct yeah i have a question about so um i think most bankless listeners are more familiar with bonding curves in something like an automated market maker which we've talked about many times before uh see our episode with hazeeb we'll include in the show notes um this is different right here like you know you did you create your own custom bonding curve or was this inspired by a uniswap or some other automated market maker um yeah no we we created our own bonding curve um we we actually um we were developing this stuff before uni swap existed um but we just had to do a lot more testing because it's a bit more complicated than um than the the uni swap curve um we designed it like specifically for what we were doing it's a specific use case like it's not as generalizable as um as uni swappies for you know you can use in a few different scenarios etc um but the yeah that i mean it was really developed for a specific purpose i mean we did a lot of like simulation testing and stuff on this thing because i guess it was relatively new and this means basically because there's a bonding curve present um it's not like if somebody wants to purchase an xm i guess you know they can purchase it uh from the bonding curve itself so they're not like purchasing it from from nexus mutual some entity or something else of course they can also purchase it on the secondary market but they can always buy and sell tokens directly to the bonding curve is that correct yeah that's exactly right yep the unispot bonding curve is just like a straight curve right just a it there's super uniform it doesn't have any any uh other it's like one single curve but the nexus mutual curve is different right it's more custom fit to your guys use cases and earlier you said that like as there's more and more capital in the curve the the curve goes exponential really really fast why why is there a disincentive to add more capital to the nexus mutual pool um well we just we want to make sure we've got enough capital but not too much basically yeah why is too much bad wouldn't you want more um well it's kind of like not necessarily because what we do um perhaps there's a few subtleties to it perhaps um so this this concept of like um if there is one capital pool but if we kind of like segregate it into two sections um and there's kind of like the reserves um which is what we call our minimum capital requirement and then there's the buffer over the reserves and so what we want to make sure is that we've got enough reserves and we only write cover up to our kind of reserve level so make sure that um like we would never allow cover on any particular protocol to be more than 20 of our kind of reserves um so that if there is an issue um we're confident we can pay because because basically if the if people start taking money out um and they can't take money out below our reserve level it's locked um so that's kind of like there's a free buffer which you can buy in and out of as long as you're above 100 level but you can't do it that below the 100 level um and so what we want to make sure is you can you can do your buying and selling as much as you want but we have to have enough money to pay those claims and that happens over time it doesn't happen just now um and so that's kind of what we're making sure and so what we do is where we have excess capital um like for example what we do right now is when there's um well up until actually two days ago but um what we've been doing is when there's excess capital is in our solvency ratio is over 130 we we ratchet up the reserves a little bit so we just kind of arbitrarily shift some of the buffer into reserves and that allows us to write more business on on each protocol um and so one of the interesting problems we've been having recently you know good problems to have i guess um is there's lots and lots of demand but we have to be able to kind of scale our reserves up to to meet to meet that demand and so it's um you know we have to do that in a good way because if we did it too fast then we just absolutely crash the token price um and that's obviously not what we want to do so we want to do it on a gradual steady basis which is definitely challenging in the very fast-moving d5 space so hugh you own an individual comes and they purchase nxm because they want to be a part of a mutual and they want to access the upside of people paying cover right and so you express that interest by purchasing nxm but there's one more function which is that you can stake nxm to a particular contract uh can you can you talk about that yeah sure so sorry you can what you can do is really take an enhanced risk reward um position by staking on specific contracts and so when you do this then you earn a specific amount of the cover price that gets um per that gets paid when someone purchases this cover on that so for example you might stake on your compound or uni swab or maker or whatever and when someone purchases on on compound or then you get a specific share of the cover price um that there is obviously a downside to that um in the fact that it's enhanced reward but there's also in that potential punishment if there is a claim then your nxm can get slashed um proportionally to the um the claim amount versus the stake that's there um so it's there's definitely more risk involved and so um this is this is really kind of using prediction market like techniques to to price um cover so so the the mechanic here is basically if there's more staking those lower price and more capacity on that particular protocol is um is provided and when i mean capacity i mean more people can buy cover um and so those with more stakes gives you yeah better price and more capacity and um and that's kind of uh it's important to kind of incentivize the backing the right protocols because you know we don't want to provide cover on um some random new protocol that hasn't been audited that's potentially got a zero day bugger etcetera that um people have planted for example so we have to make sure that there's um there's a way to select good risks so this acts as almost like a kind of a skin in the game type function right so it almost acts as a um a risk assessment so people who are staking to something like maker um they might be willing to to stake more to maker because they you know it's been formally verified it's been in action for a while it you know already houses billions of dollars you know lindy effect is is is going strong whereas some new protocol um you know that's going people are going to be unwilling to to stake to it and and risk uh their portion so does this essentially act as a whole kind of risk assessment framework for individual uh d5 protocols and and contracts yeah exactly that's exactly what it does um so you can you know assuming we you know get more scale and um and keep keep growing and um gets um more kind of you know a bit more experience on this stuff you should be able to use the price on nexus as a one indicator of the risk of a protocol failing and that means as a staker you have to know what you're doing you can't just blindly just park your funds in one contract versus another without having some understanding of it it almost makes you kind of an assessor a risk assessor in some way is that sort of who you're looking for in terms of the community members yeah exactly it's an expert function it's a knowledge-based staking function um you know that's ideally who we want we want the experts doing this stuff um because that's where we're going to get the most value out of it so you said that this is a prediction market type model uh and and one of the core features of a prediction market is that people with privileged information or just are better equipped to analyze something are going to sway the market using their own capital at stake to express a certain opinion about the future of something right and so people that have more more privileged information about whether a contract is risky or not or at risk at all can stake their nxm in an expression that this particular contract is safe and the reward for that is they get an outsized share of the cover being paid to that particular uh uh contract and and but also it some some of that cover also goes back into the treasury to repay all of the um all of the nxm holders their their share but it's the people that are staking on that particular contract that get that outsized return first right just a nice little reward for that extra risk i want to go into that that extra risk just a little bit more how does you said that um if that contract gets uh you know exploited or bugged or whatever and there is nxm staked to that contract you said they get slashed how does how does that uh um maybe punish isn't isn't the right word but how does that cost the stakers before the rest of the mutual um so so when a claim is paid the the actual claim payment gets paid out from the from the mutual fund so it's like either or die depending on what the cover was purchased in and so that's a direct negative on the treasury um the in addition to that the equal value of nxm um that is staked in that contract is also burned um and that's proportionally shared amongst the stakers so if there's if there's if there's um a lot more next time than the claims pay then it's a partial burn if it's the other way around then then all the nxm would be burnt um so it's kind of like an offset so you the you definitely still pay the actual funds out so we kind of have like hard capital which is like ether and die um used to pay the claims and then we've got the incentive layer on top so just make sure you stake on the right stuff which is the nxm and so um after a claim payment the treasury has gone down and the number of nxm has also gone down okay so the treasury that you keep talking about here so there there is um about 230 active cover right but the treasury is smaller than that um the treasury is about 73 that's just how 73 million or so i think you said earlier which is just how kind of insurance works right um uh that's 73 million would you would you call that float and the reason i ask is because you know people like warren buffett of course have famously been insurance business for uh for decades and that's kind of where they make their money right they they take all of those insurance premiums essentially that becomes the float that becomes their treasury and they go and they reinvest it and buffett famously reinvested that in uh bull run stock market for the past you know 40 50 years or so um is that is that treasury float for nexus and what what do you do with it do you make your money on float in any way um so yes it's a float and yes we will use it but we aren't currently um so um that's going to be a big part of nexus in the future that's for sure um the we have to we have to kind of make a few enhancements to the protocol to make that happen um they're on the roadmap um the other aspect that we have to be a bit careful of is if for example we put money in say compound and we're also covering compound and compound goes down then we lose assets and liability and have to pay claims at the same time so you know we just have to be careful about the risk accumulation one one thing that could be that we're um you know obviously very excited about is like a 2.0 launching and being able to earn some sort of um return on the earth we're holding um by staking because that could be potentially uncorrelated to the risks that we're riding um and so that um that could be a really good thing for um to put some of the float to work in and that would flow back to the to the treasury to all mutual members and it just um helps the mutual members directly so you don't want to play a hedge fund manager with that float of course right but if you did put that uh 635 000 eath in something like uh staking for instance we we've uh as part of banquets we've kind of talked about that as being almost the risk-free rate of of eth in a way not to say there's no risk but to say it's it's almost kind of like um like t-bills or or uh treasuries in in the u.s government where that interest rate that you receive as part of a t-bill is kind of the risk-free rate of um of capital for that market is that sort of how you see eth with staking is that why it's kind of a safe a relatively safe place to put some of that float to work yeah exactly right we want to um we want to make sure that we have the funds available for paying claims so you want to um you know you can invest some of the floating more riskier stuff but you don't want to invest the majority of any riskier stuff um so we need to work out what we do with that majority um and something like the 2.0 staking is perfect and that float the uh interest received in the float whether it's you know three percent or whether it's eight percent or whatever it ends up being that would flow back to the mutual holders so holders of nxm the asset is that correct yeah exactly right so basically um as you know you've got that treasury pool and you've got um money coming in for covers money going out for claims money coming in for people who put um ethan and going out for the other way you also have the float the investment returns and so to the extent that um to the extent you're in this stable environment where um you're just riding business same amount of business going on and off then the surplus that's generated from the cover purchases plus the investment earnings on the float just accrue directly to the treasury and then that starts um pushing the token price up on the bonding curve because you've got your funds actually held over funds required um just keeps ticking up because yeah fun tail goes up but funds required stays the same so that's that's basically how the model works it all goes back to the members so what's super interesting i think about nexus is that all of the capital backing these claims is eath-based so it's all in essentially ethereum's reserve asset which is eth why did why are you guys this is an eth maxi yeah it's it's like a it's an eth um it's it's hungry for eath like it's an eath monster it just consumes more eath and the more eath that it has the more cover it can provide essentially why why ether and have you thought about other assets or what are the kind of the trade-offs pros and cons of using non-ether assets yeah so we won't be all ether forever that's for sure um we started off with ether because we believe that um i mean sorry stepping back the key way to actually manage an insurance company here is to match your assets with your liabilities on a currency basis so if you're writing claims potential claims are writing cover um denominated in it you have to pay claims in need potentially or you have to pay claims in us dollars die um then you should theoretically hold the same assets in the same mix so if you write 50 percent cover any 50 covering dies you should probably hold 50 percent each and 50 die based assets so that way if currency rates move you've they move on both sides of the balance sheet and your funding position is stable you're not taking any you know fx risk for an extent like currency exchange risk in that way yeah exactly um so so we started with eth only um because we believe that most the common purchases would be done in eth and we were over collateralized to start and so it was it was all it was all kind of okay we're getting to the point now where um well we probably should start having more more in the valley being held in diet to match things a bit better but it's okay for now but the um but we are a relatively maxie compared to other stuff that's for sure um the i guess what we need to do is when we kind of enable this investment earnings stuff we also need to balance the um the weights of what the assets are and make sure that the currency risk is not too much so in theory the treasury the the makeup of the treasury and all the assets inside of it should generally match or track onto the demand for cover based in uh specific currencies is that right yeah exactly so if you you know if we're writing as i say you know fifty percent each um cover and fifty percent diet cover then we probably wanna hold fifty percent each based assets and you know that could be staking or whatever um and correspondingly you want to probably have 50 um us dollar based in investments in whatever shape or form that is one of the things we've talked about a lot is uh how you you were able to put all of this essentially in smart contracts right and and presumably the the typical traditional insurance industry it costs 30 to 40 percent in administrative costs and your costs are much smaller you know relative to the amount of cover that you can provide so that's one efficiency gain in making all of this ethereum native and smart contract based i'm also curious about this could this thing continue to operate if uh your team sort of the the the management team and the developers of of nexus kind of went away i guess how bankless is it how decentralized is it today and what are your goals there yeah so um not right now it wouldn't be able to there are a few centralized elements um that we're basically working to remove um the the idea is to become a fully um commission the most decentralized protocol that's that's the goal um we've got a few things to do um to get there there's a couple of um more complex calculations that we want to bring on chain and we're kind of in the process of doing that um but it's kind of a it's definitely on the progressive decentralization end of the spectrum i guess relative to something like a compound or something we do have a lot more mechanics involved and um and a lot more things that we have to iterate on and test and we you know we're going through that process and fine-tuning stuff and working and working it out um so there but we're on that process and we're working towards it um in terms of like the actual kind of underlying risk there there's effectively a multisig behind this um that we have governance that can um get formalized on chain governance that um that does updates and stuff like that um but there is also a multiseek of the um five advisory board members that they could do potential um harm to the protocol if um if they colluded um there is a protection um there the fact that they are actually legal directors of nexus mutual limited a company in the uk um but but you know that's that's the situation we are in right now to be blatantly out there and transparent about exactly what's happening um and but we're i guess working to to remove that over time there's always the question we learned in 2008 who who insures the insurers which i don't know if we have a good answer for right now uh for for nexus but um do you see any help on the way who's going to insure nexus yeah that's a good question no one right now um we're covering open um but um yeah but no one no one connects us right now we have this treasury and this treasury is funded by this bonding curve with you when you deposit capital into it the capital is largely eth right now but it's going to diversify into a much more diversified basket of assets to mitigate risk uh on the other side of that bonding curve is the nxm token which is the token that can purchase cover which gives you a some amount of rights to the funds in the treasury if a particular contract goes under uh and and so this is the the general core nexus mutual um system uh what we haven't covered yet is what happens when a contract blows up and and this has actually happened so there are actually real life instances of of uh contracts blowing up uh so so hugh can you kind of walk us through the process of what happens when a contract that is insured by nexus quote unquote blows up yeah um so basically the cover holder submits a claim um the ethereum transaction um and then that goes to create essentially a workflow item for our claims assessors and so anyone could be any member of the mutual could be a claims assessor by staking some nxm um and then it basically goes to a vote so this is these are humans interpreting stuff so um you know that has pros and cons obviously um it means we're massively flexible in terms of what cover we can provide in the future but um but it also means that you know there's there's people involved rather than programmatic rules um and so that's essentially a voting process state-weighted there must be a 70 or more consensus on things um and um if that threshold's not reached or there's not enough staking et cetera then it escalates to a full member vote where you where any member of the mutual can vote without staking um and that's kind of the resolution um mechanism or the dispute resolution mechanism i guess and then depending on the vote um it um either gets approved or denied um and so i guess um we we paid our first claims of the visa x hack back in february um it was um which was which was interesting um psnx got hacked again recently um so um uh no it wasn't so um well there was actually two covers purchased two hours after the um attack um so i'm not quite sure what was going on there but um but there were no covers that were um outs like live um before then so i'm pretty sure we would have paid a claim um as a result of that event but there was no one with it no one with any cover so the there's no objectivity to insurance claims right there's no way to automate this in the the payouts into a smart contract because when uh like for example if nexus mutual was around when the dow hack happened right we call it the dow hack but it was more of a dao exploit and even even more objectively from the perspective of like a robot the dao hacker was really just using the dao code as written right like he didn't change the code he didn't there wasn't a bug because that doesn't that doesn't happen in ethereum technically right like there aren't bugs there are just there's just code and then there's people using the code and so and so there's always going to be some sort of human subjectivity component to nexus mutual and so how do you guys go around uh how do you guys deal with the issue of you know technically there's nothing that's actually like an exploit or nothing that's actually a bug and so how do you determine what should be paid out and what shouldn't be yeah so um i guess the first point here is if you if you could codify a way of doing it then you could ignore that you could get rid of the bug in the first place um from a theoretical that's a fantastic point um so um so basically you can't do that really um the the way we've done it is um we've got essentially old schools terms and conditions document it's basically two pages long it tells you what um should be paid out what shouldn't be paid out and people make it a subjective interpretation of what that means and it all comes down to what was the intention behind the code um like you know clearly clearly the dow the people who coded the dow did not intend for it to be able to be drained um clearly the people that go to bzx didn't intend it to be able to be exploited the way it was so you know those types of things right um and so you know there's definitely human subjectivity in there but i think that's um i think that's what people expect um and you know that's i think we're going to be in a much better or i believe we're going to be in a much better position with that type of stuff available the the the one of the benefits that we've got here is that if we want to put out a new product we can just write a new set of terms and conditions in a document and essentially socially coordinate around those and um offer cover on on anything whether that's something in ethereum whether that's something on a different blockchain whether that's something in non-crypto related it doesn't really matter we can use these same mechanisms and apply them to any risk well i think we want to talk about some non-crypto non-blockchain stuff later um but one question i had so what about an options-based approach so you mentioned the open protocol they have o tokens and um they're able to provide some level of insurance through basically people betting uh on options that doesn't seem to require as much governance is that a more scalable approach are there trade-offs with that too um yeah no that's a fantastic approach i love it um the the thing that it does really well is works for tokenized networks um when you can like swap one token for another for example you've got this token that's supposed to be worth um one usd and you can solve it for another token etc um and so you know there's there's potentially ways to um to do that um with nexus as well um that we're looking at um the one thing you can't do with that is if you can't tokenize it then um you can't cover it in using that option based approach the another advantage of uh nexus of course is because it's crypto-native uh it's composable with all of these other money protocols so we we use that uh idea of die and you can you can literally have dye and wrap that inside of some kind of a nexus protected token and have an insured dye almost like an fdic type of of dye inside of your wallet and it could be just as as fungible as before you could you could pay your bills with it whatever so that's something that's super cool can you talk about how nexus's relationship with some of these other early d5 protocols and the money lego aspect maybe maybe talk about um uh yfi so wifey they've got this why insurance dot finance thing what is that all about is that backed is that powered by nexus and how does it work yeah it's basically white labeled nexus that's pretty much the one-line description of it um right now um i'm sure andre has different plans to do different things with it so he just put a user interface on top of nexus basically and integrated it into the rest of the the you know wire and flow i guess yeah exactly but i mean it's a bit more complicated than that it actually turns our cover into an nft and allows it to be traded outside the nexus platform um which is the protocol sync thesis metaphor in there somewhere yeah definitely okay so what does that mean turn it into an nft so our listeners know what nfts are these are non-fungible tokens so this would be essentially like a you know a claim document for some a certain amount what's the advantage of turning insurance into an nft um essentially you can make it tradable i guess um that's kind of one of the big advantages um but you can also like potentially split an nft into lots of little bits and pieces like you create um a token which represents fractions of the nft and then you can like really do some tricky stuff with that on like stream cover and do some fancy stuff um so that's that's kind of a really cool advantage that you can that isn't done now but it could quite easily be done in the future um and so those are the types of things that um composability on ethereum is just amazing um people we're only doing the stuff we can kind of think think right now about or it's a bit easy to comprehend but there's going to be so much stuff that we haven't even thought of yet so nexus as an nft that would be like um you could create an nft for a 500 policy on compound or something exactly yeah yeah yeah so it basically traded yeah so three things you know the time of the how long it's for like so that covers for a month it's for this amount it's on this protocol those kind of the three elements and then you could then what you could do is like say i'm gonna buy a million on compound for a year um and then and then i'm gonna turn that into a million um compound dye um and wrap it with c dye um and so now now i have a million c and then an exam died or whatever you want to call it which is natively covered compound die um that that earns interest that's crazy like there could be entire apps and entire businesses built around just taking the nexus mutual primitive and creating nfts out of it and then you know selling that in some way wrapping that in some way what about another one uh so recently i think this week safe came out so this is kind of like insurance mining and there's a safe token can can you tell us what that is i haven't kept fully up to speed um but got a lot of questions about that yeah i'm not absolutely fully up to speed on it but i'll give you my best shot um so so basically this takes the why um the wi-fi stuff that um andre's built the nft and you can stake that nft um to earn safe governance token um and i'm not quite sure exactly where the project um is headed was headed um all the rest of it i'm not sure um but the whole point was to kind of like bootstrap um a new governance token so you can earn that so it it was basically just using nexus effectively in the back end via wi-fi um and um so we just had a massive boon in cover purchases as a result of this so basically people were buying covers so that they could farm safe token not really knowing exactly what safe token was going to do in the future um but you know that's that's what people are doing these days um so that that that's kind of roughly what it is and obviously there was there's some stuff happened earlier today that i haven't quite gone on top of but um that may not last for that much longer the crazy thing about all of this is no one needs to ask your permission in order to build these things like safe team didn't need to ask your permission in order to come up with this nfte nexus market neither did andre and iron right they they could just build it on top of these primitives yeah exactly that's that's that's one of the amazing things yeah so right now nexus's core product is ensuring smart contracts because that's what define needs right that's what we need especially right now especially with yield farming and definitely into the future in order to be legitimate but like as nexus grows and grows and grows i would imagine its product offering can also expand and so is there a future world where i can purchase cover on my my dog my my house like uh my computer like is is something like this possible how about some healthcare in the us that'd be nice yeah you need to fix that um yes um with some caveats obviously but that's definitely what we've brought it that we built it to be able to do i mean our vision is kind of like a decentralized version of lloyds of london basically come to the mutual with any type of risk and if people want to back it great we'll offer some color there you go um and so that's definitely the idea we'll we'll stay within crypto for a while yet to get some scale but um in terms of stuff outside crypto it's probably more likely to be things where there's a reliable data source on the um to assess claims um so health insurance is probably the last thing we're going to do because you know putting public um personal information available to for people to assess claims should there be an event is probably not the best thing to do um but we can do things like um like earthquake cover or hurricanes or stuff like that where there are kind of objective reliable data sources to assess claims on a remote basis to start with and then you can start um developing the networks and distribution channels and stuff where you have like localized claims assessment teams and those types of things because they should be able to earn um income from providing providing that work on the on the system so that's definitely where we're headed it's a you know it's a long journey but that's um we do have a i'm quite a big vision outside of crypto for this stuff so if in theory that i if i could convince the chain-link oracles to somehow make an oracle about the health status of my dog you could insure it with nexus well i mean in theory we could insure it anyway um and like if you're a claims assessor you could actually hook up your own assessment up to a chain link oracle that was that's up to you um you could do that um but um i think what we need to do is make sure that um there is a reliable way of of assessing claims and yeah yeah if if that's by changing great david you seem super concerned about your dog is he doing okay she's doing just fine yeah oh great all right i got worried for a minute so with with the the future world of uh you know ensuring real world items real world phenomenon uh there's also the the relevant issue of like the nation state and and kyc right and uh nexus actually currently has kyc built into it in specific arenas like not not just purchasing cover for you know the typical contract like maker dow but uh for more specific niche use cases and that's just a function of uh an artifact of how you guys bootstrapped the the protocol um how what are your guys's plans to remove kyc and and also to kind of remove dependence on the core key actors and become um become deeper in the protocol sync thesis yeah yeah that's it's definitely on the on the on the plans and in the plans um so we you do actually have to have kyc to um purchase cover as well any member of the mutual has to be kyc um right now um so the um i guess the key here is that we have a legal entity in this thing so kind of like a hybrid um d5 protocol but we have a legal wrapper that gives us some benefits that you can't actually get within d5 like we have limited liability on a per member basis which is not something to just throw away like um lightly but um but there are obviously trade-offs with all this stuff um so yeah so i think the the key is decentralize on a on a gradual um basis um my my goal here is like remove the centralized aspects of the protocol get them fully unchained and then the rest of it and then we have the option as a membership group to shed the legal entity if they wish um and once you've done that um then you can remove the kyc so um that's definitely an option i think it's up to the members to decide at that point um but we can that's definitely the path we're working towards and is there a timeline on that is like is that a small obstacle or a big obstacle i i think look it's probably going to take us um over a year maybe maybe two we'll see how we go um the key here is that there's you know there are a few kind of um more challenging um incentive mechanisms to make sure we get right and we want to iterate on them and you don't necessarily want to harden them into a protocol too early um when you're not quite sure if they've worked um so that's kind of the the approach we're taking making sure we iterate get things right um and then once we're happy with it we'll end up with a hardened protocol that we can step away from love it fantastic so in terms of other developments and other part things on the roadmap like what what are the next steps like what are you working on today and then once that's done what are you working on tomorrow yeah so um it's been a bit reactionary recently given the d5 stuff is just going crazy um so um i guess one of the one of the things we're working on is with shield mining concept where basically um different projects can provide um bonus rewards to nexus stakers that stake on their projects um protocol to kind of bootstrap early cover for new protocols um so that's that's an interesting one that'll be coming out soon um then we're going to be looking at things like enhancing like the core features of the protocol um things like offering partial claims um also like um potentially tokenized cover um and and things like that then i also mentioned the investment earnings one before but that's going to be a key larger one on on the roadmap as well so there are quite a few things you know the priorities and stuff that does move around a bit with um with everything moving so fast but um but we've got a lot of interesting stuff coming out and looking to you know integrate with more people and stuff as well it's going to is going to be key to our success so if you had to make a guess and say it's two years from now or five years from now and nexus mutual didn't work it blew up for some reason uh if you could guess why that would happen what would you guess that's a yes good question um the i guess the um i mean there's always a potential for a bug in ourselves um that's that's kind of one one thing the i think it probably would be the incentive mechanisms um on the staking side of things if we can't get those right um i think they're pretty good now but they definitely need to be looked at again um and um and we are looking at them right now um and so i think we need some more iteration there if we have to make sure that those those um staking mechanics work because that's kind of like key to the whole thing if you if you can't bootstrap cover on new stuff then you know it doesn't quite work very well so um and you have to be have an engaged staking community that um that it's really involved in this stuff so um those are probably the that's probably the one key thing but you know there's always a potential for us to get hacked as well i guess hugh we started this whole conversation with the question is defy safe yet what's it going to take for defy to be safe for my parents for institutional investors for mainstream yeah it's a good question i mean i think i think you're gonna have to have several protocols um key core ones that have stood the test of time for a while um and that they become reliable um you're gonna have to have um unfortunately you're probably going to have to have some sort of insurance or safety net of some description around these things to protect um individuals you know you don't want you don't want um you know mums and dads or whatever putting in a chunk of their life savings and then they're just blowing up right um it's it's a bit okay it's more okay when people are just gambling under their own um and they know what's going on but um but i think we need to have those safety nets in place insurance is probably one but i'm sure there are there are other things that probably need to be involved as well one of the conversations about the difficulty of spinning up eth2 is that no one kind of wants to be the first through the door with when they deposit their ether into the deposit contract to get it over on eth2 because it's a one-way it's a one-way bridge right and and if it doesn't work it's not coming back is has nexus talked about insuring the eth2 deposit contract um we can out of the box actually um on that one um so yeah that's definitely an option we can also cover the stakers um so for example if you delegate um because it's one way um you're actually taking on like um credit risk of the validator um so because you know if they stop validating for whatever reason they can't run their infrastructure then all of a sudden your um heath gets eaten up by penalties um and so you know that there's there's definitely kind of coverable um risk there that um that we can look at hugh this has been exceptional thank you so much for spending time with the bankless nation today i've got one concluding question so vance spencer from framework a few episodes ago made the bullish bold prediction that we would see 500 billion billion with a b locked in d5 this cycle if we get to let's let's cut that let's say we're not as bullish as as vance let's cut it to i know david is but you know i i do this for the sake of others who haven't listened to all the bankless episodes and aren't as bullish as us david so let's say we hit 100 billion what percentage of that is insured and what percentage of that is uh covered in nexus yeah good question we're covering about two percent now um or something um so i hope we can get up to something like 10. um which ends up being a pretty big number if you multiply both those growth rates together um but you know um that's that's that's what the opportunity is right now it's a pretty big exponentially growing market and so you know um hopefully we can be there to support it um and protect people as we do grow all right so pressure yeah yeah so but if total locked value is 500 billion then we're talking 10 10 billion in uh nexus cover then uh that would be exceptional and hopefully we can get that number higher so that defy can remain safe hugh thanks so much for spending the time with us you know what i'm really glad that you continued building through the bear market my friend i'm glad you didn't quit because if you did we wouldn't have had this conversation but we also wouldn't have had this entire d5 primitive so uh we we appreciate it it's all about the builders that's what the series has been about thank you cool thank you both awesome uh bankless nation a few action items for you today the first is this you've got to read hugh's canonical uh bankless article where he talked about the risk of lending to a smart contract we'll include that in the show notes just get your head wrapped around the main risks when you're doing something in d5 and once you do that also read about how to protect against hacks with nexus we'll include that in the show notes as well uh may make you interested in some smart contract cover for what you're doing in d5 uh finally david how are we doing on on reviews man i think we're 150 maybe more what what do listeners need to do we're pretty we're pretty happy about it the bankless nation is strong and we want it to become stronger and the way that we do that is that we get the bankless podcast to the top of the itunes charts we are already in the top 100 in the finance and investing category on itunes podcast which is just fantastic and as this bull market continues we don't want to just pump those numbers up our goal is to get into the top 10 of the investing and and finance podcast charts and the way that you can help us do that is by going to wherever you listen to podcasts and giving us those five star reviews so that we can move up the ranks there are some forgotten ico podcasts that you know had a bunch of views during 2017 and for some reason they're still sticky and so i definitely think that the bankless nation deserves to be ahead of those uh another fantastic resource that i i highly recommend people who are looking to gain a further more more intimate understanding of how nexus works defy dad made a fantastic video of how to buy insurance cover with nexus that is one of the videos that i watched in order to prepare for this podcast and so that issue if you are looking to learn more about nexus i highly recommend that video we will include that in the show notes as well all right guys risks and disclaimers eth is risky that's why we have insurance crypto is risky d5 is risky you could lose what you put in but hopefully less if you insure it we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
