trudeau in canada they're having some problems with protesters these days there is a hovid protest going on in ottawa going on in canada what caught my attention is not necessarily that protest but on the back of this there is now a mandate from trudeau and those in power in canada to freeze protesters bank accounts absolutely ridiculous this is this is qualming freedom of speech they are freezing bank accounts to people that are expressing speech banks will be able to freeze personal accounts of anyone linked with the protest anyone linked with the protest freeze your personal bank account okay and the take is this time it's their protest maybe you're not protesting maybe you don't care about this next time it's yours what if next time it's about like runaway inflation government shouldn't be able to freeze people's bank accounts without a court order without due process the government is using the banking system to silence political dissent that should not be happening ever
