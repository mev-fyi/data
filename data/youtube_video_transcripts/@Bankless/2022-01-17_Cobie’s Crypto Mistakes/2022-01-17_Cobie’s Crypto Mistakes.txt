my long-term thesis was bitcoin as the only real value in this space i'm curious to tap into kind of your brain over the last 10 years and some of the things that you've gotten wrong and then also we'd love to hear about some of your biggest wins i've made every possible mistake you can make in crypto often in crypto you do something for like you do something wrong and you get rewarded for it so i've had those as well i think my biggest wins and my biggest losses were all by making mistakes like throwing risk management completely out of the window but i also did that on stuff where the opposite happened and lost like a third of my portfolio in a single trade you can just look back at everything i was like oh that was a really good moment for me that was a really good moment for me of these like small compounding wins well the main thing that i would like attributes at least my investment style was like trade things and return to value where originally i thought the only value was bitcoin played all kinds from as soon as i got into crypto but my long-term thesis was bitcoin is the only real value in this space so far i would participate in the waves uh in order to get more bitcoins i need to get as much bitcoin as i can before everyone else figures out that bitcoin is really valuable
