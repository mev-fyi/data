[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david fantastic episode brian quintes is a former commissioner at the cftc former and he just resigned actually the day before we talked to him this is a very candid conversation and what's going on in regulators minds particularly the cftc with respect to crypto just fantastic insights here this is definitely part of the bankless series where we try and explore the disposition or the nature of these agencies that regulate the financial world and are all kind of jostling for position with how to deal with the crypto regulation question uh it was actually really uh fortuitous that brian had just resigned from the cftc so he could probably he was probably a little bit more capable of speaking freely and so we were able to pick his brain about like what's it like to take the perception and perspective of the cftc uh as it relates to some of the big questions that we have about how crypto is ultimately going to be regulated by the nation state or even if it can at all we also went through kind of just a background of the cftc and how it came to be and what its role is uh and then of course extended that and extrapolated that to crypto um and then and then also just talked about the inherent um problems the nature of crypto and how it might you know cause a big obstacle for not only the cftc but for regulators at large if you if you guys remember our episode with josh rosenthal we talked about how everyone now has a printing press for assets uh how is a an agency going to deal with that um so questions like this were uh rampant throughout the episode and i overall really enjoyed brian's very sober and pragmatic uh responses to all the questions that we had yeah not only pragmatic but also like values aligned and this is just another reminder to people in crypto who think all regulators are evil and like bad and coming out to get us like there are some fantastic people in the halls of our government and in the halls of regulators who want many of the same things that we want and value many of the same things i think brian is very much to me we had uh hester purse from who's the commissioner of the sec on bankless podcast a few months ago and i think we were also surprised at how values aligned she was with um the crypto industry and uh so is brian and i was just uh amazed to hear that like he had just fantastic insights that i think anybody in this space for the reasons you listeners are in it we are in this see to to go bankless to disintermediate uh you know financial systems become more self-sovereign more free um brian sees all of that and so he had some very candid uh insights into how these industries work like the difference between the sec and the cfdc is there a little beef there i don't know uh it was interesting to get his uh insights into you know the the world of regulators how they're reacting to crypto and i think big takeaway for me david was um brian thinks that there needs to be a balance restored that we are too uh much on the side of of saying no to everything no you can't do this no did you ask for permission i'm sorry you can't do this we need to swing the pendulum back the other way and specifically regulators talking about america but other countries as well towards being a bit more like pro innovation like asking questions like well what if we did this could we sandbox this could we let this experiment run how can we focus on maybe um prosecuting the fraud and the scammers directly rather than uh creating blanket rules and unclear regulations that that harm the entire industry as a whole so super aligned i think with uh with our hopes and aspirations you know my only regret david is that brian's still not a cftc commissioner because we need people like him in our government bodies um fighting the fight that we're fighting uh only from the inside yes that is very true it is a bummer that he is not um in like you know having the the regulatory power that he does have yet i'm really excited to see what his future uh lies because it sounds like he is trying to work his way into the crypto industry so i don't hate that either also you're totally right his take about how uh the permissionless and open nature of crypto as a response a backlash to the permissioned nature of the alternative financial system i thought was a really good take and i think was probably my favorite part in this conversation so without further ado i think we should just go ahead and get right into that conversation with brian quintez but first before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer

introduce you to our next guest this is brian quintez he is a very recently former commissioner at the cftc the commodity and future exchange he was nominated by both presidents obama and trump unanimously cur uh confirmed by the senate for that position before being a commissioner he used to run his own investment firm he was an analyst during the banking sector i think that was his trial by fire because there was a little banking crisis in between there he ran a commodity hedge fund as well so he's got an experience in capitol hill as well as in capital markets brian it is fantastic to have you on bank list how are you doing sir thanks ryan i'm doing great it's great to be with you and uh excited to be uh doing this um host government yeah that's cool so you just resigned uh recently then is that the case yeah that's that's that's the case so uh as as a commissioner uh i and my colleagues are appointed to calendar date set terms and it's a five-year term and technically mine actually expired last year uh but i could stay on through the end of of this year unless my replacement had been nominated and confirmed that didn't happen so i was basically um given the choice of when i cho would want to choose to step down and and this felt like the right time and i'm excited having been at the commission for four years uh four full years i'm excited to take the next step well this is super cool because i think you can uh get give us some takes that are maybe not representative of the cftc now these are your own kind of personal takes that will be exploring this industry but you have that i don't have i don't have to give my disclaimer anymore you know it took me four years to remember to give my disclaimer and now i don't have to do it again so yeah i'm happy to talk uh uh about my my own my own thinking you know free and clear from how it may affect uh you know anyone's view of the agency we'll start here like free and clear i think what a lot of crypto people are wondering is does the us government hate us does the us government hate crypto um i mean if you know i think there's a short answer and a longer answer to that the short answer is that um i think it depends on the time period and uh the people in positions of authority uh i think the longer answer is that we've obviously seen a transition in in um political dynamics in the power structures uh of the white house and capitol hill and in the regulatory community and those power dynamics uh have philosophical impacts in terms of a regulatory regulatory outcome and um it seems to me like uh there's uh we're in an environment that's much more negative i think um i i'm disappointed to say that and and that's not necessarily to put value judgments or um uh you know negative connotations on anybody's any particular person's motives i've uh plenty of friends that are colleagues that are you know in majority positions now and have been in minority positions but i mean you look at um as i know you've talked about extensively you look at you know what happened with the infrastructure bill you look at what's coming out of uh you know the sec and and and some of the agencies um you look at you know the language that's being used on capitol hill uh by some very outspoken members of congress and um it's hard not to think that there's a little bit of a target on crypto's back right now we've been feeling that brian to be honest i think the infrastructure bill uh is a time in the crypto industry's history where we really felt that significantly uh we got lots of stuff to talk about but let's park on this for a minute i'm curious why do you think this has skewed negative recently in the current zeke gust uh across regulators across all of government why is this regime maybe we're currently in a bit negative on crypto so i think i think it's i think it's a few reasons um number one it is you know a lot of it is currently outside of the control of regulators and uh and and and that creates interesting dynamics for the first that dynamic that it creates is that it competes against you know the regulated environment and so just just from a a a fairness perspective i think it's legitimate to to kind of ask yourself if you're in a position that's appointed that is um you know swearing to uphold the law uh to to look at you know what you regulate and what you can't or don't regulate and ask yourself you know am i creating you know fair competition and i know one of my colleagues is kind of focused on that you know at my former colleagues as focused on that at the agency um but i think there's more to it than that and i think you know more to it is um when you're in a position like a regulator you're used to having control you're used to expressing uh some of your political philosophy or your regulatory philosophy through that control and things that are outside of your control that are related to your space i think um you know challenge that and diminish your authority and diminish your power and diminish um uh you know uh what you know your reach and i think some of this could be motivated uh by you know the the the need to do more uh the want to create a a new uh regulatory uh framework and structure uh that that is some kind of legacy uh that is you know could be self-serving uh for for those in positions of authority uh so i mean i think there are a lot of dynamics that are going on um right now and you know there's there's kind of the traditional fair competition you know discussion and you can kind of err on the side of um innovation and letting the market kind of evolve before you take a you know more of a stricter view uh or you can err on the side of i need to enforce the law as it is currently written you know against anyone who should be caught up by it regardless of whether or not they fit into this box innovation versus like very strict uh rule following being sort of a stickler for this sort of thing you know uh before we get any farther brian i'm actually interested in your personal take here so like what's your personal take on crypto is it is it a good thing is it something that um the us government should kind of push away and relegate to the fringes of society what's your take well so you know maybe this represents ignorant thinking you know or or old-fashioned thinking and you know that the cftc is a small agency and we have authority over a huge market 400 400 trillion dollars of derivatives you know are traded that is that are within our jurisdiction that's the biggest market by far of any financial market by far of course that's a notional value uh you know uh uh measurement so it doesn't necessarily measure you know uh true risk in terms of dollars you know exposed to risk but it's but it is a huge market it affects all areas of the economy uh for risk management purposes you know to ensure risk transfer functions and hedging activity of of of every sector and we're 750 people or the agency is 700 i'm not there anymore right so it agency was it is 750 people and so you know it's there's a lot to handle um and so i think you know the the the agency during my time there worked hard at trying to keep on top of of what's going on um and you know my i've worked hard at trying to keep on top of what's going on but you know it takes about two clicks you know through a thread on twitter to realize that um there's a lot of stuff going on that i still need to learn more about so i say that uh you know there's a little bit of a caveat to say you know maybe this is over style thinking and we can you know talk more about it in real time you know if there's more to add but you know i i think about you know crypto is kind of how it evolved i i was i felt i was very early in my role at the agency to defend the intrinsic inherent value of bitcoin um you know bitcoin was kind of bitcoin and and ether and you know the ethereum blockchain and the bitcoin blockchain were kind of the most prominent things in the space you know as i was coming into the agency and as i was you know nominated for this role and preparing to come into the role um and you know at that point as there still are uh there were a lot of value judgments being made you know on uh what this is if it has value whether or not it's a fraud um and and you know i gave uh uh just i gave speeches in the united states i gave a speech direct you know directed at um the powers to be in europe to say look you know i don't know what the value of this is but there is unquestionable value in it and to dismiss it as something that you know is is a fraud or is worthless or ponzi scheme or a bubble misses how i think 95 of the world is going to look at this we can't look at it at that point through the lens of a reserve currency status of the united states or the euro or some other major global currency we need to look at it through the demand and and accessibility uh with something that has a finite supply in terms of bitcoin specifically at that point and understand that this is something that is going to grow in interest and likely value and so you know i feel like i've been consistent about um uh the fact that there is inherent value in what we've seen develop you know from a crypto token crypto asset uh basis and i've never felt like we needed to necessarily have you know new regulations for that that um you know those tokens you know were either securities or non-securities and while we would all possibly like more clarity on what those things on on the status of that from the sec uh we didn't necessarily need um new law you know to to address some of that i think it was more process as opposed to policy if that makes some sense um but then as you know we start getting into d5 i think the conversation shifts a little bit in terms of you know what the cftc's purview is because there have been you know some uh protocols you know through you know smart contracts um native tokens that have allowed for derivative like contracts to be listed and traded and that directly implicates the cftc's jurisdiction and and i think you know that's where you know we can really talk about you know where where i fall on on the scale of you know strictly enforcing the law in real time regardless of innovation you know or the progress uh of a certain you know of a certain space or percentage sector and regardless of some of the features that that that space has that doesn't exist in the traditional regulated financial system that solve for some of the problems which regulation was designed to address you know or um you know taking what i view as more of a of us of a stand back um you know a wait and see approach to see how this space develops to see how it can address some of these problems through transparency through open access how it can promote freedom how it can promote uh wealth creation how it can promote access uh to you know financial uh products and then revisit the law and or an agency's regulations if there is a need you know to address some flaw and you know i don't know i'm sure there are a few but i don't know of a lot of or or a huge swath of investors in this space or owners in this space that are raising their hands and say and saying hey us government please come and protect me i i need your help i can't make my own decisions yes i agree plea please make value judgments for me you know i don't see that anywhere and i think that that should be you know a direct response to anybody uh on capitol hill in agencies uh that are saying you know we care about investor protection and uh this area is right with fraud and and uh you're at risk unless you know we're there to help brian we have so much to talk about and i want to get to this conversation of d5 and so many things that um that you mentioned uh like feel like american values you know d5 being a representation of american values so we definitely want to get to that discussion in a little bit but i'm wondering if you could provide for our listeners a quick primer on the cftc as a regulatory agency so you did that a little bit 750 employees regulating this this man this massive uh 400 trillion dollar derivatives market and pretty incredible and i i noticed the mission of the cftc it says is to promote the integrity resilience and vibrancy of the us derivatives market can you tell us maybe in some plain speak terms like what is the purpose and mission of the cftc why are you guys there how are you guys helping yeah thanks so i um i'll try to take a little bit of a walk back through time not to not to bore anybody but i think it's interesting and i think you know it actually speaks to um some of the regulatory and the political uh environment of the agency and how we interact with capitol hill and what you may see going forward and why but you know the the u.s derivatives markets really began in chicago in the 1850s and um you know that's that's where uh trading occurred you know uh for commodities you know for a future delivery at a specific point to allow farmers transporters producers processors just to manage their risk to manage their risk so prices going up prices going down you know supply disruptions weather events all those kinds of things and that was a um a federally unregulated um privately self-regulated marketplace through the 1930s when ultimately because of some price movements there was a a political call to create a an agency at that point within the department of agriculture because of the uh birth of the futures markets from the agricultural sector in products like corn wheat soybeans um uh you know to create a regulatory agency within the department of agriculture to oversee you know the futures exchanges and you know and that was in the 30s and then fast forward in time and in the 1970s congress passed the commodity exchange act which officially created the cftc and gave this agency independent status which meant it wasn't neces it wasn't part of the administration and it achieved a level of independence by virtue of having a bipartisan multi-member board so we have five uh appointed presidentially nominated and appointed roles senate confirmed presidentially nominated employment roles and no one political party can have more than three members so usually you have two republicans two democrats and the chair appointed by the president so the president's party has you know um governing control over the agency uh so that's how the the agency was originally created you know you know through the 80s and 90s you had the um invention the you know the innovative development of financial futures you know futures contracts on treasuries futures contracts on on stock indexes which which significantly expanded the agency's jurisdiction from both a number of contracts traded and the markets and what was underlying those markets then because there were you know futures on stocks there was a you know agreement between the sec and the cftc about narrow-based you know security futures contracts and you know single name security features narrow-based security index futures and broad-based security index features that's just a little bit of an aside but it can be relevant going forward um then as we got through the financial crisis and a in my view a very tiny corner of the swaps market um played a role uh you know in that through credit default swaps on mortgage-backed securities you know we're talking about a you know hundreds of trillions of dollars of you know market this is i i don't know what the numbers are on top of my head i'd say probably you know 2 trillion 3 trillion something like that a big number big number but tiny fraction of the swaps market but congress responded to that you know financial crisis with a whole new regulatory regime for swaps and that was implemented through the dodd-frank act so then that gave the cftc jurisdiction over interest rate swaps credit default swaps equity swaps commodity swaps foreign uh exchange swaps uh you know that rule writing occurred in the age at the agency mostly in the first kind of four years of the 2010s although we have recently wrapped up a number of very important rules that were left unfinished uh on things like swap dealer capital uh our cross-border view of swap dealing activity a position limits regime that expanded position limits to new commodity futures contracts and um you know and that brings us front and center to today when um i was being nominated for this role and i was preparing to talk about all things dodd-frank and the implementation of new swaps market uh rules and you know within two months of uh joining the agency and and and deciding to sponsor our technology advisory committee bitcoin futures get listed by two exchanges and put the agency front and center in the crypto debate and it's you know it's we haven't looked back since and i certainly haven't looked back and i'm i'm thrilled to i was thrilled to be a part of the nc when that was happening um and you know i can't wait to see uh where it goes and how i can be involved it seems like there's one trend brian which is like um new financial product is created something bad happens congress reacts cfdc gets more jurisdiction to come fix it uh but it seems to oftentimes start with some bad thing happening in a new financial market some sort of fraud that's out there is this the the recipe that's repeating so um when i first joined capitol hill as a policy staffer you know young right out of college uh opening the mail giving towards the capitol building you know great stuff a lot of fun you know but but very introductory uh i remember someone coming into the office who you know um uh you know was well known in the office and and they just said you know brian i just want you to remember two things you know i want you to remember something congress is great at doing two things nothing and overreacting and i didn't say that i'm quoting someone that did say it so you know no one can say that it's my view i'm sure he was quoting someone else too exactly probably but but i would i would um expand upon that or actually rationalize it to say you know that you know at some level that's what it's supposed to do you know i also went to a a class on a procedure and process at the library of congress my first you know couple weeks at uh you know on capitol hill and you know uh one of the experts in in congressional procedure and the rules that are structured to consider bill said you know a lot of people get frustrated because they think congress has created to enact laws when if you really read the constitution and think about what the founding fathers had in mind congress was created to try to make it as hard as possible to have bad ideas become law and you know we can debate about how successful they were um you know over the course of time and what's developed but it is very hard for congress because of checks and balances because of you know the consensus that's needed because of how much is on their plate um and and how much time it takes to consider just the normal business that they have to do of funding the government every year it is very difficult to pass new legislation and usually there is only um you know momentum necessary to focus the time and the resources and the rule writing and get support for you know a product if it's responding to a crisis and you know it in that kind of scenario in my view you're never going to end up with um a a rationalized right-sized um you know uh scalpel-like or flexible kind of approach or one that distinguishes well between um things that didn't have anything to do with the crisis or why the crisis happened to begin with um so you're right and you know that that if a crisis happens congress usually responds and depending on who's in power uh and what their political views are you know you're you could get a you could get a result that's very punitive um luckily i think for the most part the the the rule writing that the cftc did certainly while i was there in the last four years to to rethink and recalibrate a number of rules that were written in response to the crisis have been done in a way that really respect risk respect the market and respect the public um but who knows if a crisis hits the crypto space what congress is going to do who's going to get a new authority who's going to be at that agency when that authority is given and what those rules end up looking like ryan you just went through and gave us a historical context for the establishment and growth of the cftc and i just want to add a little bit more color upon that because in the crypto world we often talk about how we are speed running the evolution of money and finance and you know the commodities and the financialization of commodities are just a part of that history as everything else uh and you talked about how the you know futures contracts came out to help people help farmers um manage risk and help ensure that they can you know perpetuate their farm and into the future without having the um the whims of the market dictate whether their farm can survive and so for the people who are you know crypto native and want to uh gain a map for how this relates to our industry like bitcoin miners are a new age farm right this is our new age yield uh with like new age crops we call these asics uh they producing digital commodities rather than physical commodities and also we also have this term in in d5 called yield farming uh and like that term is appropriate like these are people with like you know digital crops and digital yields that will need financial tooling that we have already created in the physical world and now crypto is going to overlay these things these instruments that we've had and had before that the cftc has a jurisdiction over we're going to overlay them on to all these things that we're creating in d5 and so that's really where this conversation uh between the crypto and cftc really begins uh we've seen this before but now we are putting it on to a digital paradigm uh and we all have to come to terms with like what that means and what the similarities are and what the differences are i just wanted to add that color and see if you have any thoughts on that yeah you know i it should have been really self-evident to me to think about you know mining as the new farming uh and you know given that you know some of those terms are are being used uh you know in the space and i think it's it's a great way to think about it and i think it directly applies to you know our legacy space and what we're going to see in the future you know the the most successful businesses are the ones that successfully risk manage and um and they do that through a combination of you know of tactics but derivative use is a part of that and i think you know one of the most irresponsible things i've ever heard someone say about the derivatives markets is that they're weapons of mass destruction you know they are the reason why we have had economic growth that we have had for the last 30 to 40 years period you know anyone saying something like that is trying to sell you something um and and um you know it's really unfortunate that that kind of view um you know was aired and and painted with you know whole cloth the entire space um but derivatives are crucial to risk management i think the agency has done a very good job of of regulating the risk involved although you know the the reason that um we have the regulatory system that we do you know for futures and swaps contracts is because you know the one one philosophical take on the agency's goal is to protect the integrity of a transaction you know that you know because of the use of margin you know which which is which is uh you know viewed as as basically kind of like a performance bond you know it's not it's not a down payment it's kind of viewed as a performance bond that you will you know make good on the need to pay up if the contract moves against you that does that creates leverage but it's necessary because no one's going to put up all of the money for you know a product because otherwise it's a pre-sale you know or a pre-purchase so that's not really a risk it is a risk management tool but it's not the same kind of risk management tool so you know uh derivatives hedging naturally involves leverage leverage creates risks it creates risks of default by a customer which can create the risk you know to a clearing entity that is designed to stand in the middle of each trade and break that trade apart and face each side so that something diversifies the risk of customer defaults by aggregating it together you know clearinghouses don't reduce risk they they try to diversify it through aggregation and you have clearing members which are the financial firms that are the brokers of um derivatives contracts we call them future commission merchants fcms but you can see a scenario where a you know customer through a very adverse market event can't make good um goes bankrupt that the size of that position is big enough that it affects the fcm the fcm can't make good on its obligations the clearinghouse maybe a few fcms are caught in this and all of a sudden there's a massive problem at the clearinghouse and everything everyone has been using for risk management purposes is gone you know i mean that's that's a debacle now i don't think that there's a lot of stress testing that we do of clearing houses they are incredibly resilient incredibly resilient i mean we're talking multiples of a lehman style event multiples of a coveted style market move you know that could even start to approach some of the reserve resources they have i mean very resilient um but in my view you know you're not going to threaten a clearinghouse unless there is broad financial economic chaos and you know and that may be the one of the lesser problems that you have in that kind of scenario but you know i say all of that to describe the rationale for why we regulate the way we have why the cftc has regulated the way it does and it's to protect the integrity of the transaction because of leverage and beca because of how that leverage can flow through the system now when you have a new financial paradigm that's been you know rapidly and and wonderfully developed in you know the last two three four five years of defy um you know you have kind of a whole different approach to that you have a different approach to risk management you have a different view of of counterparty exposure you have a different view of what you need to you know what what deserves protecting from a from a risk management perspective and whether or not you know protocols that have more open source code that can be viewed and are actually probably much more transparent than you know the changing margining process of the legacy clearinghouses you know that's just a completely different dynamic and you know right now the law in our rule set says if you trade a futures contract it has to be done on a registered exchange and cleared through a clearinghouse well you know maybe before we start you know punitively going after you know d5 developers and and market participants that aren't complaining about anything we should think whether or not that's the right approach you know for this kind of market and um again i think there are some very thoughtful people uh even even you know that that may take a different view of me from you know the innovation to the fair competition landscape um uh you know very thoughtful people that i think have had the best intentions but i think we need to my view is in my view was in that role before we need to be thoughtful about what's different i totally agree and no question about um d5 bringing an entirely new paradigm a more a disintermediated paradigm to the entire legislative like set of laws instead of regulations that are on the books you know you know and ryan let me pick up on that if i could for a second uh because you know i i i was listening um to to your podcast ryan's help us and was talking about the you know the political dynamic yeah he's fighting on disney he was fired up and i spoke with him recently and it was a great conversation and you know i think he um he provided you know a lot of clarity you know in some of his comments some some of them might i disagree with but but i think you know as i think about the the the progress that the crypto space has seen in political advocacy you know the voice that it has the the you know unification around an idea of you know no understand this before you attack it and you know hey we're good we might not need your protection to me you know those those kinds of uh that you know the unity around those ideas you know it might be coming from the fact that the space is disintermediated that there isn't there aren't very large intermediaries that can create a conflict between you know custom with their customers you know where customers can feel taken advantage of or can feel powerless i mean you compare it to the traditional banking system i mean you know the the the customers of some of the banks are the you know give them the worst reviews but yet they don't change banks you know i mean customer satisfaction is very very low in traditional banking space and that to me creates a fractured political dynamic where you can try to promote um you know economies of scale and you know and and the capitalist system and the benefits there while also you know uh at the the risk of um you know adversarial customer base that really does want you know someone to take it out of you know you know the entities that they feel are you know abusing them and you know there are there are uh receptive audiences to both of those perspectives on capitol hill and that creates you know a dynamic of well um you know which one are we going to listen to and and which which philosophy is in power at what point to create a you know more you know uh laissez-faire regime versus a more um you know customer protection and control regime but in this in this space you don't necessarily have that kind of conflict and you have a a again more of a a sense of self-responsibility self-direction self-education uh individual freedom individual liberty taking ownership for your decision making and it's and it's basically saying hey we're good you know we don't need you and i think that's an incredibly powerful thing to try to preserve going forward 125 agree with you on this brian and i've i've never heard somebody you know coming out of the the regulatory world um you know frame it in that way but that's exactly what crypto is saying you know how you were saying earlier uh congress does two things either nothing or overreacts and we were talking about this you quoted someone yeah excuse me voted someone who quoted someone um and we were talking earlier about this pattern of um kind of regulation how there's new financial product there's a crisis congress responds and then it overreacts and you know lots of things happen what crypto is saying is like hey guys we haven't had a crisis right like you're attacking us and there's nothing wrong here we're actually building something that's incredibly cool it's two trillion dollars and some of the biggest crypto companies and organizations and employers behind this movement are actually us-based and so like shouldn't america be supporting something that a aligns with american values and like b helps to propagate and and uh you know increase the pie of the american economy and employ more people like come on take a look at this industry we're not causing a crisis here in fact when you when you peer into all the weirdness of the code and the memes everything that goes on on twitter you'll find some pretty robust financial products and by the way if you don't believe us it's all transparent and open so go check the blockchain right like um this is kind of what we're saying and i think you're saying the same thing and i i i totally am and i think it you know it's a great conversation that leads to you know but you know my view of how you know aspects of d5 really represent the founding principles of this country which is individual liberty and freedom and you know chris john carl uh you know a previous chairman of the cftc with whom i'm very close and uh it was a wonderful chair and it's been doing wonderful things in this space the original crypto dad i think twitter gave you yeah that's right um it was great to be at the commission all that was going on you know he had to turn off his phone as his twitter followers you know went from uh basically a hundred to fifty thousand uh but it it was well deserved and he's very thoughtful person i mean he he said in a speech the freedom to transact in the financial marketplace is part of freedom itself and you know i think we need to take a step back in this country and ask ourselves you know how much freedom are we really giving up and is it for the right purpose is it for the right benefit you know the i'm a big believer in balance uh you know i think i think um you know there there are rational arguments on both sides of a spectrum between um you know ensuring things you know aren't used illicitly versus ensuring that people can do what they want and are free to transact with privacy but i believe that the pendulum has has swung very far you know in one direction of anti-privacy and pro-surveillance that we need to have a reset and a rethink of that conversation and i think you know the only way to do it and you kind of see you know in an ecosystem when it gets out of balance it's usually something that's in the other extreme that comes along that resets yeah you know to me that's that's d5 you know that's crypto you know that's um that's that's some aspects of of what we've seen is it is it's it's the it's innovative innovation um that is responding to something getting way out of balance and i think no one's going to argue that that we don't want you know terrorists to be using you know things that uh could cause harm to people but you know that doesn't mean that the government should be able to see every single transaction i do um and that crypto shouldn't be viewed more along the lines of physical cash um and even with you know um aml uh and and terrorist financing concerns you know i would think that is it's in the us's you know uh geopolitical you know uh national strategic interest to allow citizens of foreign countries where some terrorist organizations are based to be transacting in these things to try to create more independence from those regimes and so walling those you know those countries off from you know the innovation and the wealth creation um you know of these things you know just for the sake of of of you know if a justified fear you know of how some may use it you know it could be doing plenty of harm that needs to be considered in you know uh how we view um the progress that people around the world can make to escape authoritarian uh dictatorships and you know that's the foreign policy aspect i mean there's the domestic aspect um i think it just requires it's going to require a new conversation and i think um uh the laws on the books are the laws on the books and the interpretations are the interpretations but um you know we need to do a better job of swinging the pendulum back totally agree with that um brian i want to ask you about kind of uh some differences that might be in the mind of a listener as they're thinking about the cftc jurisdiction and and kind of sec and um in both organizations regulators have played a role in in that um recently uh there's been sort of a new sec chair gary gensler taking charge and he's communicated some things that the crypto industry is just kind of like unsure of the clarity still hasn't come out of the sec with respect to its position on basic things like what's a security versus what's a commodity uh you tweeted this out on august 4th just so we're all clear here the sec has no authority over pure commodities or their trading venues whether those commodities are wheat gold oil dot dot dot or crypto assets i'm curious about this um what in crypto is clearly a commodity versus what is clearly a security like we still don't have a solid answer to that um is bitcoin a commodity i think the cftc has said yes is ether a commodity i think the cftc has said yes i don't know if you can confirm that and then like what about all of these other assets because we have now hundreds of thousands of them and we don't know what regulatory regime they even fall under can you shed some light on this yeah i i i can try uh and you know let me just let me just say that you know that the the tweet that you showed was um in response to a speech that chairman gensler gave at the aspen security forum where he characterized crypto as the wild west with rampant fraud that needed protection oversight and he was going to use as many authorities as he could to provide that as well as asking congress for new authorities to do it i recall the speech um uh yeah um i was i was very disappointed in some of the reporting of that speech as well as in the la in my view the purposeful lack of clarity um or or omission of certain facts given chairman gunzler's chairmanship over the cftc during and after dodd-frank when the cftc was given new authority fraud and manipulation um issues in spot market commodity transactions spot market commodity transactions are just you know cash for commodity you know going to the store buying something spot market you know commodity transaction um and that is authority that the cftc has had and reporters know it and the leadership of the sec knows it and a lot of people in the space know it and it's authority we've used that the agency has used i think we've run brought 25 to 30 cases over the last couple years prosecuting fraudsters who are offering you know exposure to crypto or a new crypto token and just absconded with people's money um we have you know uh fine received civil penalties um disgorgement uh and and you know other you know financial uh related penalties to the tunes of i think over 100 million dollars you know maybe 200-ish million dollars so um you know the cftc has been very active you know in this space and again with you know with a within a small agency 750 people full-time that are you know charged with protecting and overseeing and promoting the integrity resilience of you know the entire derivatives markets and you know i was disappointed that that our role in promoting that market integrity and holding fraudsters accountable was not raised either in that speech or in um the press and i was disappointed that there wasn't um more subtlety to what current authorities you know the limitations of current authorities are uh around pure commodity transactions wherever they are traded versus you know what congress may or may not choose to do and if they choose to do something who should be the correct um uh you know agency to try to implement that regime and so you know it's uh um i i think there's i think this is part of a longer story um and again my view is that there isn't you know a groundswell of support uh in in the crypto space for um you know needing the protection of the government people are taking individual responsibility and doing their own research and expressing in my view you know their their rights to freedom of financial market transactions in the space but i think you know to your point it is not the cftc that determines if something is a secured under our statute under the commodity exchange act basically anything that can be bought and sold in interstate commerce that has some level of fungibility is a commodity so we don't as an agency we don't have to make really you know an affirmative declaration that this is a commodity basically you should assume that that basically everything's a commodity you know so so then the question is is that commodity also a security you know does that commodity also you know represent a security and if so it goes into the sec's purview okay so from the cftc's perspective you're saying all crypto assets that are out there are commodities and it's outside i just want to clarify that real quick i think it's a little strange when you start talking about nfcs yeah okay what's going to ask you know like what's that what is it i think it depends on on how many of these of a similar kind of you know of nft are created but if they are you know if they are somewhat unique and they're highly limited or there is the lack of fungibility you know you know true fungibility from one to the next then then that wouldn't necessarily mean that they are commodity okay so that could be an exception some nfts may not be commodities some probably are but anything that is fungible so any erc20 token from from the cftc's perspective that's a commodity uh now whether it's also a security or not that's beyond the jurisdiction of the cftc and that starts to fall into sec territory and then they have their own tests that um they apply with limited clarity i would say on whether something is a also a um a security and so we kind of know that bitcoin and eth are commodities at least i think we know that because ether is on the cme right now cme futures correct so okay so this is an important point um the sec is going to be the agency that that declares or through a you know court challenge uh you know prevails in classifying something as a security commodity okay and if they do that that security product you know it you know in our in my language a spot commodity but that security product has to be traded on an sec regulated exchange or uh ats alternative trading system right which was a registered huge registration you know regime um if something is not a security if it's just a commodity it can be freely traded because there is no federal regime registration regime for spot commodity trading venues there are some state regimes around money transmission right which i think you're probably familiar with with the discussion over the last three to four or five years but where the cftc becomes involved is if a if a registered exchange seeks to list a derivative on a crypto asset and if that crypto asset is viewed as a security by the sec then that futures contract actually has some joint jurisdiction between the agencies if there isn't a view at that point or uh um you know going forward that the underlying product and underlying asset that crypto token isn't a security then that futures contract is solely within the cftc's purview so the fact that you have bitcoin futures contracts and ether futures contracts trading within solely within the cftc's purview means that at least up until now the sec has not viewed or declared those to these securities in my view that's absolutely appropriate um and i said i think in march of 2018 that echoed a lot of prior thinking including then chairman chris giancarlo that at that point bitcoin was clearly a non-security commodity and um uh recently uh chairman heath tarber former chairman heath tarbert of the cftc declared ether to be a commodity itself and he didn't necessarily say a non-security commodity but my view from within the agency and and looking back on that was that he wouldn't have made that declaration you know without you know some level of uh communication or awareness uh that you know of how the sec uh looked at that um so you know then the question is well um you know should should you should exchanges try to list a lot of futures contracts on a lot of these products to clarify what their status is well i mean at least that's that's you know kind of you know you know some idea um and in that circumstance i think you have to be careful what you wish for because there wouldn't be anything to prevent the sec and and you know this is their jurisdiction these are decisions that they make on a regular basis and they you know they are they have a lot of institutional knowledge and applying securities laws you know the end if if they do that too aggressively hopefully you know someone sees through a court case uh to its completion and allows a judge to decide as opposing to you know enter into a settlement that doesn't necessarily add a lot of clarity to the space but you know if if there were a flood of futures contracts on a number of crypto tokens there's nothing that would prevent the sec from saying we think all of those are securities and then that creates a broader implication of well does that mean anyone you know that's running a you know crypto spot crypto exchange is violating the law because they're listing these products that the sec now views as securities but then you can you can take that a step further and say to yourself well what if we have you know two kind of you know competing spot crypto exchanges that each apply you know for um or maybe you know where one applies for you know derivatives license with the cftc and what if it tried to list a futures contract on its competitors you know native token or rewards and then all of a sudden you know it's basically using an anti-competition tactic you know through you know forcing you know a regulatory agency to potentially you know classify something um that's in you know their competitive interest just by virtue of you know the regulatory process and i go through all that to say um where i think we're at a point where these decisions need more transparency um there is a there is a bill that was uh authored and sponsored by um congressman mchenry of north carolina in the house it passed the house that called to create a you know working group between the sec and the cftc and private market participants to discuss and try to clarify the status of a number of these tokens um and i think that's an interesting step if it were to come to fruition i don't know what the result would be you know i think that the sec may just do a lot of listening and say thanks you know we'll we'll let you know what we think and as is now i think they're they're right and you know and within their regulatory you know jurisdiction but i think it speaks volumes first of all you know having served in the house of representatives for seven years you know the the the house is run purely on a majority basis and it is a highly political you know um chamber of of of congress you know the majority and the power of the speaker is is pretty unparalleled and i'm not making a value judgment on any speaker or the current speaker or any prior speaker that is just institutionally how the house of representatives is run and to have a bill in my view that that directly implicates or challenges or acknowledges the lack of transparency around these decisions and calls for um a new process either out of frustration um or you know to some to some degree um uh you know indictment you know of of of that lack of that process of that lack of clarity um to have a bill pass from a minority member you know who has a prominent role as the ranking member of the house financial services committee you know passed in a democrat-controlled house to me speaks you know fairly significantly to a you know a view within at least one chamber that this isn't you know this is unacceptable but this needs to change and i don't necessarily know you know if it's not that bill what the right approach is um you know i think i think the the the dialogue between the agencies around the status of something if there's a futures contract or brutus contract you know listed on it yeah i think that deserves more transparency um i don't you know and having served in this role i'm also you know selfishly a little bit of a defender of the deliberative privilege you know a lot of my internal communications are protected by deliberative privilege because it's me forming opinions within within my own staff and i think that you know there there's there is the need to try to have free and open communications in us you know a small close-knit you know office so that exchanges of views can be heard and you don't necessarily you know overly weaken yourself you know in trying to make a decision and then having conviction but to the extent that there are two agencies that have views about a product that have widespread implications you know i don't believe that those communications necessarily should be outside of the public sphere regardless of whether or not they weaken one agency or the other in terms of potential you know uh uh legal challenges to what they do brian there's a lot to like parse apart uh with this and and the the last what we've you've been saying has been i think illustrative of what a lot of people in the crypto world kind of just want to turn off right there's a lot of things to pay attention to we have all these agencies that are like trying to find the line between these two things and one of the reasons why we like tokens in in the world of ethereum and on and on defy is that these tokens themselves transcend all like previous categories and boundaries that we've been able to establish from like the the pre-crypto world um like we have tokens that can literally be anything and so they will be everything and all agencies will want to have their sort of like jurisdiction imposed upon these things uh and so like because there's this lack of classification on on tokens it leaves a lot of interpretation as to like what the responsibilities and roles of these different regulators are actually are um but it kind of also leaves a power vacuum right because there is no classification and so one thing that one thing that we're worried about or pessimistic on from the world of crypto is that all agencies that have any sort of relevant uh jurisdiction is are going to like claim territory and this is kind of like the the libertarian versus like the the status approach right like people especially bitcoiners love this narrative is that like all governmental organizations are incentivized to grow their jurisdiction and to grow their organization and so ultimately that comes to envelop everything around it uh and then all of a sudden we've lost the freedoms that we also value in in the crypto world so my question to you is is there actually a fight for jurisdiction over stuff like this and it do you see that the like the the budding heads of the cftc versus the sec and now also the treasury do you see that as like a uh them trying to jostle for position to have more power and control and and to um you know perhaps even straight up increase the funding towards their own organization so i mean yeah yes and no uh you know i think if you know if if you approach your role within government you know either from a you know a government employee perspective or a leadership perspective or even an appointed perspective you do owe some allegiance a significant allegiance you know to the law you know it it's a hard thing to look at the law and if it says x to say i don't care you know when you're in that kind of role you know it's just it's there's a lot of irresponsibility you know that that that that view could could generate um you know so i think if there are things that feel to you know an institutionalist you know uh an agency representative who has expertise that yes this is clearly in our jurisdiction and if we didn't express that view we wouldn't be applying the law you know fairly and equally um you know i think that i think that that's you know to some degree you know what you know what what some of this activity is uh you know on behalf of of all kind of you know counterparts uh and agencies you know looking at this space i think there's a different conversation about you know things that may not be within their jurisdiction within any agency's jurisdiction that they either again view as a threat to their own powers and their own control either through um taxation through uh money supply uh through um you know quote unquote investor protection issues that then they are trying to find flexibilities in their authorities to bring them into their jurisdiction or they are asking congress or hoping that congress you know creates a new regime to give them that jurisdiction and i believe that's a high bar i think that there needs to be a high bar to congress creating a new regulatory apparatus out of whole cloth that it has not done before i mean we do not have a federal oversight regime over purely spot commodity transactions you know we don't have we don't register you know cattle auctions in texas and oklahoma you know we don't we don't have a federal regulator over ebay right in terms of an exchange you know the money transmission aspect probably um but why is this so different and why does it need this kind of attention um to me that's there's a high bar to justifying you know new public policy uh for any regulator and i have not seen anyone convincingly state that uh including all of the speeches and dialogue that has so far been presented gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto bison cells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemiini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including

makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave dot com that's aave.com brian i want to spend the rest of our time here uh talking about this this new paradigm that we've maybe introduced earlier in this conversation that is defy right so we talked about this world that i think that the current financial of regulatory apparatus is set up for is is a world full of intermediaries but but defy sort of disintermediates the intermediaries so instead of institutions that that you know take funds we have code that actually takes uh funds and that's open and uh transparent on on chain and i want to maybe contrast let's kick off this discussion to ask um you about kind of the you know the cftc and how it sees things and maybe other broader parties in government right so the cftc brought some action against um bitmex uh recently right and so not not to zone in on that action specifically but this is the example of what on the bank list we call kind of a crypto bank this is a centralized exchange and intermediary sort of an institution you'd find in traditional finance and i feel like from my perspective it's just like okay it checks all the boxes this is just another institution that we regulate like all of the others okay the cftc knows what to do that here are they breaking laws are they not if they are then we have to um you know prevent fraud so okay i get that but now we've got this thing which is defy and it is permissionless it is global it is open there are no counterparties there's no bitmex it's executed by code not humans and i guess my question to you is when we talk about defy does the cftc do you think and do other regulators see the distinction between those things because we've got crypto through crypto banks and intermediaries but then we have defy which is executed by code and these are completely different worlds and i'm not sure how many people understand the subtleties of this difference but it's massively important i i totally agree with you and you know and again i mean i'm not sure i understand all the subtleties i think there are a lot of subtleties uh to it and it's in a very fast and evolving space um but there are enough differences that i do understand to feel a lot of conviction and saying the the old model probably doesn't work and if the old model doesn't work you know why should we be trying to apply it and rope someone into it because they publish code or because they chose to use something um you know again but you know as as i've said before um in a different discussion just as a matter of fact not because it's a view that i love but you know the cea the my exchange act the law says it is illegal to offer or enter into an off-exchange futures contract and i mean that's the law um and so you know if just to be clear brian whether that's a um the law says as like just the black and white words of the law whether that's a centralized intermediary or a a smart contract executing that futures contract um it's it's just a law that pertains to the contract itself is what you're saying well so so i mean i think that you know i'm not a lawyer and i'm very glad i'm not a lawyer uh you know the agency had plenty of lawyers and they do great work uh but i'm glad that my voice was a little bit differentiated from those and i'm glad that you know not being a lawyer sometimes i i felt like i could take you know a higher level view and ask questions uh that you know maybe someone more focused on the details wouldn't have asked and so you know i i say that to say that you know this isn't legal advice since i'm not a lawyer thank goodness but you know i guess you could look at the operative words in that statute as as being you know to offer or to enter into which you know could mean you know some entity offering something so it could be you know a centralized entity or it could be something else that may be hard to hold accountable for something but then the other you know word is enter into which actually creates liability for an individual you know um taking responsibility and um you know and again exercising you know financial market freedom by you know entering into a transaction uh and and i think that's a that's an unfortunate and dangerous concept and one of my points on that was look let's take let's take the cftc out of it let's say the cftc just refused to enforce that that part of the law you know large financial institutions are not going to engage in activity that they know is illegal and so you know if the d5 community if if if the d5 space and certain you know protocols and their smart contracts you know are hoping for more institutional engagement and there are you know derivatives being traded and and there's there's a hope or a wish that you know institutional money or resources come into that you know that's a that's gonna that's a problem that's going to need to be solved you know either by changing the law you know creating a different kind of framework that can recognize you know the status of a non-entity you know code you know as a exchange you know or some other kind of solution uh so there is a real world implication to what the law says even if the cftc decides to do nothing and and i think that's important to understand um but you know but also you know to your more fundamental question ryan um you know i i think that you know there could be a view by some at the agency i haven't heard about it directly but i can understand if some have this view that they saw activity occurring that they believed is illegal and they're going to find someone to hold accountable for you know um i wouldn't agree with that and that's not something that i would necessarily you know overtly kind of support if i had you know if i was in my prior role but you know people could take that view you know within within you know within the regulator um ryan uh i wanna i wanna jump on that point and and uh ask another question that's related to that um when i got into uh crypto uh i was how old was i i was young i was like 24 25 or something uh and i had i i had a psych i had a psych degree right i didn't have a business degree didn't have a finance degree uh i paid my taxes with turbo tax um whatever just like input my w-2 called it good uh and so many people are coming into crypto with that background right like not really understanding finance not really understanding not even understanding commodities or securities or anything because you got a ledger you live in your parents house uh you find this ethereum thing and then you start pressing some buttons uh and so like one of those buttons might be to mint a commodity or or a derivative token or something that falls under the regulation of the cftc now if it's not going to be a centralized intermediary because these individuals are playing around in defy and the the reporting requirements or the the regulation requirements actually don't fall upon everyone uh does that mean that it actually falls upon the individual to understand the rules and regulations coming out of the cftc and you and do you think that the cftc will actually start to have a jurisdiction over the individual right like no you actually can't touch that contract because of the laws is that like a future that you see or is that just too too crazy i i don't see that future and i think that would be very irresponsible of the agency to take that view you know um technically could there be liability there yes but uh i i don't view it as as credible um or as responsible um i mean i think you really see the agency you know only going after individual traders who are you know committing massive manipulation you know in important markets that are bread and butter to the cftc jurisdiction and those cases take a lot of research and a lot of time to bring and win um and you know i i don't i don't see that as as a again this isn't legal advice but i don't see that as a as a likely outcome in this space and it wouldn't be something that i individually would be concerned about me personally um you know i think it's i mean we're just we're just gonna have to see how how the space evolves i i think that um you know there is an understanding that um you know publishing code is a first amendment right and uh it is it is part of freedom of speech and uh there are a lot of court cases you know that that that back up the ability to publish something that could be used by you know any you know recipient you know in a in a negative hostile uh violent you know right breaking way but it is not the publishing uh you know of that material that is uh violative of the law it is the use of it you know for that illicit purpose um and i think the the more that you know that defy stays or or furthers itself as decentralized uh the the the the safer um you know the ecosystem is because it basically just becomes individual actors interacting with uh freely published code i definitely think that's a good thing and i think that i think that's a i think that represents a lot of hallmarks you know and again that you know some of the foundational principles of the country yeah that's that's a really really good thing to hear and i also want to ask because the other uh obstacle that i i see coming uh towards the way of regulators and especially the cftc is you know earlier we talked about nfts and how like you know nfts could not be synthetic assets or commodities or anything but the thing about defy is that we have all these financial tools that plug into each other and so we actually just uh yet just yesterday a a report a new project came out that talked about creating perpetuals perpetual contracts upon a price of a of the floor price of nfts which just means like the aggregate price of nfts all of a sudden we can now make uh perpetual contracts based off of nf any nft like set anything that has sufficient amount of liquidity in the last two weeks we have seen a thousand nft projects like blossom and it just just created out of thin air over the last two weeks and i actually kind of think like over the next year we're gonna see like 10 000 more and that means that there's going to be like room for like tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of perpetual contracts synthetic assets derivatives that are all coming out of nfts and that's not even talking about the defy tokens which also have the same potential properties and so like i see a world of 10 000 synthetic assets 10 000 like derivative contracts coming into into d5 and so like is the cftc equipped to handle just a cambrian explosion of assets that kind of fall under the purview of commodities no no no and and i and look i mean i i don't think that it needs to be concerned about that you know even if it you know technically implicates its jurisdiction you know the agency has very important authorities over you know critical components of of the economy that it doesn't need to be using its scarce resources to you know go after you know a new blossoming space you know that that could implicate its you know potential jurisdiction but let me answer that also in a different way which is that i had said before the cftc has uh anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority over spot commodity transactions you know not not some overarching trading registration regime you know regulatory regime but pure anti-fraud anti-manipulation um you know civil authority you know to prosecute you know if the agency's considering getting involved in the d5 space at all maybe it should start there i mean technically that would mean that the agency has some level of prosecutorial authority over flash loan attacks for instance you know over outright fraud and theft through you know um you know chat room schemes um and you know if there aren't um criminal authorities that are helping to prosecute that activity and if the agency is starting to dip its toe into the defy waters you know let's actually just go after the bad actors who are stealing things oh my god can i just can i just put my hand up and say that's exactly what we want that's exactly what crypto wants i mean there are bad actors there are uh people who perpetuate fraud i mean i don't not a day goes by that i don't get a dm or somebody on discord message me and um try to get me to do something in crypto that's essentially going to steal all of my money right um these are the kind of bad actors that uh we would hope our regulators would help us with the clear frauds right um the big connects of the world i mean good job scc for going after that that case right or if there's a centralized exchange that is um defrauding their customers like please help with that um what what we worry about i guess brian is um yeah the editor for bank list we have a newsletter too and um you know we try to go to uh various products in the us one of my favorite products is a dy it's called dydx doing really cool things it's a perpetuals products product it's not available if you live in the us right so it's like geoblocked you live in the us you can't access it and i'm like lucas why can't i access this and he's like he always goes because we live in a financial prison ryan that's why right and he's kind of joking but like it also no he's referring to he's referring to the cftc's authorities and the statutes that exist so if i'm in europe i get access to these markets and these products if i'm in another place and like why can't i think the regulatory environment in europe is different i think it's changing it could be changing very rapidly and you know sometimes you know uh a lack of clarity could be better than clarity and we'll see how it evolves in europe um because you know the clarity may not be as uh beneficial as you know anyone could hope but what i just worry about is like uh can can is there the real case that america could fall behind we have some of the the like the best talent in this space a silicon valley uh came you know from the u.s that's the us creation and like how can uh government us government not lose sight of let's not mix miss the next internet guys this is like a financial this is a really huge uh movement we want it don't doesn't the us government want it to be centered here don't they want their citizens to have access to this and i worry that we're we're missing something along the way and this is not a criticism on you in particular like no no personally i never mind being criticized you know i believe that you know in my prior role accountability is part of the job and that can come through criticism feedback whatever um so you know i um i appreciate any and all that at all points um as i hope my colleagues do and i think they do um but i wanted to bring up two issues that you raised one was kind of the geo fencing um you know i believe it's a disgrace that regulators are are forcing through a potential enforcement action you know entities to take away what in my view is a first amendment right to privacy of market participants you know in our country you know we talked about balance and the pendulum and i understand that there are ways to get around rules and get around regulations um you know but to me there is a very strong first amendment argument to be made to the ability to use you know um vpns and and and access points that are you know less traceable to the government maybe i don't know that much about vpns but a lot of the conversation from a regulatory basis has been around um detecting those uses and trying to prevent those that from you know those kinds of access points and i and i don't i don't view that positively you know i i think that that that an exchange or an entity can meet its obligations by having reasonable standards in place that doesn't necessarily preclude people from exercising some right to privacy and it's the government's job to find those things out not to force you know other entities to do its work for them and we've we've gotten to a point the regulatory state where you know regulators are forcing entities to do a lot of their own work and i don't view that necessarily positively uh for freedom or for um you know the uh the the standards of privacy of the individual consumer and that conversation can go directly into big tech if you wanted to but i mean we don't we won't go there today the issue to me is still around you know the ability to transact freely in the financial marketplace and it's regulators job to try to understand what's going on whether or not frameworks can apply and if they aren't how they can be so you know that's that's one that's one of my points of view there you talked about um you know innovation and entrepreneurialism and wealth creation um and you know in my view one of the fascinating things about d5 in its true form is that it is the ultimate and you know maybe in my view the ultimate expression of the beneficial power of a free market from a um access innovation uh transparency comp you know reward competition virtuous cycle um you know you don't have a lot of that uh a lot of those characteristics in the existing financial system um you know it's hard to compete against the incumbent you know top 50 banks let alone top three right it's hard to compete against the the top three derivatives exchanges it's hard to compete against the top two or three stock exchanges um but here we have an environment where you know things can be innovated at a very low cost by almost anybody have instantaneous and widespread accessibility to create a network effect that generates value and wealth that then can be competed against and you know reprovoke you know innovation growth wealth everything that we want um why would we unduly inhibit that it's beyond in the name of increasing a regulator's power increasing someone's potential legacy or in the name of you know applying a law as it's currently written you know again i talked about balance and i think ultimately things have to come back into balance but i think you know d5 needs to run as far as it can as fast as it can to make sure that we get that pendulum swinging back more towards the middle well we are running fast and we are running hard right now brian and as we start to bring this to a close i want to ask you a question about like projecting into the future so you've talked so much during this discussion i think one of the major themes has been kind of this balance uh another theme is um we need some additional regulatory clarity coming like from our legislators from from congress uh for some of these agencies too so i'm wondering if you could maybe we're in sort of a negative uh trough i guess it seems like a negative regime but but can you tell us maybe where you think this ends up and paint the happier picture of how you think america can move forward and other countries america can maybe partially serve as a model for other countries how they move forward with some sensible regulation for crypto that doesn't kill innovation but actually supports it clears out fraud how do you think this is going to play out in maybe a good way so i think you know again i i i'll try to separate what i see in in terms of the innovation and evolution of d5 versus you know more of the well-known large market cap you know crypto you know products assets and their trading environment you know i think you know in in any um in in any economic environment you know service providers are going to come to exist and grow in order to increase access and uh you know ease of use of of of new products and we've seen that with you know the growth of um exponential growth of you know crypto trading venues you know exchanges i think exchanges you know there's a sense in in the government that the word exchange connotes say you know a registration status with the government so i kind of refer to them as you know crypto trading venues but you know people refer to them as exchanges and that's fine um you know highly centralized entities uh providing a valuable service you know being compensated for that service you know outside of a you know more traditional uh financial regulatory regime because they're you know in the spot commodity market for the most place depending on what the sec may or may not decide on the status of any product i do see the potential you know for a regulatory regime to develop around those because of their size their scale their customer base i wouldn't necessarily advocate for it if one's going to be developed i think the cftc needs to be front and center in the conversation there was a bill that was introduced in the last congress called the digital commodity exchange act that would allow the cftc to create a voluntary registration regime for spot crypto trading venues and then through through through registration would basically grandfather in as non-security commodities the tokens that were being traded there or that had enough liquidity to justify you know commoditization right to solve a couple issues at the same time and i think if something's going to happen that's a good approach for a few reasons one is that it's voluntary so that it doesn't just force you know large successful you know service providers that have increased access to these products into something that may not fit them or may destroy value uh it allows an agency that has you know some level of expertise in the commodity markets to develop you know a regime that should hopefully become attractive uh enough for you know voluntary registration but it also creates an incentive you know through uh more certainty of the legal status of the products that are being traded you know that there's no you know that that is an approach that i i could appreciate and it is in the house agriculture committee they have the agriculture committees getting back to our first conversation are the committees of jurisdiction of the cftc you know it's not the financial services committee it's the agriculture committee because of the history of futures contracts originating with the agricultural markets and i would say that it's very important that those are our committees of jurisdiction because farmers have a strong voice there and it forces the members of congress sitting on those committees to pay attention to the effect that our regulations have on end users on the people who need the products we regulate to manage and run their businesses you know and i think that that's a very important dynamic that i i actually really appreciate so it may sound odd but i think there's a lot of public good there um and so so that's in the house agriculture community i don't know what the status will be of that bill going forward but i would hope that in any discussion about you know a a a centralized crypto trading venue registration regime that the the the members of congress on capitol hill that have jurisdiction of the cftc are front and center in that conversation you know moving along to d5 you know i i don't think there is the bandwidth the understanding uh or even the um uh capability possibly at this point to create or craft legislation that would be able to effectively target that space i think we're going to have to see how so i think it's going to be more of a regulator-led uh discussion of how any regulator wants to apply its existing authorities if it decides to take action and then against whom for what and you know we may we may see court cases develop out of that and again as i said with regards to you know challenging any regulators you know decision making hopefully um if if any regulator takes a view that's too aggressive uh that's too broad or that isn't well substantiated you know a judge ends up making you know a ruling on it to either um limit you know or or negate that kind of decision you know or hear it for its merits and and embrace it under certain circumstances uh you know in that scenario ryan this has been absolutely fantastic uh to walk um through some of these issues with you i really appreciate it i hope the bankless nation heard that it all starts with agriculture all starts with farming is what brian quintes is telling us this has really been a pleasure thank you so much for spending some time with us thanks ryan thanks dave it's great to be with you um i wish

ryan i i do appreciate that i was going to have to leave by the end of the year anyway and um it was the right time to to move on um i don't have anything uh lined up yet uh i'm hoping to have some announcement in the next uh few days maybe within a week um as i said in my you know uh my resignation uh uh communication i wanna keep crypto and d5 very relevant to my career and i i think you know at least one of my announcements in the near future will do that i'm hoping to um do a number of things that can you know embrace you know this space this innovation um and uh the freedom and and uh opportunity that exists in it and help move it forward well brian uh as bullish as i am on crypto i am also as bullish on your career and seeing what you do in this space so i'm looking forward to
