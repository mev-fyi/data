it for just shy of a billion dollars and who is now an investor and hard at work building fractal where he is a co-founder a nft gaming platform so justin's gone all in on web3 in many ways and he caught attention recently because he's had a serie a series of very bullish posts on nfts and nft gaming recently on twitter which of course got people excited so i had to have him on the podcast talk about what's going on we talk about what twitch would look like if he were starting it today and what it would look like as a web 3 property we talked about gaming and fts and the tremendous amount of pushback that they get from the gaming community and what it will take to overcome that pushback uh we talk about fractal his latest venture and why he's building it on solana which i'm sure all the solana uh maxies will love and then general life advice honestly uh as somebody who has had a tremendous amount of success and also found that that external success was not always making him happy so some very uh important words of wisdom i'll say for folks who are in this space where we're constantly chasing profits feeling like we're not enough and of course we get into a whole bunch of other

everyone welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and i have a very special guest with me today i'm incredibly excited to be talking to justin khan the co-founder of twitch and now investor founder of fractal a new nft gaming marketplace which we're going to talk all about and a general badass and content creator who i've now discovered and like enjoy for his content so uh justin thank you so much for being here welcome to the show did i miss anything there with your intro no i think that's enough there we go yeah content creator embarrassed by how successful you are um no no i've done i get to do a lot of things which is fun but um yeah no i i i love making content most of all i think well i want to talk we'll end up kind of talking about that because i do think it's interesting you went from like a platform for creators and being on the platform side to the content creator side yourself though i think you were kind of always creating content we'll get there we'll get there let's start with this give us your background and you know sort of your journey to where we are today and and you're now interested in web3 sure yeah so i've been a internet entrepreneur in silicon valley for the last 18 years i started off in kind of the web 2 era building javascript apps and one of those apps that we built was called justin tv it was kind of like a market it was like a um not a market it was like a show that we were doing to uh like a live streaming show about ourselves uh in the early days the internet was like 2007 and then eventually that turned into platform for live video and then we turned it into a platform for live gaming video called twitch then i built that for a couple years grew to be a pretty big website and we sold it to amazon in 2014 and then from there for a cool billion just just shy of a billion dollars they didn't even want to give me that but uh oh yeah for you [Laughter] so after after that look what happened um i was an investor i invested at y combinator for a couple years as a partner there and then now i have my own fund called go capital and uh incubate and help start companies um and the one that is on everyone's mind right now is called fractal it's a uh nft marketplace for gaming assets so helping players discover buy and sell uh you know gaming nfts and when you say we in the early days of building justin tv who else was sort of with you in that in that era yeah i had a couple co-founders for justin tv um really talented uh individuals uh michael seibel kyle vogt and emmett shearer and uh they've gone on to do really incredible stuff so michael's now the ceo of y combinator running uh like you know yc and and um i think you know they're funding a thousand starters a year or something like that and um and it's still the sea of twitch you know uh i guess 12 years after we pivoted so he's still growing strong at amazon you know twitch is a big company there and then my co-founder kyle went on to co-found a company with my brother dan called cruz that's a self-driving car company and uh big company in san francisco they just they just launched uh self-driving fully self-driving rides in san francisco for the first time ever it's a pretty cool experience that's wild so you started as really a content creator and it was sort of like your own reality tv show is that what you're describing with justin tv it was like the early days of kind of trying to all we're building and web 2 and the rest of it is that is that right i'm a little yeah kind of like so i think a little young yeah or i'm just old now no no i feel old in web 3 but yeah so i uh started off actually we started off with this calendar app uh called kiko which is kind of like google calendar but it was like shittier than google calendar in every way basically but um you know we were like 22 21 when we started building it and then we ended up selling that company in this fire sale on ebay it's kind of like a yolo like hail mary when it didn't really work out and then after that we ended up starting justin tv which is like us trying to make our own reality show on the internet so we're kind of like content creators but we knew nothing about creating content and we were not very good at it we were better engineers than we were content creators so we like had built this whole platform to enable it and then we turned it into the platform when people were like they showed up and they were like your content sucks but how do i move my own life are there still early like can you find early episodes of if they were i think it was live yeah there weren't episodes it was like always live she's live really quickly yeah there are recordings i think on youtube or on the internet thankfully thank god we lost most of the archive of the footage which is i mean i i don't even i would be embarrassed to look at it now you know well you know you turned something you turned it into something pretty amazing twitch obviously being a massive platform and i want to talk about what twitch might look like today in like the web 3 world i know you've you've said that if you're building switch today you would probably make it web 3 native which i assume means decentralized and more empowering to the creators so i want to uh kind of break this down for folks because i think this is interesting as we think about how different industries and models might be disrupted moving forward in web 3. if i understand it correctly you've got a couple ways that right now twitch like a few revenue streams you do have ads on twitch and then yeah people like people donate right like to the they basically subscribe to the streamers and so they're trying to yeah kind of like uh they subscribe they get some benefits and chat you know and uh like emojis for the streamers and then it's almost like a i guess the equivalent would be like patreon or a um like a sub stack or something like that and twitch takes a cut of those subs and then there's twitch bits and channel points which i do they both they both still exist on twitch i really did actually try and research this and and my sense is that channel points are for the people who watch the streams and bits or something that the creators are like a virtual currency right like that that you can donate right to this streamer to the streamers yeah i had always heard of channel points is that like a similar is there a distinction points are a reward that you get for like okay watching yeah if you don't know 100 that makes me feel a heck of a lot better you know to be honest after your time i'm not a power user anymore okay but so bits are sort of this in-game currency you can reward your like favorite creators with or get special emojis in their store yeah you like buy something and then it appears on their stream you like but by donate to them and then it appears on their stream okay so one you know sort of obvious tweak here and i think you've talked about this publicly as well would be twitch uh really owning the bits but then rewarding creators with them and it being like an erc20 something that can be exchanged on a dex and that incentivizes the creators to drive the price of it up through genuine awesome content and engagement et cetera is that is that right is that how you would see this evolving into a web 3 world and are there other ways you would evolve twitch to make it yeah you know if you were creating twitch today or something like it you you would focus on making the community an open and programmable economy right like all the economic engine around the community so that includes you know subscriptions the donations and you would basically you know the twitch company itself would probably be holding a treasury of these tokens and then they would distribute them in a way to their the people who make the content right the people who are this the content creators the streamers uh maybe power users or viewers or moderators who are doing something and so there there would be kind of like an economic engine probably similar to what people pay for today which is like to pay the streamers to reward them or for their attention and um you know the only thing is like there would be potentially this upside of like uh you know there could be a deflationary mechanism or some sort of value accrual to the to the token that would share the upside in the people holders of this project right and like and would that have that's kind of yeah would that have been better call let's just start with financially would that have been like financially better for you and the team creating twitch or would have been an act of goodwill for the the that's a good question would it have been better for us financially like well one thing is we probably couldn't have sold twitch which turned out to be much more successful than just the buy the the cool billion so like potentially it would have been better if we'd like you know if we were an open source project that like was this like decentralized project and we're just holding tokens in it like we couldn't have sold it twitch uh itself so maybe we would have been forced to hold on to this like you know this kind of like project tokens that represented the equity value of things so it could have been economically better for me but i think more importantly what would have been better is that like more people would be able to participate in the upside of this project like the people who are creating the marketplace you know twitch is like a marketplace of content and people are creating content and people consuming it you know we'd be rewarded for that and i think that's kind of how the internet should work you know like yeah so that's why that's what what i think is most important do you think we'll see that will something squash twitch that is essentially a decentralized twitch that will draw users because it brings their engagement and rewards them so the problem is that there is like a strong network effect to being on twitch right because if you're on twitch is driving a lot of eyeballs because people go to twitch to discover content now just like they go to netflix you type in netflix and find something to watch you know people find a certain kind of content on twitch and so i think it's pretty hard to break that now there's like this really strong economic incentive like i actually think twitch could be much better off if they were like we're going to issue this virtual currency this digital currency to all of these people it's going to be decentralized currency so we're not going to control it we're going to issue to like pro rada to the people who make twitch we're going to hold a [ __ ] ton of it ourselves and then it's going to be open and programmable and people can build experiences on top of it in our ecosystem and i think that actually could be hugely valuable like a a creative to twitch the company itself but the problem is it's really high risk and it's kind of a one-way door right so if you have this thing that's already working it's really hard for you to convince yourself like to fully decentralize i think as a web 2 player and it's the same thing as like blue sky with twitter like you know i think it's just really hard like you have public shareholders in the case of twitter here and twit twitch you have like bosses at amazon to report to and so can you do it i i don't know like to be honest like i think it could be have tremendous upside and be really good for like the world in in the sense that like there's more participation and perhaps governance of of this like large internet property but i don't know if it's practically possible it's kind of like you might be trapped in this like local minima of uh in terms of governance or like the activation energy required to get to this new state is very high do you feel that way across you know twitch is one example but sort of social media writ large i mean there's a lot of optimism let's say around the potential for decentralized twitter and facebook and which of course have crazy strong network effects themselves what's your take sort of broadly on this ecosystem yeah i do feel that way right like i think if jack couldn't get it done is this fud blue sky and and twitter maybe are we fighting right now people are gonna unsubscribe from their podcast or like we listen to you to tell us that it's all gonna happen yeah i mean look i i think it could happen but i think if it happens it would be i think it's much more likely to happen with something new right like yeah just like there's always something new in consumer trends you know like whether it's clubhouse or snapchat or i mean snap's not new anymore but like you know you get the idea there's like there's always new features the way that people interact with each other and i think that it's much more likely that you know kind of crowd ownership or like the community ownership happens with with a new project than with an existing one what's the question between like are we going to trojan horse the world into web 3 are we going to like like burn down the old one and like you know build from scratch and this is sort of a hey we'll start building from scratch and hopefully one by one we pull people over because the experience for the user is or the the economic incentive for the user is better yeah i think it's probably a combination of economic incentive but also like i think the economic incentive alone doesn't do it like people need to have some sort of va you know core value proposition that they're like really excited about in general already you know and that can drive that will drive adoption i mean look people try new stuff all the not all the time anymore i mean it's gone down since the beginning of like apps but like people still are willing to try new stuff you could even like truth social you might hate it or love it you know trump's social media has like driven to number one in the app store monday i think and i mean reportedly you know it was buggy i don't know i didn't try it but shocking yeah but like my point is like yeah you could imagine some people create a movement and they attach crypto to it and they can drive a huge amount of like core initial interest and that's enough to get the ball rolling i don't know mm-hmm okay trump should have attached a you know crypto element to uh truth social well did you track the melania the recent melania scandal they're clearly aware of of this world did you follow this at all if not really selling an nft and then it was like wash traded or something she basically bought her own nft i mean she did the kind of classic thing where i mean we don't really know but like the money that bought the nft ultimately came from her wallet i mean that is or a wallet to be known which is hilarious and just so the trumps you know that's the beauty of blockchain like they did that that's always how they've operated it's like weird shady like kind of like you know bs but now we can all see it and it's like yeah okay well let's talk about gaming or did you have something else you wanted to add there no no no okay let's dive into gaming this is obviously people i i really came across i you know i i was kind of aware that you're doing stuff but you've been now tweeting bullish things about nft gaming and so of course the world is the blockchain world is so excited about that because you have so much credibility in the gaming world of the gaming space and um had some tweets that that i think really caught everyone's attention uh i'm curious like what was your aha moment for nft gaming and i say that because i've heard other interviews with you and it does sound like it was a little bit of an evolution freedom i was a total skeptic at first you know like i think i went you know my history was like i was buying bitcoin in 2013. right before it crashed then it crashed i was like i'm an idiot i'm the bag holder then i was like you know when i saw ethereum start to rise i was like okay this is interesting as a programmer but like it seems deeply impractical to build any like real applications i don't get it so then i invested in some other funds like people were like professionally investing in crypto and that did well but like the whole time i was like a skeptic in terms of like is this ever going to produce any applications that i give a [ __ ] about clearly it's produced something people find valuable but like is it going to produce any applications especially like a high throughput one like twitch and so it was only about a year ago where i kind of discovered nfts i had actually invested in nft companies before but mostly because they were started by smart friends of mine but like i was still a skeptic right i know i was i love that you're like i was a skeptic so i was buying bitcoin in 2013 and then i was invested through these funds but i understand what you're saying because you're so at the heart of this world i'm at the heart of like tech and so i'm like i have all these you know you when you see smart people doing something you're like you want to be invested in it you know yeah so that's my that's my philosophy so i'm like okay smart people are doing this thing i don't get it but i want to be invested that's always been my philosophy and i've to be honest i made a lot of money that way so like here i'm like okay i i finally am like but like a year ago i finally things clicked for me and i was like oh you can actually make a hike through a throughput application and some of these technologies some of these l2s or solana that like actually works like you know like it works for the user and um and then i kind of got red pulled into crypto as a way to motivate a community kind of like we were talking about with the social on the social side like if you you can distribute the value of a project to a large group of people and they are they have that additional incentive to ape in um in it additionally to whatever they want to do with that core application right so to me that was like very interesting as a motivation and i had i had actually nfti's my youtube videos uh like this about a year ago and sold them on you know and i raised about 30 000 dollars in eth on on uh the openc and i was like oh this is interesting like people want to support you know me and uh so that paid for my channel like i was you know kind of paying out of pocket for this channel like as was hobbies so then i like monetized my youtube channel and i was like oh this is interesting and i kind of forgot about energies for a while to be honest i invested in openc actually a little bit and then i like you know obviously that was really good but then um i kind of forgot about nfgs and then at the end of the open c was y combinator wasn't it that was a y yeah that's right okay so then at the end in like eight months later i'm like you know one of my friends was like hey we should do something in crypto so he was we were brainstorming ideas he was like really into solana nfts and he was like so and if these are really interesting salon is interesting and i was like well the obvious thing to me that's going to happen is gaming nfts because there's already this long-standing tradition of people spending tons of money you know tens of billions of dollars a year for in-game assets you know on free fire on fortnight um in you know counter-strike like all these you know all these different games and so putting them on a blockchain is kind of like a really you know to me it seemed obvious it didn't doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that step out you know the people it's the hard part is like getting people to spend on something that's like a digital asset in my opinion so then uh that's kind of what got the got it started and we started working on fractal shortly thereafter in i guess it was like december end of november like november end of november you know cool so we're gonna we'll definitely get to fractal and of course i think the the the ping that i think is probably going off in a lot of people's heads is solana which i want to talk about why you've kind of decided to go in on solana via fractal and other pieces but before we get there i want to kind of stay on this just gaming nfts as a concept in general because i'm not a gamer but i'm on twitter enough and i'm on like you know blockchain twitter enough to know that there's tremendous like pushback and hatred of nfts from the gaming community so i've like kind of read a bit and picked the brains of friends of mine who are into gaming to understand that but i'd love to start with just hearing from you why do gamers hate ft so badly i think that people are always afraid of things that are new you know it's kind of like why people have hated cr on crypto that's a localized example of why people have hated on crypto this whole time like you know there's some amount of like this doesn't make any sense to me i don't like i haven't really bothered to like figure it out i like feel like other people are making money on what seems like a scam so there's like that element and then with gaming it's like there's a lot of examples of people [ __ ] on the new technology in gaming like this is exactly like i'm old enough that like i've seen this movie before which is why i'm like not that worried about it and i find it kind of hilarious it's like if you go back to 20 2008 when free to play came out like games started releasing for free right and then they would monetize by selling you [ __ ] in the game like levels or the characters or whatever everybody was like this is all the gamers all the traditional classic console gamers like these games [ __ ] suck they're a scam like i don't want to pay over time like i want to just pay up front like you know i don't want to be nickeled and died and so like that was like the resounding message from the gaming community and then of course fast forward 14 years and now like the biggest games in the world are free to play games and that's the predominant business model of gaming i think this is exactly the same way where people don't really get crypto they don't see why they they don't understand why they might want it and so they're pushing back against it and there's a lot of you know like kind of misinterpretation or like misunderstandings about how it works and so you know people are pushing back against it and so people are like it's bad for the environment or it's a scam where it's like like the games are terrible like you know you hear all the same things basically as like free to play yeah and so that's sort of the sense i'm getting is is as i've talked to folks are like you know somebody was giving me the example of like when diablo three i i'm parroting this so if i screw this up know that i don't i don't know this natively but like you know tried to put in-game assets sort of on a marketplace outside of there and the community freaked out and felt like they were being like scammed and like you know that there's this really really deep seated just disdain for all of this stuff and mistrust of all this stuff what do you think it takes to overcome those hurdles or those ops like is it just time or how does this play out so that eventually it becomes yeah i think it's time you have to see some games that people actually want to play right at the end of the day if there's a game that people are like that looks like a sick game my friend likes it i want to play it and it turns out like it's a blockchain game like are you gonna care like is that gonna make you stop not play the game i don't think so not for most people i think people are gonna try and they're gonna be like oh this is great and it turns out oh i like you know bought this stuff in game or i like earn some stuff in game and then now i have like the ability to like swap it out for some digital currency when i want to like play the next game or whatever they're gonna be into it you know yeah i don't i'm gonna put you on the spot here so we can cut this out because i know you may have a conflict of interest that make you not want to answer this but like do you think that game exists now on blockchain like are there blockchain games where you're like this is an awesome enough experience in and of itself that like this will this will get everyone into it i think there are a bunch that are coming so you know when we started with fractal we basically interviewed all of like i mean it's the same thing it's exactly like free to play like the first free to play games were like mafia wars and farmville right they were not like and the gaming community was like farmville is not a game yeah exactly and so the first blockchain games are like a lot of them look like d5 rappers right with like some graphics and so people are like this is not fun you know this is not that great and obviously the motivation to play a lot of these d5 kind of games is more on the uh economic side right like it's cause like oh maybe this is like gonna make some money or something i don't think that's the like natural resting point of uh games i think most mostly games will be played for fun and then there will be a very small economic component of it um but like you know what what i saw when we started fractal was we went and talked to like every gaming company that we could find every founder of a gaming company or or people are building gaming uh video games and and there's what we found was like there are tons of like aaa developers who are moving into the space but for them they like it takes a long time to make a game you know it takes a year or two and they uh you know there's a lot of investment that goes into it and they most of them didn't want to like just sell a shitton of nfts upfront and then make the game like two years later they wanted to like you know they're actually building it and then they're gonna do maybe if they do an nft sale would be much closer to like when the game actually launches so i think what we're seeing is like it's gonna happen but most of the really good games are in development right now you know so and you talk about these aaa game developers who it sounds like are leaving these aaa game studios to enter this world and start something new so this gets back to this like trojan horse versus like burn it down question which is for these existing aaa game studios that are incredibly successful with the models that they currently use and seemingly would be losing out on income in some capacity were they to switch to a more nft integrated blockchain sort of model where do you think those go like what is the future for aaa gaming or game studios and blockchain yeah so i think you know obviously some of them who have tried to like ape into the blockchain have been there's been severe pushback right oh yeah just like i think if they you know 10 years ago they were like or 12 years ago they would be like we're going free to play like there would be pushback uh i think what's going to happen is they're going to go oh no we can't threaten our existing business model our existing revenue so they'll like wait and see what happens and then there will be some new entrants that are very successful in blockchain and eventually they'll be like okay we're gonna bite the bull and we're gonna just do it you know like look at mobile games right like mobile games when it started off people were like oh there's a novelty whatever and most of the early mobile game studios were new entrants were startups right because they had nothing to lose but now like you know ea's fifa or call of duty or something like that those are huge you know mobile uh game platforms like mobile game you know uh mobile games with a huge player base and so what's gonna happen is eventually the aaa studios are gonna ape in it's just gonna take some time for them to see how much like you'll have yeah league of legends and all these games will eventually incorporate nfts in in a later stage is that right i think it could be existing properties it could also be new properties by those okay i guess that's sort of my question is like you know so these game studios they're new at some point the new games they make will be called blockchain and nft integrated and native and the legacy games may may or may not ever go yeah may or may not i don't think i think it's kind of like a semantic distinction right like okay the big the aaa studios will eventually be you know incorporating blockchain into their business model because i think it's just a better model for users and for the game studios themselves here's a question because i've been thinking about there's i feel like there's maybe a distinction but what i'm going to maybe ask is maybe there's not between like play to earn like i feel like what you when people think of like blockchain gaming they think of play to earn they think of an axe infinity right where they're the game is sort of leading with this is supposed to be making you money which i think is like creates a lot of pushback in and of itself and people are like oh then you're not optimizing for fun but it feels like the bulk of what we're going to see are like just games that also happen to be something where you can earn money like all they will all be play to earn in the sense that you're going to own these assets that may have you know some sort of account correct is that how you see this playing out and like where do you see kind of the future of this play to earn is that something yeah i'm gonna be using in the future i think that's 100 right like if you you know 20 years ago i was buying world of warcraft gold on like you know you know on ebay and so like some guy was like his job job right but his job was like to farm that gold or like run a probably a group of people who were farming that goal and then they'd sell it on ebay it was just not facilitated at all by like it was made more difficult by the game environment he had to like log on and like meet me somewhere in the world and like transfer it versus like actually just being able to do it in a more streamlined programmable way like but that still existed but most of the players of world of warcraft like 99 of them were like doing it for fun and then like maybe one percent of them are probably less we're doing it for economic reasons right and i think the balance looks a lot more like that where most players are playing games for fun maybe some people are like doing things in this game world to like that people don't want to do for economic reasons but that's like that's fine right like that's just kind of like they're creating like liquidity and like in in the in the market of this game but um i think that's the ultimate end point because most people want to play games for fun you know and so i think we'll see these games be look like the other thing that exists right now is like a lot of people are buying it for more speculative reasons where like there's this hope that the game the assets the game will appreciate over time but i don't think that's actually necessary for the games to incorporate blockchain and have see value from that right i think it's much more about the open and program like the true ownership and then the game economies being open and programmable so other people can build experiences on top of those nfts or digital economies that's what's going to make these things happen during value versus like the price always goes up you know yeah we're i i'm excited to hit that phase because we are like in such a just deeply speculative phase with all everything to do with blockchain and it'll be exciting when we start moving into actually like buying this stuff and there's some of this happening of course right now i mean i think it's happening in ethereum right now right like yeah like ethereum has been flat i mean there's huge volatility obviously but it's been like mostly flat for the last year but people still buy [ __ ] tons of stuff in ethereum and use it to do all sorts of like uh smart contracts right so like that to me is like um you know ethereum's value has transcended just like holding it for speculative purposes to see it rise yeah yeah it's cool for me to hear you talk about buying the gold world of warcraft gold on ebay because i actually saw like a very anti-nfts and gaming thread that was like using that as an example of like and see like nfts actually have no use and like there's no point of them because you can already do these things that they're saying you do and it's like it just does them easier right like which is like half of you know like new businesses are just like some of them are completely revolutionary and most of them are like improvements on an old system that also existed yeah in a preview if you keep you know create an open and programmable environment people will be able to do things that you didn't know could exist like world of warcraft is like the iphone before there was an app store and like you know and there was an open sdk right like we would have been limited to the like i don't know six apps that steve jobs thought were important like compass and timer or whatever right like but it turns out when you just like open up all these things in api then someone can invent uber or doordash or you know instacart or you know the million other apps that exist out there and so obviously that unlocked a huge amount of economic value both for consumers and also for the for the iphone itself you know apple itself so you could think about this the same way it's like yeah i can log into world of warcraft or whatever game you know fortnite or something or probably a counter-strike would be an example because you can trade skins and counter-strike and i could trade this stuff myself but if you make it open and programmable like think of all the things people can do they can create like a lending marketplace they can create a borrowing marketplace they could create you know people they're gonna be people who like create whole businesses of like lending this digital stuff um and there's stuff that i haven't even thought of like much cooler than that but like it's just to me it's very obvious that open programmable environments create a lot of economic value on top of them ethereum being like a very great you know easy example well and you're sort of making me think i i'll ask you about this i don't know if you followed this the nft worlds project um yeah and you know that's building sort of using minecraft do you have any thoughts on that or like you know where you think that ends up i think it's cool you know i mean i don't know i you know i don't have a strong thesis on like all these digital lands obviously there's a digital lands lands grab where like everyone's trying to create the digital land that everybody uses and then sell like these spaces in digital land and to be honest i don't have any idea what's going to work you know i do think like i do think there's going to need to be a lot more utility in this digital land than like just owning it so you know we're gonna see like land is valuable right in the real world because you can do all sorts of [ __ ] with it so i i i'm waiting for the utility i think but there's you know people people are creating digital land obviously and it's like um obviously people are buying into it to be early so yeah i think there's definitely going to be something there like if you think about like sorry one last thing i'll say is like if you think about like like it's almost obvious that there will be utility in digital land if people are hanging out in digital spaces right it's like you're the ability to like control what happens in those digital spaces in some way like even if it's just like advertising some [ __ ] is like gonna be valuable because people's time and being a certain space is valuable and so um you know i just don't know how that's going to evolve or what that's going to look like or what digital lands are going to be valuable at all yeah the the nft world thing i was going to say and i think it does tell us what you're saying right like the the appeal there is it feels like a lower barrier to entry than some of these like the sandbox or whatever because it's a it's a world that people are already used to kind of building on and programming on to some extent and it already has all these users who sort of understand how that works so you're making these tweaks that i don't fully understand around how you're making it like a metaverse blockchain etc but like just intuitively there's a certain amount of okay people already understand this that's also your downside right like you know you have maybe this first mover advantage but like anybody else can now also do this so i think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out in theory i think you can build utility onto that faster than maybe the sandbox has managed to seem to do but i don't know it'll be all tracking it in real time you know everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eat on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their default goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon okay let's get into fractal why don't you give the overview of fractal and then we'll we'll dive in sure so fractal is an nft marketplace for gaming assets so users can buy sell and trade gaming assets on on our marketplace at fractal.is and we just launched it in the end of december so it's been live for a couple months and now it's you know people are games are are dropping primary mints on our site and then we have the secondary marketplace as well and you also would appear sort of have you have like a native token and i say token and i think these are erc721s is that right that are these fractals they're okay we have so we we have a uh nft collection that we dropped to our users about 100 000 fractal nfts and they are different special snowflakes that are like floating around the metaverse with different attributes and people are building experiences on top of these nfds um the nfcs help you you know kind of reward you if you're holder of one of our nfts you get rewards on our marketplace as well so like you get access to certain white lists and stuff like that um so they're kind of like integrated with fractal itself and then there's also you know other third parties that are creating experiences on top of the fractal nfd and when you say other third parties are creating experiences on top of that meaning i'm another gain and a fractal nft will have a use case in my game yeah like a lot of them are you know cosmetic or you access to certain levels or some you know even a white list in their game or something like that like the simplest cases of people giving like benefits like hey you get to join our game alpha early you know stuff like that but other people are building games on top of fractal nft you know like they're building you know different kinds of games where if you're holding a fractal nft you get something in the game yeah and so there's sort of these two different categories then that exists there's something like a fractal which is like a totally interoperable cross game intended to work in many different games and then you have is it true then that there's a then there's a there's a series of tokens right or a game can drop can do their nft launch on your platform that are that are not interoperable that sort of function within that game obviously they yeah it's an open marketplace system but it's not you're not switching those over to another game that's right so like you know it's an nfc collection so people are dropping you know their nft collection that's designed to function in their game as like a character or a land or an item or something like that and they're dropping them on uh their own they're you know they're dropping them in their you know on fractal as like a primary mint but then they and they sell on fractal but they're not you know other people could the cool thing about an open and programmable internet and the fact that all these nfts are on the blockchain is like if i was a game developer and i want to incorporate someone else's nfts like i obviously could allow holders of that nft to crucial benefit my game you know just like uh looks rare said like anyone who's like an open c user we can just airdrop tokens to them right because it's all like open and so so there is like you know they are interoperable in a sense that it's like an asset on the internet but they're not necessarily designed for interoperability and you chose to build on solana i alluded to this earlier you talked about how you had a friend getting really into solana nfts i mean you know that's sort of controversial there's all this you know there's there's uh well i don't know rivalry you could call it obviously between different chains why did you decide to go with solana well i mean at the end of the day like we want to be wherever the gaming companies are and i i think they're split you know some game companies are choosing solana some are choosing polygons i'm just using immutable acts i don't i you know i don't have a i have my own technical opinions i guess but like i want to be wherever the gaming companies are so eventually we'll support other chains where you know where there's games um i don't really you know i think it's kind of funny that there's so much tribalism in yeah yeah yeah it changed i don't really like uh subscribe to that soup that much but like i'm like more of a i guess a web 2.0 technologist where i'm like okay just use whatever's the best tool for the job if i was obviously there's now an economic incentive to believe what the best tool is so you know whatever but like my personal belief is like i we just chose salon for a couple reasons to start with one is um you know close to this team at solana my uh co-founder was really into solana my our ceo david you know he was like super into solana and then i think as an engineer i was like well if i was starting a game this is probably the platform that i would want to use because of like at least for high transaction throughput things um and so those were some of the reasons why we like started off with solana but like i think there's a lot to be said from for these other platforms too so like what we're not we're not seeing like we're seeing people start games on all different platforms yeah do you you know the the main criticism i think that people give toward first lana of course is the centralization piece and for like the people who are like deeply web3 like you know drinking that kool-aid deep in that ethos like i feel like that's the pushback you get with solana do you worry about that uh well i think it's a compromise on security yeah i think there's progressive amounts of decentralized there's you know decentralization versus centralization is not binary right there's more there's different progressive amounts of decentralization that you probably and it's like a risk tolerance like how much do you want to trust a central authority for what application use right like if you're moving if you're no if you're holding like like millions of dollars you you might want something that's like as decentralized as just bitcoin or ethereum yeah i'm actually staying with andrew yang who wants to come say hi to you what's up brother yo what's up i haven't seen you forever andrew holy [ __ ] man your hair got logged uh speaker coming out of the speakers so amazing brother good to see you man are you in puerto rico right now yeah i'm in puerto rico right now you look like asian jesus that's that's that's the look when did you guys first meet each other at least a few years we hung out in the bay area what is that freaking 2017 2017 or something like that yeah kind of he was telling me he was going to run for president and then then boom it's like years later now you're like you're like the most famous asian american thanks bro yes you are no i think you are i think you are it's amazing you know carly was higher number three on the campaign that's why we're oh i'm tired number five but i'll take number three whatever who are the others [Laughter] what are you doing in puerto rico um mainly just chilling uh you know we're doing a little bit of web 3 stuff because it's like a hub for that um oh yeah i saw you were at eat denver right yeah yeah yeah it's a good time robin just texted me today where where do you hang your hat mostly brother yeah mostly sonoma county but i'm you know i'm out in uh miami visiting him one you know because we're working together like pretty often twice a year maybe so between sonoma and miami huh and la i'm in l.a a lot actually i just rented a house there yeah well it's good fun man i miss you it's been way too long let's have a schedule uh in in real life no i'm in sf periodically i'm going to be in la for bill maher at the end of this month so um yeah i'll ping you i'd love to get together it's been way too long i you know get occasional updates from robin yeah i'll let you get back to it cool be good yeah later a nice cameo okay so you're talking solana ultimately a decision that came down to all right if i was building a game what would i build on i know you probably hate this this line of questioning because you are like look ultimately we're going to be chain agnostic and we want to build for a whole bunch of different chains but because i do feel like there's a lot of curiosity about this i know imx is making a big play on gaming and a big push on gaming when you talk about sort of the throughput and the scalability like right now in your estimation it feels like solana's just better able to handle the amount of transactions that go on if you're playing a game with nfts in it like i'm you can tell i'm not i'm not technically uh savvy enough to fully know how it's going down but look i think there's lots of options like imx is a good one like obviously they have gods unchained it's like working they have like transactions like a lot of transactions on that game so like i don't wanna i think there's like lots of different ways that you can do it and i'm not i guess i really don't wanna be like i know all these guys are all great there are a lot of great teams and i'm not trying to say oh you should check pick solana you should pick imx you should pick you know uh polygon like i think there's like lots of reasons why one team might pick one versus the other and i think there's no clear person who's going to dominate and get like 99 market share yet so you have multiple options when you choose to fly we're so pleased that you went with delta today or whatever right like you'll see exactly so i don't think there there's you know i don't think there's a clear uh company that's like the one that where everything is going to go to or not company but platform so this is also sort of in the vein of me not being super technically savvy yeah you know i'm now at the point where i understand for example when we're talking about nfts the art itself is not often actually on chain right like the art itself is on ipfs and the smart contract has a pointer that takes you there or in in some cases it's on aws or whatever so when we talk about blockchain gaming what's actually on shane like what are we actually talking about there yeah so there's that's a good question because so technically most of the assets are not on chain mostly you're like getting a pointer maybe there's an image on chain right that represents a model or something like that but when you when this you know the wallet is loaded in the game this pointer actually is translated not just to an image but to you know a set of data that represents like a model or a you know like a 3d model that's used in the game it's also like some attributes or whatever right like then the fact is that like a company generally is making this centralized client that can interpret that data however they want so like what do you actually own you really own a pointer that like says you own this thing right like now there's people who are trying to build blockchains for gaming that will like store all this data on a chain and that's pretty cool i think because it makes it more interoperable with you know it makes it more programmable more interoperable um but that's like not how most of this works right now so there is a you know i think all this question marks around digital art where it's like oh but it's on aws and what happens if that guy starts paying for the aws that like applies here you know those questions apply here and and what we're talking about really is like you know when i'm my character running around in a game that running around like a lot of those interactions are typical games but then oh i just earned a sword or i just unlocked a pack of loot it's those assets that are on chain with this whole asterisk caveat that it functions like the call it pf which is that it's usually a pointer so that it will more of that become like will that running activity like does it make sense do we want is there a value to that being like an on chain you know i it depends like a lot of these things do not you know i mean i think it's um the cost of putting something on chain is like non-trivial right even on solana so like you know it depends on is there value in storing that on chain and i think the answer is there's probably like items and characters and assets you know core assets that people and you know money and gold or whatever on these games that people want to store on chain because there's value in having a immutable ledger of like who owns what but then there's like you know other things that happen in the game that probably are like not as important to kind of track in an immutable way you know there's it's that goes back to that question of like centralization versus decentralization these gaming clients are going to track some information about the players and like have some data about the players that are not necessarily going to be completely exposed in an open way right and it's like do you trust that game to like represent it correctly like implicitly you're trusting the game someone because you need them to render these assets you know to like create something for that uses all this [ __ ] to you can play and experience right so it's uh i think it's you know it's more nuanced than just like it's decentralized or centralized or it's on chain it's not on chain it's that sliding scale you know with sort of everything um this is probably an obvious question but there's a chance there's an interesting answer so i'm going to ask it which is why build a game specialized marketplace why not why wouldn't somebody go to any of the other solana marketplace on art or some other sort of solana marketplace where there's also a gaming tab and and why sort of build a white make it your niche well i think it's kind of like twitch you know or steam is another example there were download marketplaces that were you know inclusive of gaming but also had like everything else the one that exists today steam that people know about there's um you know with twitch it's like there was youtube live you know and there were like other ways to go live you know but twitch was for something specific and obviously you know when you focus on a certain demographic especially gaming you can you know tailor your feature set marketing and community to a specific use case and oftentimes that's better for discovery of and of that thing you know so like twitch like why do you need a site that's just for gaming it's like well it turns out there's a lot of gaming culture people have this expectation of discovering a certain kind of content there uh it creates its you know there's its own like culture and memes and vibe like emerge and um that's enough to like sustain a specific site and i've never started a business myself but one of the things as i have friends who've done so or whatever like a common early set of feedback is is to narrow your target audience right like you know with twitch being like just anything we'll stream on here probably doesn't get off the ground the same way that tailoring it towards gaming did but then you see now like you know djs are streaming on twitch and there's like some weird-only fans like adjacent stuff now happening on twitch like twitch has expanded into people streaming beyond gaming but by having that really sort of targeted focus you know yeah we grew it exactly that's exactly right so i mean my there's already open c right like open like i don't think creating another uh open c is gonna like work right so you have to well how how good is it how well does your openc competitor work cause i don't know i think there's a lot of appetite for it no but yeah okay maybe i mean that could be i'm kidding i'm kidding for me like it's like very obvious that there could be a gaming verticalized uh play that serves people in a different way there's like could be gaming specific features i think the features you want when you're like buying art and browsing art is different from the features you want when you're you know buying gaming assets and exploring gaming games so i uh yeah you're having conversations with people building blockchain games i'm imagining on a nearly daily basis or at least very regularly and you're clearly have had conversations with some really incredible game developers coming from the aaa gaming world we're now in this space are there one or two takeaways or things you're particularly excited about or things you've learned that folks might be interested in hearing who are not getting to have these conversations i guess you know i don't know if we don't remember if we cover this but like there's so many good projects on the horizon like that if you you know i feel like i have like a telescope and i can see them because i'm talking to these people and i'm like they're i've seen previews and i'm like oh this is actually like this is gonna be a thing like i think i have much more faith that this space is gonna be durable and going to be a real thing because i see all these projects coming and a lot of people who are looking at the current projects are like we don't care like they're not interesting enough whatever so i mean that's probably my why i'm so excited you know for folks who want to make some money off of that do you have any advice for people like where they should be hanging out or what they should be doing to kind of capitalize on this moment in nft gaming yeah it's probably like i guess if you're focused on you know i don't i i'm not really into this space because of the speculative aspects of your caveat with where it's like okay this is a great way to make money i think that like that probably ability you know that probably goes down as more people enter the space and because it's with you know it's it's um because it's gaming like i think that that the goal here is like i think that games could be the way that the next hundred million users on board and crypto and so i think there are going to be a huge influx of people i don't necessarily think this is a durable strategy to make money and i don't really condone like yoloing nfts is like the primary way to like make money but like okay that being said like if you were trying to figure out where's the alpha like what i would think is like like you know you should be figuring out where are where do i find it's kind of like venture investing right you're like choosing projects i think even more than art even more than any you know nfts that are like more pfps or art like where it's more like one and done they like launch this thing and then it's out there you know now those projects are starting to say okay we have road maps whatever here they really do have to have a road map because like the game has to like show up and exist for this thing to be valuable and so i think it's really about finding the teams and looking you know who are the great teams and how do i like participate in like amazing teams and so i think the way that you find that is kind of like how you find any venture investments you know you're talking to people where in the industry you're trying to like be helpful to the you know gaming potential gaming teams you know if you're just on online maybe you don't have access you're like you know you're trying to be in alpha groups or people talking about which games are like by what teams and like learn more and so a lot of what we focus on with fractal because we think we people want to like have knowledge about who they back we spend a lot of time giving people more access to information about the games that are on fractal so we do like a podcast called fractal radio with the founders we're trying to dig into like who are the founders of these games what's their experience you know we're um we're doing a lot more on the kind of diligent side and i think that's you know fractal itself fractal community we bring them in our discord we do amas with them that's like a good place to learn about these games obviously i'm biased there but like you know in general i would be in their discords doing research trying to figure out who's behind the project are these founders credible can they make a game are they gonna make something durable it also strikes me that there's the angel investing comparison in the sense that like or you know like vc investing comparison which is that like most things won't hit but if you happen upon the thing that does you know like it more than compensates for that that doesn't hit do you see this as being similar like even just like yeah for sure projects et cetera you know this is a highly speculative risky way to allocate capital right like i don't even know if i would call it an investment right like so yeah you know you're yes you are you know i it's one of the the reason why people are interested in this is because you know you can have elluvian being worth i don't even know what it is now but like billions of dollars right and and some of these companies be worth billions of dollars even sometimes before they've really shipped the full experience and so um obviously and with with liquidity right so like obviously that pays for a lot of like yellowing into like games that don't ship or rugs or things that like suck so um i think that's why the dynamic of the market has existed as it is today you see a ton of profit chasing in this space right recklessly people are just trying to catch the next thing that's going to 1500 percent you know go up or whatever the case may be and i think it was in one of your youtube videos or you sort of said this publicly that like you sold twitch for just shy of a billion dollars and for so many people you know that's what they think their dream is or what they think they're trying to do is just accumulate as much wealth as possible and you said that you it didn't like you weren't suddenly like euphorically happy like your life in some ways didn't like change radically after you had this sort of huge exit and that for you was really finding more intrinsic happiness versus these extrinsically motivating factors can you say a little bit on that because i think it's such an important thing to keep in mind for so many people who are in this space right like everyone you know is like out there like especially the people who are buying this stuff a lot of like gen z you know younger people in their 20s or early 30s they're like yellowing these things everybody has a friend who made hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars on like nfts or something like that or wall street bets [ __ ] coins trading whatever like and and so like there's a lot of fomo and i think that's like kind of you know embedded in this generation through social media too and so you know it's even more exacerbated maybe than on when i was like starting out but um and so consequently you have all these people who are like they really want to make it super bad that's like the most important thing in their life and that was what it was like for me you know i had like all of these hang-ups about like i want to make it i want to be like the man the super successful entrepreneur whatever it was like my whole ego and identity and when i did you know we end up selling twitch and people were like oh my god you're the crazy good entrepreneur like i got all this validation that i thought i wanted and i did want you know i did want but then you know like that becomes your new normal and uh pretty soon thereafter i was like looking at my other friends who started airbnb dropbox and being like oh i didn't do good enough like i have other friends who are like the founders of coinbase or like reddit or you know like all these other companies and so you know it never ends it's like a treadmill like if you're looking for external validation to fulfill you there will always be something else and yeah like i had money and i could like obviously financial security but the thing is i had it beforehand i was like you know we were even ever since i had been paying myself you know like just even like a reasonable salary like it wasn't after the first couple years it wasn't like super scarce right and then like it didn't really change right like we so what happens is your lifestyle just generally creeps up to like however much money you have and then you have all the same worries or problems that you did before you know and so i just think that the human condition is to be on this you know the natural state of being a human being is to have this hedonic treadmill and to always want more because we evolved in this world in a world where you know you didn't have a lot right like scarcity was a real thing like now today in the modern world most people in america if you're listening to this podcast about like flipping cryptos and nfts like you're pretty good you're doing good like compared to all human humans who've ever existed 100 billion humans that ever existed if you're listening to the podcast you're probably in the top one percent and so like you know but it's it's it's human nature to be like have that scarcity mindset and be like i don't have enough and i want more and that can be all-encompassing and the problem is like that just that it doesn't really lead you to any lasting happiness you know intrinsic happiness comes from their happiness really comes durable happiness i should say it comes from having like intrinsic motivation and fulfilling your intrinsic needs and you know we talk about that for a lot actually it's my favorite topic but like you know i think that's that's something people think about very much well i have to ask the follow-up which is like how how have you found that intrinsic motivation i know we're coming up on time but i feel like this is like a very good yeah what we end up leaving people with i feel like it's a beautiful ending to like what has what have you found to be helpful on that front well so the funny thing right is that all these people are like well justin you're just doing the same [ __ ] you were doing before you're like starting companies you're investing in companies you're like flipping nfts whatever you know so like i mean there's like a people i have had friends be like so what like you're nothing changed for you right like enough but it's but the thing is like i used to do all the things that i like i am doing from a scarcity mindset whereas like i need to win i don't have enough if i like i need to be the best i need to like have people know who i am i need to like they need to like retweet my tweets on twitter or whatever you know and today i'm like i just do all the things i do i just think of i filter everything through like what gives me joy like what do i love to do what do i love to do every day so like if i'm making content on social media i just make the content that i like to make and hopefully it helps someone and i don't know if i just put it out there i'm not as obsessed about like how is it growing did it like perform well or whatever when i'm starting a company i'm like okay what are the parts that i love to do like i love to mentor people i love to be the evangelist i love to like learn about new ideas and sell new ideas and so i just focus on those things and i partner with other entrepreneurs you know my co-founders who maybe handle the parts that like i don't like to do as much and so i just like really focus every day i'm like filtering everything i'm doing through like does this give me joy do i love to do it and then i just try to do those things and generally i'm like way happier and i'm not so obsessed like fractal i think it's a good idea i think it could be a big company but it doesn't have to be in some way i don't really give a [ __ ] like it's like i just i'm having fun i'm working on with people who i really like a team i really like and i think we have a shot and i'm gonna work and i'm actually working really hard but i'm working hard because i'm having fun with it you know yeah so there's two things there's two different directions i want to go and sort of in closing uh do you have a few more minutes i know i'm taking i'm over your time so the in terms of the long-term hope for fractal and actually there's a couple things i want to say here obviously becomes a prominent marketplace for nft gaming i'm assuming you know expands maybe to include other chains games etc is it what's the um like marketplace fee two percent on the second area yeah okay um is there anything like you know is there anything there that you're like in five years this is our vision or you know is there sort of anything in particular you want to highlight in terms of that that future vision for fractal and then i have a quick follow-up on that yeah so i think what we want to do like it's the same strategy as twitch and i've been pretty public about this like with twitch we went to the streamers and we said we're going to focus on making it the best possible thing for the streamers and how like because they're creating the content so how do we support the streamers as best as possible and we went above and beyond we went outside the box for streamers like we would help set up their computers we would help we'd take them out like at parties like in all these like gaming conferences we would just like i remember for one streamer who wanted a ferrari in his music videos doing for youtube like we found a ferrari for him you know we were just like you were doing that like community first approach before it became quite as like buzzy and known as today that's right that's right it was like completely community for first because there was already youtube right there was already all these other competitors so we were like we have to be the best friend of the streamer today it's the same thing but for the game company it's like we want to be the best friend for game companies so like when we help game companies for mints we're like helping them calculate their you know we have a uh particle physicist uh at our actually a mathematical physicist sorry it's a there's a distinction i don't know what it is but there's a distinction and he's like he's he's like helping calculate rarities for them right like or um when they want to figure out their community launch strategy like i have my community team lead he'll like do free consultations for these guys like help them figure out like how how to do a calendar on their like launch or like i'll you know we i do these fractal radio episodes with these with the game creators to like highlight who they are and like that's fun for me and so we're just doing like anything and everything we can to like be supportive of these game uh publishers game developers game creators and i think if we have done a good job in five years we're the company that's known for that we're the best friend of blockchain game companies hopefully the space has become something you know but like we're we're their best friend and like that's what everyone in the industry knows and we built tools and processes and a partnership team that really drives that and then you know one of the things that struck me that you said earlier about twitch is if you'd built it in a web3 way you probably wouldn't have been able to sell it i don't think that same dynamic applies here right because this is actually sort of a centrally owned dynamic much like an open c is like it's a marketplace yeah so i i think like this is a potentially like something that can have an exit correct that that's right as it is okay yes okay do you think though broadly ever like i've said this multiple times in this podcast like one of the things that i i find scary is cause sometimes people tell me like i drop an nft for the podcast or this not i'm like i have no interest in doing that for multiple reasons at least right now in my life one because i don't think i actually have particular value to add or something special to do via an nft the other thing is like it's like a forever commitment like that's not like we have yet to see the exit path for teams that start nfts right like maybe some of these you know you've got board apes or um cool cats or like i don't know some of these that may be considered blue chips that perhaps are so lasting that they will be able to change hands over time and it'll become a brand like supreme and the ceo can change but like we haven't seen that yet how do you think about that how do you think that evolves this like sort of just foreverness seemingly of i think start this project i mean i think forever is a long time and like we haven't really seen whether any of these things are durable at all right like yes they're going to be on this blockchain but it doesn't mean that you're like desperately going to be working on them or maybe like the community took it over or like you don't know what's going to happen with with them with the case of fractal it is a centralized company but like there are you know parts like this nft collection that we've decentralized and like that are owned by this community and um you know i have the advantage of being on the other side of like a pretty big exit where it's like nothing changed really for me i mean it was like i so i'm not particularly interested in like building a company to sell it you know i'm i'm interested in building a company that solves a need and kind of builds a community in a very durable way and i think that my interest what i like about this space is i can see it being this like you know kind of like this ecosystem and of of games and gamers um for a long time to come and so i guess like i'm not really interested in selling it at all you know i mean it's just my decision though we have like other co-founders yeah of course well and this i guess will circle me back to the the second sort of track or point i was wanted to make after i heard what you said um because i i think there's a another component here which is you see these people hustling and wanting to make it and and putting a lot of value on making it but i worry that in this space it's also in like the least durable healthy way which is like 99 call it 100 of the people who bought board apes and are now like multi-millionaires like hadn't had no idea like you could not have predicted that that was going to become what it did right and like to put like i think satisfaction can come from actually building something and you can also build something in ways like where you feel really mentally unhealthy and where like it is just about the status etc but there's also something i think really awesome about what you did and i i i worry about people here who feel have the inverse right they feel bad about themselves because they didn't make those millions of dollars and you're like so much of what's happening right now in this space in particular is wild luck is even more luck than starting you know who's gonna old yeah yeah completely completely um and i i feel like that's always a good reminder for folks who because it's just you everybody feels falls prey to feeling like they're not making enough for their you know they're not earning enough in the space as you watch everyone on twitter kind of like dominate yeah 100 i mean that's the human condition i could tell people that but i can be like look it doesn't matter at the end of the day but most of people like when someone told me that when i was 22 or 23 or whatever i was like [ __ ] you like i don't believe and some of that's good right because that it drives you right like you know and you wouldn't be where you were today had you not had that angst exactly it's not good or bad it just is what it is and so like you know what i'd say to people out there is like yeah you can you can worry a ton you can grind your you know yourself to the bone to like make it and you some of you probably will and that's you know that you'll see for yourself all along it didn't really matter that much and so um you know but people people have to like like some lessons they you got to learn yourself do you meditate i meditate every day you know yeah that's see that's the that's like i think the real answer to all of this exactly and someday i will stress myself out enough that i will become a regular meditator and in the meantime i just ride the waves my emotional waves well awesome justin i really appreciate this is there anything you feel like we didn't cover anything else we should chat about anything else
