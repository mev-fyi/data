what makes me angry is for people to say things like oh there are hundreds of Banks insolvent and it's hyperinflation time and the system is coming crashing down and there's no hope and buy Bitcoin right that that's what makes me angry uh there are real problems here and this is not helpful right in fact it's actively harmful and that's what I'm speaking out about bankless Nation we're going to get straight into the episode today there's Bank runs and there's rumors of Bank runs going on one side says the banks are insolvent get to the lifeboats another side says the banks are going to be fine and they're sick and tired of the doomers pulling the fire alarm so who's right this is the third episode in a series of conversations we've been having on Bank list and to get the full debate you'll need to listen to the last two on the get the Lifeboat side we had biology srinivasan he said that Bitcoin is going to one million dollars that the dollar is hyperinflating it's probably gonna happen fast like in 90 days fast then we had Arthur Hayes he gave us the Traders perspective he doesn't think it'll happen as quickly as biology but he has the same message get out before it's too late so this is our first episode on the Counterpoint on the gonna be fine side the banks are okay Ben Hunt is giving the counterpoints today there are a few benefits a few takeaways we want you to get out of this episode number one why are the Lifeboat people wrong number two why the banks are actually solvent this is what Ben thinks it's his take number three three why treasuries are still the safest asset in the world number four why Ben thinks hyper Bitcoin and Hyper bitcoinization for the world is actually a really bad thing and number five how Ben thinks we can reform rather than replace the FED that seems to be a theme for this episode there will be links in the show notes to the two previous episodes if you want to get caught up on the debate as it stands there are two other things I want to say before we get into this episode number one tensions are high on this debate there's going to be an inclination to go on personal attacks into question motives I'll remind all of us before we get in that none of us can assess motives we should focus on attacking the argument rather than the person and so I encourage everyone listening to this to approach the arguments on both sides with an open mind and really focus on the arguments rather than descending into personal attacks we see our role at bank list is to present the arguments in the best light our listeners are smart they can make decisions on their own number two David plan to be here but unfortunately he had an emergency he had to attend so it's just just bending myself today guys we're gonna get right to

am super excited to introduce you to Our Guest today once again Ben Hunt he is an investor and the creator of an incredible investor Community called Epsilon Theory he's a several Time bankless guest a a perfect person to have this conversation I think because he's been one of the more outspoken critics against apology srinivasan's 1 million dollar 90 day Bitcoin hyperinflation thesis you think biology of course uh in our episode early this week said that the dollar was going to drop to near zero or at least Bitcoin would be going to a million dollars in short order and I think Ben Hunt is the internet's leading candidate to push back against that theory in that thesis so we are uh happy to have him today Ben welcome to bankless how you doing I'm doing great and it's super to be back here uh with you guys uh always enjoy it so thanks for having me on yeah I think we asked for counterpoints to balaji's thesis because at bank list we want to hear both sides of any arguments that we can sort of make up our minds about this and of course bankless is a you know crypto friendly Community but I also know you Ben to be a crypto friendly I'm individual friendly person I am I am yeah and I I know that because we've spent hours literally on on previous episodes I'm talking about it so um you know that's why this is this is interesting this is not a you know a crypto Villain Like Paul Krugman giving this critique of balaji's uh thesis this is uh somebody who has expressed hey you know there are some use cases for crypto and um I think you've been excited about the things that Bitcoin other cryptocurrencies can do in the past so I'm wondering if you could just as we before we get into the discussion and the Counterpoint to biology give us your crypto credentials a little bit like what are your thoughts on crypto as a technology look I I mean to say that I'm you know a fan of of I think crypto use cases might be going a little too far right I I think that there's you know a a clear use case a wonderful use case Alex glidstv you know has been very prominent on this about you know in uh repressive communities right I mean that it's a it's a wonderful way to or a wonderful way uh really one of the only feasible ways to exit uh those kind of repressive systems uh I think though that my main praise for Bitcoin specifically crypto more generally is that I think that it is elegant and wonderful art and people think that that's a big put down when I say that and it's actually my highest praise art is what inspires us right and and I think that they're I'm I'm very Allied and enthusiastic about and supportive of the ethos as I would describe it of the Bitcoin and larger crypto Community one of self-reliance long time Horizons a mindset of autonomy I think that those are what makes a society worthwhile and vibrant and successful I think that which makes an individual life vibrant and meaningful and successful so that's you know I'm not going to call that my credentials because I I also think that Bitcoin specifically crypto more broadly like any application in finance attracts fraudsters hucksters worse right yeah people I call raccoons and that's my that's what makes me angry that is has what has made me angry about biology right it's that raccoonishness the as Big Daddy would say in uh Cat on a Hot Tin Roof the mendacity just the mendacity right of of the lies the self-interested lies that's not the only thing that makes me angry I have plenty of anger at the system and the perversions of the system but fortunately I think it's possible to walk and chew gum at the same time that we can call out both social and societal inequities and change them or when it's necessary burn it the down I also think we can call out the lying liars and the lies that they tell for their own interests and so I I really think we can accomplish both things and that's why I'm happy to be on uh bankless again so um we'll get to apologies argument in a minute and and certainly I think a lot of bankless listeners will agree that crypto has seen its fair share of raccoons I mean specifically uh 2022 is probably the year of the raccoon wasn't it um that's definitely what we had um I I want to set some context some more to you Ben because um Can can you tell us like you said there are times to burn the system down you said that you are angry at the existing system and I think what you mean is is kind of the FED I remember our last conversation you talked about this idea of Hollow Men Hollow markets Hollow world I think you are in common alignment that something has gone off course in the United States and maybe other Fiat regimes what are your criti peaks of the FED where do you think that U.S monetary policy has gone off course before we get to biology's argument I'd like to hear you on this sure I'll I'll start with this um I think the Federal Reserve saved the world in March of 2009 I think they saved the world uh I think they did in March of 2009 what it's the one job of a central bank the one job of a central bank this is why central banks exist it's not for Price stability it's not for Full Employment their one job is to be that I'll use this word liquidity provider the lender of Last Resort that when the Global Financial system when the heart stops beating I like the Pulp Fiction analogy their job is to come in and get that syringe of adrenaline and put it right into Uma Thurman's heart that's their job and that's what they did in March of 2009 I think that saved the world the the problem was not that shot of adrenaline the problem and this is what always happens with emergency government action it becomes permanent government policy right we move from that shot of adrenaline to get the heart beating again save the world to having a constant IV drip in our arm of you know 14 years of zero interest rate policy that's a horrible mistake and it perverts what good can come out of a Fiat system fractional Reserve Banking and all of that so I have enormous disagreements with the fed and this transition from emergency government action into permanent government policy more broadly speaking and this was the topic we spoke on last time this notion of using of of transforming emergency action into permanent policy sometimes it happens without even the emergency action right so so we were talking about last time was how Alan Greenspan very intentionally not with malice a forethought but certainly intentionally what he decided to do was to use monetary policy to keep interest rates artificially low in order to grow our wealth and I understand why that's politically popular and I understand why that you know why he would go down that path because for a while you can accomplish that you can sin a little bit and not pay a big price but since Greenspan right so we're we're going back to you know the mid 80s now we've been sinning a little bit more and more and more and then with the Great Recession and putting zero interest rate policy as policy as permanent policy we send a lot and so there is absolutely a horrendous imbalance in our system around debt I think that there is a path to believe it or not grow our way out of it I still think that's possible I think the window for that is shrinking and shrinking I can understand people say no I don't think that window is there but what I don't it's not just I don't agree with what makes me angry is for people to say things like oh there are hundreds of Banks insolvent and it's hyperinflation time and the system is coming crashing down and there's no hope and buy Bitcoin right that that's what makes me angry there are real problems here and this is not helpful right in fact it's actively harmful and that's what I'm speaking out about so Ben let's get into the argument so um I think that uh you called the FED there's this in the United States there's this horrendous imbalance around debt and I think a lot of people in crypto see that and would agree with you and I think what what you're here saying is just because the FED is wrong doesn't mean Bitcoin maximalists are right but I want to get into the the argument that's part of what I'm saying if I could just uh that's absolutely part of what I'm saying and I'm saying and I'd love to kind of get a chance to talk about this here I think there is a path forward you know from here that over a very long period of time with enough political will and resolve it can we can get back on a much Sounder footing I hear you we will we will talk about that uh about the way to kind of Reform the fed and get on that sound or footing um there may be some folks coming to this episode that aren't familiar with apologies argument now uh I mentioned the outset that we did release another episode of biology earlier this week it's hour and a half long episode or so you guys can go listen to that if you want all of the details um Ben I just want to make sure we're starting on the same uh like starting point here sure can you articulate what biology is actually saying like what's your understanding of the point that he is making and his overarching thesis right so you know when I first started writing Epsilon Theory and this is now you know 10 years ago you know one of the I read about this and yeah it's all very you know grandiosely titled I wrote a Manifesto I mean how how egocentric is that right but anyways I did and and and and one of the lines in the manifesto is about how important it is to call Things by their proper names I really believe that right it's important in our individual lives it's important in our social lives it's important our political lives to do just that to call Things by their proper names and you know that has one aspect of it which is uh I guess let's call it an anti-political correctness that you don't have to walk on eggshells that you can use you know call things what for what they are but in inherent in that approach is that words themselves have meaning that that words mean something and words like insolvency words like impairment that biology throws around like this you know these words have an actual meaning frankly that's why I you know I think I when we're first talking about doing a a podcast you know there's a notion of the debate there's a there's no debate here because we'd spend the whole time talking about words and do they have meaning or not but a word like insolvency word like impairment I these are not words that are just reflect your Vibes right they're not your feels about A bank's assets or liabilities they have real meaning and so what makes me so angry is for biology to just kind of throw out you know hundreds of banks are insolvent all caps right your money is not safe by Bitcoin you know and what makes me again so angry is that it's these big accounts like apology like of where he's you know they we know the big accounts who are typing out in all caps your money's not safe take your money out of the banks and that does make me angry I've had yeah I've had a dozen uh is it a dozen no it's not a dozen I've had eight to ten readers of Epsilon Theory email me and say hey I'm nervous I'm worried or asking for a friend right my parents are nervous or worried what do you think yeah yeah they'll couch it in some ways like that I've been thinking about taking my you know my money out of Wells Fargo for sake and you know and and I say for sake and I don't know I don't sorry I should have asked what our policy is here so uh you know Arthur Hayes episode I can only imagine no no no I can I can only imagine hey I mean Wells Fargo is one of the too big to fail outfits and you're talking about taking you know a sub 250 000 account clearly right and put keeping it in your the cash money in your in your in your home I mean what is this what is this and I'll tell you what it is it's lying Liars saying this stuff right for their own benefit and winningly or unwittingly for the some really rich guys who I really believe intentionally want to destabilize our country and our society and again that's what makes me angry so words like insolvency and impairment and that the bank hundreds of banks are in solved but that's just not true it's not right now does that mean that Banks can't be insolvent absolutely they can't you know the last time we had a lot of banks that were insolvent was in 2008 in 2009 and I wrote a lot about that I ran a hedge fund we were on this from the the very start so it's not that I'm some freaking apologist for the banks or the bankers but what insolvency is right is when your assets are permanently impaired like when you buy lots of mortgage-backed securities and the ability of people to pay those loans back ain't there that is not the problem we have today that is not the problem with buying U.S treasuries and Fannie Mae I.E U.S government supported mortgage-backed securities or munis the problem is not one of impairment the problem is one of liquidity and that gets back to what it was talking about before about the Federal Reserves any central banks one job their one job is when the hits the fan I.E the banking system halts because there's no liquidity there's not cash their job is to put the liquidity into the banking system that's it that's our one job and that's what they did with the their Term Loan facility it's not QE right it's not again these words have actual meaning so QE is the Federal Reserve buying stuff and keeping it on their balance sheet I'm buying this seven year bond it's not here's cash for a one-year facility as emergency liquidity actually most of these expansion of the balances return to QE or reversal of Q of QT reversal quantitative tightening most of its 90-day financing it's that shot of adrenaline to keep liquidity cash money in the banks for the people who want to take it out for whatever cockamani reason they want to take it out for so Ben if I'm understanding you correctly there are there are two parts to this pushback and you've even called it anger so you've got you've got kind of uh yeah you're you're pissed off about this and the two parts it sounds like is part one which is you feel like there is some untruth around the actual definition of these words I want to talk about that in a second and the second part is uh motive you're actually questioning the motive of those who are propagating it motive is always a hard thing to actually you know ascertain but maybe we could talk about that absolutely 100 let's focus on the untruth side of things so insolvency impairment what about the idea that I don't think that um you know to play Devil's Advocate to what you're saying I don't think apology or Eric Voorhees are saying that individual Banks won't be able to meet their uh obligation they're saying for the individual Banks aren't able to meet their uh obligation without fed intervention and the thing that is actually insolvent is more on the side of the FED itself and maybe one representative whether we call it QE or whether we call it the bank term financing program one representative of that is how large is the balance sheet of the FED actually growing and we have seen it growing through this intervention uh over the past you know couple of weeks you're saying that this is short-term growth but I think the proponents of this argument are saying it's never short-term growth Ben you know this you just made the case back in 2008 that like once you put the morphine drip in it never comes out and so we had Arthur Hayes on the episode earlier this week and he said yeah it's small now but this btfp alone could grow to like four trillion dollars and be a covid level um increase in terms of uh base money dollar supply uh what's your take on this that it's not true right so so the the I mean any event it's not for you so there is a maximum there's two trillion dollars in non-g sub okay what's a g sub it's a government systemically important Banker so the the big the Big Four U.S banks big retail commercial Banks are too big to fail right they they cannot go into a resolution process and and this is what we're going to get to there are real problems in our banking system real serious problems about how these big four banks are your deposits are guaranteed and outside of them your deposits aren't guaranteed there's a real problem of 250 000 they're not guaranteed there's a real problem in the lack of regulatory oversight of what I'll call kind of the the big Regional Banks it's again that they don't have the same level of regulatory oversight that the big banks have it's that there are government protections on deposits for these big four Banks and not for any of the other Banks right these are these are these are all real problems that really need to be addressed by policy but one of those problems is not you know I got 99 problems of one of them ain't that we're going to have four trillion dollars of new money printed and going into the banks right that's not it that that's the equivalent of saying you know what the S P 500 it could go to zero that is actually true right if if every company if the Western World actually the entire world collapses right and we return to a Bronze Age barter system right the S P 500 goes to zero that those are equivalent statements that we could have four trillion dollars in new money printing money printing and the S P 500 could go to zero so yeah I get I get worked up about this stuff it's not right it's not correct because the key difference and again these words have meanings right they're it makes a difference whether you are buying a mortgage-backed secure you're the FED you're buying a mortgage-backed security and it has an anticipated life span of whatever seven and a half years let's say something that they buy from Fannie or Freddie that has a meaning it has a term it I mean is written right there on the paper we can say no we can measure what the duration of the assets are on the fed's balance sheet you can imagine we can better that and it's not the same thing as saying oh well this Bank facility Well this could be you know billions and billions or trillions and trillions of dollars it has a term limit here's why it's not also going to not going to expand the interest that the FED is charging the banks to take this facility this is expensive money right you the banks are losing money when they post a security to this fed facility this is the old and I think entirely correct saying about how bank or the central banks should provide the emergency support the emergency liquidity right you should apply it to you know solvent banks on good collateral at penalty rates and that's exactly what they've done right that's exactly what they've done the collateral here is the safest stuff in the world it's U.S treasuries it's again government supported mortgage-backed securities these are not banks that reached for yield by giving out liar loans and ALT a mortgage back whatever that's that is not What's Happening Here now before someone asks could there be problems on these Banks balance sheets on the asset side absolutely absolutely I you know people me you talk about commercial real estate lines could those loans some of them be impaired yeah yeah they sure could because I think what's happened and this is also a the bologies and the others screaming about bank and Solomon saying take your body out it's not safe what they've contributed to is a credit freeze here in the United States we are at the Leading Edge is going to be an awful recession it is it's going to be an awful recession and this is part of the contributing factor to it so you want to look at some of the bank loans and say okay I'm kind of worried about them I agree I agree but that's not at the foundation of what the biologies of the world are saying is driving the duration of the the insolvency their Vibe word of the banks what they're saying is oh the interest rates have gone up and so the duration risk and that's what a bank does right this isn't credit risk this isn't some sort of permanent impairment this is what a bank does and when people get freaked out the Central Bank the FED has done what it does it provides that emergency liquidity so that the banks don't fail and they provide it at a penalty interest rate so that all the banks don't just say oh yeah let me have some of that nobody wants any of this unless they need it to tide over this liquidity driven desire to pull the deposits out and I think that I think that is over frankly I think the FED has done its job right and and that all this this business about oh your money's not safe and there's runs on the banks I think what the FED did is they bought time for Alice to solve and let's solve them the very real problems of a two-tiered banking system that we have in the United States and let's try to work on this massive recession that's coming down the pike because we now do have a credit freeze here in the United States so your high level take Ben is that they have solved the problem of the bank run that it was temporary they I hope they have some liquidity in and and the next thing that Central Bankers need to worry about uh and all of the entire United States used to worry about as a recession um I I have a question for you because like so this is probably a point of um debate you said this what uh treasuries are the safest assets in the world I think that is a key point where um people who are making balaji's argument would disagree they would say no Ben they're not the safest assets in the world Fiat is not a safe instrument we had Arthur Hayes on the podcast earlier this week too and he said that um all of these Fiat regimes are kind of inside money and all of the debt that nation states are accruing of years of the morphine drip of you know health care costs skyrocketing of irresponsible fiscal policy decisions they are going to be Laden at the feet of those who are inside the system the inside money the best thing you could do is go outside the system I can't think of anything more inside money than treasury so why do you think that treasuries are the safest asset in the world because when I tried to imagine a world where a treasury a U.S treasury has credit risk and that's again that's what we're talking about here my credit risk I mean you're not going to get paid back at the end of the term that's why we call it a risk-free rate it's typically a what's called a treasury bill which officially is any duration less than a year or a year or less but typically people mean the 90-day obligation of the United States government it's called the risk-free rate and for most of the past Century that risk-free rate has been above inflation so there's a positive real return on holding on carrying dollars so that's what it's called carry right so in uh in in in in in finance it's the is why you know my view of these kind of dollar debasement charts that go around oh my God the dollar has lost 98 of its purchasing power it's again mendacity it's because the dollar has carry you you you there's an interest rate associated with dollars now again I said this before the last 14 years have not been a positive real rate return of return the carry on the US dollar has been below inflation and then when inflation spiked up is way below inflation and that's why job one of the FED is to get us back to a positive real rate of return on the US dollar the normalizing of interest rates that's what that means an abandonment of this zero interest rate policy which does debase the currency right and it does penalize Savers and it does do all of these very true things that I think the Bitcoin and more broadly crypto Community quite appropriately call out but what that does not mean but it absolutely does not mean is that the U.S dollar system can or should be burned down right or that there is actually credit risk with the United States government because in that scenario if I'm not oh I'm not sure if I want to get paid back you know the next 90 days for the next two years on The Treasure of the two-year treasury I bought I'm kind of worried about getting my money back on that there's credit risk there well let's try to imagine what that world looks like and I'll tell you what that world looks like and people you know I get it to this all the time in my tournament oh well you know people would actually be able to buy a house because they'd be so much cheaper then it's like our entire GDP would be cut in half unemployment rate would be 40 percent mortgages would not exist student loans wouldn't exist auto loans would exist no lending would exist I mean it really is returning to that oh yes man I have such fond memories of you know a Bronze Age barter system and that's what it's it's it's the epitome of around and find out uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been

web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free yeah I I'm starting to understand kind of the picture here I mean you're thinking that people seem to be like celebrating the idea or the fact that Banks would go insolvent or that you know the um the fed the U.S would be unable to meet its obligations I want to make sure the system is broken we might as well burn it down now and it's like this is just like LARP it's LARPing I was actually I agree with you on this I want to make sure that though that we are not um beating up a straw man here so okay I think that that one of the things that you said around treasuries um I don't think that those who believe at least some portion of balaji's argument uh would say that the us is going to default on its obligations rather that the thing that you said that over the last 100 years real Returns on treasuries have been net positive on a one two percent something like that rather that that won't be the case for the decades to come and that doesn't usually happen granted whatever it does happen though yeah so just come out okay I'm agreeing with you right so again it was I think it was Alex glasstein or somebody's business well you know one of the reasons I like Bitcoin is like an insurance policy against us not returning to a you know a positive risk-free rate a real rate of return to which my response was fair all right fair right I I I I I I so I Surrender on that right that that is a reason right and and I I get it it's the same rationale you would have for you know yeah for for like 30 years you know why you would own gold for example it's it's exactly the same argument it's an insurance policy against Central Bank error uh and uh as the lawyers would say right that stipulated okay so you do agree on that point and uh and so I think what you're saying though is that um the Bitcoin maximalist position or this position that biology is is presenting is far more extreme than just the case of um hey Ben you know we're buying all of these outside money assets because we think the real Returns on treasuries are going to be negative for the next three decades because of Central Bank policy and fiscal policy and the U.S uh losing its power status in the world and the US dollar uh diminishing as a reserve currency so that's why we're going outside the money you would probably say that that's fair that's a fair argument that's also a reason to buy gold in other assets but I think what you're more objecting to is the the more extreme nature that this narrative is being portrayed they're not saying what I just said they are saying you get all of your money out now before it's too late and that's right so my my argument is with both the portrayal right the hyperbole but my but more fundamentally my objection is to the vision here's what I mean and you see this with you know in the past with gold bugs too the idea is that it's not just I've got this insurance policy if you know we have stresses and issues in the existing dollar system no no we need to replace the existing Fiat system with a gold standard we need to replace it with a Bitcoin standard we need to end fractional Reserve banking we need to move to fixed Reserve banking so my larger objection my objection is not just to the hyperbole my objection is very much very much to the notion that there is an alternative Financial system based on a fixed Supply thing like gold or like Bitcoin so I'm very opposed to the the underlying vision in addition to the mendacity of using words like oh my God hundreds of banks were in solved and your money's not safe I got it okay so I I want to dig into that because that is that is deeper in the layer of your objections and I think one of the most crucial pieces so basically what's going on is there is a ship it's hidden Iceberg people are debating on the size of that Iceberg how catastrophic it is maybe you disagree with the whole metaphor and scenario but absolutely allow me to put some pieces together so something happened maybe people how about this Ben people are saying that the ship hit an iceberg and there's some debate as to whether it did or not some people this is my point there's no debate right that this is like saying when you say is hit an iceberg yes that is a metaphor the banks are insolvent oh my God your money's not safe and what I am telling you is that that ain't true okay so Ben here is saying I'm trying to make sense of this for bankless sisters because biology just came on the podcast and said we had an iceberg on the podcast and saying we didn't hit an iceberg at all that's a lie people are making this up now sorry I got I gotta interject and I'm not saying you can't hit an iceberg sure you know what we hit an icebergs are real is what Ben is icebergs are real icebergs are real we hit an iceberg in 2008 okay and everything that's happened since then was our government's both initial response to hitting the iceberg which I think actually saved us from sinking yes but then disaster disaster so that's going to be too strong pathetically right the the actions they took to keep us from seeking they said let's just do that permanently understood so we icebergs are real we hit an iceberg in 08 this wasn't an iceberg okay that's what I'm saying so let's continue that metaphor for a second because I I enjoy it anyways I don't know if any list okay so we hit an iceberg we didn't hit an iceberg is what Ben says some people are saying we we have hit an iceberg but Ben believes in icebergs they are a real thing you can hit them in ships some people aboard the ship are saying come on to the Lifeboat everybody aboard the Lifeboat right and you're saying hold on don't board the Lifeboat look at that there's only a small number of lifeboats we're not all going to get off and by the way the lifeboats are leaky they're like this is this is kind of the the objection to the vision so I I want to dig into that piece of it because we've already talked about you know whether we hit an iceberg or not and you've articulated why you don't think we have but what about the Lifeboat is leaky to you so let's say that everyone followed kind of the uh the big the strong bitcoiner case for getting aboard this alternative to Fiat monetary system sure what do you object to that what's so wrong with the vision why do you think the life lifeboats are leaky or there's not enough to go around or whatever metaphor no no so I'll continue with this my view cockamami analogy and I'll say this you can't cross the Atlantic Ocean on a on a on a lot of lifeboats that's the problem that's right why though people don't understand our economy our economy is a big ass ocean liner that's what it is right and icebergs are real it can sink I I get it we're not sinking and yet the claim is oh my God we've gotta we've we've got to we've got to scut you know this ship is sinking right we have to move to a system that's not a big ocean liner no no no we need to get on our own all our you know all our little lifeboats you know we we you know and what's this idea about having a captain of the ship oh no no no no no we need to all make our individual decisions about where our little our Lifeboat is going well you know you're not going to cross the ocean that way and what I mean by crossing the ocean is you can't maintain I you know people don't like to hear it but I mean my God the the standard of living in the United States and the year of Our Lord 2023 is phenomenal and for people say oh well you know I just I kind of wish we'd just go back to like you know the late 19th century when you know men were men and you know sheep were scared and you know it was you know we had some rugged individualism and this is what I mean by LARPing this is what I mean by LARPing it's just like God yeah eight billion people or whatever the number is in the world and you're just saying you know if they if they live they live you know it's like it's like I to continue the cockamani you know analogy replacing the ocean liner with a system of lifeboats I I I think that's a really poor idea this is this is the Crux of it and I'm glad we got this deep in this in this conversation Ben so make that case some more though okay so you're saying that a fleet of lifeboats can't cross the Atlantic what is so great about the Fiat system what is so great about fractional Reserve banking what is so great about having a captain who can kind of uh inflate money supply uh to whatever kind of the the ocean liner uh needs why can't a uh Bitcoin based or a crypto based algorithmic um monetary system of some kind do all of these things I mean nation states did exist prior to Fiat regimes that were based on things like the gold standard what are you like why can't we return to something like this uh and why do you have such objections to the Lifeboat idea well for two reasons one is that the reason that governments left the gold standard was that it constrained them so much um both for doing things like you know fighting a war uh but also constrain them so much in things like just extending credit to an economy and growing an economy so it's the latter of those I'm kind of even most interested in doing because what would actually happen in Wars is that you would debase a currency I mean this is like you know Henry VIII would do this right you change the the mix of silver in your coins right or you'd you know you'd say oh well we're going to borrow you know I'm good for it right are you you'd issue deposit notes that were actually kind of fractional Reserve banking of the time you do war bonds you do all find all these ways to borrow money anyway to fight a war let's I'm going to leave that aside because you can do that on a gold standard too what is very difficult to do on a gold standard or a Bitcoin standard is to create a system in your Society where you extend credit to anyone except the rich so my objection to moving to to instituting a gold standard or a Bitcoin standard is that access to credit or anyone who's not very rich does one of two things either it vanishes because banks will no longer be able to lend right to have a velocity of money and my God this is on my my Twitter feed people think the velocity of money is the speed of a transaction it's not right it's the degree and this is at the heart of a fractional lending system right which is that you lend money to a business they want to expand they want to buy something they want to hire people right you lend them money that money is now deposited at your bank it's their account so they're spending it those deposits then you then take those deposits you can lend that out right so or a fraction like 90 of it let's say so it it this is the velocity made the same dollar is doing is accomplishing more economic activity that's the velocity of money and that is not just possible it's at the heart of a fractional Reserve System a fractional fractional banking system and it's exceedingly difficult to do in a fixed vacancies now the counter to that as people say is oh no it's okay right the banks will just originate the loans and then they'll securitize them and you know that will fund The Lending that takes place what that means is then you have to think well who is buying those who is buying the asset-backed Securities who is buying the mortgage-backed securities and in our country because those would be the two things that would be the securitized and you can all right for example this is called a wholesale funding system right that the banks fund their loans basically by packaging the loans and then selling those as Securities to generate the funding for the next set of loans as opposed to relying on deposits and the fractional Reserve banking system right there's much more prevalent in Europe than his in the U.S where our banks are much more supported by deposits retail deposits you can do it right what that leads to though is the buyers of these Securities are the banks the buyers of these Securities are the government right so when Bitcoin standard or gold standard people are talking about no no no we need narrow Banks we need a fixed Supply and the like and yes there would be these these other ways to accomplish lending because you did the banks would just be a wholesaler they just originate the loans and we package them up and we'd sell them guess who the buyers are it's the banks in the government right you're you're you're basically calling for a far more centralized world than a world of fractional banking where Banks make loans and hold their loans on their own balance sheets I I sorry I'm a capitalist and the root word of capitalist is capital and to make it a capitalist economy grow you need that supply of capital and credit particularly to the non-very rich so that's my uh five-minute defense of fractional Reserve banking system and and as they would say happy to take comments and you know you're going to get tons of comments on this on this this podcast right right I mean I think comments are going to be oh you look the Hulk on XYZ and those it's like I know that look I know that and this is why we're we want to hear both sides of the argument I and I look I wouldn't care I mean Twitter is a nasty place isn't it Ben like sometimes people get personal um I think conversation oh my God you should see my my feet I know it I've been there too uh not for this particular issue but others and there are tribes and there's anger and um it's just a nasty you know nasty place I um anything that the bankless platform supports is going to be constructive debate and so I would encourage all of the people wanting to comment on this be constructive let's have the conversation let's have the debate no personal attacks um Okay so could you also con like contrast the world let's say that we did move to some sort of algorithmic coin standard where it couldn't be debased something like Bitcoin so why is that a worse world I mean you've just painted the picture of of why um you know like fractional Reserve is necessary is kind of a Cornerstone for civilization and I think it's really it's sorry sorry sorry it's a Cornerstone of modern society a Cornerstone is a modern society that's all it and and and and now that we're here to eliminate or you know not eliminating right you're limiting it to the very rich mortgages Credit in general so I mean credit cards go away auto loans go away mortgages go away student loans go away but except to the degree that they are absorbed by the big Banks and government that's what's happening with student loans for example every student alone now is backed up is is the government owns those loans so yeah you could still have student lending with a Bitcoin standard but it means that we're just we're creating a more government Reliant centralized Society for doing it so that's what you see even if we just swap out the denominator if we swap out you know the dollar for some other standard as a you know store of value medium exchange unit of accounts you think that that leads to a more centralized more unequal world that is less free and so a hundred percent okay so you're saying that the the product that um you know maybe maximalist advertise is really not as advertised because the the picture of their painting at least part of it is the ship is sinking we have to flee to this other ship that's kind of narrative number one but also this other ship is a more self-sovereign uh like Freer world with more Liberties and is going to lead to Greater I I hope this is the argument greater economic Prosperity I mean there are there are some that might even disagree with that statement and be like no it's it's all about like bunkers and citadels and uh you know that that's that's a very dystopian view of things and I think there's an element of it it's self-reliant some are painting a picture of this being a good thing for society and you're saying this is this is not this is a huge step back yes that is exactly what I'm saying and the Crux of that argument is that I do not know how it is possible to extend credit with a fixed Supply system right except at extremely high interest rates because let's say you're the bank of Bitcoin right and somebody comes to you they've got this great idea for this project and I just need you to lend me this money from your deposits your bank you make loans and so you say okay okay okay right I'll do it and you make the loan and then something happens and they can't pay the loan back right what what do you do right there's no loan loss Reserve right there's no you know separate Equity here you've lost money for the depositors right and if the depositors are part of that decision to go and invest the money right and they're making that decision hey they're going to they're going to want a much larger you know the risk is larger so they want more of a return what banks do is that they allow us to pool social risk taking or fractional Reserve banking does right and and that's a really good thing because the alternative is that credit dries up except for people who already have a lot of money so that's the Crux of my argument that you can't have this fixed Reserve System based on gold or Bitcoin or whatever it is and maintain societal-wide access to credit which are there excesses in credit of course there are of course there are and there's a necessary credit is the oxygen for our modern economy and society and if you take away that oxygen it dies I I want to ask you about this so another word for credit Ben is trust and I think very much the the whole story of humanity up to this point is um a story of scalability like our species is able to coordinate better than any other species that's why we develop roads and hospitals and cities and and Nations and and technology so scaling trust is kind of the name of the game if we're going to survive and thrive in in into this uh 21st century so another word for credit is is trust but I want to ask you about this it feels like to many people I think you would you would agree to this the central bank has kind of betrayed our trust it's like we don't necessarily get a vote on the money supply and I'm wondering I want to pitch to you this idea Ben is is there some sort of a sweet spot here okay we have the ship the big ocean liner there is a captain okay but like what's to prevent the captain from sailing like going to some destination we don't want to go or May making bad decisions or treating everyone on you know in in the ship in kind of a subpar way making decisions that aren't Democratic that that aren't liberal well one prevention mechanism is leaving the system we can basically threaten the captain and say look hey we should have the right to Fork off we should have the right to go on to these um you know uh these lifeboats and if you don't steer the ship in the right direction uh this is our vote we'll leave we'll go on the Lifeboat we'll go find some other ship is there some sort of sweet spot where we we have a check on power through these non-insside money systems outside money systems like Bitcoin or ethereum or gold or some other monetary standard and we can use this because it feels very much Ben and I think you would you'd probably agree with this that central banks have too much power too much unchecked power I'm like what can I do about this I mean how much money did we print during covet if I disagree with that I can vote but like we're just on this on this kind of machine and I I don't know what else to do other than to vote with capital and that is an Adam Smith that is a capitalist idea of being able to exit the system vote with your capital and get outside of a system that's no longer working for you is there a sweet spot we can find so a couple of strands I want to untangle here the first is that I would very much be in favor of a more I'll call it rules based monetary policy right and you know that that that's absolutely a course correction that I think makes a ton of sense a more rules-based monetary policy and the main kind of big rule that I'd be very much down for right is an explicit recognition of the fed's one job right that lender of Last Resort facility right and in moving away from the effort an intentional effort to guide or mold behaviors through words and God knows I've written thousands of words about this and it's it's a real problem I have with the Federal Reserve that because they are of this church who believe that they have this the French would call it dirajisma this ability to direct economic activity and they know best for us they are going to use their words not as an accurate representation of what they believe or think but to use their words intentionally to alter our Behavior you know what we might call lying under other circumstances that just again that's the mendacity on the institutional side so if you're asking me should we reform change see or Shrink the influence and the actions of central banks and foreign absolutely right should we eliminate central banks in our modern system much less a fractional Reserve System banking system hello right so that's strand number one now strand number two the exit why can't we just take our money and go somewhere else Amen brother take your money go somewhere else right that's separate from big name accounts getting up there and on Twitter and here and every other place shouting in all caps the banks are insolvent your money's not safe buy Bitcoin again that's what pisses me off right both of those things piss me off the one that's more kind of urgent and in my face right now is the latter I see I uh I want to ask a question about this rules-based monetary policy really quick because I can hear probably the the bank list listener saying but Ben that's what crypto is so the idea behind crypto is that any rules-based monetary policy as long as it's tied to a human making decisions and some sort of political apparatus those rules will be bent and broken and they would say that's what we actually have with crypto whether whether you believe the Bitcoin algorithm is correct or the ethereum algorithm is correct it's something that is immutable very difficult to change that is kind of written in the software that is rules based now maybe it doesn't have the right rule but they would say Ben you'll never get humans I get the point yeah let me let me let me answer the question right that's I'll answer drinks so the core problem for a government and a Bitcoin standard or a gold standard is that the rules that are there are out of their control right right and this is this is true for the gold standard too one of the huge problems of the gold standard was do you have a gold mine or not right that was a big problem that was a big problem if you're a country and you're on the gold standard and uh we don't have a gold mine that's that's a real problem here right um because we can't legislate right it's it's the exceptions it's those emergencies that come up and when the rule is not in your when you can't when there's nothing where you can break the CL the glass in case of emergency like the FED did in March of 09 like the FED did with this Bank Term Loan facility it's it's the it's the separateness and the inability of government to ultimately control the reason for being the raison d'etra of any government which is to tax I I mean that's why that's why governments exist and you call it senior age you can call it all these different words but they're basically about this this is why governments exist and you say well screw that I'm going to be my own sovereign individual I want to go live out from the Isle of white or whatever and you know you know Screw you right and knock yourself out man knock yourself out um this has been kind of at the core of my of that philosophical difference I have with Bitcoin Max season as a supplied for policy right I don't think this is a battle that is winnable and I don't think it's a battle that even if you won is um a good thing for the world which is to move to a fixed Supply monetary system that is inviolable and not cannot be changed by the citizens however they are represented and however their will is represented in the perversions of that in government but how it is separate from what citizens can do anything about Ben uh this has been great I want to get to one more thing before we close but I'm kind of summarizing this going back back to our my you know my ham-fisted analogy um but maybe it's helpful for some listener out there uh we're all in the ship together uh Ben believes in icebergs he doesn't think we hit one in this particular case um and he believes in your right to go board the Lifeboat but he takes issues with those who are um screaming and shouting run to the lifeboats run to the light boats and that is the Crux of his issue uh yeah what do you think about that summary I think that's pretty good the only thing I'd add to that is I I don't I don't I think it's a pretty crappy world if we live in a world of lifeboats right I I think the ocean liner is an important thing to maintain it has definitely gotten off course over the you know the last 13 15 years I want to change the course of the Lifeboat of the uh of the ocean liner right and replace if not replace the captain put more controls on the captain and let's get better capped you know crew right but I don't want to live in a world where we're all floating off in our little lifeboats well let's get something out let's complete this Counterpoint with this then so I'm understanding this is Ben Hunt the reformist right uh not the radical who's telling you to you board the lifeboats but hey we can reform the ship that we're on and I I promised you to give you like opportunity to make the case uh earlier in the episode on how we could actually reform the existing system Ben what do you think that looks like how do we fix the Fed uh more rules based less reliant on they'll call it communication policy or forward guidance um a real rate of return a real rate of return right greater regulatory scrutiny of the banks an increase in the uninsured amount of deposits or the insurance on deposits an increase not uh unlimited but an increase because I want to make it possible to still have a regional bank system that is deposit driven it still allows for banks to make loans and keep it on their books because that is such an engine for entrepreneurialism for risk taking for economic growth in our society that's what funds small little businesses all around you know this country that's what funds farmer loans AG loans right car loans all that stuff that's the economic activity the banking activity I want to strengthen while at the top right we need to return to a monetary policy that has a positive real rate of return and you do these things and it'll take a while but fortunately we have time we grow our way out of the debt we grow our way out of the debt and that's going to require some real fiscal reform too there's a whole set of things that I'd want to do there and then the final thing I do right is I would have a million dollar lifetime intra you know tax-free capital gains exemption all right and then I would tax capital gains progressively over that one million dollars but I want us to return to being a society of Risk Takers entrepreneurs and investors and I think our fiscal and monetary policy should support that Ben you think Windows shrinking but that's what I think we should do you think we can get there we you think we can use Politics as our engine to get there I absolutely do I it like I say it's getting harder and harder and it's made harder and harder by the biologies of the world right it's made harder and harder by this because it breeds more and more distrust and there's plenty to be distrustful of and lots of things to change including some things to burn the  down but the fractional banking system and having a lender of Last Resort ain't two of them Ben this has been a really productive conversation and uh I hope so thank you I've really enjoyed it yeah I appreciate you coming on and making this this counter argument um I uh I'm hopeful we can have these continue to have these kind of civil conversations and debates and I would encourage anyone listening to this is uh if you have a commentary or follow-up uh let's keep it on the high run arguments not the not the low rung attacks so that we can have some more uh productivity and hear all sides of the arguments and and figure out what's going to happen next uh that's what we're all trying to do here well thanks again I really appreciate every the opportunity to come on guys got to end with this risks and disclaimers of course none of this was Financial advice crypto is risky so is D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you
