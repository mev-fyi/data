welcome everyone to top signal the crypto show that brings you the same guests and personalities that you all know from the podcast you listen to or the videos you watch but instead of information data and analysis top signal is entertainment comedy and live ship posting keeping up with crypto is work and top signal is not that the one rule that we have on top signal is that there is no fact

sir all the way from munich so guys this is um we're really excited for the nft show today i'd like to ask you guys just one big question before we get into the games i'm going to start with tom um why are you here repping the cats why what what what's about the cats do you feel like you can rep today for everybody on this show well i mean you guys are doing this awesome show and i think it's just the community deserves to see us for what we are like as raw as possible but full transparency always from the cats definitely love that answer and uh miss mr tubby i don't know if you have a rebuttal for that but let's see if you have one why are you happy why are you here wrapping the penguins um before the penguins i was actually a professional [ __ ] poster and i'm pretty uh i'm pretty you know good meme so i think that like that's what i'm representing from the fuji penguins and i'm here to bring that energy to your show oh thank you i needed that and i appreciate that sir and uh zenika you're kind of a free agent today you're not rocking the ape we appreciate it you're very handsome sir so why don't you tell us how you're feeling and why you're here maybe representing the apes or who are you representing today no i'm feeling great i'll i'll represent the apes i think you know why not i've been an ape since pretty early on not quite mint but yeah they're my longest lasting nfc community for sure excellent i mean somebody said you were the best ape that they could have uh offered us so we appreciate that and i think that's true too all right dave should we get right into the games let's do it mike what game are we playing first today folks we cooked something up special these you could imagine i i don't know what they are but you can imagine these folks here have some wild nfts in their profiles for and i bet lots of people are asking them hey tom hey tubby hey roy what should i be buying next let's put everybody into the headspace of what an nfc founder just like you folks or an empty influencer what would you do with something like this we get a lot of tweets on twitter you see a lot of tweets like hey i have a dollar hey i have a hundred dollars i have an e what should i buy if you had 25 dollars to make the most goated nft profile portfolio with this grid here what would you do let's just talk through it let's just talk through it now and just suspect just to make this a little bit more fun only one from the top line and you have to use something from the bottom line all right let's take a look why don't we go uh rory you're looking at this right now what what are you seeing here that's uh that's sticking out to you the goose the goose i want the goose why the goose it's iconic i mean it's worth i think more than anything on that top line but i'm not 100 sure with the the punk but you know it sold uh maybe a month ago for eighteen hundred eighth i think maybe sixteen hundred uh and it's just gonna go up from there it's like one of one it's one of a kind in art blocks yeah i love it that's an easy pick all right yeah all right well what roy why why why are you up why don't you help us formulate the 25 you've already articulated ten dollars of it where are we going next huh well so you said i gotta pick one from the bottom line right so oh just to walk through it so just let everybody know let's take a look on the top right here we have the zombie punk of course we have the goose ringer um we have a really dope squiggle we have a fedenza and we have a random random nft from dc investors gallery yo that's that could be a good pick i'm just saying um and of course we have on the bottom line this is a fast food squiggle if you knew those existed this is that also ben's a rock that's a rock this is from our actual me and david's actual portfolio they got rugged and they don't exist anymore yeah that was that was a fake fidenza rock not a real one there's also minting 10 of the newest cardano nft project i mean hey roll the dice folks um a polymorph and a fast food penguin as well so that's the bottom line so uh roy you you've picked the goose for ten dollars yeah dollars up to spend my friend right so let's go bottom line i'll probably i don't know anything about cardano nfts maybe they're going to be something but i've heard of the polymorph from universe and that seems like it could be worth more than the others so let's go with that he's going for value folks if you're hearing this paul and roy he's a value investor so all right right so we have i want to win this and then we have a polymorph so what do i have left 14 14 sir well okay uh second line i've got to go for the cool cat that's oh no i'm reversed there bro i mean you see the the hair's tough now cool cat final answer okay and then what do i have left eight eight bucks seven bucks seven bucks seven bucks okay so two from the third thing the sup duck and the robotos done i wanna get another from the bottom line let's get i want that rock for this that's all wrong [Laughter] great choices right yeah value value value value rug we'll put together your portfolio that you put together and we'll put on twitter and see who has the best one all right uh who's next uh tom why are you going next right i guess top row uh fodenza straight up for denver yeah you gotta go easy yeah that's a sick choice plus if i go with my next choice which is the the the cat with the tv head i can put the fedenza in the tv this sneaky play wow okay as in like wait you you're talking about bob ross is painting the fidenza right is that what you're saying i'm thinking bob's ross painting the differedenza yeah nice nice wow so yeah i'm making myself a pfp as well while i'm at it and uh and while i'm doing that i might as well go for the squiggle to put on my t-shirt for my cat are you talking about you're talking about the fast food squiggles yeah fast food squiggle is going on my t-shirt what i'm loving uh what's that leaving me with so i'm up to 18 now uh so let's go let's uh roboto yeah let's go for that roboto uh sort my own now uh 21. roboto he goes on like the little shoulder of your of your cap yeah he's going to be like a shoulder buddy yeah yeah we got we gotta we got our repper penguin too he's gonna be on the other shoulder uh and that leaves me with what two more let's go for the fedenza rock and minting ten random cardano dice you went shopping in the one dollar center yeah yeah dollar store tom looks for gems so roy looks valued almost for gems and last but not least mr tubby you've been thinking you've had a lot of time to think about it you've heard your peers um what is the go to nft portfolio for you with 25 bucks so goaded nft portfolio uh ten dollars has to go with the crypto punk i just think that like the future for the future for crypto punks is only going vertical so ten dollars to the crypto punk um and then am i allowed to spend more than one in the bottom cap oh yeah as well keep going dude dude yeah so i'm gonna take five uh fast food penguins [Music] [Laughter] five fidenza rocks and then i'm gonna go with five fast food squiggles and that's my final answer oh my god i love it great that's fun okay that's it well one of our peeps will put me probably put this together we'll put it on social media and see who put together the best nfc portfolio well dave what would you do oh gosh okay um well if out of the top line the fidenza is the only one i would want on my wall like i have a crypto punk on my wall but that's because my crypto punk is pretty i don't have i don't want an uh a zombie crypto punk on my wall that's not that's not very pretty so fidenza from the top line is going on the wall um i refuse to buy an ether brock because they're just way too nihilist um so i gotta go with the the rainbow board ape teeth um for for my number two that brings me at seventeen dollars yeah you don't this is a divine road by the way oh i didn't say this uh the five the five this is everybody i'm sorry i didn't say divine probe in the five dollar line is absolutely come-ups absolute come up so gotta do that once that puts me at 22 and so um then i'm also going to choose to mute the turtles from my timeline so i don't ever see ryan sean adams ever again [Laughter] awesome and that's my final answer that's great i don't have any picks i mean a number of these are mine so thanks for looking at my nfc okay dave let's go into the next one you ready for the draft yeah we're ready for the we gotta do the draft folks it's fantasy football season i know not everybody here cares and if you're an amer if you're not in america you don't even know what i'm talking about probably but fantasy nfl football is here for all those that all the people here that care about that we are going to do a similar type of uh fantasy football draft but instead of drafting fantasy football players our guests today are going to draft the most coveted celebrities that they'd want to rock you know their communities profile pictures and the trait that that celebrity would have of that um or the type of a type of cat type of penguin that that celebrity would have in this spot again just for people that don't know the format we're gonna go random here um actually i've selected the order already in the next slide um it's going to go one two three and then it's going to go snake back to three two one to be the second round and then the third round is gonna be one back that way so we'll snake we're gonna go four rounds should we need an extra round we will but um i think we're going to be fine with four our guests have had the night to think about this they're going to make their case for each of these celebrities if it gets stolen you're going to see some drama let's get into it right folks the gang drafts the most coveted celebs and mr tubby i got you here first sir um do you know what you want to pick for the first pick overall in the in the in the gang drafts most coveted celebs draft yes uh it's clearly how it clearly has to be elon musk and what does elon musk have what is he rocking which penguin is he rocking bro what's the property i wonder which trade what's the trait yeah what's the trait uh he has to have like the cross-eyed trait like with the derpy eyes i don't know if you've seen elmo's penguin but uh that's what i need to have i didn't even know he had a derpy one okay of course yeah all right it's gotta be strong i don't think anybody disagrees with that first overall so elon musk penguin would be crazy for everybody in the game okay xenic i got you here second um who's the who's your first pick in the second round maybe controversial but we're gonna go check in the first round we're gonna go joe yeah we're gonna go joe rogan he may not want us but do you hear that joe rogan yeah wow we're going to get him around he's going to realize how great nfts are how great the apes are he's going to come on board and he's going to love it joe rogan wouldn't have worked out on anyone else's team but on the ape team yeah i could definitely see yeah yeah yeah and we know we just talked about you guys the other day what trait would you have we'll give him a blue dress just okay i like that okay tom round us out here you're gonna get two picks tom by the way right so you're gonna get this the last pick of the first round and the first pick of the second round um set us off here who who's your first pick there we go sorry my dog goes crazy sometimes so my first pick queen of england oh my god [Laughter] and uh and we're gonna give her a fire crown oh i love it oh it's great that's good and then like you said go go for the second one yeah yes sir you get two all right all right next one mr bean oh my gosh rowan atkinson bro yeah rowan atkinson keeping it british sir wrong atkinson yes indeed and honestly i think that guy can pull off any trait it doesn't matter what he's got he's gonna make it work that's great oh we love that you know that's a that's a really good pick for the fourth round i i gotta say yeah wow [Laughter] the queen geez that's hot okay roy yeah you're gonna follow up the queen i don't follow the queen the king uh well i'll just go with what i had picked larry david because i love him and he's awesome and we'd love to have him with the apes um i can't imagine him getting involved with the apes he'd be like making fun of the whole concept of nfts but um and i think he deserves a pimp coat oh yeah david in a pimp coat yeah okay i would love to see the curb episode about infts yeah yeah yeah all right clay what do you think round the sound you get two picks i get two picks cool so my first would be kanye west oh bro it just has to be oh bro yeah mike here is a big kanye fan oh yeah and a big penguin fan so here we go which which penguin man which trait he's probably gonna rock a kimono of some kind probably the abstract kimono in my opinion it just makes sense he's on a big like fashion kicks i think he would go for the abstract kimono i think ice jacket but that's fine i mean okay that makes sense too yeah you could put like a like a craw a slash or something he would go for either or appreciate that appreciate it um first round first pick of the third round mr tubby oh i gotta pick one of my favorite nba players kevin durant i i love kevin durant so much um from nba yeah yeah yeah we got we got steph curry even though he hit it off of his profile i don't know why but yeah i would i would love to have kevin durant uh as for the as for the trait man um what would he have dude yeah this is this is a tough one i don't i'm trying to think of which one he would go for it's he he would probably go for something with like the circle glasses i think in my opinion that's just what i envisioned in picking it's cool right let's manifest that all right let's manifest that clay all right zenika as always back to you my friend i'm gonna go for another controversial pick actually now it's too controversial if you're packing picks for the fourth round sir yeah um all right less controversial but maybe still a little bit let's go with shaq so we're going to steal him from the creatures he's loving them but yeah we'd love to have him with the apes um he's classy guy we'll put him in a suit uh i think that's a trade for him yeah that belongs in a suit for sure yeah great choice okay um well let me let me get a sense of the uh of the field do we feel like we should go five picks are we feeling four is sufficient seems good yeah it all seems good all right tom you're gonna round us out then baby um you're gonna pick two right here and and maybe ice some people out who knows okay so yeah yeah cool so my first one ryan reynolds great mister you know i think he'd uh i think he'd be great in a frog suit yeah that kind of comedy style he's got going on and i think for our last pick you know it's got to be austin powers with the heart eyes oh oh my god that's a good that's a good fourth rounder right there the heart eyes is really important the nash two national heroes three national heroes of england the queen cyril and aquinson and allison powers super choices all right roy who's your last pig man huh controversial and not controversial controversial all right let's not i'll go with i'll steal another national hero from england go ricky gervais because you know we always love to happen to him he is great yeah he's great uh and he can have we're going to give him a dog that's it's not a trait but it's a companion because he's such an animal lover yeah that's a solid pick a solid pick all right man if you don't pick who the brick i'm thinking about right here okay bro there is somebody you have all left off the table and he has made himself all the way to the end of the fourth round clay please tap into this what all right i mean is it like a parent you gotta give me a hint like you gotta give me a hint on all of our parents yeah okay but you do what you do this is your draft bro i don't want to put my stuff on you both you pick your draft see i could go super polarizing and like in kind of political and uh i don't know how this one would play out hey it's top signal [Laughter] oh man um [Laughter] okay um since we're having fun let's just uh let's just pick donald trump yeah that was who i was gonna pick that was my controversial one it's pretty good it would be a pretty big boon for us so yeah i'm a trade literate are you giving donald trump all right since we're gonna go full ironic here uh and we have two matches here we're gonna go with the macaroni hairdresser yes yes yes one of those wow let's take a look everybody let's just pause for a moment and take a look at this freaking draft that we just did and i want everybody watching to think about who who won this one who has the most goateed draft so far we have mr tubby first round elon musk cross eyed this is penguins kanye with the abstract kimono maybe the ice jacket kevin durant with the circle glasses trump with the macaroni here that low key is a dream blunt rotation all right yeah joe rogan with the blue dress come along joe rogan larry david with the pimp coat ape shack with the suit ape absolutely perfect and then we have ricky gervais he's also going to get a dog for the companion cleaning us up here is extreme tom from the cats and he wants to put every hero that every english contemporary knows in their heart in the cat and he's gonna put the queen with the fire crown sir rowan atkinson any trait facts ryan reynolds in a frog suit and he closed it up folks with awesome powers and heart eyes on the cats those are pretty dang good guys that's a good that's a great draft right there vitalik is that who you're thinking [ __ ] [ __ ] battalion guys i was thinking i was thinking sam bankman freed oh that's fire too that's awesome metallic dude don't [ __ ] with nfts right now that would definitely buy whatever one of these that he rocked him so that's true [ __ ] yeah wow come on guys all right all right guys coming up next in the show we are going to do the around the horn game we're all just going to present the same prompt to all three of our lovely avatar guests here as well uh so we've got some fantastic prompts some funny jokes coming your way by your way before we get there we are going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible alcomix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stablecoin into the alchemix vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alkamix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alcomix.fi that's i a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x dot f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomixfi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smartchain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets hello we're back and uh we're back with a game called around the horn that you're probably familiar with if you are one of our top signal uh watchers so around the horn we're gonna show a prompt to the screen and uh each of these guests that we have today is gonna respond to the problem they're gonna have 30 seconds to do so and um hot takes are encouraged folks and also dunking on another hot take that somebody else made on the show is also encouraged we have a lot of good ones today and when david likes your takes he presses his button if you have a bad take this is what you get and i give the points on the screen here right like a good intern so let's get it started folks um and we don't need to always go in this and i would encourage whoever talks versus to go whoever wants to go just go i'll start playing the little 30 second timer um if that doesn't work i will just cut you off so let's let's get started first question around the horn what is the single best nft attribute across all entities it could be in one nft you name it um does anybody have one that they want to start with yeah sure uh tv head for cool cats because you can get the actual inner out and put any other nft you want in there to show it off that's very hot it's extremely hot hard to beat that surface area for more nft flexing is a pretty hot hot take what do you think tubby what is the single best nft attribute in the game remember that you're a penguin sir but i know i know okay okay uh it's it's uh it it it just has to be like the the the derpy eyes on the penguin it's just too memeable it's too viral like once you see it you just perfectly understand the you know the process of penguins and the idea that we're trying to you know it has to be the derby eyes yep derpy eyes we like that roy do you have do you have an answer for this i'm gonna as a free agent sir yeah so i'm not gonna pick a particular trait but you see it a lot of projects where they have like a little companion on the shoulder like a cat or a fox or a little animal like a monkey for some of the mutants and i love that little companion aspect within your within your avatar we like that too it's modular right so like your cam companion you can pick and choose right it depends on the project how many things we give in that dave you get a date right yeah if they gave me the date you get you get two dings for being creative but you get revoked a ding for not explicitly following the direction so back down to one day [Laughter] okay the whole monitor we appreciate that let's go next this time it's just not working but you guys are keeping it tight and we appreciate that what's the best nft avatar not represented here today what's the best nft avatar not represented here today sorry go ahead roy go ahead roy no world of women world of women mean i just think it's a great community it's a great project i like the art and they haven't really been in like the popular conversation of blue chips and stuff like that but i think that they're going to be more and more and we need more representation of women in the space as well so super that's just one ding on that all right it's hard to press it twice in a row okay two dings you got two dings two dings darn you bro that was gonna be my one you got to be quick beat me a few seconds all right i gotta go for roboto's because pablo is just so crushing it and the guy has got just energy flowing out of everything he does it's amazing um and the artwork's just sick it's just so family friendly yep agreed all right clay wrap this up here baby what is the best nfc avatar not represented here today this is a weird one but i i think it has to be crypto punch right all right we're tied up after three boys what community is your and claire i want you go first what community is your friendly rival friendly rival hey you don't have to be friendly bro i'm i'm just trying to make this a family show but like you tell me when we so when the pudgy penguins first came out and uh we were getting like pumped heavily by every like news outlet and we went to immediately to like a 4f floor it was definitely cool cats like i remember talking with tom and just like saying like holy [ __ ] what the hell's going on right uh yeah and i think that we had a healthy rivalry at the beginning and then like clearly they took they took a a you know ahead and uh yeah i think i think that was a friendly rival rivalry when we first came out and yeah it's a cuteness competition right and yeah yeah yes and we have the right stuff here what about you tom what do you think is that do you agree with that do you have anything to add on that i'm gonna get no i'm gonna get no positive dings for this answer i honestly don't see any rivalry like community-wise like i'm not saying we're above anyone i'm just saying we see ourselves as equal across the board with all of the communities because we're all in it for the long run and we're on it as a family so like [Laughter] who are you representing today in in this answer what can you i'll just keep representing the apes but um yeah tommy you stole my answer now i was gonna be like we have no rifles really [Music] [Laughter] i'm gonna say i remember back in the early days the me bits were sort of a nice friendly rivalry um remember when their flaws were about the same and then uh yeah i think one has clearly excelled plus one to smashing me beats into the ground no one likes me but they said friendly rivalry yeah who gave us our first cool cat dave is a is a me big guy give him credit for that thing this is true okay guys what nfd project made you bearish okay the core in q4 we just played that card but like hey what nft project did you just see you don't even say it by name you could describe it but what nft project made you bearish roy why don't you go first as the guy as a free agent here i have never been bearish about entities in my life [Laughter] avatar project made you buried what did you see that was like yo wait maybe i should list some of these [ __ ] cats man legit no no no never against any actual positive project for any project that is like rugging or scamming anybody like sure that's always a you know absolutely you get two for that one we don't like rugs all right clay uh you i said i know you said that we didn't have to name names but i'm just to say misfit university um that's just that's just where i was like when it first came out and i started seeing some of the traits and then like kind of the rebuttals that were given it just wasn't you know it wasn't uh i feel it it wasn't yeah enough like i i think i think that i i i i didn't think that they did anything scammy but like i think that the the like i said like some of the traits and how they lined up was pretty bad and just maybe like i don't know all right you get three for that because you answered the question and we appreciate it [Laughter] all right i want to check my answer against you guys uh ether rocks made me super bearish until they started going for a hundred and eighth and like god damn it there's still so much money to be allocated right right bell curve yep [Laughter] oh man i'm not gonna answer mine um here's the next question and let's go tom first on this one are nfc avatars a flash in the pan 2021 thing or are they here to stay through the decade what do you think i mean i i think twitter has answered this one for us by announcing that they're going to be adding the verification process for nft nfts in general great answer yeah we're crushing it all right who's next who wants to follow that up okay i think that they're absolutely here to stay we have you can just see how much people love like embracing these communities and being part of an online community i mean i think like the lockdown covert stuff helped everyone stuck at home and now they're just finding new friends around the world basically and like 10 000 is not many we're gonna have millions billions of people who want avatars it's just it's gonna be huge two very strong points yep run that up clay what do you think um they're definitely not a flash in the pan uh when i was being interviewed for new york times and the what i told him was before and this is my job because this is the best answer to the general public like when you're walking uh down the street and you have like a rolex on it could be a fake rolex there's no one there like maybe only a couple people see it and like even then it's just like you can't even guarantee that it's real but when you see like an nft profile and especially with the as tom said the twitter verification you can go check and see the proof of that that it's real and that you know so yeah i think i i think that uh online flexing is here to stay and that's you know yeah yep he just kept going all right play nice bro you made some decent points there bro all right we have three more questions for the conclusion of the show folks so bring your best the the scores are close and i'm going to give you tom give you the first opportunity here what does your community have that others do not what do the cats have the penguins don't they don't that the robotics don't that the sub ducks don't oh that's like that's a horrible question that's a legit a horrible question i you know what i i'm gonna go diplomatic on this one like i think pretty much any uh established nft community they all basically have the same thing they've all got that kind of family vibe going where everyone's like grouping together behind a common interest they've got like an amazing you know hopefully like amazing team driving the project like building it out and like essentially growing everyone's bags you know that's what a lot of people are looking for and just developing cool new stuff within the space everyone could kind of look up to and like new people coming up coming in can say yeah i want to i want to basically build on what these guys are doing and go to the next level up so i think everyone every community's got that going on mike when we were planning this show we forgot that everyone in nfts is just relentlessly positive yeah we are the gm community right so okay we like that dave do you want to give one or two dings for that oh yeah you got to go with two dinks got to go with two dings for the positivity positive points for possible 224 but hey now people can't follow up corn with that one huh so uh hey uh clay why don't you respond next what does your community have what do the pengs have that other communities don't following a a similar positive sentiment regarding the entire space um yes and also i think that our community memes better than any other community like that's just my opinion i mean i think all the memers were penguins for a summer so yeah they're like yeah hey hey that's just my opinion like i i love the memes i gotta i gotta be a little bit biased i think that the memes are uh esteer memes are strong all right roy uh so the apes i reckon i mean yes i agree with everything that was said before you know every community is excellent and has been easy but uh time i think that they've just been around longer than like obviously not longer than crypto punks and avastar's and a few other projects but in this new wave new era of community driven road map driven team driven profile pictures apes are the first will be the first we'll always be the first they're the crypto punks of this new age and that's just something that like other projects will come out and they'll release stuff and it'll be excellent it might be better and build off it but it's building off what the apes kind of started in this whole new era and the effect there tom you forgot to answer faces left true that's true that's true we're not ambitious yeah i mean roy you could have said double digit floor too um [Laughter] today like they're getting there it's under the double digit yeah super close yeah who is the biggest villain in nfts scammers dammers straight up scammers positivity gang boys was that was that you uh tom that said that first yeah yeah all right we'll give it to you for that roy you co-signed that you could say more if you want uh yeah i'll say uh the government of the united states of america [Laughter] he's not even from here folks all right i can't yeah i can't really top that but um i celebrity scammers are like a breed of their own in my opinion when they're you know coming out with like copy and paste projects when they're stealing art and they're like just coming into the space just to know it like it's just really disgusting in my opinion yeah i think we're bucketing uh pump and dumpers in the in the scammer bucket too right because those that's very very disgusting stuff get people excited all right guys look at the scores got the chills i you know in in the in the last minute of this show guys i am feeling it we are gonna go to a big question pull your corn out guys but out corn each other if you're finna do that okay why is your nft going to take over the world you don't need to dis anybody else to make this a good answer for you why is your nft going to take over the world let's see who's uh yeah player tom here you where you guys need the points i'm going to give i'm going to give clay go ahead and and take some time here why is your nft going to take over the world um i think pudgy penguins will take over take over the world because they're just universally liked like they're very unisex in nature in that uh everyone likes them it attracts multiple crowds uh there's not like the the the traits are family friendly but they're all funny so i think that uh yeah riding along that axis it's uh it's just it's just like one of the most universally appealing projects aesthetically i think the unisex point i think is a really really good point yeah no point all right cat tom well honestly everything that uh clay just said applies to the cats as well unisex we're family friendly we're standing out because we're facing left thanks to that baby it's the wrong way the wrong way yeah and you know we have that kind of ip that any company can say we wanted to work with you guys like literally any company in the world can attach themselves to us like no problem and i gotta say the cats already rule the internet right means cat memes like ever since the internet was here cats went in right all right roy why are apes going to take over the world sir i would say that we're already well on our way to taking over the world we have we have the first mover advantage we have uh there's an announce that there's going to be freaking club or bar in miami like an in real life establishment there's going to be ape fest like coming to new york city that's apes are moving into the real world and the metaverse uh i wouldn't be surprised if there's a literal yacht sailing around the world with just picking up apes and dropping them off in a few years i heard two things there so you get two points and that that puts us at a time yeah do we need the tie break or should we just give everybody some time dave uh do we have a tiebreaker question i'm not sure we do i think everyone everyone gets a monologue okay in the spirit of good vibes on the nft projects it's a three-way tie no one actually goes to the hospital the yeah the rory allen's in a group hug pump it up let's give uh let's give roy his his 30 seconds first why don't you to spotlight roy real quick and roy why don't you say anything you want to say for 30 seconds it doesn't even need to be about apes it could be about your newsletter whatever you want go ahead buddy sure uh well yeah thanks for having me on this was fun i really enjoyed it i

thank you very much for having me on this has been a load of fun um i gotta answer your question uh in as much as like when i stick to a question just like plugging ourselves i don't particularly want
