there's people who hate crypto like they hate crypto um on twitter they get very angry at nft people but the nft people get angry back at them and i think that there's a venn diagram of people who want freedom so like whether it be anti-work people or the fire people and then crypto and there's an overlap where they want freedom and they want money and they want control but um both groups are kind of talking past each other and i think there's really good aspects of crypto like creating ownership being able to control your own narrative uh you know having a community but when you when you zoom out and somebody who is from the out group is looking at the end group of crypto they see things like hyper financialization um they see things like in group versus out group like not feeling potentially welcome into the community they see the scamps and ponzis and i think that's sort of the issue is that you have a lot of people who who maybe want this element of freedom but the way that crypto is perceived going back to that concept of narratives it doesn't quite click for them in the way that i think crypto would want it to click for them
