[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what an episode first time we've had an sec commissioner on bankless and not only was she a guest she's also a listener of the show yeah absolutely fantastic pretty cool that the the great words of bankless are making all making their way all the way into the office of the sec hester purse uh more more endearingly known as crypto mom has been one of uh i think crypto's biggest allies in the space and she's careful about that word because she doesn't advocate for any specific industry but why we call her crypto mom in the crypto world is because she understands the value and what can come out of crypto and she wants to make sure that the power the dormant power that is in crypto is able to manifest in ways that are good instead are instead of being bad and it's very rare to have someone who is is in a governmental regulatory body that also understands the power that can be and is looking to help facilitate that so uh hester pierce is a fantastic ally of this base really happy to have a very deep and thorough conversation with her about a whole range of subjects such as tokens defy quote unquote self-driving banks and you know regulatory clarity and what she's optimistic about in into the future yeah and i want folks to really really appreciate what this takes is because an as an sec commissioner right like the crypto markets that's just like a fraction of your brain space i mean you're not spending all of your time thinking about crypto um hester is not like us we spend all of our time thinking about crypto right so the fact that she can talk about defy the way she does um understands what dows are understands kind of the nature of nfts and of protocols and the removal of intermediaries and can speak in an educated way about this space is super impressive and honestly is um it makes me bullish makes me excited it makes me optimistic and something that you repeat so often david is the most bullish thing for crypto is to be understood and that means understood by everyone we want like financial uh people to understand it and wall street we want silicon valley people to understand it we want everyday citizens to understand it we want regulators to understand it and in particular those that align with the value the value system of crypto which is open access to a permissionless financial system they'll just gravitate to it and they'll fight our fight for us in the places where we don't we don't we we don't occupy and we don't exist and so you know i i just think that that was a very refreshing conversation with a regulator someone that you might think is sort of like uh you know the cop trying to tell you like what you can't do uh but she really she really gets it she really understands it and she has a very nuanced perspective on d5 so just a fantastic episode the sec is only one of many regulating bodies that is relevant to crypto and so this this uh conversation does not represent all regulating bodies but if it did i would be extremely optimistic about the future of crypto and d5 regulation which is an inherently an almost impossible task to like perfectly regulate what is something that uh you know d5 moves at a speed that no one can comprehend not even ryan and i and that's a question that we ask hester like how do you even try and regulate something that moves 10 times faster than any human can keep up with and her answers there i thought were pretty compelling because she said it's not about regulating the technology it's about regulating the principles and how else are you going to regulate something that you know it has infinite possibilities with regards to what could be done on ethereum and hester understands that and and the fact that she understands that i think is really important to what can be done here with crypto to make sure that we actually produce the ecosystem that we know crypto can be yet it is not yet and i think hester would want us to to clarify that the views she expressed were her own personal opinions they were not views of the sec writ large but this of course is uh goes back to something we often say which the layer zero is people that's true for you know crypto networks that's also true for regulatory bodies there are individual people making the decisions and advocating for positions in our places in government as well so with that as an introduction we want to get right to the interview with hester purse but before we do let's take a minute to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible metamask is your go-to wallet for the bankless journey if you're going bankless you need metamask period browser and mobile get them both this is your tool to unlock the world of d5 here's my favorite part now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe this has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens choose a token you own a token to exchange it with get your quotes if you like what you see you hit swap that's it what makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes it compares dexes aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage this means you can swap a wider range of tokens and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity you don't even have to think about it try it out download metamask for desktop or mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uni swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring banglaz bankless nation we are super excited about the conversation that is about to be had we have commissioner hester purse she is one of five commissioners on the sec for those not the us that is the securities and exchange commission in the u.s it's one of the most important regulatory bodies affecting this space the sec stated mission this is important because we'll get to this is threefold protect investors number one number two maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and number three facilitate capital formation sounds like that mission has lots of intersection with crypto which is what we're going to talk about with commissioner purse today commissioner purse welcome to bankless thanks for joining us brian and david it is great to be here um i love listening to your show whenever i'm feeling discouraged i i listen to your show because you're so optimistic about the future so it's a nice uh it's a nice way to to bring my mood up i do have to start out by saying that my views are my own views not necessarily those of the sec or my fellow commissioners i think everyone in this space knows that but uh i still have to say it well thanks for saying that we appreciate it and we're glad that you are a listener that would i mean we're honored uh to hear that and certainly uh we are avid readers of your speeches because those speeches make us equally optimistic about what regulators are doing in crypto uh in addition to all of the things you say about crypto so it's an honor to have you um commissioner purse i want to start with this question because this is this is kind of a fun one but the the crypto industry has given you the moniker crypto mom and i think that's because you understand this space at a level that others don't but what's the history of that moniker i haven't really like what why does the industry refer to you uh under that moniker um well i want to start out by saying i do i i do love your show and i i listen to it but sometimes i feel like it's a bit of a foreign language so i don't want to oversell my my knowledge of the space i'm learning i'm still learning and i'm definitely open to learning and you guys are helping me on that journey um but in terms of the the moniker it came after i wrote a dissent on a bitcoin etp um and after that someone came up with the title and it's it's kind of stuck since then what was that dissent i'm just curious about the history around that well when i got to the sec it was i got there in january of 2018 and so that was just about the time people were thinking about doing a bitcoin exchange traded product there had been some efforts before i arrived but then um after i arrived there was there was a denial of one and i wrote a dissent saying hey you know i think bitcoins ready for an exchange-traded product you're applying different standards then you apply to different kinds of products so what's the story here why don't we move forward and you know that was three years ago and look where we are today same place same place that's right i think the the crypto mom name came out of k it's kind of a it's very an endearing term and it's it's something i think out of the crypto space we are really lacking in good uh representation in our in our governing bodies in our in people that represent what crypto can bring to the world and you know it's crypto often has you know a very tainted brand um there there's just generally negative connotations and it takes um someone who can come in with an open mind and see what what me and ryan see and be optimistic about the future of of crypto uh and so i but before we get this conversation started just thank you for for being that representative person that that our industry truly needs to to help facilitate what can be good crypto innovation well i mean that's nice of you to say i i will say that you know i don't advocate for any particular technology or any particular industry but what i do think is important and something that we've kind of lost as a nation is to remember that the government is is there to serve the people it isn't the other way around and so you know they're they're people who are trying to do things and build new things and try new things and some of those experiments are going to fail i mean we know we know that when you're when innovation is happening a lot of failure has to happen along the way um but this notion that it's that you have to get permission before you can try things i think is really detrimental to our society i think that's uh really what david was referring to commissioner purse when he mentioned that not so much an advocate representing an industry but an advocate representing some values that we in crypto hold dear and i want to ask you about this because we very much think the values of crypto open permissionless um you know basically self-sovereign for the people sort of financial system aligns very well with american values some of the bankless community recently referred me to this um article uh from someone that was written in 1999 a gentleman by the name of ira magaziner and apparently he was an advisor to the clinton administration articles called creating a framework for global electronic commerce and he kind of goes through how they um navigated the regulatory waters and sort of the government waters when it came to the internet because when the internet arose there were all of these questions like what about encryption what about privacy you know what happens if we get this communication technology to the people and he talked about the internet as a force for progress how it aligned and identified with american values and education open internet freedom of speech democratization people i'm curious crypto does crypto does open permissionless blockchains is that in alignment with the values embedded in the us constitution yeah i mean i think it's certainly in line with what we are as a country and the fundamentals of what this country are which is that we want people to be able to engage with one another in mutually beneficial transactions that are voluntary and really the government should be stepping in only when there's an issue of someone harming someone else and i think the whole crypto peer-to-peer model is one in which you've got people voluntarily engaging with one another um in in ways that they find to be beneficial to to you know each party finds beneficial and why should we stand in the way of that um as a government i think we should try to encourage that kind of thing because it's it's better for society when you have people cooperating with one another so i'm curious maybe this comes from um a recent speech where you you articulated this well that you made in in february um it's called atomic trading and i'll note it had uh rocket emojis in the title of the speech at least as it was published in the sac so maybe some crypto culture leaking out here um but you made this comment you said technology does not change our regulatory objectives of protecting investors facilitating capital formation and fostering market integrity but for technology to have its maximum benefit we will need to change our attitude specifically we tend to look at technology technological innovation the markets with deep suspicion and that mindset has to change i felt like in the speech you were making kind of this this dual argument that hey like first um our mandate at the sec as regulators hasn't really changed you know people are still as as we call it on bank list the base layer of this entire system and people really haven't changed uh across the centuries but at the same time regulators government specifically has to look at technological innovation with an open mindset rather than suspicion can you get into that and you know why you made why you made those comments well i think one of the issues with regulators is that we you know we're people too right and that was that was part of the theme of the speech we have our own concerns about if something goes wrong people are going to come back and they're going to say hey why did you let this happen you know you could have you could have shut this down before it became a problem and so we have to fight against that natural reserve on our part that national natural conservatism and say look we're willing to take a risk as regulators to allow people to and i hate to use the term allow people but to not stand in the way of people trying new things um because those new things could be good for society and so we have to constantly uh push against that and of course we have our mandate so we're always going to be thinking about protecting investors we're always going to be thinking about the integrity of the markets but if you don't if you don't open the doors and allow for technology to come in people are going to lose out and we're seeing that so in our sector um everything we're very much about getting disclosure to investors that's a very important part of our mission but we're very much rooted in this paper-based approach and so if you compare what things are like in non-financial sectors versus financial sectors they tend to be much more backwards much more old school in the financial sector than in other sectors and and people come to the financial sector and they already don't really want to spend a lot of time thinking about finance i mean it's it's boring it's intimidating and then you tell them and we want you just to look at this thick layer of documents and read through them and and people say no i'd rather be doing my online shopping on my phone and so if we can try to marry those and allow financial firms to use technology to communicate with investors i think that's a good thing now you are saying we want to just jettison the old financial system altogether and go for this new this new model over here and my point of that is you know hey why not let people try those things too peer-to-peer systems are very good for for other reasons and so we should as regulators we should kind of like the fact that people are trying peer-to-peer because it has certain qualities of resilience that that a centralized financial system doesn't have but again we tend to to you know be very slow to allow that to embrace that commissioner i want to get your opinion on what the what the potential that lies dormant in the crypto world has to to offer the world and i think going back to why this crypto industry has bestowed the title of crypto mom to you is we we think that you see that potential in there and with that potential that crypto has to offer what do we have at stake with good regulation versus bad regulation like what what do we have to lose if bad regulation happens what do we have to gain if we can create good regulation well on the bad regulation front i think we're seeing a little bit of this now because a lot of things in crypto move so quickly regulators move so slowly other regulators in other places tend to be moving faster many of them are moving faster than than we are in the us and so what happens is you have people trying to avoid the us all together um not only not building stuff here but they're they're trying to avoid even dealing with us persons and that's a very dangerous thing because then we'll miss out on a lot of that growth i think good regulation is is difficult to do because the technology is changing quickly what we've learned from the past is that it's really bad to bake old technology or any particular technology into the regulations so i would say on a sort of on a general point you want to have regulation be as technology neutral as possible to allow for experimentation that said i think in the crypto space um we may need to do some specific crypto specific regulation to allow the freedom for some of these things to to work and it's it's a big job because i think you know i've i've suggested we need to do something to allow token distribution events to happen but i think there's stuff we need to do on the custody side um and then there's if you want to look further down the road um if if you want to have a regulatory structure that that envisions dowse i think you have to think about that as well but in general i would say that the the the hope that i see and the the the um good things i see coming out of crypto is this ability to bring more people into the financial system to allow them to come in on their own terms you know doing away and again i don't think we're going to do away with the centralized uh financial system i don't think we're going to do away with financial institutions you you guys might disagree with me on that but i think having this other option of of really self-serve you know just do it do it yourself do it with peers do it on an anonymous basis so that no one is deciding to shut you out of the system because they don't agree with you there's real there's real promise to incorporating more of the the american population and the world population into the financial system um by using by using these these technologies i gotta say it's so refreshing to hear you articulate it in that way because that that is definitely the language that that we preach and it makes me optimistic even to hear you um use terms like dao's in like a correct context um so glad you're you're diving deep on this can you make the case so um david asked about sort of the the cost if regulation is not done right but i i don't think the crypto industry writ large sees the other side of this which is what are the benefits if regulation is done correctly can you make that case to bankless listeners well i think getting it right means that then you give people the freedom to stop thinking so much about regulation you know i i it kind of disheartens me to listen to these podcasts and half the time people are talking about regulation instead of what's being built so one is just removing this distraction from people so that they can concentrate on what they're best at but second is i mean the united states has a history of being a place where people from all over the world come to work together and build things now you know i guess one could argue in in this new world we don't all need to be in the same place have you guys even met each other yet because i know at one point not yet so i think right david i think that's becoming a meme like are we ever going to meet we may never meet at this point commissioner we're not sure but i mean i feel like you don't you don't even you know you've got this really natural interaction with one another without even having met and so maybe we don't we're not going to be as geographic centric but i still like the notion of having the united states be the place where people want to come because it's a free place it's a place where they can build things and try things and and work with other people who are equally creative and enthusiastic and so i think if we don't want to lose our place i our capital markets are the best in the world and i you know i stand by that but we have to remain nimble to do that so i think i would say you know to people who are asking why does regulation matter it really does matter to allow people that freedom to to be their best at doing what they're best at well this is what's interesting is because um david and i and i think listeners to the bankless show really believe that this parallel financial system that we're building this thing called defy is going to play a massive role in the future of finance in the future of money in the future of how banking continues you know uh on the internet basically um but you also articulated in in your speech which i'm going to refer to once again that this kind of presents can present a challenge to regulators and maybe defy is one of the bigger challenges that they've seen we've had waves of challenges with like what is this bitcoin thing and then what is this ethereum thing and then like what are icos and now we have this d5 thing cropping up and it doesn't just touch areas of the sec or cftc it touches fincen it touches the entire banking financial apparatus in the u.s i'm going to read a quote out to you from your speech decentralized finance will provide a very good test for our ability to regulate with an eye toward protecting the interests of investors markets and this is key not incumbents um can you talk about the challenges of d5 as regulators are are looking at this now and trying to to figure out what's going on well the the regulatory model especially you know a model like the ascc is really reliant upon looking at particular institutions as a center point right so if we if there's an issue if there's a problem we know who to go to it's that it's that financial institution at in the middle that's intermediating between two people with defy you don't necessarily i mean you don't have a central entity to go to and you might not even know who wrote a smart contract right and and if you do is it even appropriate to go to that person i would argue not so you really don't have anyone to hold accountable and i think that that's that's kind of the the challenge it's also the beauty of this because i think when when you when you're dealing with something like defy where it's really up to the people involved to make their own decisions the responsibility is clearly on them and so we have to that's the message right because when something goes wrong people want to come to us and say we'll do something about it and in d5 i'm not sure what we could do about it if there's a problem so it's it it is you know if you think of a decentralized exchange for example um or an automated market maker who do who do we go to when something goes wrong i don't know who to go to so that's that's the big challenge for the regulator the interesting thing is there's there's really no one to go to it's your point this is all this is all code um this is also why we end every episode by by talking about cryptos this is the frontier it's not for everyone this is sort of the the wild west and if you're playing in this space you have to take personal accountability a new level of personal accountability um but what you just well that's why i actually do appreciate that disclaimer that you have at the end of your episodes because i think that's an important message it's exciting to be part of this but being part of it means that you are taking a risk and if if you're not comfortable with that risk you shouldn't walk down that road so that's why i think there's going to be you know even as d5 grows i think there there's going to be a way for people who aren't comfortable with that to be served so i think there will be some element of centralization that people can opt into or opt out of and that's probably the the best solution right that people can choose their level of comfort and their level of willingness to take risks completely agree this is we we sort of uh harken this to to the oregon trail right you could get dysentery you could you know break an axle wheel you could starve on the road lots of bad things can happen to you when you're on this other side but i want to ask a question about um regulators current understanding of this because i think you articulated it very well like in d5 there aren't intermediaries but we're like looking from the outside not actually sure how many regulators understand defy at that level yet like some of the um conversations some of the the the verbiage some of the the tone coming out uh sometimes makes us think that they think defy might just be another kind of banking sort of thing where ever there are intermediaries there are custodians at all times how close are regulators to understanding that we're talking about um code we're talking about no intermediaries we're talking about a a different level of self-sovereignty when it comes to to this financial system i mean i think people haven't spent that much time thinking about it yet honestly i think it's it's still as much as defy has has been having its moment and growing or maybe its preliminary moment and growing really fast i just think there's not a lot of attention on it i mean you've got to keep in mind that regulators are just now coming around to the idea that well maybe bitcoin is is is going to be around for a little while um so i defy is is really not on people's radar but i mean i think we need to be having these conversations before it it really grasps um people's attention because what i'm concerned about and i think it's better just to have this conversation out in the open what i'm concerned about is that when people see things move peer-to-peer people who are regulatory minded their initial inclination is to say let's figure out a way to grab those peer-to-peer transactions figure out a way to monitor them and let's figure out a way to um regulate them and though that raises those kinds of inclinations raise really profound questions for us as an american people there are obviously reasons why we would want to monitor those things you know we aml kyc you wanna you don't want the financial system whether it's the decentralized one or the centralized one to be used to fund activities or other illegal activity so we get that um and and you i mean i guess there are other types of things that you would you know i think about investor protection you want investors to be protected but at the same time the value of privacy the value of people's ability to transact without having government watch what you're doing in your in your individual financial life those are really important principles and i think if we don't put that out there and say we care about these things and you can't just plow over personal privacy and the ability of people to live their lives without being monitored we're going to end up in a really bad situation really quickly it's very interesting to me in my in the in the more traditional securities land that i occupy and spend most of my time in we're just now starting this massive surveillance program for every trade in the in the markets every in the stock in options markets every retail trade is going to be tracked in those markets now and i don't think that's okay and people say well why why don't you think it's okay if you have nothing to hide why do you care and my response to that is you don't have to have something to hide you just don't necessarily want some regulator seeing every stock you buy in every stock you sell because there's something personal about that now if you're doing something wrong of course we as regulators are going to go in and look at what you're doing totally fine but for for the average person just going about her day-to-day business to have to to have to think about being monitored all the time i find that really problematic and i think that's going to be a real challenge in the d5 space and it's one where we really need to confront head on i completely agree it's been sort of a trend on bankless or a theme i should say on bankless that as we enter this new digital world as american citizens or as people in their respective jurisdictions all over the world enter the digital world we have to be very careful we don't erode and lose all of the freedoms we fought for in the analog world because this data to your point is just so easy to track and if we don't have that conversation and set up that value system now and even embed those values into our protocols the people are going to lose i couldn't agree with you more how important is it um for regulators and and government in general to get sort of um good narratives i was i was struck by an article that i think brian brooks wrote from the occ this article about you know uh d5 being sort of like a self-driving car and the regulator's response to that how was an article like that received and is that sort of thing helpful to help those in government understand what's happening in d5 i think it is important narrative matters i mean we've seen the negative narrative has really carried a lot of weight for a lot of many years um the negative narrative around bitcoin which is then sort of shifted to all of crypto and then you had all the ico fraud going on in 2017 that negative narrative has really held on too so i think countering that with positive narratives is really important and there are positive narratives to tell i mean this is not you know this this this is not just one-off stories there really are positive narratives of people being empowered to make their own decisions of of people being able to get paid whereas before they wouldn't get be able to get paid and get paid and something that's of value to them um you know so there are there are really are positive um freedom affirming values that i think and stories that can be told but i think people need to do a better job of of telling those and they do matter to regulators um because that's what you know regulators think about when they when they approach an issue if they have in their mind oh bitcoin is all about um you know silk road or crypto is all about ico fraud or whatever whatever the the current negative thing is you know people will grab hold of that it's pretty remarkable and i think you were articulating something that is also a theme on on bankless um and that's this idea that um while defy and cryptocurrency and blockchain open permissionless blockchains we think is going to disrupt finance and disrupt banking they're also going to co-exist and co-exist in some pretty cool ways so uh we we have this idea on bankless we refer to as uh the d5 mullet where you've got like you know fintech in the front but you've got d5 in the back um and i've i've heard rumor as uh commissioner purse that that you've described you've used the d5 d5 yeah i feel a little bit bad because i stole that from you and i used it no we um we very much want these sorts of narratives to spread because uh education is is so important but can we talk about that so the idea of the the d5 mullet it's just a you know funny way of saying that fintech and uh d5 crypto systems are going to coexist and in fact crypto open permissionless blockchain systems will make banking and fintech so much more efficient right we're we're literally building things on on legacy financial rails now and we can rebuild on these crypto rails i'm wondering if if you see that the the wins there in general for the us banking system and if regulators see those wins yeah i mean i think there certainly are lots of opportunities for that to happen we have a financial system i mean i spend most my time thinking about the securities world but you know our payments our payment system is is is pretty antiquated i think people would say um antiquated might be too strong of a word but but there's there's definitely room for modernization and so i think people will be looking to crypto as as a way to modernize the underlying infrastructure um and you know whether that's with stable coins or you know potentially down the road we're gonna have um a cbdc but i think you know d5 i think that's why i i do like this d5 mullet imagery because you can imagine defy and as i said i think some people are still going to want to have that centralized interface and so i think they'll do is you can set it up so as much as possible is done through crypto and defy and then in the front you do have a a a way for people to interact with people or with institutions so i doubt that this is again you guys might disagree but i doubt that this is going to be a world where we just flip immediately from centralized to decentralized i think centralized parties in the financial system are looking for ways that they can incorporate crypto into what they do and how they serve their customers absolutely long live the d5 mullet hey guys i hope you're enjoying the interview so far in the second half of this interview with hester we get into uh gary gensler and hester's optimism about gary's strong level of understanding of the crypto space but also where her and gary don't yet see eye to eye i also bring up the conversation of the role of tokens and how the sec can ensure the maximum potential of tokens is unleashed while still mitigating their potential for abuse and then we also ask hester about how the sec intends to make sure that regulation can keep up with a world that always seems to be perpetually accelerating and then of course we get into the conversation of a bitcoin etf and even an ether etf and some of the nuances and intricacies and difficulties that has risen as a result of the slow response to this etf really enjoyed having hester on the bankers podcast but before we go any further we need to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i

yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics let's talk a little bit about the the sec so we've talked about the broadly uh government regulation government regulators and and sort of the the cost of getting it wrong and the benefits of getting it right before we talk about the sec and maybe some of the things it's got gotten right some of the things maybe you feel like it's needs improvement off track can you do a quick recap for the audience uh on the sec so the purpose of the sec i said in my introduction i think that's a very clean mission statement and actually a pretty inspiring mission statement maybe you could reflect on that and then uh my understanding is there are five sec commissioners of which you are one uh and that there's a chairperson that chairperson uh has now changed from jay clayton whom some might know in crypto i believe is is gary gensler now confirmed or is he in the process of being confirmed can you give us some background on everything that's going on so the the sec is about 90 years old and it is showing its age a little bit it it is one of the federal financial regulators the u.s is pretty unusual in the number of financial regulators it has both at the federal level and the state level and so it can be quite a complicated um ticket to work through if you're trying to do something in this space we are one of two regulators federal regulators for the capital markets um which which is basically those are the markets where investors come and they put capital in and businesses come and they take capital out distinguishing it from the lending sector which is you know the bank regulators handle that um so we oversee the stock exchanges the options exchanges we oversee broker-dealers and investment advisors we are not a merit regulator which means that if someone comes to us with an investment product our job is to get the disclosures in shape so that an investor can understand what he or she is buying but not tell them don't buy this product so we definitely write lots of rules um but our mission really as you said i think that mission statement is a nice clean mission statement protecting investors and on that on that aspect i always try to emphasize that protecting investors means not only trying to prevent them from from getting hurt by pointing out to them that their their red flags they should be looking for when they invest things that they should be thinking about by getting them disclosure so they can really make a good informed decision but also um making sure that investors have the opportunities they want to invest in the things they want to invest in um then on the on the market integrity point we think a lot about market integrity we want to make sure that our markets are places where people feel comfortable coming in and transacting um so that's one of the things we think about for example with the recent gamestop and other meme stock events where people were were saying well the markets they had concerns about the markets um or they were concerned with the volatility and those kinds of things we care about that because market integrity does matter and then on the capital formation side it's really important for people in the united states to be able to come to our capital markets no matter the size of their business from the very smallest to the very largest to be able to raise capital to build something that they that they um believe that you know that we're there their talents are going to be used so they're trying to build a business we want to make sure that we're that our markets are there to allow them to do that um we are in as you said there are five of us we're unusual in that some agencies are headed by just one person we're headed by five we're an independent regulatory agency which means that we're a creation of congress and we are responsible to congress we're not um we're not part of the executive branch meaning that we're not directly responsible to the whoever the president is we're a politically balanced commission um by law we were politically balanced um so right now we're at four because uh gary gensler is waiting in the wings to be confirmed he is um what i think likely to uh have a confirmation vote sometime this month and so we could see him coming in sometime relatively quickly but we deal with lots of things and so i think one thing to always emphasize when i talk to a to a crypto crowd is that crypto is one piece of what we do but it's a pretty small piece of the whole picture yeah totally understood you know i'm curious so uh assuming uh gary gensler does get confirmed how much does the chairperson's kind of posture understanding of of crypto sort of change the trajectory i think the the narrative around gary gensler coming in is that um i mean this is somebody who understands blockchains understands uh cryptocurrency and so there's some enthusiasm from the crypto community about his ability to bring this understanding into into regulatory policy do you share some of that enthusiasm i do absolutely i mean i think having someone like him who really has that that base layer of knowledge um coming in so that then he can really think about okay how does this interact with the regulatory structure you don't have to have the initial conversation you don't have to tell the narrative of there's something positive here because he already knows that he's been at mit he's been engaged with students who are really smart who are working on these issues he's passionate about that i can tell just by talking to him um i i've had i i've known him for quite some time and and had a chance to go up to mit actually and do an event with him a couple years ago um and so i think he'll come in with that really strong base and that will be helpful in figuring out where where he thinks we need to move forward the chairman of the agency is important in the sense that he not only manages the staff that's the chairman's job but he also sets the agenda so clearly he'll take input from from others but ultimately he sets the agenda and so this is an opportunity for us to get some of these crypto issues that have been really not moving to to move forward i think i think it will be helpful um so it's a good confluence of events i think the industry has really matured but we're also getting sort of a fresh start with the new chairman um and so i'm hopeful so what will be some of your initial ask it's good with someone like gary you don't have to have the the initial conversation about like what is crypto what is blockchain what is even d5 maybe you know we can even talk in terms of dows uh to mr gensler that would certainly be exciting but what will some of your key asks be for the agenda moving forward as it pertains to crypto well so i think one of the things i'm going to ask for is that i put out a safe harbor for for token distribution events basically that would allow people to do those in a way that they would they would know is compliant with the securities laws i'm not wedded to my particular safe harbor um but i would like him to take that and and say if you're not going to do that let's think of something else we can do in this space because right now there's such tremendous uncertainty and people really do not feel comfortable from from my understanding and talking to people they don't feel comfortable involving u.s people in any kind of token distribution event because there's the potential of an enforcement action down the road so we need to get some kind of regulatory safe harbor out there for that second i would say that we need to allow traditional financial institutions to engage with crypto which means addressing issues like custody um because right now people just don't feel comfortable doing that there are lots of questions i mean some traditional financial institutions have jumped right in but many are standing on the sidelines kind of waiting for guidance there and then third i would say you know a bitcoin exchange traded product and potentially an eth-based exchange-traded product is is you know one of those is likely to come down the road at some point here and and we we always look at these things on based on their facts and circumstances so there's no guarantee but but i think the fact that we haven't moved one of those forward yet is something that i will definitely have a conversation with the new chairman about can we talk about the safe harbor for a minute because i think that's important so what specifically are uh what was your original proposal in the safe harbor is it basically that there would be so here's my high level like non-researched understanding of it but um somebody someone launches a token a team a project launches a token um they would have a three-year period of time to cross this line of being sufficiently decentralized and during that three-year period of time the token wouldn't be subject to traditional uh securities regulations and that sort of thing but after that three year period year period of time if there is clarity on the token um you know crossing that line of being sufficiently decentralized then it would not be a security at that point in time be treated maybe as bitcoin or something like this that's a really fuzzy understanding of it but no that's a that's a good description yeah that's that's kind of the overview i mean during that period you've got to make certain disclosures and you are subject to the anti-fraud law so you can't just lie as you're making those disclosures and i think that the rationale behind doing the safe harbor was look there's there is real concern that people who are buying tokens aren't getting good information so let's try to address that legitimate concern um but let's also try to give people the freedom to build out the networks because i continue to not understand how you can build a network if you're not allowed to give your tokens out it seems like it's not that easy to do so that's the problem i'm trying to solve with with the safe harbor with the uh onboarding of gary gensler into the the as a commissioner um how does that make how optimistic are you that you that the sec is going to get done what it wants to get done do you think that he's going to help move the needle and also let's we could also talk about um just the the progress that the sec has made with regards to crypto regulations so far um how would you uh rate the the what the sec has gotten done and how do you think that might change now that uh gary gensler is coming on board well i am optimistic look i don't think we've done a good job so far and this is not a this is not a condemnation of the staff at the sec as i say they're really natural reasons that regulators tend to be very conservative because they don't want people to get hurt and they don't want to upset the integrity of markets either and so there's there's there's this concern but i think what you need from the top of an agency is you need to someone to say and in our case it's the commissioners to say we get that there's a risk to to allowing new things to allow again i i don't like to use that term in connection with regulation because i don't think that we should operate from a baseline of things not being allowed i think we should operate from a baseline of things are allowed unless there's a reason not to allow them but the world we live in is one where you know you have to get permission to move forward um so so i we need from the top of the agency to be saying we get there's a risk but we think there's some there's some really important rewards at the end of the day so let's move this forward and that's why i'm optimistic that with a new chairman coming in we can have a little bit of a reset a chance to rethink things um you know i think that chairman clayton much to you know a lot of people in this space are not happy with with the approach that has been taken over the last number of years with respect to crypto chairman clayton was a very good chairman and worked on lots of issues but i think we could have been moving faster on the crypto stuff um in fact he i think one of his new one of his new uh jobs is is is crypto related um so i think it is an opportunity for us as institutions are expressing more interest to just take this new turn to take a a new look um and to to move forward so i'm i'm hopeful um and and i think i don't think it's only uh chairman gensler either i think my colleagues see the growth in this space they see the interest in this space and so i'm hopeful that we'll all just be able to sit down together take a fresh look do some of these things revisit some of the positions that we've had in the past but that said on something like an exchange traded product where you've laid out an analysis and you've said hey this is what we're looking for when it comes to a bitcoin exchange traded product and presumably the same the same comments would be given with an east based exchange traded product then to say okay well no we're gonna we're gonna look at it in a different way we're gonna look at it the way we've looked at other types of exchange traded products it's hard to go back and change the course that you're on so that's why i have said in other contexts i think we have dug ourselves into a little bit of a hole by taking these positions in the past which are very crypto specific positions um instead of applying the standards that we apply to other types of products that we regulate what would you say are some regulatory leaders that the sec has had what are some uh good examples of good regulation that that you're proud of that's come out of the sec with respect to crypto or just in respect to crypto yeah um okay you're gonna really challenge me here oh wow uh okay so i would say one good thing that we've done is um right before the end of the year we put out a it was it was a sort of a pilot program that gave gave broker dealers five years within which they could experiment with digital asset securities now that begs the question of what's a digital asset security and what isn't so that's a difficult question but i think that was a an important first step to saying we get that this is going to happen we're trying to set up a framework within which this can happen now we can quibble as i have about how um limited that was that you know for example you can't hold any non-digital non-security digital assets which means that if you want to get you know paid an ether or bitcoin and you want to exchange you want to have people pay in that to get digital asset securities you couldn't do that um and there are other restrictions that i think are too restrictive but i think that is a positive start now the other thing that we've done is we have established a fin hub which is our our office of financial innovation basically financial technology and i think having a group of people at the sec who are thinking about these kinds of things on a regular basis who are more technologically adept than the rest of us at the sec um those are positive things as well and they've had a lot of interaction with the community they have these peer-to-peer meetups which they now do virtually so that i think is a great interface to have we've also issued some no action letters i've been and a no action letter is essentially it's a letter that you get you describe what it is you're trying to do you go into the sec they give you a letter back that says if you do it exactly the way you said you did it and maybe apply some conditions on it um then we're not going to recommend an enforcement action against you so it effectively gives you comfort that you can move forward we've used a couple of those in the crypto space i think it's not a bad a bad thing to do although they've been very limited in scope and i mean i think in some of the circumstances i would even argue i'm not sure why these people even had to come in to get permission to do this because it doesn't seem in our bailiwick at all but i think having that mechanism there and available for people is a positive thing it does sound like maybe some infrastructure is there that could be useful that wasn't there previously but but i'm also wondering about this i'm kind of putting myself maybe in like your shoes or the people who are are advocating for uh regulators and those in government to take another look at crypto it's got to be hard to do it when in 2017 you've got you got a lot of uh shenanigans going on right there there are many um empty promises and empty tokens um we we all know that that era uh didn't have didn't have the strongest projects coming out of it so i imagine 2017 2018 is probably very hard to to make the case uh you know among regulators that that crypto is an industry with some staying power and doing some good in the world and doing some good for the u.s but now i feel like things are different so we're 20 21 d5 is here it's actually being used um there are protocols like like uniswap that are doing billions uh in in trading volume um there are decentralized protocols like compound and ave that are allowing individuals to to essentially take out loans collateralize backed loans on this open transparent financial system we actually have the promise of defy and crypto kind of like growing up so there's some real stuff that's happening here i'm just curious does that make the case that you're trying to make easier is it easier in 2021 versus 2017 when there's some actual real stuff that's built here is it just as hard as ever well i mean i think you're right to point out that 27 so i when i got to the the sec in 2018 the dow report we had just issued the dow report to say hey people you know if you're doing some of this stuff it could end up being a securities offering so you better be careful um and and then we brought a series of cases and i think i mean i i should have included that in the thing the list of positive things we've done i think the cases involving fraud are particularly important to say to people if you're doing a fraudulent securities offering and you're draping it in a crypto cloak you know too bad we're going to come after you because you're just defrauding people and you know people are people and they will find ways to defraud people so i think that that was important for us to lay that marker down the unfortunate thing and this isn't true only with respect to crypto but a big part of my job every week is to look at enforcement cases and to vote on them and so we're getting this constant stream of really bad fact patterns where people are stealing from their mothers their brothers their friends and their you know running off and you know using it for all kinds of nefarious purpose using the money for all kinds of well i mean they think it's positive but it's pretty see pretty seedy stuff that they're they're using the money for and so you see this and you're getting this constant flow and you think wow everyone out there is trying to rip someone off because you're seeing so many bad things and so it can be really hard to move past that even with respect to the traditional financial system you're suspicious because you do see and and everyone does need to be skeptical no matter who you're interacting with if someone is doing something that looks odd to you or they're not answering your questions you should run the other way um so that's it's healthy to have that skepticism but i think from a regulator's perspective the negative stuff can really overshadow the positive stuff and so with respect to d5 specifically and everything that's going on in the d5 space i mean from my perspective it's really fascinating to see this right it's this it's this financial system that's growing up outside of the traditional financial system to meet the needs that people have to enable them to to to enter into financial transactions in new ways and i think wow this is really interesting that these people have kind of come up with this from scratch i mean you know they learn the lessons from the traditional system but they're coming up with it on their own they're figuring out how to collateralize these loans you know sometimes things work better than others right and there have been some pretty pretty big instances of people saying whoa i didn't expect that was going to happen but it's still this trial and error stuff and i find it really exciting but i will tell you that the average regulator does not find dyna dynamic growth like that exciting they find it to be very intimidating because if it's happening we need to be regulating it so i would say that the growth i don't i don't know that you're you're getting a uniform wow this is really kind of cool that this stuff is happening i think you're getting more oh uh as this grows bigger we better figure out how to how to how to regulate it and we do have to be thinking about those things i mean we do have to be thinking about do these things interact with the securities laws so i've asked that question where does defy interact with the securities laws because i want people in the defy world to be thinking about that too because i don't want to end up in a situation like 2018 2017 2018 where people are doing things and then several years later we're coming in with an enforcement action and saying you shouldn't have done that i'd rather have us be clear up front here's where there might be an intersection with the securities laws or maybe it's not the securities laws maybe it's the banking laws so that people know and can make decisions and we then we can think about whether we need to change the rules and maybe we do maybe we don't i think that clarity is definitely what the crypto industry is craving as well and do you think at least in the near run we'll see some of that clarity with this sort of reset as you call it kind of this this blank slate is that and one you mentioned uh safe harbor address you know custody bitcoin etf but like clarity is really what the crypto industry is hoping for is is that going to happen anytime soon well and i think that's that's the thing that i found pretty refreshing about dealing with people in crypto you know they're not coming to me and saying hester please don't regulate us um they're coming and saying just tell us what you what the regulations are and we'll figure out a way to work around that i mean not work around them in a nefarious way but we'll figure out a way to build our businesses build the projects that we're building within the regulatory structure but you can't not tell us what the regulatory structure is and then come in after the fact and say ha you violated the rules that we didn't tell you um so so i do think that that's that's why i'm optimistic gary gensler and i don't necessarily see eye to eye you know i tend to be a pretty deregulatory person by nature he tends to be based on based on his his prior job running the cftc the other capital markets regulator he tends to take a more regulatory approach than i do but i think he appreciates the value of regulatory clarity and so i do think that we can come to an agreement about laying out some some regulatory clarity for people so that they know what they're dealing with um and that's why i'm really optimistic because i i think we can we can take that challenge on and he'll appreciate the importance of that challenge um and and so i am optimistic commissioner paris i'd like to dive right into the lines then here and get to the subject of tokens specifically uh and as we know tokens on ethereum have had a sketchy past and i think this fits in the model of how technology uh improves you know bitcoin one of the first use cases of bitcoin was buying drugs on the silk road that is no longer the primary use of bitcoin uh and like in 2017 the primary use of tokens were these you know largely vapor icos but now they are now the ethereum ecosystem is innovating at large and they've turned into d5 tokens which represent capital assets that's something new uh but extending this into the future and something that we get really optimistic about on bank list is the the coordinating power of tokens as community coordination tools and we recently saw the power of a recent nft being sold for half a million dollars that got a bunch of people to coordinate their capital because they wanted that using the power of ethereum and it was just purchasing a token that was a piece of art and there are many other tokens that represent just the coordinating power of a community at large to come together uh among shared cultural values and ethos to produce something as a community and i think in the era of this very digital world that covet has helped accelerate and like how we were talking about between me and ryan how we coordinated on the internet with and now ryan's one of my best friends and i haven't met him yet it's it's the power of these communities that uh are built on ethereum that is makes me optimistic about the future and so with that framing in mind how do you see the dormant power in tokens and what could be expressed and then how can the sec help express that power versus stifling it i mean that's a big question right so my first response to that is what is the sec's role the sec's role is not to be the visionaries who are thinking about how these things can be used it's to to set that framework within which this can happen and i think it's exciting to see you know i don't i i will candidly tell you i don't fully understand everything that's happening in the in the d5 space and i certainly don't fully understand everything that's happening around nfts um i think there's there i have a lot of learning to do on that um but i think what what we should be doing is allowing that experimentation to be happening and figuring out ways that we can again provide that clarity so that people can can feel free to to to enter into those transactions i think we have to stop being so so so skittish about peer-to-peer engagements um so i think we're going to have to figure out a way to to grapple with the peer-to-peer element that's something that really is quite new for us um and so and then we also have to just figure out where where our authority lies and where the jurisdictional lines are that can be something that's pretty tricky and we haven't really talked about that um today but i think the sec has has a has a mandate but the cftc has its mandate and then the ftc has its mandate so whatever we can do to provide clarity on that i think congress has some interest in in sort of nudging us along the that path of of dividing jurisdiction explaining who whose jurisdiction something is um so that's i think a piece that if we were to do could be helpful but there's a lot of legal work that needs to be done too to think about how what the legal rights associated with a lot of these things are and that's a little bit beyond i think our ambit that just has to happen kind of in the private sphere as people work these things out one of one of my personal favorite things about this base is how fast it moves and how fast it moves is extremely intimidating like me and ryan are full-time trying to keep up with this space and even we don't even keep up with it so i can't imagine what it must be like to be at the sec where things just tend to move a little bit slower in the world of regulation and this acceleration of innovation and ethereum it only seems to be accelerating even more so how do you how do you think about how governmental bodies in the sec is going to be able to keep up with something that is perpetually always moving faster and faster i mean that's a big challenge for us but i think that that helps us think about how we need to regulate which is going back to this idea of technology neutrality um and and and really setting some broad principles within which this growth experimentation um within which that can happen um so that's that's the best thing we can do i mean we do need to have more people at the agency who know the space better um and that is difficult for a lot of reasons you know i don't think most people in this space really think oh i'd love to work at a regulator um and so so how do we how do we draw on the knowledge from outside i mean i think if people who are listening have ideas about what what i can do to to get better educated myself or to um better you know to how we can better educate the sec and other regulators i'm certainly open to those ideas um but it's it it will be a challenge going forward keep listening to bankless commissioner pierce thanks no need to call me sure thanks we're at that point in the conversation yeah well since we're at that point in the conversation so i'm curious to get just your your take you might not have a take on some of these specific things but uh as we're in the section of talking about tokens um and you threw out nfts what's your take on nfts does the sec have any jurisdiction here do you have any like ideas uh in terms of what how the sec might play a role or is it just too early well i think partly too early but but there is a possibility that if we are talking about an nft that you're fractionalizing um that's one example of where i think the securities laws might might intersect another example i think is um if you're dealing you you could imagine nfts being actual securities like so taking equity securities and turning them into nfts and it's a little too early for me to see how exactly that would work but that would certainly mean that the nfts would be within our within our remit um so i think we are what i always tell people is if you're doing something where you're going out and you're raising money to build something or you're taking something and you're slicing it up and you're saying i'm going to manage this for you this sliced up thing and and and you'll get profits based on it you've got to be thinking in terms of the securities laws because those things sound like very securities like now again i can't give financial advice i have to give that disclaimer but i do want people to be thinking okay what is the purpose of the securities laws the securities laws are there to make sure that people who are buying into something where it's the efforts of other people who are going to make that thing rise in value and the person buying it just has to sit there and wait for the price to go up you might be that you know that sounds a lot very securities like so you might want to be thinking about going and talking to a securities lawyer so here's something weird and this is like you know kind of defy weird i'm i'm going to throw it at you and get kind of your response and again that the response might be like hey it's too it's too soon we don't know enough yet but there are these things right this self-driving uh bank self-driving code basically um defy protocols right and some of these d5 protocols actually uh generate cash flows right so um and there's this you know notion that's become a bit more popular of a governance token that essentially allows individuals who own that token to sort of manage decisions within the protocol um and the protocol distributes the cash flow so it's actually the code again back to that theme of it's not a central intermediary it's the code that's doing the distribution of some of these cash flows what's your take on these governance tokens does you know is this going to be part of the the clarity that we're we're uh hopefully going to see from the sec or do you have any takes now well i think that's a great example of like the kind of question that i i would love for people i'm always trying to get people to tell me where do you need clarity and i think that's a great example of we need to sit down and wrestle with that is that is what you're describing to me essentially what the dow was that we did the dao report on is that really sort of the same type of thing um are you creating this kind of um investment company that's that's decentrally managed it's a really interesting idea um and i don't know you know i don't know how we think about that in terms of the securities laws i really i really think that's that's exactly the kind of issue i want us to wrestle with at the sec and maybe their their securities lawyers at the sec i can talk to and and they'll say well this is clearly this is clearly the answer on that but i think it's important for us to think about those things because that is kind of the trend that things are going and and um i i think it shows up in lots of different areas now where you get this um you know where before you had these decisions that were being made by a central person or a central entity and now those decisions are dispersed how does that inter intersect with our our our laws i i don't think they're easy answers hester something that concerns me is that uh with the suite of tools that is available on ethereum for every uh rule or regulation that that comes out of some governmental agency there is a way around that and not only is there one way around that there's perhaps infinite ways around that and perhaps you regulate the erc20 token that comes from a dow that's issuing cash flows and then somebody puts that into a an ethereum address that wraps it up and puts it into an nft to escape some sort of rules one thing and this kind of goes back to the the question of accelerating innovation i i don't the the free market in my opinion because of what ethereum enables will always be able to route around uh regulation uh does this does this concern you uh because does the experimental just power of ethereum concern you as a regulator well what i would say is that's why we need principles-based rules not technology-specific rules because principles-based rules are harder to engineer around but i think another point that regulators haven't really you know embraced is that the market can be quite effective at regulating itself and i'm not you know i'm not saying well there's there's no rule for regulators there is a role for regulators but we shouldn't we we should be happy when we see the market regulating itself and so i've seen that in crypto where you know during 2017 there was this this this ico um everyone was pouring money into whatever but then over time people started to say wait a minute i'm not going to give my money to a project unless i actually unless there's something behind that white paper and so that kind of regulation so even if people are trying to get around an existing government regulation the people who are interacting with that are going to try to push back um not necessarily saying you have to do it um you have to do it in a way that that is the old way but to say you have to do it in a way so that i i'm comfortable interacting with that um so it is a challenge for us regulators i you know it certainly is a challenge how quickly things are moving and how easy it is to engineer around but at the same time we should also view it as an opportunity to um incorporate some of that natural market discipline into the way we regulate the markets i agree yeah i agree i think anyway like that the crypto market has been a very painful lesson on the back of the the ico boom when like many of the tokens people invested in lost 99 of their value and i see in this cycle investors are much more careful uh well i'd like to say that but not in all cases at least the veterans are much more careful those who stuck stuck around are now telling people and you know talking about sort of so the market sort of you know learns these lessons the hard way um and that's been good for the industry i must wish hester we could like put just some caution tape around the whole crypto experiment and just say like hey we're running this whole financial experiment over here we've got this caution tape if you choose to cross that tape then it's on you like this is the wild west it gets crazy when you cross that line and we can't we're you know we're not protecting you in every incident across you know across that line it feels to me like if we could take that sort of approach and when you choose of your own volition to to go into this cryptos you know entirely what you're getting into that would be super healthy because to be honest crypto is just trying to figure this stuff out as we go too like what's valuable what's not um you know what's what's going to stick what's not where the product market fit is all of these things we're trying to figure it out as we go too is there any idea like that um that has passed by government or regulators we just caution tape the whole thing and just let the experiment run well i mean that's that's a model that i think is a good model you think of our private markets in the united states where the public markets are governed by our strict disclosure rules you have to public companies have to provide you know required disclosures in the private markets we let investors and companies work that out now what we've said historically is we've said but the only people who can be investors in the private markets are really rich people because we think that they can take care of themselves and afford to lose money if they do and my view has always been that's very un-american we should allow anyone to participate but we should do take this caution tape approach and say but if you participate in those markets there's no guarantee that you're going to get the information that you need and there's certainly no guarantee that you're going to get the return that someone told you you're going to get so please exercise great caution when when entering into that space but that typically hasn't been how we've worked as as regulators um that said we're not a merit regulator either and so that is kind of more along the lines of um telling people look here's the information you make your decision but you're making the decision and you're taking the risk so to some extent that is that kind of approach um so i the the only other thing i i would say in response to that is that if we were to take that kind of approach here's what would happen okay caution tape big letters you enter at your own risk you know it's not for everyone make sure you know what you're doing or nobody cards no technical support yep you're on your own there's no one to call when something goes wrong then something goes wrong twitter i open up my twitter hester i lost my money in this you know d5 protocol what are you going to do about it and my response is i'm going to do nothing about it because i told you that you were on your own there and we don't have any insight we don't have anyone to grab hold of there but i think that it then you know people are really angry at the regulator for not doing anything so it really is a responsibility thing if you want to enter into that space you've got to take the responsibility when things go wrong and you've got to take that as a learning experience and then move on from that and decide you know what maybe the d5 world isn't for me maybe i'm back into c5 but don't come calling the regulator who you told to stay out of it in the first place that's the knowledge people are people though and you always want to have someone to call when something goes wrong and i get it i do too as we come to a close here hester and again thank you for coming on and being so generous with your time we have to get to the conversation of etfs and so my my questions to you is when bitcoin etf and when the bitcoin etf does come if it does come or is there going to be one etf or many etfs well i think that's a big that's that's a big question that we all have and and again i don't i don't have a good answer to that because i thought there should have been a bitcoin exchange traded product approved based on the documents we got based on the applications we got i thought it should have happened uh a long time ago so i don't really understand what it is we're looking for the bitcoin market is quite mature now in the sense that there's a mature finding a futures market um there are a lot of very large uh players in those markets now that are arbitraging and you know bringing price consistency across different markets so i don't really know that there are other countries that have exchange traded products we saw canada just introduced some i don't really know what we're waiting for i i i have not understood that again facts and circumstances of each application how the product is going to be designed by those things yeah bottom line is i don't know when when an exchange exchange-traded product is going to get approved but again i think it is a natural chance for us to rethink our approach given that that gensler is coming likely coming in very soon um but even even so these product approval type things and i approval is not the right word but allowing these products to move forward can take a long time and you raise the important question of is it going to be one because the first one is likely to get quite a bit of attention and investor funds or is it going to be multiple at the same time and i think that's that's a difficult question and another example of why it does matter when regulators wait too long to do something it makes it much harder to do it and i think that is a cautionary tale for us regulators more generally and that's something that you saw with brian brooks at occ you know he said look i can see that this is going to be a bigger not exchange traded products but that crypto is going to be a bigger thing in the future and so i'm going to lay down the rails already for it to be integrated into the banking system that's a really good approach you do it before it becomes such a big thing that it's such a big deal and then you allow financial institutions to experiment with it i would love us to be doing the same taking that same kind of approach the the crypto space uh tends to be pretty good at putting on a conspiracy hat and i've got a little bit of that in in me myself and so i want to uh propose this question to you in my opinion the longer and longer that we don't have a bitcoin etf the more and more of a political statement it is to protect the brand of the dollar as the world's reserve currency because there's something to say about like perhaps not helping facilitate bitcoin growth if it comes at the cost of the us dollar which comes at the cost of u.s sovereignty and perhaps every single day that there's not a bitcoin etf is a is an attempt to protect a dollar how does that sort of conspiracy land with you i mean i think you should probably take that conspiracy hat off but what what i i do think that that the american um approach the american government's approach to crypto to bitcoin to d5 one needs to recognize as we talked about at the beginning that there's a value to these uh to these these stores of value exchanges of value to people and in both in the u.s and outside the us and because of that we as regulators shouldn't approach it with the idea of oh this is bad but oh how can we build the regulatory system within which this stuff can function but the second point i would make is that i think it's really short-sighted on d5 because so much of d5 is really it's it's it's in dollars i mean it's in stable coins but they're dollar stable coins and so i guess my question to people who push back and say oh this is a threat to the dollar would be to say well actually we're dollarizing more of the world because it's being done through private stable coins um and so that should be something that you actually like if you like the if if you want the dollar to have more value and it's you know it's really a positive in people's lives so that's something that we have to take into account too so people need to stop being so concerned about standing in the way of non-sovereign stores of value and exchanges of value i think that they can coexist with the sovereign ones and so i don't find that to be a challenge and i think it's it's again a really important reminder that regulators need to remember that we serve the people our job is to serve the people that does mean protecting them but it also means enabling them to engage in the voluntary transactions that they find to be personally beneficial and that i think will be in the end societally beneficial esther do you have an opinion as to the market structure behind ether the asset and perhaps if a bt a bitcoin etf becomes approved do you think that an ether etf would be not far along behind it well again i think if we look at the way that the the commission has approached bitcoin it's it's a very confusing approach to me because it does try to impose the market structure that we know which is the equity market structure on this underlying um on on the underlying bitcoin market and if that same thing were attempted with respect to eth i just i don't know how that would play out because i don't i don't understand imposing it on bitcoin and i don't know how it would play out in eth um so i i think it it remains to be seen whether someone will try that and if so how how we approach that one maybe we try the national pride angle we can't let canada beat us at the etf game can we maybe that'll work um hester you've been very generous with your time you know thanks thanks so much for spending it with us and we appreciate your role as a regulator and you're kind of educating others about this um can can you tell us i guess maybe a message to crypto those encrypted the crypto community who maybe think of regulators or government in in a bad light give give us some optimism right so so tell us the the good stuff and maybe you entered this conversation saying you're optimistic why are you optimistic for 2021 and beyond i'm optimistic because we we do live in a place where people are supposed to interact with regulators provide input to regulators inform us help us to think through these difficult philosophical legal technical issues and so what a wonderful uh opportunity it is to be in a society where we can have these conversations we can have them publicly we can wrestle with these things together um and so i think that's that's the source of my optimism it's that people have been willing to engage with me they've been willing to get over that big regulatory label that i wear on my hat and and and you know tell me what they're trying to build tell me what the challenges they're facing help me to think through these issues and so i'm optimistic because this is a world in which crowd crowd involvement you know that's what defy is about it's about decentralized um talent and decentralized contributions to uh to uh something that people are building together we can do that in regulation too we can take all of the wisdom from people who are building from people like me who come from a regulatory background from lawyers and we can meld that all together and we can build a better regulatory framework why not apply that that same decentralized ethos um to regulation so that's why i'm optimistic people forget regulation is just another protocol and we are in the protocol space hester how can people help like those listening how can people help uh you asked for some feedback earlier do you want feedback on this sort of thing how can they get plugged into this yeah i mean you know bring to me issues where you think clarity is needed um bring to me solutions about what you think that clarity would look like but even just knowing what the where what the questions are that you have would be helpful um so you can contact me at commissioner purse scc.gov i'm on twitter but i i
