hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs and our one and only and of course favorite recurring segment moment of zenika zeneca is back in the house uh our favorite we're gonna talk all that's going on in the world of nfts and web 3 today there is so much zannick and i i think are both relieved that we recognize like the top 10 uh best projects again for a while there a lot of the the top 10 volume projects we like wouldn't know half of them but we're back in in somewhat chartered territory but of course there's all sorts of other news that is in some ways uncharted we're going to talk about all of it but first we're going to hear a word from our sponsors and then back to a moment of zenika and my conversation with seneca 33. axiomfinity is a game

are we in the market right now yeah we're in i don't say like uncharted territory but the market is maturing and evolving in a direction that i'm not sure we've seen yet and i mean that sort of you alluded to it before about how we recognize the top ten so like the blue chips they're doing great they're doing fine you know board ape ecosystem uh doodles azuki cool cats all the women prices are holding strong trending upwards it's excellent and i think part of that is probably due to the apecoin drop like we saw just a ton of liquidity come into the market uh and people were concerned like they were thinking is this going to suck liquidity out are people going to sell their nfts and buy a coin but i think that because it was listed on all these you know exchanges just on coin uh coinbase and binance we have a lot of sort of people who may not have had exposure to nfts now buying in because of eight and then the apes who are selling that coin are taking that and some of that money is going into other nft projects and for a while people were thinking and wondering you know where is it going to go where is it going to flow to and historically we've seen it go you know into the blue chips and then like this trickle-down effect where you know because if if someone buys a bluetooth i mean someone's selling one for 10th 20th 100th and then they're taking that money some of it's going out but some of it's going into new projects and we're definitely seeing the first part of that where again like all the blue chips are thriving uh i'm not sure that we've yet seen the trickle-down effect um to a real extent like some of the like mid-tier projects are doing okay but especially the newer projects we're not seeing too many crazy like mint outs and then one two three eighth floor projects anymore and that's probably a healthy thing but it's it's just different to how we previously seen uh like this whole trickle-down economic effect and maybe it's too soon maybe in a couple of weeks we will start to see that happen but by and large we're in a phase i think right now where uh the blue chips are doing great and they're thriving and everyone else is sort of like twiddling their thumbs and like is it going to come to us is what's going to happen um yeah i wonder if the fact that we're coming off of a a couple weeks of really the market being down and people being scared i think precipitated by ukraine but also other things has made people who they were trying to sell that doodle to have the stability of the of the eath right and they're sort of like still a little trepidatious because of whether it's the macro geopolitical scene or whatever else and they're sort of like not trying to now spend it anew it's all speculation of course but that is really interesting um that we're not seeing that yeah kind of trickle down to these other projects i think as well uh ether is like pumping a little bit it's over 3k and whenever that happens you do get a tendency of people to say well maybe it might be better holding on to my eth rather than putting into nfts because what if eath rips to 5k what if it actually goes to 10k um you know historically when that when eth does pump a lot nft prices tend to adjust a bit and yeah i i think that's just that's a great point yeah because you would i would on the the counter to this would be that you would maybe expect more people uh entering but again to your point this is probably why eth is pumping you've seen stocks do well too the the fed had an announcement here in the u.s that was you know bullish it basically rate hikes were what people were going to expect them to be and so it didn't like overly freak the market out and then you had some good news coming out of ukraine in terms of oh there's talks of a peace deal who knows what'll play out with that but i think both those factors had led to sort of a surge in in like stock markets so i think that's probably playing into the eth price but it hasn't really migrated over to you know the the uh non-blue chip nft prices i would say like despite that it's not like sentiment is bad or low uh in the market if we go back to say mid feb you know people were pretty bearish and you know there was just things were not minting out as well and prices were low and bleeding esp even blue chips and like people were just like not feeling great now it's sort of i think we're on the uptick and it's people seem a little happier and obviously you know things can change on a dime in this market like things would look and bearish and then hugo bought punks and me bits ip and then dropped a coin and all of a sudden the market is full of excitement um and like a month before that it was like the pixelmon fiasco and the war in ukraine you know flip things the other way and so who knows you know maybe coinbase marketplace finally comes out and everyone is is ecstatic and it's actually the catalyst that we're all hoping for or thinking it might be um or maybe some other negative news comes out and it just flips it's such a precarious market in yeah speaking of yuga and that big news you and i actually haven't talked about it you and i both talked about it individually you even came on i think a bankless panel to talk about it so i don't want to overly uh stay here and and actually one of the things i'm excited to chat about is some of the news we've had even since this about apecoin but yuga obviously bought punks bought me bits and then dropped apecoin your your your take your your your quick take since we don't want to stay here for too long it's extremely interesting more than anything else i think you know we're seeing this first massive acquisition of one nft brand acquiring another and not just that the number one acquiring the number two or the number two requiring the number one uh i think it is it was fairly inevitable that we would see more of these mergers or acquisitions in the space but i'm not sure that anyone expected the first big one to be on on this scale yeah i had tweeted that and you know kind of retweeted this when this happened i tweeted back in january like when do we start to see major nft projects buying up uh other you know other projects to add to their ip portfolio but in my head it was very much i would have anticipated a yooka labs doing the buying yeah i didn't anticipate they were going to really yeah it's not a merger but like merge in the sense that it's the two behemoths um i thought they would buy up maybe smaller ip or you know like they're gonna buy up a dead heads or you know whatever sorry dead heads i don't know probably not for sale but you get my point i think um one note on this i think it's opened up this really interesting dialogue when now people are a lot more aware of the intellectual property rights of their nfts and like before that it was just sort of like oh you know lava labs is is dmca in people and apes have full commercial rights cool we're not really going to care too much into it but then we look at well who actually owns the intellectual property of your nft when you own an nft you don't necessarily own that ip and then you're still beholden to a company so we talk about true digital ownership a lot but then there's this disconnect when it's like well you own it but you don't know the ip and then now now people are starting to just it's this new dialogue that's opening up which i i find really interesting fascinating and uh yeah i'm sure we'll talk about that more in in future uh events driven folks into the arms of cco you and i were you were saying your feed is just dominated by dc investor going off and talking about how he'll only buy cco projects yeah moving forward and it's just fascinating yeah it is and you know we're we're holding back here in part because i do want to i've said it on the pod before i do want to do like a cco panel and really bring in the the uh the the hyper mac the cco maximalists and maybe some of its slightly bigger detractors and have a conversation around it because i think it's critical to to what's happening in the space um time magazine is accepting apecoin for digital subscriptions i think this is a really big deal yeah that's that's huge i mean obviously time has been in the space a lot lately um but this is like this is not an nft thing they're doing this is their magazine right yeah yes well it's the digital subscriptions to their magazine so you can't buy you know well you can't go to the stand but who's buying you know who buys a physical magazine at this point anyway yeah uh this is the race for to the metaverse and of course we're not gonna have one metaverse and yada yada caveats caveats but like that is what we're talking about and it's the race to be metaverse money or one of the top metaverse monies right sand is in that race man is in that race i think you can argue these other project coins are in that race i don't know that as explicitly so um but you know ape has now set the bar and i i i don't know i i almost feel like this has been undertalked about maybe it's being talked about in in on twitter in places that i'm not seeing as much but i think this is a this is a really big deal because time is a is a serious company and this could lead i don't know if it'll lead to other companies making the same decision but it like makes the water warm for that should other major brands that that aren't just web 3 brands want to start accepting alt coins i i think it's it's really interesting i think it is too i think obviously it's huge it's time magazine and they're accepting apecoin it's a great utility use case for apecoin i'm just like as an a holder and fan and big fan of luca you got i'm just like curious as like do we need another currency for like why why couldn't they just use eth like it seems like i'm i think apecoin is going to be great for governance and for perhaps within the ape ecosystem and obviously this is great for acorn as well it's just like expanding it but i don't envision us living in a future when people are like if you go to subscribe to time you have like 10 different currency maybe maybe we will maybe you can pay in whatever currency you want um but yeah i asked this question to john rogers uh last week on the show and he was like it's not scalable i wasn't even thinking about in the real world i was asking about it in web 3 like will the metaverse have 10 trillion different currencies because you can see quick exchanges in the metaverse where you can quickly if you have banana coin because you're in the cyber kongs area and you can quickly convert that to apecoin for the the ape area john's opinion was still like no that's not scalable uh i think it'll be interesting to see how it plays out are we living in just like completely like there's a totally multi-coin universe or not to your point about do we really need another coin i recorded a conversation yesterday uh with somebody whose opinion was like ape did this wrong board ape did this wrong they can get away with doing it wrong but other projects will start to copy them and he was like they did it wrong because they didn't launch at least immediately with utility and it's going to lead a ton of other projects to just drop coins without utility and it's going to tank their projects and i don't think we're going to have a trillion coins i think there will be a couple dominant players and um i understand the impulse for a project especially a project like aboard ape to want to throw their hat in that ring and build the dominant brand ecosystem i mean what a branding play like if the us dollar was like the nike holy [ __ ] it's huge and so i understand the impulse there but i do think it you have to be something of a board 8 size to be able to get away with it yeah i mean i've heard that a few times over the last couple of weeks since they drop it they're like people say oh well now every project is going to drop their own coin and there's going to be no utility and it's not going to go well that's already been happening if we go back to like september last year we saw a flood of erc20 tokens come on the market and projects were launching with whether it's a dow or some staking element and just constantly and you know yuga even came out and said that you know we are planning a token but because because the apes were like well when are we getting one and they're like well we're gonna do it right we're gonna take our time so q1 next year which was like five six months away but in the interim we've seen so many projects launch with a token launch a token that just goes to zero because there's no utility or the utility is well you can use it to breed more nfts that you know it's just like almost ponzinonomics which if there's no demand for these new nfts like obviously that's a good use case if there's demand like if all of a sudden you can use apecoin to create a new nft that's part of the bayc ecosystem that's enormous you know but and like cyber congress did that well because you know they had the genesis kongs and then the babies and there was demand to be part of their ecosystem but for brand new projects that launched with a coin yeah it's it's nothing new and i think we're gonna probably see an increase in amount of that just because of eight um and most of them are probably just going to be worthless yeah some of the coin launching i feel like is is uh what's the word i'm looking for like genuinely they come by it genuinely from a governance standpoint of wanting to be able to stake or delegate votes and that's much easier to do with with an erc20 than it is with a 721 um i know in other projects i'm working with we're we're dealing with that right now like do we do a token simply purely for government so that it can be staked to other members to have a greater vote or this and that um but when you're when you're trying to make an ecosystem coin and you're not of the the scale of of board apes what do you think of milk gold do you have thoughts on that milk gold cats tokens so cool cats launched like their milk token and their gold token i didn't even know they had a gold token i know milk uh i'm i'm just it's in my mind they're both connected to the cool pets yeah system i in my mind that the whole thing is on pause because you know they're having issues with polygon or layer 2 and i haven't been following it i think uh it sounded when i first heard about it and was hearing about it like leading up to the launch so prior to january it sounded like they had really cool plans and utility and it was a well thought out ecosystem now i i honestly haven't been following it but i could see them doing it in again if it's with a it's coming with a blockchain game there's real utility maybe and if the game is fun and people want to play it then then it can work yeah moving on unless there was other things you wanted to say on that meta angels are our kind of mutual friend at this point alison and alex who launched meta angels they came out with an announcement that they've partnered with wearable they were the launch partner for wearable on this meta angels specific marketplace it looks like what rarible is doing is making a play to like white label marketplaces and partner with projects so that they can have their own project specific marketplace uh i think this is awesome yeah we'd love to hear your initial take on it and then i can maybe say a little bit more yeah i think it's super smart i think uh a lot of people have long been saying myself included that the end game for marketplace is it probably project specific marketplaces where you can um i mean say what you want about lava labs but the buying experience of crypto punch on their website is fantastic you can sort by traits it's like optimized for their collection uh and i think as we go on um we're going to see more and more of that openc is you know it's a great casual marketplace but it's not like if you want to buy and sell gaming assets there's probably a better way to view them in a 3d environment and all that kind of stuff uh or or just there's just different collections have different ways of showing their traits art blocks and art you know is probably better viewed in a different experience so yeah i do think the end game is individual marketplaces and wearable is you know coming up with this infrastructure i guess where they can partner with projects or white label them as you said um allow them to say you know have their own marketplace with lower fees than openc i believe it's two percent instead of 3.5 and then uh i can't remember exactly those fees go to meta angels instead right yeah so it's it's a two percent fee and then uh a percent of that fee also goes to their uh scholarship fund i haven't let me pull it up it's their um hold on uh yeah i was talking about this with you earlier but alison and the met angels team sent me like an i was like hey i want to talk about the marketplace like here's a specific question i have and they were like here's this like incredibly well thought out document that answers any question anybody could have about i was like this is why we're bullish on media they're such professionals they're yeah these are like real humans who have built real businesses um okay so angel grants so um they are giving no strings attached grants on a weekly basis of like i thought depending on the price of each about you know a quarter of an east basically to i think artists community members who apply um and basically the the only criteria for this grant is like you are doing something that will have a positive impact on like your or other lives which is like a beautifully broad thing so basically giving if with ether you know so they're giving a quarter of an eighth out weekly and so a a percentage of this two percent fee goes into that like a fund that will be given back out to community members yeah and it's awesome it's just like it's a if you're gonna [Music] trade meta angel and secondary market and and you're bullish on well just there's no reason not to use this marketplace now it's lower fees than openc plus point five percent i believe goes to this fund which helps people yeah yeah yeah absolutely i think this is this it actually felt dovetailed to me with the eight coin thing in the sense that i think we're seeing projects almost like exert their power more like board ape made the point like metaverse is right now we're supposed to be all cool but like they're actually just boring like and and and marketplaces like the the reason we go to marketplaces are the projects right the reason right now to be in the metaverse would be the games and or the community and the projects and so these projects i think are sort of looking up and being like well like [ __ ] it we're the we're the fuel for this whole thing that's happening you know like gaming isn't quite at the point yet where it's the blockchain gaming scene isn't good enough yet for that to be kind of standing on its own so the reason we're all here at these projects it's it's brand it's ip right now um that's still the very dominant force in nfts and so it sort of feels yeah like like projects started stepping in themselves board apes like we're just building our own metaverse you're here for us anyways meta angels is like here's our marketplace again you're here for us anyways and i think that's um that's interesting and i like that vibe yeah and i think board apes they part of one of their proposals is they want to build their own marketplace as well because i mean if you look at the top 10 projects by volume sometimes the top five the top five i think at a point last week were all uglabs it was punks me bits mutant apes bought apes and kennel club dogs and it's just like it all that volume open c is taking 2.5 percent all that yoga has to do i mean i say all it's not easy to do but you know if slash when they do it that two and a half percent can either go to yuga it can go to the ape dao or the ape foundation it can go back to the the buyers and sellers it's just that's money that can stay within the ape ecosystem and more projects are recognizing that yeah yeah yeah absolutely polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their d5 goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including infinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse okay uh invisible friends uh announced a partnership with kith i was really excited about this i feel like we're the perfect two halves of a whole which is i have a little bit of a background on kith i feel like you i obviously follow invisible friends but you i think are even closer to invisible friends than i am so uh we maybe we can fill in each other's gaps here uh i'll i'll kind of kick off with some frame settings so uh this started hints at this i think started actually in december there was a cute public exchange where somebody i think just a random person on twitter had retweeted something of invisible friends being like you know kith collab or can we get an invisible friends like draped in kith or something and then uh the the invisible friends team retweeted it and we're like any time we'd love to talk to them ronnie felig who's the did i pronounce that yeah ronnie fleek who's the founder of kith then responded to that invisible friend's tweet and was like yo like follow me let's dm me like or so i can dm you let's let's chat so that was back in december they then had this announcement i think this past week that they'd be partnering or maybe it was last week they'd be partnering up and um i really like this kith is a is a really it's it's a streetwear brand and i think they've done an exceptional job sort of building over the years really through very strategic partnerships and uh us like a strong commitment to quality i don't know if this is still true but there was at one point i know they they had the brand had grown tremendously and they still only had like their two original locations in brooklyn and manhattan and he was like very just intentional about not wanting to like over saturate the market with his with the brand and and so it's just been really a focus on quality i also was doing some some digging on them um and you know they used to do fun things in their stores which again they may or may not still do i i kind of tracked some of the kiss stuff a number of years ago where they had like a cereal bar you know like where they had like you know cereal and frozen treats and whatever so that kids or you know teenagers who maybe couldn't afford the the clothing at that point would still come in and like spend time and like are surrounded by their brand and then they had a couple like more accessible price point items like chocolates or or um you know they did some food stuff that would have little tickets in them and if you collected four of them you could redeem it for like a kiss nike branded tennis ball for example so this idea of redeemables this idea of collectibles they've been doing this for truly the whole lifespan of the brand community's always been a focus for them but i was looking and i don't think they have made up an explicit play into nfts before this collab with invisible friends so that's why i you know again i'm i'm excited because i'm a bit of a kiss fan and i think they've done you know an amazing job building their brand now that i've given you that that background what are your thoughts and tell us what's up with invisible friends these days yeah i mean it seems like a perfect collab for invisible friends invisible friends is it's so focused on it's like quality over quantity i think that they have really made a point to i mean the the project had insane hype when it launched you know they had hundreds of thousands of people following on twitter and discord but if you if you go back you know six months ago um the artist marcus was he was you know i remember a treat of his he said you know this is the culmination of 20 years work and like my life's work and he spent half a year plus on this specific drop and he was just like i'm not going to release it until it's perfect it's going to be delayed and delayed and delayed until it's perfect we want to ensure that everyone is happy uh they did 5 000 they could have sold 50 000 if they wanted to but they were like we're going to keep the collection size small we're going to ensure the quality and it sounds like they're taking that same approach to their partners and their partnerships and they're not just partnering with anyone presumably they're getting thousands of offers just all the time because they're such a hyped collection um and i think the community is it's really dedicated and passionate and really like enjoys the the brand already which is you know amazing because it's a relatively new brand uh and i think this partnership from what like i'm not familiar with kith or at least i wasn't before this but it sounds like it's a pretty perfect blend uh do we do we know what it involves like the the partnership we don't have details and they did tweet out though they gave ronnie feig the uh the founder of kith a um honorary like special honorary you know invisible friend and they tweeted that out so it looks awesome we'll be excited to see the details but i'm sure i i feel like this will be an incredibly well executed partnership given the the similarities in terms of focus on quality focus on brand that both of these partners really have exhibited thus far so i think also invisible friends is it's you know a lot of people were saying it's going to go the way of hate beast it's going to go the way of mecca it's like the super hype launch that you know pre-reveal goes up to like five six seven eight nine ten eth um and then the others you know they dropped i think mecca is point five or something or lower and and hape is between one and two um but it's been several weeks now and it's it's holding strong at around seven eighth and yeah to me that that's enough of him so much better to me even before the the launch or even before like reveals like well i guess you know we really didn't know with some of these others but like the art is just way cooler in my opinion it has way more like heart and soul you can tell that you can see a brand coming out of this i can't see a brand out of hate beast or or mecca yeah and so this to me is yeah this is more like an azuki in my opinion in terms of like there's there's a real feel and a vibe to the thing for sure okay let's this is kind of a silly topic but i i i want to talk about it which is this pepe uh scandal matt fury creator of pepe the frog getting sued have you been following me i have not been following it i saw it in in the notes and it sounds fascinating to me i feel like there's some meta-analysis that could be given here i have not figured out what it is so i'm gonna tell you the story and maybe you have the meta-analysis in short um somebody a a buyer i think his last name's thayer thought he was buying like a one-of-one rare pepe it's like this image of it was an nft of pepe's like behind basically it's like his butt sticking out of water and um but it was kind of artistic and he paid half a million dollars for this rare one-of-one nft pepe and then matt fury goes and releases like 46 other copies of this exact same image like for free and so of course the value of this nft that had been you know he bought it at auction for half a million dollars goes down to like over half a million it goes down to like 30 like below 30 000 and so he the the buyer is suing matt fury uh for you know really damages and all the rest of it that's why it's meta analysis yeah i mean does it say anything about the world today it's such an interesting thing i think uh it goes to show just how how new like how early we are and how new all of this is because you know this is not something that is entirely uh unpredictable we could have seen that an artist might release um like new editions or something that sold really well just to make more money but i think if they bought the nft there's at least the providence that that's the first one so it's obviously not a good look or move by matt to just release a bunch more editions of the exact same thing that was a one of one but we have the provenance we know which is the first we know i don't know i think again anyone could right click save but anyone could have that image and it's not like uh there's value to it and so i think that in a perfect world the market would attribute significantly less value to these copies and then the original that you know was sold at auction sooner has the real value and that's like the first and then these are but again it comes down to like does matt say well these are in his mind all equal all official and it's it's really interesting thing and i'm curious to see how it works i'm yeah and and there's still it seems like there is still value being given to it in the sense that it's still i think valued at like thirty thousand dollars which is nothing to kind of sneeze at but it's down from half a million yeah yeah it was reminding me not because it's actually necessarily all that similar but you had sort of two back-to-back stories where you had that person who spent half a million dollars the same on tom brady's last like football yeah yeah yeah and then brady's like actually i'm back i'm back yeah um yeah and he i think brady actually i think posted on instagram like the story about the guy who spent the half a million dollars and then tweeted at ftx and was like hey can we get can we get this guy like can we can we get this guy bitcoin or can we get this guy a donation i don't know he was like i don't know he was trying to get fdx to help the guy out um okay rihanna filed trademarks for nfts in the metaverse not much to be said here just want to go through some interesting news that i saw in the world of uh web3 call it celebrity yeah moving into web 3. so that was exciting if there would be if there was one celebrity you would want to see move into nfts in the metaverse which celebrity would that be for you oh wow that's a good question uh i've never really like been huge on following celebrities but uh well maybe it's a poker player like isn't it there's been there's enough poker plays in this space already and they yeah the ones that could sell nfts probably have had enough success and don't need the money also and or are like just cash grabbing and and would add no real value um yeah i got no one i got no one all right who who would you want to see humongously lame answer um well you know i i don't necessarily there's nobody that comes to mind for me of like i want you to issue nfts and i would go buy it though maybe taylor swift she would probably be high up there but there would be people truthfully a lot of like i'm a huge reese witherspoon fan i think she's incredibly i think she's both talented and i love her films and i also think she's super bright and she's such an incredibly intelligent businesswoman so like that excited me to see her to know that she's gotten into it um like for me it's more about like the validation of oh these people that i actually think are very smart business people on top of being celebrity that are getting in and i think so many of the people that i respect i mean mindy kaling has now tweeted about it at this point shonda rhimes i think is interested in it um so a lot of the for me like women that i have admired because i think they're they've they they deserve their celebrity for being smart yeah no i think that's weird to say but yeah have gotten in taylor swift i guess would be the one um okay speaking of celebrities and entering uh patrick mahomes signed a deal with nfl all day yeah yeah this is hilarious i found out you don't know who patrick mahomes is i was like that before this call i was like senator do you have anything interesting to say about patrick wilhelm's getting in and you were like i literally don't have patrick i have no idea who that is and now i know because he told me he's an nfl player yeah yeah yeah he's like that you know he's good debate but arguably like the best quarterback in the nfl right now he's the the quarterback for the kansas city chiefs um so yeah that's hilarious you were giving me uh vitalik not knowing about tom brady yeah so i was like oh okay i'd say you're not in the states not that everybody in the states even knows who patrick mahomes is but like you haven't i'm not into the stage or am i into sports so yeah yeah double whammy okay nothing nothing to say there again news that i'm flagging um some upcoming drops i thought it would be interesting to talk about really on like the art like pure art side you have [ __ ] render takashi markami and x copy all coming out with um drops i think in imminently [ __ ] renders claiming the process for getting one of his has already really started um do you have one that you're most excited about that you want to start with or or they're all very exciting honestly three very prolific um high-profile fantastic artists i i think x-copy is just to me i own zero x copy and i'm there there's an open edition on nifty gateway i think for i think 10 minutes for one eath or like one equivalent it's like three thousand dollars and you know i'm curious to see how that goes how many are going to sell open editions are always a little bit scary you know they could just sell tens of thousands of these things and you know we say that's gonna be so much money but then you look at like pack and how much that pack can sell uh but yeah that one to me is just most exciting because i would like to get my hands on at least one yeah so you think you will participate in this open edition open edition meaning like it'll sell as many as sell 10 minutes yeah so you have no you don't have control or insight into the supply going into it yeah i think i'll buy at least one okay just to have an x copy just because i love x copy yeah what do you love about x copy i love the i mean the art style stylistically when i first saw it i i didn't didn't appeal to me that much but it's like really growing on me over time and i love just the just the history and the story of you know of x copy and how he came to be in this space um and i appreciate how digitally native the art style is so it's it's not just um a still image it's just like very clearly you couldn't create this with oil on canvas or something like that this is an nfc this is a digital piece of art yeah well he's been you know he's super super og as a digital artist and exactly you know i've been kind of digging into learning more about him because i agree like i can't fully appreciate the art until i kind of understand the history and as i dove more into uh do we know it if x copy's male is it he i am unsure okay i'm using that pronoun i'm sorry if it's wrong or i shouldn't be but um i mean his work is like so evocative and chaotic and like yeah you know intense and i have come to to really appreciate that in a way when i like first joined the nfc space and was like what like why is yeah why is this the thing and i like now i'm like oh okay i guess i get it now um yeah the [ __ ] render avatars are coming out there's like this four process redemption or like four like there's four different stages of uh or opportunities to get essence i believe which is ultimately what you'll redeem for one of these avatars i think they're selling right now these these redemption pieces are selling or i'm sorry the essence pieces which you can redeem for the avatars are available on openc it looks like yes 0.8 because i think some early if you if you had the the crystals yeah you could redeem the crystals or not redeem the crystals you could if you had a crystal you had a free claim to get the essence one for one and then some people are taking that essence and selling it um for around one eighth year point eight to one eighth and then yeah the essence will be used to mint the avatar and then my favorite honestly of all three of these takashi murakami i i really do love takashi's work yeah and limited details i think on this he's been teasing murakami flowers i mean he's done he's done a lot of work with flowers in the past and you know we know these the sort of digital looking flower i i couldn't find details on exactly when it's dropping he's been talking about it i think since january or february um we got a new detail uh i think in like a couple weeks ago about it um but but no like specific launch date yeah all as far as i'm aware we don't know yeah all priced say it again no we're a price we don't know the price yeah um correct yeah yeah i'm excited for it as well i think that i'm a fan of his as well and i like i mean the flowers they look cool they're very digital looking like pixelated type style um yeah definitely want to keep an eye on as well the details we got was that uh i think it's like clone x right if you're in the basically the artifact ecosystem you're not allow listed or or you're not you don't you know you're not sort of entitled to one of these but if you hold uh previous like uh you know murakami work i think you are so that was disappointing i know to artifact fans yeah here we go them them's the breaks you um okay last one this is maybe a quick episode unless we have uh other things we want to sort of off the cuff talk about but the world of women galaxy drop uh do we have a date there end of this month i don't think we have an exact date it's a little light on details but i would imagine we're getting close to launch time so they've been giving out um i think they announced it about two weeks ago and they've been giving out mint list allowance spots to various communities and there's just like this massive grind for these mintless spots because people are viewing it as you know the companion drop to world of women world women's floor is like 10 12 13 8 and so presumably these are going to be valuable but we we don't know what the price is going to be as far as i'm aware we don't know how much these are going to cost so you've basically just dropped lore and the fact that this is like the the world of women the original the the original characters i sort of found another planet and there are these other women on this other planet i i i believe the lore i was reading it a little while back and so this is this new set of characters in this ecosystem i mean it's interesting um hello sunshine reece witherspoon's obviously announced that her production company is partnering with them um to create ip you know you know they have the ip but right to create actual stories out of the world of women characters i don't think we have many details on that but that's exciting i wonder if the galaxy characters will play a role in that on and on i it's very well done if you go to the world of women i think if you look at like the galaxy page on the world of women's site it it's evocative i'm like oh cool there's a story here a bunch of women going into space finding other women like hell yeah so i am pumped about it and i will be closely watching other announcements on it i mean of course you have this like slew of you have all like the celebrity women who are into this like you know coming out for it going with paltrow's giving away allowance spots and eva longoria was giving away a lot loudly spots and um it is really wild it's um yeah it's going to be yeah it's one of the most hyped things i think i've seen in a while because it's not often that you see these blue chip projects come out with a companion drop you know it's like yeah and i think uh we we're very unclear on details like we don't know them in price we don't know the quantity a lot of people speculating it's going to be 20k 10k you know one to one free claim for holders and then 10k but again we don't know we don't know a lot uh but it sounds like it's going to be a smashing success we have seen some sneak peeks of the art and it does look pretty cool um it's very in style and yam is so talented yeah awesome seneca you are the best we will be back with you in a couple of weeks and thanks as always for sharing your your wisdom and insight into this wild world and ride that we are on no thank you so much for having me
