[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero is a podcast that focuses on the people behind the code because the theorem is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with peter pan who is a fellow class of 2017 crypto person got into the world of crypto around the same time i did made similar typical newbie mistakes that one does buying xrp um but peter immediately injected himself right into the core of the ethereum community and kind of led the charge for dallas he was one of the earliest dowers to really kind of reinvigorate this whole dao revolution starting i think in maybe early 2019 peter's legacy along with others as well is metta cartel medicartel was the first dow after moloch dao to really use the the dope molok framework and to try and bestow part of what its visions should be upon the world via funding grants but it's really turned into much much more than that i think meta cartel is um it's a meme that is also um a public good kind of it's a it's a vibe that we all as a collective humanity can tap into defining meta cartel i think is inherently impossible but i think you will as a listener understand why after you listen to this conversation with peter pan so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into that conversation but before we do a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes staking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lydo.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the leido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started all right guys we are here with peter pan peter what's up it is a pleasure to be back on uh bankless well leia zero i guess uh there's zero no yeah different series right yeah yeah so you have different like series and focuses and totally yeah player zero is just basically the tuesday flavor of bankless at this point uh so yeah it's the bankless podcast but the layer zero sub category i guess yeah i'm stoked to get you on for longer than just 30 minutes because the only other time we've had you on the show was uh the 30-minute pre-interview about what it was like to write that before a bitcoin series which turned into like an audio book type podcast yeah um i think yeah that was beautiful uh thank you so much for doing that yeah uh thank you for it was so weird because yeah it was like like i wrote it and like when i first came to crypto and like no one thought like i some people read it so it's cool but no one really like shauna's spot like no one cared about it for pretty much two and a half years yeah right uh when you wrote it it was in the depths of the 2017 mania right so like not necessarily the the community that would appreciate a post of that nature so the funny thing was that yeah this was one of the first things i i discovered crypto started going to rush like workshops dev workshops and 17 but i think in 2018 i went full-time just like i want to learn about the space i want to find a job i want to do stuff in here and i start asking questions really on a fundamental basis of like you know what is crypto what is blockchains what is technology like what what is cryptography who created cryptography uh and when i wrote it it was just like i couldn't i wanted to say through the history i first started talking to crypto people again i realized i couldn't really i didn't i basically didn't shut up about this stuff and then i think that's when i realized i should i should i should write this down um and i think i've the series was mostly finished uh when the time i went to my first ever crypto conference uh in may 2008 2018 that's right uh in toronto for edcon um i was a sponsor it was a sponsored trip like some people uh bucky pooba in sydney funded me to go on a scholarship to go to the conference and i didn't know anyone i didn't have any friends so in the hashtag edcon hashtag for the conference i just posted like i kept on posting this link of like the 70s intro to history on uh before bitcoin and surprisingly i met a few people such as philip um and chris safer like who were working on brain bot and i'm token back then like just different people i know all the way to today that like actually like came across what i wrote and then i actually read all of it because because you just tweeted out the the link with the hashtag just because you speak barely like i barely had any crypto followers or anything and i was just like spamming that hashtag of like hey check this out the history of crypto that's hilarious uh not not too many people know this but i kind of have a similar like entrance into crypto for at youth denver 2018. i wrote out some essays that i thought would be interesting and i didn't have a medium account i didn't know what a medium account was at the time uh and so i printed out these essays and i was handing them i literally had a backpack that felt like 20 pounds of paper and i was handing them out physically to people at east denver 2018. i think uh some of the early cypherpunks did that as well uh who it was but you know they were handing out the cypherpunk manifesto and paper to people right they were doing that in the 80s and 90s right yeah that's right good point okay so uh the the very basic question that i think i'll start with is like how what was your first entrance into crypto how did crypto land in your life honestly um i think well i think this went back to 2012 and 13 when i was online i was like doing weird internet things i was like learning how to like it's like they were online they were like weird firms about things such as like how do you social like social engineer systems so you can get like free cans of red bull right or like you know you learn it's like it was a whole forum about like you know weird tricks in society like in life sort of it's like real life like real life exploits yeah it's like really exactly real life exploits and bugs that were sort of harmless right like how do you get three cans of red bulls like he messaged the support being like oh my god i've bought six cans and they're absolutely nothing in all of them they'll air i wanna i would like a replacement please right or like how do you get a small fry at mcdonald's for free just go when it's busy and awesome you missed they missed it right um like we had little society bugs like this and that and one of the forms was like uh yeah they were like you know it's like hey you can earn several dollars a day clicking captures and uh that happens to be a site where you basically like it it was like bitcoin falls back in 2012 or 13. uh and that's where i discovered bitcoin i just like for a day or two and like you know barely sense just clicking on captures and like getting bitcoin from different drips and faucets and i think that's when um yeah and i didn't think too much about it i was like this is weird why am i doing this this is i'm gonna stop doing this this is like a very little benefit to me was it was it because of the money or just because you could because i could i was like fascinated with i like set up wallets i was like collecting like mini bits of satoshi's every time uh and i just went down different rabbit holes you know uh on the internet like that so like you know i still have the account to today so it's like today it's like seventy dollars maybe right but i like it like wow did you were you one of those few people that actually kept the private keys of their first bitcoins they ever got yeah i i i i actually surprisingly i don't know how i dug it up but i like i remember one day i was just like looking like i wonder if like uh i have anything i just like searching my email and yeah i still have it actually too bad the airdrops aren't really a thing on bitcoin because those wallets would have yeah yeah um so i learned about that then skip didn't care anything about it i was really like working mostly like tech startups in sydney in like 17 uh 16 and 18 and um around that time period and uh i sort of got bored of like building web 2 and i think i started exploring again and and you know i think i started hearing about like i think in the mid early 17 like people talking about investing and figuring out how like you know uh and i was like wait what's ethereum and i learned there was like many different cryptos other than just bitcoin like i heard about like omg made safe like see a coin and like what the hell is gnosis i'm like what the hell is all of this uh and then that uh wasn't so basically like watching youtube coins for like you know she coined videos for a while until i think in september october of 2017 where i went to my first ever um crypto workshop where uh that bucky pupa the legendary dev of the godfather of crypto in sydney basically it was back then like running uh four hour workshops at the time several times a week around like what is a private key what is a blockchain network it's like what does i can you know what does it look like to run a light node sync a light node right like and that's when when i went to my first one i was like basically like it blew my mind like whoa that's like this is way more than just like uh speculative investments this is like entire like platform like this is something that was gonna be super huge and just like fell down the rabbit hole pretty hard like i went to every one of the workshops pretty much um afterwards and um yeah and uh i think uh that was my entry into crypto so there's uh often at least for people who come into the ethereum community there's like two aha moments there's the aha moment of like oh this crypto thing is for real and it's here to stay and then there's the aha moment is like oh this crypto thing is really all becoming encapsulated by ethereum did you have those two aha moments as well it's not like you definitely had the first you just described it was there anything like that aha moment i to be honest i i was definitely an xrp holder in the beginning i like bought everything i bought litecoin i bought monero i bought xrpl i was like and i think i showed up to that dev workshop being like yeah i'm an investor like you know they're like what are you investing in like oh like ripple's gonna be totally like revolutionizing the future thank you and they're like i sort of now understand why they're looking at me in a weird way um and i think over time like what i i just realized that all these really shady people were like hanging around all the other projects and only really the real developers and builders were hanging around like ethereum their phone community so i sort of like naturally like you know made that realization of like oh this might be the most legitimate one right uh you know the developer that you were talking about who's leading the workshop when he was talking about private keys and blockchain networks was he was he using it is ethereum as like the model or was it more just like technology independent no it was definitely a theory he was showing me uh if like light node syncing he was showing us how to deploy uh erc20 contract through remix uh you know and we were using like you know i think e4 wallet back then as well um yeah it was like very eccentric so yeah yeah when you were you said you got bored with uh working in web 2 and you work for tech startups so what were you doing for tech startups like what's your like technical skill set before you came into crypto um yeah i was a ux designer so i talked to all the users right so uh the last project like web 2 product i walked on was uh cans aid so it was like basically uh this it's basically like if you have cancer you uh mostly like are guided by treatment plans and uh like uh you know based on paper right like you know there's no real way to actually like deliver information uh real time from like yourself to like you know clinicians right so uh like the whole uh life cycle of like getting cancer and like going into prevention and like treatment like it was just it was like in chalk and like stone basically right so it was like i was working an app that basically collected all the data fed it to clinicians and i was a person really understanding talking to all the cancer patients clinicians family members everyone part of the journey and just like understanding the problem space this was like very early on with the startup now still running today um and uh yeah i was i just talked i was the person to talk to everyone uh and put details into a doc and uh distilled them into products and like features and problems and data to biz dev marketing and uh you know product and you know i designed ui and but you know a lot of it was talking to people what about that like behavior or activity do you see yourself like recycling skills into this current web 3 crypto world i yeah i i sort of feel like i hadn't like with community building i just like um well i feel like with community building that's a lot of what i've done in the last couple years and still do a lot of today like at least helping projects think through this um and i would say that a lot of it is just like i take a i i really i guess take a lot from product design and your design and user research because i think in product design right like you the heuristic or that what you're taught is basically to really focus on user needs and you know build empathy with users and customers right and i feel like the equivalent of that of being user like of having user and product obsession in web 2 is like the website equivalent is probably like being community for us and having empathy for community members right so um i think that it's really the same thing and like design in general it's like design is a process right of like id like identifying problem space i getting solutions testing it iterating getting feedback right and with product design you know i guess so being ui designer web designer or mobile designer you just basically you'll assign specific mediums in which you execute design for it right um like you're you know whether you're a graphic designer as well visual designer motion designer you have techniques and tools to solve the problem right or create a outcome or create experience i feel like with um you know building communities it's really designing you're designing an outcome you're designing an environment designing a journey for people to go on to reach a certain goal and instead of uh you know wireframes as being the medium which you express the design through you're doing that through uh communication text storytelling organizing the layouts of discords even to branding to you know all these things and to relationship building your these are your tools and you know instead of me looking at sketch and drawing boxes all day and doing using drop shadows it's probably more uh like people are more of the interface of community building so this is the analogy i've always i've always had uh you know and whenever i'm stuck i usually think like what how do i design myself out of a situation or someone so this is really interesting and i'm trying to figure out the right question to ask um so it feels a little bit like social engineering right where with ux you're trying to optimize towards an outcome my social engineering has like a very negative connotation but right like it does it's a very shady it's very shady connotations like it's not good right but also like almost explicitly crypto is um we are trying to we we have tools to tinker with incentives what does that mean we're tinkering with social dynamics right and in the intro to the show i always say cypherpunks know that the code they write creates social systems or impacts the people that use it right and so like when we're designing these communities like when you're a ux designer you're trying to just basically ease the frictions to get the outcome that you want right like we have this outcome we want to make as many users as possible go through the complete process and actually achieve the outcome with like communities they're almost like isn't an outcome because the community needs to define the outcome all your job is to do is to get people into the community right and have the community figure out the outcome i think it different communities uh can exist in different ways right like you know the way you describe it like you know the community decides to outcome totally right uh but a part of that journey is like helping like often like times it's like facilitating that discovery of what that community wants right and creating like and creating clarity right like that is also the process and once you have some love clarity it's like people like i guess your job is to help people get that right um so in a way it's very it definitely is very uh emergent but there's also something very like operationally rigorous about like once you've like identified what the community wants you've often also had to help the king to get momentum and find uh make it steps towards that right um that's why i think oftentimes like the moment in which a community really becomes alive is often when like you find the community's trust win it's like you know there's plenty of groups that come together that want to do things but they often fizz away because nothing ever gets done there's no ownership right um and oftentimes i feel like the the key there between like fizzling out and like really becoming something special where everyone jumps on and adds on is like you know sparking the first win the first victory for that group uh and getting making sure that it's a a victory that everyone can feel sort of some sense of ownership around right do you think that like so imagine a hypothetical community has come together there's a decent amount of energy in there but there's no w's yet there's no winds but there's some semblance of shared purpose and reasoning goals in some direction as like we don't know where our winds are going to be but we're going to be they're going to be over here like where are they we're going to go that way find a w out there right do you do you think that like maybe the actual instantiation of finding that w can actually change uh the out the the direction of the community community's like well there's there were there's 30 degrees of direction that we're going to go we're actually going to go 30 degrees to the to the left or and we're also going to go 30 degrees to the right but we're going forwards but the actually find the the wind 30 degrees to the left and so everyone stops going right and and because the wind was over to the left the wind actually dictates the future direction have you seen anything like that i've seen communities well yes i definitely hesitated that but i feel like the story of medical is the opposite oh tell me a lot of medical a lot of medical toe has been like i've always been very like i'm very like uh organized so like i want to like make sure we like find when structured wins but it's always like i feel like whenever i've tried to guide the community in many ways um it's what i've ended up achieving is more like incept like performing inception to people being like making sure that like you know it's like we need to get go somewhere let's go i think we're in this direction and then like people some people resist that sort of the meme doesn't catch on and i'm like all right whatever and then very naturally we actually do go somewhere because people are generally aligned with like the requirements of where we need to go and strangely enough it's like the answer is very emergent right and then over time i realized that you know you need enough uh chaos and noise to exist uh you know like some that is actually something like you know a good thing you want a lot of uh you know like sort of friction and like bouncing you want ideas to float in and out you want there to be collisions of ideas and that's sort of where you know yeah the memphis and that's why i think you know um yeah direction comes from so like i realized instead of like forming direction frost uh you know like one of the things i the mentality shifts i went from in terms of making doubt proposals was like instead of like pointing in a single direction first i you know i started writing proposals that really just outlined the vision of where we want to go and then getting alignment there and then just like holding discussions around that vision and then very naturally the the sort of the actual tactical um direction really emerges from some of the members right like it just it sort of clicks when the right meme comes abroad right um yeah and and so that's how i've learned sort of how to operate there's there seems to be like a chicken and an egg discussion here right like do the visions dictate the winds or do the winds dictate the visions and i mean it sounds like there's an interaction between those two things do you have an opinion on which one's more important i don't think the uh sometimes one is important but like sometimes a long-term direction is impo is more important than the current short-term focus but sometimes you need to also run with it sort of like i feel like running communities or fostering communities is a bit like being sort of uh a dj sort of like you know you're like uh you're mixing tracks that work well with each other you should you sort of know what tracks you're putting on but at the same time you're reading the room and the next track that you thought was going to be good 20 minutes ago might not be the right track now like you know uh but there might still be this overall theme and that you want to like mix throughout the night with right like that you have a certain set of song selections right that you want to like play within uh and there's no right answer but like um you know so i think you have to be really present and sort of have your finger on the pulse on making sure you go explore the areas that the community wants explore and at some times make trade-offs to just like project into a certain area because it needs to go where it needs to go right and i think that is like the you know like it's like not too much salt not too little just just right just just enough right so um that's a another cooking analogy i guess it's like you know yeah it makes sense because when you're i'm not i'm not a dj i think you are or at least you very much appreciate people that dj yeah i appreciate my uh warehouse raves and sounds yeah okay okay so it seems to be like the the shared goal behind like a crypto community a community at large but like what we're really talking about crypto communities and a dj is like there's a an energy right there's a vibe that must be sustained uh and the dj's job is to sustain the vibe while also directing it right like making sure the vibe stays alive uh and same thing with it with a community right like there's a vibe and the best thing the the goal of a community is to make that vibe shared by more people right so djs want their music to be listened to by more people d5 communities or crypto communities want their community values to be shared and vibed with by more people and then have that vibe become like stronger and stronger and stronger over time right like it's just like this core energy of like there's probably uh other examples as well and also like time is perfect yeah yeah no this is a perfect way to describe it and um yeah and there's uh you know it's like oftentimes in dallas it's like get done or have fun or do both and like you want to have a bunch of mix of both and do things within that's in line with the vibe of a community right yeah and like there's got to be some sort of semblance balance between like play and work and play right because if you're all if everyone in the dow is working and no one's playing well is that really a vibe but also if everyone's playing and not working then like the vibe is going to die yeah because like all the economic resources are going to get expended yes absolutely right uh the whole coming like it should be a chat this should be a chat it's like the trade-off of like nice yeah it's like the future like nba the the crypto version nd it's like vibing working it's like we've got to find the perfect triangle like of equality here you know um we're working hard playing joints yeah the conjoined triangles of vibing and uh working i don't know there's something here somebody else take this and run with it um peter what was the the first like crypto community that you felt aligned with and identified with good question um [Music] i would definitely say um i came across oh that's right yes this is um so my first crypto conference like in uh may of 2018 you know at contemporanto the day before the conference on i went to this event uh where you know like people were talking about eip zero it was a um back then i think the firm community was like basically in a bit of a show like you know because the uh eip 999 just happened which is basically this like idea to hard fork right oh no no it was like i think parity's uh proposal i'm not sure what it exactly was but i think it's parody's proposal to like uh like hard fork ethereum but that was shut down because like there was like a parody multi stick hack yeah no that that i think that was right yeah uh and the funny thing was also vip 999 backwards is like six six died [Laughter] um so yeah people were talking about uh yeah zero um i mean yeah p9 and i said like you know huge contention because like if i'm hardcore uh from the dow and that happened right but what about parody motorcycle you know blah blah blah so the ip0 was a effort to basically go around the entire film community to collect feedback on how ethereum should be governed what its values were right uh it was one of the first attempts to really put this on paper right um there's a reference to layer zero here somewhere with eip zero it's like the genesis of the genesis of the culture right that's right and i think uh that was an online survey and i was like helping like collate the survey responses together right in a figma board um but i that was a meetup like held by the shared magicians that was in charge of like hosting discussion about uh yeah zero and uh eip uh 999 and i think there was like justice steiner like uh it was lane red tag like uh hudson um i think griff uh griff green they were on a couch and there was like a you know some downtown toronto meetup space there was like lfo there like all the people i saw on twitter but were like just on all that like rl on the couch like talking about this stuff and i was just sitting there like this like little you know dumb nut just like listening in and like trying to keep up and i think that resonated because they were truly trying to like protect something important which is like this like the community around ethereum right making sure it doesn't like fragment and you know making sure governance was sort of sort of conducted in an open fashion i so i really that i think that's the first community i really like resonate with and like forest man was sort of really in the in the weeds helping coordinate everything i was trying to do i wasn't i couldn't really participate in any of the discussions so i just like did the dumb stupid stuff like hey i cleaned up the github issues i i tagged all the posts you know um i wrote the notes for this right um i did things such as like oh let's like don't know anything about the product managers in ethereum and web free back then so i'm going to do eve product interviews right on on everyone on all the pms i knew um and yeah and at that meet-up i just like remember being like wow this is like it's like such a privilege potentially to like contribute to something so big right um and that was like what's the strong impression i was like i wanna i want to do important work one day i like these people having the ethereum cat herders as your first community that you uh came into with is an insanely awesome answer i was expecting to hear some random community that like died out a few a few months later uh if i joined today it'd be like i'm like hey i joined this like social token thing like um it's like we're all getting tattoos you know like getting tattoos there's yeah i'm sure there's gonna be an organization like that if it's not if not already oh it exists oh yeah wait oh is it is it the nft or what is it non-funding yeah yeah hashtag shout out to proof of ink dal proof of ink dao i have not inquired as to how i get my ink um they're not real tattoos though right no they're 100 real there's about like actually 7 21 oh boy i'm not sure i'm ready yeah yeah yeah okay hang on i'm not done with the ethereum cather's uh section yeah why why i you you hinted to it but i just want to want you to unpack and elaborate like why did you decide to commit so much energy to this organization that you just met like what what motivated you to do like the basic stuff even when you couldn't understand the bigger stuff to be honest when i first i guess uh joined this film like when i i guess it goes back to before bitcoin that series tonight like i originally would join just so like i want to like i knew like i think late 17 after going through the workshops i knew that crypto web free interference was like going to be like it was the most i was so i didn't i couldn't explain it to someone very coherently i couldn't i didn't do anything in it meaningfully but i just i knew it was like the the first meaningful adventure that uh you know of crypto really which was like my dedication of time and energy it was like i just was so sure that this was going to be a thing it was like almost [Music] undeniable like i just felt so obvious and i was like it just made sense to get a head start i had a friend on everyone else and like learn about all of this before it became even more complex uh and then you know that when i went into sort of the history of cryptography and realized this connection to the cypherpunks um i sort of became very inspired by the sacrifices and all the work that people did you know back in the 70s and 80s and 90s and i really you know for the first year you know the at least from the start of my journey into ethereum i felt very inspired to like do something meaningful like do work that would be eventually like recognized somewhere you know like in the like like in 50 years later like my my one wishes was like have some piece of work that i've like walked on just like remembered as like somewhat sort of a building block right um so like that was very inspiring um and so i felt like this was important worthy work that like needed to be done and no one else was going to do this nor could i really concentrate in any other fashion like you know everyone else was back then everyone was hiring developers but no one needed like uh community builders or like comms like you know people who can't code effectively right on engineers um so i felt like this is the best grunt work i can do and uh serve uh this sort of movement right so that's what i did and so your resume also includes being a very early if not the earliest member of metacartel when did uh how far ahead in the story am i skipping ahead here um you know maybe so metacattle really the formations happened you know in september of two of i'll try that yeah 2018. that's right um so yeah like i think you know basically medical originally was a technical working group around a ux solution known as meta transactions hence the name right right wow that is a trip yes yes okay sorry keep going yeah so in the same ad con um i believe in toronto there was the ux unconference and that that new york's unconference alex vanishan presented universal logins a ux login solution that was that used gasless voting and multi-sig key management right um and that was like revolutionary and like everyone's like oh my god this is like the future of us we're gonna bring mass adoption you know mass adoption is like solved um and i guess this his technologies like he outlined he didn't really alex anderson didn't invent meta transactions but he's the first one that really popularized it and then brought it into the minds of everyone right um and so uh his video uh tournament universal login spread around and you know i think you know um i started working project uh that you know also wanted to work uh in the same areas meta transactions uh so and i think the first ever like real life working group that emerged around meditations was in uh the first ever east berlin in 2018 um and yeah that's and i remember very distinctly almost photographically like the first meeting of mp like different people from staff from nurses like people and status just gathering in the um hall of uh factory berlin um you know just hey like we're here like let's talk about meta transactions and how do we stand what do we need to do like standardize the contract interface can we create a decentralized meta transactions network and after that event we started a telegram group which is which we is still alive today which is like the main ecosystem chat from metacartel like it's sort of just like general news and stuff like that but you know um where we started the meta transactions working group and then we thought that was a boring name after a couple weeks well you know so we like put up a vote on which name we should name the working group and i think you know we named it metaconsole because actually that wasn't the first name we voted on for the first name was el cartel della meta i mean that was like mp's like it was just like a weird it was like first vote it seemed it won the outstanding vote but like it just was not very easy to pronounce so like the second most bad meme bad me immediately bad meme it was like not even like that long it was like half a day later we realized this is bad let's change it to the meta cartel um and the one that was voted in was like metal with a metal space cartel and they were like no and then mp was like no you put it together right uh so it's like metaconsole and then that's uh i guess the meme is like were the only ones working on reddit transactions uh it's a cartel knowledge uh how many people were there in the instagram chat at the time no more than like 17 20 and i and so we were running the meetings we were writing meeting notes and we wrote down everyone who attended as well so i think like you know we saw the hackmd documents like back then where it's like we also i also wrote like a blog post overview of all the problems you're trying to solve right um and yeah it's like no more than 25 20 20 people trying to work on this back then um yeah and so that a group of people were working on these like problems that uh we're trying to solve that reminds me of uh one of the talks that i listened to at mcon where somebody it might have been you actually talked about how meta cartel was formed uh at least at the maybe it was the meta cartel venture side trying to fund projects that were solving the problems that meta cartel ran into and so like kind of uh linking this back into our discussion about like how a community establishes a vision for itself hey it's very very emergent but it seems to be like this community just formed formed around like hey there's this technology called meta transactions it can be a huge ux upgrade everyone here believes and sees that vision of the huge ux upgrade so let's form a group around this and all of a sudden that group turned into a more instantiated community what was the next steps after putting everyone into a telegram and like finding a name for the organization what happened next uh yeah i guess the fun fact was austin griffin was the first one to join that telegram group chat as well yeah yeah i saw the screenshot that's like um and so yeah after people joined um we like met offline a couple times like east san francisco where we were like hung out did things and then it was actually it was like in october like early october we had east san francisco and that's where the medical logo came about as well um logo is a chili pepper in a sombrero it worked that's dancing and uh miraculous and it was mp yeah dictate and it was frankie nines as well like drawing the thing um and when it came out i was like this is awful like i wanted to be a serious serious like research group i was like i need a job i sort of need some credibility like like you know i'm like putting effort into this volunteer sort of organ like come on like and then like people love the chili logo and i'm like really well at the same time ethereum had his unicorn logo were you maybe you're in the mindset of just like hey i need to look professional because that's what this world is about is that the mindset yeah yeah yeah i think i had this mindset of like i need to look professional because like for us like i'm like i'm like getting to the end of the year and i haven't like done anything like you know i haven't like and i like me to like i was like i'm running out of money i like i need a job like i'm like that was like like like okay yeah um and but you know like i grew to love it over time but you know back then i was like oh god really just like okay whatever i was like disgruntledly like accepted the logo so that's an example where like i really wanted to be one thing but the people loved it which we went with it right so um yeah and and i guess the unique part about the initial seed of medication was that there was a lot of people who joined the community like a lot of people that was part of the initial tech working group around use experience weren't like ephraim ogs there were definitely some right like really like people who were around like stefan from gnosis and people like that but um it was like a lot of new people and i think that's what like really spiced up the group from the beginning it was just like people who came in 17 early 18 who just like were application scrubs like we didn't like we couldn't walk on like baseline stuff we couldn't work on scaling we just like wanted to build cool stuff right like for end users and that's what we cared about um and that i think ceded a lot of the dna of like medication which is like you know have fun do things like run it like sort of run and gun like you know uh move fast and experiment which is the opposite of the fearing back then which is like how do we like build the next thousand years of ethereum you know how do we uh you know yeah build all this infrastructure we we just wanted to expand and move faster it was a fairly counter-intuitive sort of mindset as well like and then and that's what actually i think like signaled and attracted all this all the interesting people that uh became metacottol um you know like you know early on there's definitely this uh like generational phenomenon where generations in crypto find themselves like they all like we all got into crypto with the same background like we all we here's like the centralized blockchain scam that we all fell for at the same time uh and then and then we found ethereum all of us more in the same like few months or so and then yeah everyone finds like commonality in that when they actually got into into crypto hey guys in the second half of the show the story of meta cartel continues uh it is an endless story it's a long term games story so the story by hopefully by definition does not end but unfortunately we have to break up the podcast to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for

of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave.com um but i just want to keep on on going with the story so metacartel formed after an alliance behind like trying to work on um meta transactions came up with a name came up with a logo what what was the motivational energy to keep this organization like cohered was it was it considered an organization at this point or were you still kind of in this like oh yeah there's like a group of people under this like label like take us from the pre-organization to actually an organization yeah yeah that's a very good framing uh yeah it was like honestly because it had like the chili logo and i think because that helps much actually like i'm so thankful like because of that because like if it was a serious thing i might have treated it more like a serious thing but because i had a chili logo and like had all these amazingly like smart people crowd around it and like for some reason solely gained a lot of legitimacy like you know just like had smart people coming in to like collaborate and solve problems and uh i but despite that i just sort of thought of it as a huge joke that got bigger and bigger like we like printed out a medical shirt and like gave it to alex vanderson to wear and we printed the logo on the wrong side of the shirt it was backwards so we like you had to make a purpose like alex jennison no we made a mistake it was just like some printed shirts and for some reason the logos on the back were like who the hell did i didn't this um and then we wanted to have alexanderson wear it but he's just like oh yeah i'll work backwards so i don't know if you can find him in 2018 in prague he was giving a talk and he uses totally backward shot like just looks weird um and um yeah and then we were like oh my god like alexander since worrying about wearing the medical shirt you know and i think then i had a i remember the interaction where i was trying to give joseph lubin and sitting in the front row a medical toll logo like syco and he's like what the hell is this and i just sort of shied away i didn't explain it i was just like look have it and what this is enough um and so yeah anyways uh we try to solve my transactions over the new like i think at prague is when we made a breakthrough and like you know a lot of the main problems were solved around meta transactions and uh that's where the gas station network came about when tabuki really made this like the design shift you know um and yeah i think it would i i think in the new years like early 2019 uh 19 then like you know denver or whatever like i wasn't at the very end but like and a lot of the research problems are over so i felt like okay this is this was like a fun thing this is done i didn't even think about it right until i think like uh you know people someone was like in the telegraph chat like hey like where are we meeting up and this was like for eve denver like we have to do what like like and and i guess at that point we had like spent a lot of time together as a group like we had we you know hosted dinners that we took out whole restaurants out filled up the whole restaurant you know we've like did a lot of research calls offline and online and it became i think when the first person volunteered to you know like volunteer to run the meet up and fund the meet up and like find sponsors and it autonomously came together i think that's when i really started taking medication very seriously i was like wow this is like there's now a community here it is not just me trying to keep it alive you know um and i think that's when i was like okay like i'm gonna dedicate this next year um like i love time boxing initiatives and sprints like i'm gonna time box one more year uh or one year to purely focus on growing medication as a community and i just knew that it was a very valuable hub of people who are very application uh minded and i didn't really know where i would go i like you know i talked a lot with drew harding and james young like back in late 2018 about like should we create like a dab development you know studio adventure studio can we create a gap incubator and i think that's where my mind went it's like how do we get more adapts how do we build more daps and how to experiment with more use cases and it took on more generalistic sort of focus of like let's build stuff that's useful um absolutely did not get that off the ground because you had no credibility there's no money there's anywhere um no track record as well and and you really failed to like i think we tried literally trying to form adaptive incubator but we're like where do we get money like i don't know like do you know like racism you know no one has [Music] how do you do this thing i don't know so um we fluffed around for a bit more until i think and that was also when molecule was launching and i think james young was talking about molecular to me yapping his goddamn ear off to me like you know about molotow dabs and i basically like uh blocked any sentence in my mind while i can doubt in it for like a while until i think i realize that like when markdown made its first grant uh and i was like wow like this is the first ever doubt i've ever seen or like existence that is actually like creating growth valley today and that's when i really like started to hook up and like oh wow i want to join this thing um and you know obviously they didn't let me because uh i was poor and i no one knew who i was as well um and uh but you know that was the moment where i was like  you guys i'm gonna uh create my own dao or like as a joke just it was initially a joke i had a chat a call of cassandra and a meme like as a after like a debrief of like why the was i like not allowed to give away my own money and volunteer it wasn't like yeah and then um they're like why don't you create your own jail oh turn medical telling the dow i'll launch it down from medication and i was like great let's why not do like a grand style focusing like a molecule but focus on like out of the application layout right yeah that's what made a cartel that was my first impression of metal cartel was just another moloch dow but with a more specific direction of what it wanted to fund and it was like it was moloch dao for the ux layer is that right yeah absolutely and i spent about a month talking to fill my days up of course like 10 12 calls at a time just talking to everyone i knew in the space which is not a lot and just ask everyone for money to put it into a dow um and i think that back then now was sort of not exciting but not exciting enough uh and i think like you know we announced it down like you know but surprisingly i guess when we announced it more publicly people really wanted to experiment downs and i think even more after when like joseph lubin and vitalik uh and consensus yeah put in like four million four five million dollars in somalia i was like oh wow this is like this is happening right so um but even then we could barely scrape together a hundred fifty thousand dollars by june um to launch the thing like it was honestly a dire sort of effort of like and it was i guess like we scraped together maybe a thousand one point five thousand beef at the time it was just like a hundred dollars roughly or even less even than that um oh no it was definitely last it was like 900 e 800 yeah um and uh we were just like trying to figure this out i was super scared like never done it down before uh yeah it's like i was like shaking like and we had a first down meeting and i was like trembling in my voice i was like trying to get people to introduce themselves right and i was like dude do people want to do stuff now then like people like do people like this like i just no frame of reference i was just like scared and trying to do things but the going back to some of the things we were talking about at the very beginning of this is like it seems to be that meta cartel was definitely a balance of work and play right like they had this goofy logo had this kind of funny name um there wasn't really a shared vision or shared direction that was very well defined yet but the vibes were very strong it sounded like like one thing that met a cartel had going for it was like really really good vibes uh and then we enter like the whole moloch dao phase where uh you know amin kind of pioneered uh the whole like making daos cool again um and then meta meta cartel was probably was just like right behind the whole dow movement it's like well what whatever we don't we still don't know what our our organization is going to be about but we can at least formalize it into a dow and kind of go from there um we we would you say you were like the lead community organizer or lead community manager of medicine i was the time i was the i was a lead uh slave of medical hotel the the drummer eye drummer yeah i i did everything and anything uh the community wanted me to do i was operating in at its wish i was enforcer right like you know uh and to be honest like now i haven't like thought too much about that time period when like just trying to formalize what is medical telling you know what it is like as a dow right um i was holy god pretty shitless scared i was like literally did not know what i was doing i was like i hope this like people don't get pissed that i'm like wasting the time i'm like it's just like and when people committed i'm like i'm just like make sure you commit the eve right like and the unborn like like it was basically i don't know like it wasn't it was through if a scan yeah we got everyone to onboard free to scan you know for the contract uh interface there yeah and we're like trust me like this is legit like this it was like instructions in the notion doc and i just like made crm being like just ping everyone to like on board um and i was like just a lot of fun scared i was like yeah like you know like people who commented like hundred east and like they were very important commitments and i was just trying to make sure that like they came for a right um but then we got off and running and i think yeah a lot of those people i knew a lot of people reaching out like uh that wanted to join and it was a mix of like people that just i think were ready to experiment like in hindsight it was like a very forward thinking like everyone who uh sort of pledges of menopausal doubt at the start doing fascinating things now today just like it was like really like people who wanted to build downs and experiment and they were the first people who took the leap of faith i felt like with molok it was a lot of eth whales but these people with medical at all like we raised the minimum pledge amount to you know 10 years from 100 so it was like a lot more like ordinary people builders and like less east whales and um you know that i'm like i'm like ever like so thankful to anyone who even pledge anything to that down like back then because without their leaves of faith like it would not be like we would never have done the experiment like it was literally people like you know uh you know just people from the community being like look here's a hundred each like like yes experiment you know like and i'm like thank you sir like you know like you know like i i just it was i really couldn't help them back uh you know and uh i think that's what i really checked about the culture of like let's just do it like you know um [Music] and yeah so and so very so like internally thankful to like everyone who like pledged back then and just like or even retweeted or even supported the thing like you know yeah so why did you give a so much like if it was if the direction of meta cartel was undefined and like the vision was unrealized and and the direction like no one really knew what you were doing and you didn't even know where meadow cartel was going why did you put so much energy into it why did you commit to so hard yeah so in early 2019 uh i mean yeah i was like trying to like i was give myself some leeway of like okay let's spend a couple months trying to figure out medical stuff we'll commit a yeah but to be honest two three months into the year when i was kind of failing to get the dap incubator stuff off the ground i started looking for jobs again i i was like applying to places for pm rolls comes yeah yeah like crypto jobs it was like coms rolls community management roles like ops roles anything non-technical no one would hire me like no one would like pick up like respond to my like application seat like no one would and i was like i'm so like i'm like oh my god um like i'm like getting pretty broke like this is you know uh like not good like um and i think like the medical things like when i when i was rejected and this prospect of like building it down like you know like it was the decision of like go fund it continually finding a job or like go continue wandering in the desert and like just like be accept this a bit like this possibility that i might just get fully lost and like not come back out alive or well and i think to do anything really out there and creative you just you have to accept and the fate this potential fate that you might just get really lost enough and it might not be a good outcome right so i just like i was like it you know this is there's a chance that like doing the first focal mallet was going to be a really big an interesting experiment this is potentially a chance like make a mock right like you know uh in the space and uh yeah i just went went into it and i think uh that's when actually like finance tech from finance x they were doing fellowships they have plenty of money back then so i guess they were just funding like cool projects in space of fifteen thousand dollars five thousand dollars a month so it's like a three month uh thing and that came in super clutch yeah like i would have that just like funded like you know i got to believe it was super cheap lots of kebabs you know i split the payment the fifteen thousand dollar payment uh five thousand dollar payment every month two free ways some to pee some to alex hoffman who was working on the dow back then some to uh myself and um just like that was super clutch and then once we had money in the dow i was like okay like i was just sort of every now and then like begging for some money you know like hey here's a can i have a couple thousand like two thousand two three thousand dollars three four thousand dollars in there like literally like every two or three months this wasn't like a weekly thing it was like three months later i was like i had no money please i need to go to death garden like five thousand dollars um and um yeah people like yeah of course but to me i was like just privileged to like welcome the thing um and yeah and you know surprisingly we had uh we got somewhere i guess and i think a lot of the we didn't know what we're doing just like funding different things like we founded kickback we funded uh like dao ideas right and i think that's when we started going from just dapps to like thinking i'm more about taos of like okay we have grand doubt but what about doubts parties at sponsor events right what about dows that are like uh that are projects how do you turn a project into a gal how do we uh can we take a create a dev shop down right uh what about an investment down like an upgraded version of the grand stamp that could actually valid capture right like um and that's where i think a lot of metacartal ideas were like you know from there was like really discover and also question like what is the future we want to build here like why are we so interested in dallas and that and i think in the latter part of 2019 especially when we had an off-site we called mcon zero right which was like 15 of us just like coming to denver for an off-site after you know um after uh osaka devcon we like came together to talk about like what are the values of mendicots or what uh the visions that we wanted to build like in web3 um and what are we going to stand for like what is what are we going to work on and you know and that was a very pivotal sort of like moment it's a time period for medical when did you go into that conversation with your own answers as in what you wanted to see meta cartel turn into absolutely none yeah you were there to listen yeah i was the guy i was like let's do let's hang on denver and then like oh people were like yeah let's do it um and i was just i was like mind blown that like we could get like 15 brilliant people from the internet to meet irl in denver um it's just like that was mind-blowing itself like let alone m con the recent m-con one like we're like got 700 people to come together right um and i think like there was a moment in like the our brainstorming sessions and our airbnb were like what like what do we what is our vision and just like super quiet you know one and then i think i just like started ranting like without any thought in my mind like everything's gonna be a game like you know and then people i'm like yeah like you know this is like the economically for like that will turn everything into a game like you you know you can uh like schools will be gaming like work will be gamified right like you know um you're walking down like everything will be we just like started ranting like you're being absurd about the future with what we knew about dallas right and we wrote it all down into this thing called the web free manifesto um and uh that we shouldn't probably use that as an investment pieces in hindsight as well you know we shouldn't have just like voted down and did do not too much with it um but and then we wrote down a valley we that was a bit more you know there was more clarity of that i think we could put it down but um that was a very spontaneous moment in the middle of that room where we just like sort of had like yeah like really express like where we thought the future was going and like that was like a strong driving force of like we want to build this like world that was more equitable richer you know fairer right um and a place that could benefit more and more right and create more and increase less scarcity um you know so like and yeah i think um that's one of the uniting factors i think of medical it's not only our values and like what we care about but also like we all generally i think are like deltas like we were like either like not like coders or like product people like you know traditionally it's like everyone who's there is like here to build the future and like of like what what pre is and like uh to explore the frontier right and none of us there were like really i think like really in it for the tech basically right um um that's one way to describe it how did you you speak about um the the values in this conversation where you just started ranting and other people were there and everyone was sitting in a in a circle all trying to come to terms with how they didn't have an identity about what this thing was but everyone realized that they needed one and no one knew what the answer was um how or why did this whole um growing the pie um attitude or um sustainable wealth approach and creating wealth and sharing it like that's for something i find very very deep with and one of the reasons why i'm attracted to the whole meta cartel cohort of individuals is like they know that the cool thing about web3 and ethereum is that we've found ways to generate wealth sustainably uh and we get to the and the more we actually share it the more we actually get to generate uh that took me like i only kind of discovered that mental model like very very recently some of the meta cartel people have been talking about this since since day one can you just talk about how that sort of vision and ethos arose who like who voiced these opinions the loudest what did they say how did it come about i think that um this was from the very very start of like um medical from the working group days like it just made sense that like why are we like talking about like meta transactions in isolated pockets let's come together like what much more powerful smarter you know we can get much more done by collaborating and there was just like this collaborative energy i think from the very very very start um we took that energy to events like to create events to uh we took that energy into everything we did and i think that really was the driving forces like and then i think like somewhere early along the lines i i knew this african proverb called like if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together and i just like slapped it somewhere and everyone's like yeah that's like that's our thing uh so that and then so i think that was like this random sort of meme that clicked as well you know and i think this is where like everyone who really carries it like really has ownership over this everyone truly believes it in the bottom of their hearts that this is like the best way to actually conduct ourselves in web pre to work with each other right like we have meta consoles like a community of different gals and different people like we don't have a single gal anymore right so it's just initiatives of medication and despite that we all try to support one another's initiatives we try to we we are like this social fabric that collaborates with events and you know the reason i think we still stick together is because like everyone who's like drawn to it i generally like feel that like we can benefit one another by like actually up in a very positive sub manner and just like uh people curation i think was a big focus throughout all of medical talk too just making sure you had very well well natured like individuals who are more who are givers than takers right um and we looked for other givers in spaces and brought them in um and i think that is like sort of the key key right like you know um and yeah we've had to remove a few bad apples over the years only a few to be honest but um yeah like i think there's a huge focus in curation and there's this energy at the start as well um when if ever did the conversation about economic sustainability come about there was ever a moment it was like hey guys like it's really cool that we're that we give away money but like you can only give away money for so long until you run out of money right did the conversation of like how do we make metacartel economically sustainable ever come about yeah we did throughout the whole time but and i think it was only that it only got became more of a talking point when um i think like i really started to burn out in like early 2020 just complete burnout i think like barely just got ventured out up and running then um and massive burnout just like loss of motivation like wanted to i was like instantly when i burnt out like secluded to myself from all social media or communications like two weeks and i think like i i just like realized what i was doing like walking like literally insane hours like uh like it would be i don't even count the hours like this is the only thing i did every day and i had one day off and i would just be a vegetable for that day and i think like that creative energy that that you sort of like have the the type the energy that you know makes you go wander in the desert aimlessly in search of me you know sort of something interesting to build right that does have a short fuse on it like uh and you know if you can't operate in that mode which i was operating the last two years then very you know in a sustainable fashion and i think that's when we started thinking that's when we started formalizing roles pedro's but by then it was sort of like okay like i'm like totally like burnt out i just need space and time right um in hindsight now that you are where you are have you gotten more financial capital by working for or with meta cartel or social capital that that was the thing i realized uh when i burnt out that like social capital doesn't put food on the table doesn't pay for flights doesn't uh pay for it you know you can't fund other people with so like you can't i was i also saw other starving teams and projects that were doing amazing things and i just was totally helpless almost like in helping them and i just felt like terrible i was like i literally can't help you i can reach like you know i can tweet about you but you know i can't actually like put food on the table for you right and i think that was like a very and that experiencing that myself made me realize like oh wow like it you know i think i went from very idealistic like this let's just experiment to like oh wow like if we were sort of powerless without any resources and we're not being sustainable and not generating more resources or accumulating more as a community right um we can't we don't we're sort of powerless right and and you know uh and if we care about others and we want to help others when we have this like responsibility to make sure we are sustainable and that we are actually do like you know uh grow resources and grow leverage grow ability to help people and um like like resources wealth uh governance power influence social capital all of this i feel like it's totally meaningful as uh like meaningless unless you're able you're able and willing to use that to like benefit others and like why else would you like you know like i yeah that's sort of the mind shift shift i sort of made and um yeah and that's sort of what i think medical tend from like a research house more into like how do we like make sure we make sure like the projects of everyone and medication succeeds how do we make sure the people individually succeed both you know like from uh the personal uh you know like you know satisfaction the personal lives to like the you know financial to the create like whatever they wanted to achieve right like that it became more of that of a focus and i think that sort of been stemming on ever since last year and we're yet to maybe we're yet to like re-establish what medical is about but it's been a lot more of that uh in the last year or so than just let's experiment for the sake of experimenting let's you know let's just give out grants and do things without thinking about the long term is that where medic cartel finds itself today is in search of economic sustainability i would see that really falls in the individuals of its members but i would distill metacartel like today to the most trust what like i would say at least from my opinion like i'm trying to make it the most trusted most good-willed good-natured list of true like curated lists of people in all of crypto right like uh that's a highly curated list and um that's like what it is it's like you know that if you're in presence of medical so you're in good company like you know uh amongst people who play uh shitty games you know you're going to have a certain level of trust like automatically the mood slightly you know you're more able to express yourselves and you know let your god down a tiny bit because you know you're amongst people who are who share your values but also you're amongst people who are willing to like protect those values as well right um and enforce it and to also like curate for those values right and i think that's what we're trying to really consolidate medicals all around you know so does that mean that metacartel is more of a social doubt like maybe maybe i would say yeah yeah it's just a curated list of good people yeah and i think the love of curation is not just like you buy two but i think would who knows if we're ever gonna have a liquid turn but like right now as we're thinking it's like we want to have like the best curation like the most anal most like back-breaking level of curation as humanly possible like uh like yeah like uh multi-human factorial vibe checking and not just like we like this person it's like we've walked into spots and we've interacted over a long period of time they've shown how they make decisions they vibe well like uh they get involved they lean in like this level of like curation and just making sure that like we endorse and we like help the people that are truly these gems that care about the same things we do succeed in any way shape or form right with the collective leverage that we have right so when medicare tells like culture and vision and ethos vibe if you will is like you must be a good person a provably good person person and then also be able to use that goodness for others and have an interest in doing that when we like that it's very easy to have a positive son some nature when like everyone is inside of this group with a positive some nature helping other people with positive subnatures helping other people with positive subnatures and so it's a great way for positive some natures to rise to the top right like you can actually bootstrap but historically people always say like you know nice guys finish last right like if you're if you work for others then others will just take advantage of you and extract that but if you can actually put up borders around the good people and say like here all the good people go in here and you find yourself with you won't actually find anyone in metacartel that's extract only because by definition it's a curated people of list a listed a curated list of people that if you give something to them they give something more back to you and then you give something more back to someone else yeah uh we celebrate like those that give selflessly like it's it's like we make sure we consciously like chant like you know uh really uh acknowledge and like you know uh highlight that um and i guess it's like medications version of a good person you know like a medical good doctor up to your your core you might think we're a bunch of and that is totally fine that is okay uh but we're like a guild we're a fraction in this space and we're of a certain flavor and those that are sort of amongst core or potentially very well vetted or just endorsed right in some way should form you know we will probably work on something more formalized but for now it's a bit more like you know amorphous and you know sort of uh i guess like peer vouched um but we want to make sure that like you know uh yeah there's a sort of protection and not only protection but like this platform to empower those right like uh that give the most and uh it's like a social have a download trusting nature and that's in the past it's definitely like cost me i've trusted people that i should not have trusted if this is before crypto um in the last the last few days in colorado at mcon a bunch of all the amcon people the meta factory people went out to uh where was it was it breckenridge or somewhere in colorado yeah yeah in um somewhere so late no no no lake actually but a group of people they rented out like six houses so we could all go hang out with each other in the middle of uh the colorado mountainside and uh almost everyone brought their backpacks with their laptop and also ledger in it and everyone just like tossed down their backpacks into a little like here i put your backpacks over there like dump it over there and then everyone just like started walking around the hills of colorado in varying states of sobriety yeah yeah no one like everyone knew that everyone else's ledgers and laptops were like right next to each other and no one gave a flying like it like no one cared at all that that's that's the first time it's ever come across my my mind that like people's ledges and laptops were all bunched up next to each other in a room those house houses that were totally unattended i didn't know 50 of the people there like i had like i did not know oh yeah like i'm not actually in like uh medic cartel and so like there's a bunch of yo yo you're pretty you're pretty like you've heard me like most yeah yeah yeah yeah so like i actually feel like you don't need to be like part of any specific doubt to be a medical community member nowadays it's sort of like you show up it's like you you know like you show up to the i don't know like the scouts or i don't know you show up to the some gym a couple times and now you're regular i guess right right and yeah so are there defined you are in meta cartel or you are not is there is there is there anything like like actually defined there i would say varying degrees but we need to do a better job that's why i think you know over the christmas over the end of this year we're definitely gonna there's a clear intent to really work on defining those uh what those boundaries and we'll probably what we'll do is just like initially like come work on a list of 5 600 people who are like these metacartal people to get added um you know ask us fill out this type form and this is the person that's a bouncer and you might gradually decentralize that like you know we might give everyone a nft and say like you guys every year you guys vote on five people who are the gatekeepers and balances of this list just like keep it super lightweight like you don't need to have voting like you know curation is done by the best curators like you know everyone's the best curator of people um so and i think most people get that like a lot of the core p medical has been around for ages like they've always like sort of had suspicions of like what like why why is it like many times like very militaristically like run like wait what like you know there's a lot of dictator memes even though we're down and like but i think over time they trusted the process that like you know you give someone you delegate someone power you trust that is literally a value of medical trust trust like like back others right like place your trust in them right they're here for a reason uh and you know you can withdraw that trust any time if you wanted to so as long as that's uh you know um go for it um so we're gonna probably formalize that some way shape or form and maybe like you know just something like democracy you know uh revisited but unchanged it's like five people uh gatekeepers to remove anyone from lists three people need a vote and three out of five multi-signers i don't know um to add anyone two out of five and just the goal is to not grow that list quickly but painfully slowly like yeah very appropriately um now once members every three months this should be a process that lives you know in the background mm-hmm um it sounds like i think yeah it sounds like meta and i know sorry go ahead go ahead a little bit and i think the end goal is like you know and we just have this launching list of addresses where like you guys all get private access to like all these great things um yeah it sounds like meta cartel has actually never been wholly defined sounds like it's always been a little bit of a just like a vibe not uh not a constitution vibes only do you think that like maybe that's actually the optimum optimal path for meta cartel is to kind of only be a vibe and not ever have a constitution that's a good question if someone comes up with one and we all vibe yeah why not but you know i think we've just i feel like we've always just just done enough right to like to like just created just enough social infrastructure for the group to be functional and to go where it needs and beyond that um it's i think you get like uh diminishing level returns in terms of how much effort and thinking you put in how much meaning do you descri ascribe to the meta cartel name like i know it was kind of created on a whim yeah meta cartel does that mean name mean anything um at least to you it's sort of it's i it's definitely a bit numb to me i think you know because it's just like it's been everywhere but i think the meaning of it is definitely of a like it's like chaotic good at its best it's like a chaotic good nature like sort of energy right and um that's the sense i get from it and when i think about it i think when i think about medical it's all i think about like the standards it's set in the past by you know the former members the members in the past the prior activities to be done and it sort of makes me feel like you know we should continue it's like there's something to live up to at least in the past right so um i and like a lot of the work we did i think with in 2019 and 18 it's like we could probably never replicate ever again we're in a totally different state of mind like just focus as well um and with the right people right growing together um and then in that sense you know it's like a very rich i feel like it's just this really rich journey and piece of history we've all sort of been able to share thankfully uh you know and different people keep joining it i think that's something we want to foster it's a journey that everyone adds on and on you know like some of the best most active members you know are the new ones often times right uh they bring the energy um and the vibe um and i almost feel like uh you know when i'm like working with 1kx and working another dows and helping other people form gals like medical is like as like this element of like chaotic good it's such a it gives it so also so amorphous like it's just sort of very undefined it's been shifted in what it is over the years i sort of use it as this like almost this expression of community this nature it's like you study we study nature because it's not controlled it's erratic and it's you know um emergent like you know we study uh how the forest grows how uh lightning flashes across the sky and we look at the patterns and i feel like what metacartel was was this sort of phenomena which i often reflect upon and try to learn from even years onwards right where like how do you run a community what went right and i try to take pieces of that when i was you know when you i'm like just in certainly tunnel division in you know because i think you're in a different mode when you're like working on something 100 hours a week completely broke and you need to create something right you know you like you're with your back against the wall and like uh i i definitely not uh at that state level or in that state of mind anymore and i'm trying to like it's like a fossil which i'm trying to learn from right right um the if it kind of feels like meta cartel is like um a meme in the sense that like i remember i worked as a uh at an ico advisory company in 2017 that was my first crypto job and like a number of the icos that came through the pipeline were like tokenized memes it was so antithetical right like we're going to take a meme and we're going to tokenize it we're like you actually can't tokenize a meme a meme is something literally if you try and capture it it goes elsewhere and i feel like that's that's why i asked um maybe metacartel is better off with an undefined vision because if you try and define it well what whatever meta cartel is will actually just route around the definition and it'll turn into something else like great we made we informally instantiated meta cartel well it let's do a different telegram and like talk in that one instead i feel like if you try and capture it the energy will actually just go elsewhere this is a very profound point actually um it's a it's an amazing point like yeah because like even whatever we do we're like i think we're going to call it the meta something or medical's thing not the metacartel right that's a meme that will like we've maybe like instantiated maybe some of the values and the visions that will like be there but it's almost like it's like hidden it's like it's been it's been so many blocks now that like it's just buried in the history of ethereum and like fossilized by all the hashes right and we can do nothing now but to look back and learn it what those transactions meant and then try to interpret those right and what will happen onwards is other blocks we sort of do make right um yeah um my my vision of metacartel what the name actually means like well first you have meta and crypto people love being meta right like we like zooming out crypto in my opinion crypto people are kind of tapped in to how the universe works almost better than anyone else any other cohort of individuals in the world in the universe like crypto people they they connect weird dots and then they get it right right and so they understand the world they understand the universe at a meta level right and then the cartel aspect is like uh a cartel is like the first early formations of uh a government right like what do you get out of a cartel cartel comes knocking on the door and says like hey we want to offer you guys protection and then they people responded like uh protection from what it's like oh anything bad from happening including us if you don't pay us yeah that's what a government is right like government's like hey like you gotta pay your taxes and if you don't we'll throw you in jail like that's just one's legitimate one's brand new um so like we have this nebulous group of people which as as we've discussed are a group of people with shared vibes shared values uh grow a positive some nature with a commitment to help that positive some nature uh be bestowed upon other people also in the meta cartel and so while we were walking around the hills of colorado um i very much felt like if ethereum and if the the values ryan said something on the weekly roll up uh last week that stuck with me and when it was uh when you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values and so the idea is that like when when you take it when you use ethereum and when you come become a part of daos and you adopt nfts you start to adopt the values that are embedded into these systems the values of decentralization the values of everyone is equal everyone is an admin and so going back to metacartel we have this group that is very very meta that understands the world at a very deep level and self selects for people that with a positive some nature that hopefully in my mind it actually is the new like society the new culture the new genesis of the new culture right because we want to we want to completely rip out the old financial system inject it with this new financial system and then as a result of that really what we're trying to do is we're not just trying to get people to adopt new technologies we're trying to get people to adopt new values and so for me meta cartel is like the new social layer zero right the new layer zero for not just like crypto but for the whole rest of the world and if medicartel can keep on self-selecting for the people that carry the vibe forward and add energy to the vibe hopefully meta cartel uh blankets the whole entire world with its values with its vibe right like maybe maybe it's way too ambitious to assume that like you know every single person's a theory mattress will be a part of the meta cartel but i do think that more uh sneakily will my cartel come to envelop the whole entire world by blanketing the whole entire world with its values wow that's a profound uh vision yeah i i i guess it's weird to see someone uh else sharing uh talking about medical like that because medical has just been this like tragic like hiccups series of hiccups and you know misadventures and like somehow we're like stumbling forwards and then like now we're here and um it's been you know maybe three years since many castles been around like who knows we'll be in like seven years and many council's like 10 years old right um and but i think that's like i guess yeah and i guess like who do you want your neighbors to be in crypto right um like men how do you learn how to be like right like um yeah um so you know i i think like we'll keep doing what we'll keep doing and you know i think this has this insane focus of like you know uh championing and cherishing and appreciating great people you know great people who give and play positive some games and um hopefully yeah it leaves the the space one person better i guess right um peter who are your heroes in this space oh man who are your great people this is super hard i think definitely like i mean salamani like uh he's amazing mentor like uh of of me helped me so many ways from like lending me a couch to the like massage bedroom to sleep in in his in spank house uh back in 2019 was like flat broke um i think um he's definitely one i think you know and i think there's many others like uh you know like the odyssey crew or um like you know uh yellow like james young all these other people like that i'm not mentioning just like the early medical folks uh that are like sort of really like shaped how i think uh yeah awesome peter this is a fantastic conversation is there any anything any uh part of this story that i haven't gone down yet no i think uh this is amazing yeah like i think we really went through everything all things metacultural history right and um we talked to really we really went into what it was really about and i think hopefully those who are listening may get a better sense of what we are beneath the events beneath the memes beneath the surface layer events you might come across the reason why we are the way we are like you know why we might even be fairly selective and exclusive in the way we operate in in many ways and um so yeah what's the uh the biggest lesson you've learned in crypto that you think would be relevant for for listeners to hear i think medical would have never i think like been this so important to me if i didn't like take a leap of faith and just like it and and you know like just like i think like to be willing to just wonder and be lost like like with with something that i thought was important right so i feel like you know if you feel like something's super important you don't know where it will take you um but you believe it's an important cause and mission and um i would say yeah like and there's this huge ominous sense of unknown like go for it like this this is like uh back yourself and something interesting will happen when you you use the wandering in the desert metaphor like you're out there broke wandering in the desert trying to find something did you did you actually find something or did you actually just make a settlement yourself out of this piece of the desert and then that settlement actually ended up working out which do you think is more accurate i think i don't know yeah um it's more like uh you know i made enough noise attractive village and then that village now sustains who i am in many ways right like uh it's like it's funny because i'm like almost uh the delinquent of the village or city that has met a console and i'm taking care of me now like it's like you know i'm like i'm lost i need a car you know back to from the mountains to denver i'm like please please help like you know like you know yep someone please you know help do this thing or we need a venue like this brilliant people stepping up and um yeah so like just privileged i guess peter thank you for uh coming on layer zero this has been a fantastic conversation i really appreciate it david cheers hey we hope you
