bankless Nation we have a special bonus episode for you is coinbase moving offshore that is the question has the regulatory climate in the U.S become so bad that it has caused one of America's largest exchanges to actually relocate to another jurisdiction that is the question we pose on today's episode we're gonna be talking about coinbase's digital asset business license from the Bermuda monetary Authority and what's going on over there David who do we have on we're talking to Tom Gordon who is the vice president of international policy at coinbase and this really got on a radar win Tom and and uh his co-worker release a blog post that talked about this license that coinbase has gotten in Bermuda which has raised the question is is coinbase moving offshore and are they doing one of those offshore derivatives exchanges which we all know about we've seen these before is coinbase doing one so these are the big questions and that's the questions that we start with asking Tom about but then it spirals into a much longer conversation about about the global chessboard of international rules and regulations and how that makes some areas easier for coinbase to operate in and harder for the coinbase operate in and how will this landscape change and adapt moving forward and overall what is coinbase's plan for navigating this changing chess board so that's the episode before we get into that episode bankless Nation we got a message from our friends and sponsors over at swellnetwork really cool decentralized staking protocol David what does swell want bankless listeners to know the swell sticking as a service Dao is life so you can now go stake with swell no minimums lower fees higher yields because swell is both a staking as a service Dao like rocket pool or like Lido but is also a defy yield Optimizer kind of like your so multiple sources of yield brand new product there's a link in the show notes to join the community if you want to get in on the bottom floor of something that's brand new into the ethereum staking and defy yield Marketplace don't just hold your eth guys stake your eth as well as a fantastic protocol to do that link in the show notes Ryan before we get into this episode I want to just like bring up uh this era in crypto is marked by regulatory we're talking about Gary Gensler every step of the way yeah and it's so frustrating and it's regular season which is not a fun season to be in uh and I remember going through just lessons from Cycles have passed back in 2018 which was 2020 2022 so like it was down only and then it was 2019 which was the year of both building and also frustration uh and so understanding the landscape and I was newer at the time but understanding the landscape because there was also regulatory conversations back then too China was Banning crypto for the some of the first times uh we were finally seeing crypto have a glimmer of relevancy in uh Congress although albeit briefly but it was still similar yeah now these conversations have moved forward one cycle bigger uh crypto's one cycle bigger and so as we have these much bigger common stations I just want to remind listeners that this was always inevitable and this is part of the plan and just because we are in the Pain part of the cycle that means that the better Horizons are on the way and this is what coinbase is saying this is what why they are doing their International strategy and I think it's going to force the hand of the United States uh eventually once we are done gritting our teeth and getting through 2023 regulatory season yeah I think that's a great Point what I would add to that is um the the problem this we're still in the bear Market obviously and this is kind of a regulatory bear the last bear Market David back to 2018 you know what kind of bear that was wasn't a regulatory bear so much I know there's some flood in China those minor comparison we didn't have product Market fit okay we had nothing we would be begging at that time please talk about us in front of Congress uh Mika regulation in Europe that would be a dream like oh my God crypto is actually important enough to pass European regulation on that would be incredible and so um even though some of you might be thinking about this regulatory season is it's bearish let me tell you this is this is the most following condition this is exact this is a win condition this is a problem that a winning industry actually has where uh okay now it's big enough we have product Market fit it's established enough we're at one trillion dollars and now uh the worldwide Regulators have to figure out how to handle this asset class so that's the wider context of you could look at the short run you could be like bearish well you know Gary Gensler in the US doesn't get it and they're falling behind no this is incredibly bullish we have major International communities and geographies actually talking about crypto passing regulation about crypto it's entered the conversation there's hearings in Congress about this so that is the The Wider context I think where we bring on this guest today yeah and we it's also important to know that like oh don't be bearish bankless Nation the only reason why we're saying that is because Ryan and I are from the United States this is only bearish for the United States crypto is fine it's just going to be better elsewhere sorry to the United States citizens but this is just a bullish crypto conversation for the rest of the world you know the United States is a very wealthy and very large market and eventually we need the full weight of the United States behind crypto but the the Brian brings up a very important a very important point of this episode is that when other jurisdictions entice crypto it forces the United States hand um so this is our our dose of hopium that you didn't know that you needed not that you indeed did need it but first before we talked to Tom

the frontier of smart contract Wallets on ethereum basic station we are here with Tom Duff Gordon the vice president of international policy at coinbase Tom welcome to the show great to be with you so the the big news here that I think a lot of people are focusing on is that coinbase has received a digital asset business license from the Bermuda monetary Authority which has led to people wonder is coinbase moving uh short are you guys abandoning the us because understanding the current regulatory environment in the United States I don't think anyone could really blame you but that's a question that everyone has is coinbase moving offshore uh it's a good question uh the simple answer is no uh we're proudly us we're going to say U.S company uh I think some of you saw the response to the Wells notice that we put out yesterday where um Brian uh and Paul talked about you know the reasons for setting up in the U.S we think the U.S has an awesome opportunity here to kind of lead because of the strength in Tech and in finance but clearly you know we've been struggling with a lack of regulatory Clarity um so we've been amping up uh our kind of Mission to kind of you know spread economic freedom globally we want to bring a billion people into the crypto economy we can't just do that in the US so International is a big part of what we're trying to do here um and part of that is is trying to light up the map um we go Broad and we and we go deep and we've announced a number of really exciting developments including the Bermuda license uh over the last few weeks so um we're gonna we're gonna continue to push for regulatory Clarity in the US as much as possible but equally we're going to be expanding overseas as well so I think I really want to know what that looks like and what and what that means and so is Bermuda like a big area of emphasis is like one question there's also another question of like UK also seems to be an area of emphasis but maybe you can just we can just zoom out and start at the high level just the broad scope scope of international what is can you just kind of explain the calculus of like what is coinbase's plans at a high level to expand internationally what does that look like what should people know how happy to happy to do that so we tend to look at International in two ways one is the go deep markets and the other are the go broad markets and we know we set that out on a Blog about a year ago we have more or less 10 International markets where we want to go deep um so if you look at the kind of in Europe UK is our biggest International Market and then we have five other kind of European markets you know the big ones that you would expect you know France Germany Italy Spain Netherlands and Ireland and then in APAC we're we're kind of going deep we're onshore in places like Australia and Singapore and in the Americas you know we've just announced some kind of exciting new developments in in Canada and in Brazil as well so these are kind of the markets that we're very focused on um we're equally going broad Bermuda is going to be part of that kind of go broad push where we cover other markets kind of you know from a single location um and we're also you know we have interesting conversations with Regulators in the Middle East I'm sure we'll get on to that in places like India Indonesia as well but you know stepping back 10 kind of major kind kind of go deep kind of markets internationally and then some other markets that we're going to cover more from a kind of go broad perspective and and that's how we kind of carve the world up at the moment I know Tom you said that uh coinbase is not a moving offshore outside of the bound to the us though it does have an international strategy let me ask you the question though um are there conditions under which that might change I think some of the quotes that we saw circulating from Brian Armstrong basically that it's not off the table right and it seems like very much now coinbase has decided to Double Down dig in and fight in the U.S basically suing the SEC um for more rule making responding to the Wells notice very publicly uh Brian keeps tweeting out uh pictures in Washington DC where a coinbase is presumably speaking to folks that are in Capitol Hill so it seems very much like the the current posture is to actually fight but if things got bad in the United States are there other avenues where where coinbase might consider actually moving offshore or at least relocating its headquarters somewhere other than the United States well for the time being we're staying and fighting um you know there when Brian set up coinbase 12 years ago there weren't you know there were a number of other kind of crypto companies setting up offshore immediately but we deliberately decided to establish kind of coinbase in the US we've been fighting for that regulatory Clarity I think as you know well over the last few years last year we petitioned the SEC for kind of clear rules um part of the you know the the recent kind of writ and court process we're going through with the SEC is to get them to respond to that petition not telling them how to respond to it just asking them to respond and to create those clear rules we want to see the development of a Securities kind of market for crypto in the US we think it's a huge opportunity so we're not gonna we're not kind of running away we want to continue to fight the good fight but equally we are seeing an extraordinary exciting amount of kind of you know regulatory development happening internationally where Clarity is forthcoming right and you know there are normally three steps in generating that kind of clarity first of all um geographies tend to kind of focus on money laundering terrorist financing it's kind of Step One travel rule type stuff step two is they then think about stable coins because they could become super systemic very quickly types of kind of Licensing and custody rules and then the third step is kind of technical rules and implementation we're seeing a huge number of GEOS move forward now into kind of stage two and potentially stage three Europe for example with Mika is is ultimately at stage three so we have to be engaged in those processes you know we want to spread um you know economic freedom we want to bring a billion people into the crypto economy and we've got to be part of those conversations Brian said in London uh nothing is is off the table um and I think what it means by that is we will you know we'll continue to stand fight in the U.S but equally our mission is is broader and we will be very present and we'll make sure that we're you know involved and engaged in all of those conversations in those other markets as that regulatory Clarity will bring more users into into the ecosystem so for bankless listeners do doing the math obviously coinbase needs to be broader other than the 300 150 or so million Americans who live in this country who wants to get a billion of course there are a lot more people that live outside of the U.S if that indeed is the mission um Tom since you you've got some of this exposure you mentioned a few markets already you also mentioned Mika I'm curious if you could kind of like rank order uh the different geographies in terms of how high quality and friendly their crypto regulation regime is and I know everyone is somewhat still early to this game of course because this is a brand new industry a brand new technology but I'm trying to get a flavor I mean like the Middle East for instance or areas in Asia or the UK or Europe for example uh and then the United States and Canada where does everyone stack up if you were to do sort of a you know a top 10 list yeah it's a it's a great question maybe I can start by answering that by saying the debate in the U.S which which I see a little bit from the inside and the outside around you know what is a security and what's a commodity should you know should this Market kind of belong under the SEC or under the cfdc this is not a debate that I see kind of pronounced in any shape or fashion happening outside of the US right yeah so this is sometimes what I think is kind of gets lost and is missing uh a little bit in the debate in the U.S like genuinely what happens outside is that we do a token mapping exercise and this is happening across multiple different kind of GEOS so not just kind of Europe but also Parts you know the major parts of the Middle East and aipac where the first thing the regulators and policy makers are doing is trying to figure out is crypto an existing Financial instrument and should we apply existing Financial instrument laws or is it something new or is it something in between and I think where the UK is coming out where Europe is coming out where Australia and others are coming out where Japan is ETC it's quite simply to say there are kind of Bitcoin ethereum um you know main all these kind of main unbat kind of tokens these are not existing financial instruments so therefore they're going to need a new set of tailored rules where some of the regulatory risks are the same and some of the underlying activities are a bit similar we're going to take existing Rule books for financial instruments slightly modify them and apply to the crypto economy will develop new rules for things like stable coins but where we've got tokenized Securities tokenized Commodities tokenized financial instruments clearly those are financial instruments right and you just apply the existing Financial Services law so so it's kind of interesting that you know the the kind of distinction between what's a security and a commodity is mainly only relevant in the US because you have separate Regulators with jurisdiction the the distinction that we care about outside of the US is are these things existing financial instruments or not and that's been a much easier question for everybody to get to grips with so I feel like answering your question you just have to kind of start by level setting to say that the the conversations and discussions are very different um you know internationally outside well let me just dig in that to make sure that that point lands completely so there's this this famous not famous but like a clip viral clip back and forth Patrick McHenry asking Gary Gensler is ether a security I repeat is ether a security or a commodity again and again and again he asked this question and Gary Gensler would not answer the question basically if I went to a governance body in Europe let's say and I asked um uh legislators that same question is either a security what would the answer be it would the answer be or or is it a commodity would the answer be uh that's not the right question that's not the question we should do things that's not how we do things like or would they very clearly be like oh this is a new Financial instrument clearly it resembles somewhat of a a commodity what would they the return answer be to a question like that yeah I I it's a great question they would they would basically say what we look at is slightly different we want to know is this an existing Financial instrument or is this something new and so in kind of European terms you would say is this a method instrument and mifid is the markets and financial instruments directive which is the existing kind of Corpus of financial regulation so is it an existing Financial instrument that fits in there or is it a Mika instrument right for which we've got new rules right for yeah arts and asset reference tokens and stable coins Etc the direction of travel if you ask this question Ryan in in Europe I think is very clear uh ether would not be an existing Financial instrument it would be in other Financial token to which the rules are under Mika apply not method now that has not been um 100 finalized we had the ink is not quite yet dry because there are some technical rules that have to be made after the vote in Parliament uh that we've just recently kind of seen but that is the direction of travel which is very clear and I think that's the same in the UK and when gonna see that the same across Asia as well so Tom the the the difference is whether it's miffit or Mika and that that's almost like traditional Finance versus digital Finance let's say and that would be the kind of the access of conversation and clearly something like ether is is Mika it's digital Finance it's not traditional finance and so rather than commodity versus security is old versus new yeah and and a new set of rules and kind of thinking like that seems um smart and like just healthy and like normal and build up from first principles I don't know why we're having such trouble in the United States with this uh Tom but but anyway I don't want to um delay this so thank you for digging in like so so give us the the stack ranking here who's on top who's got the best regulation who's got the kind of the worst uh good question uh so I want to go through all the countries um look I think uh Mika is Mika is good we support it um there's a lot of level two technical rules that have to come out but for centralized actors like ourselves the rules came out in a pretty good place um if we had a small criticism it would be around the treatment of stable coins uh which we think is is a little bit harsh on the Mika but more or less I think that's a very good framework I think Mika will also be influential on the global level because we haven't talked about this either but kind of whilst uh we're kind of waiting to see what happens in the U.S no one else is kind of standing still and he and the global stance Setters are also kind of moving and we're going to get you know principles from the FSB and iosco and and kind of others kind of later on this year um but you know Mika is Mika is good I think it's going to be influential for those global rules the UK have just started Consulting that framework seems to look a lot like Mika but it's kind of more flexible in certain areas so we're kind of quite pleased with the way that that is trending I would say that some markets that I would group as a little bit more cautious on the retail side and some of that has changed post FTX so places like Hong Kong which is Big which is opening up which is super interesting right because China obviously banned crypto but Hong Kong is now opening up and the recent consultation paper from the sfc was kind of really interesting for everyone to see but I will say when you dig into that a bit more um the pivot is fantastic but they are very cautious on the retail side so only a limited number of tokens can be traded by kind of retail users and a similar kind of hesitancy we see somewhat in in some other GEOS in APAC like Singapore for example where you know a huge amount of excitement overall in the space and the technology but again concerns around consumer access on the retail side and consumer detriment and we see that in a number of markets so I would say you know the themes post FDX where some jurisdictions are beginning to tighten up and reduce kind of flexibility he tend to be around conflicts of interest and consumer access right and these are things which kind of crystallized you know over the last few months but you know look I think we're positive more or less about what's happening in the Middle East uh what's happening in Europe in the UK um Australia kind of one step behind but their token mapping exercise was very thoughtful and and they're moving ahead nicely um Singapore and Hong Kong have good regimes looks like they're developing good regimes but perhaps more cautious on the retail side um and then you know Japan um you know we found that a market which was very exciting a big early mover but one in which they had quite a lot of localization requirements particularly on the custody side so that was a bit harder but it you know without wanting to give you a kind of a full stack ranking um I think we would see from a comprehensive kind of perspective Mika really being right up there um but kind of fast follows from a number of other GEOS and the G20 rules will probably pick up a lot of what Mika says and allow everybody to generate a bit of consensus because here's the thing guys the at the end of 2023 it could well be that a lot of international jurisdictions or the ones that kind of really matter are in stage two or stage three of this process and there are Global principles and it could just be the US it just finds itself increasingly kind of you know Standing Alone um in the room without you know being on this on this journey and that's something that concerns us and again we're not pleased about that and we're doing everything we can to try and push the us along but you know particularly from my perspective focusing on the international markets this is a pivotal key year there's a heck of a lot happening things are moving fast and we have to be part of those conversations even as we kind of struggle to to get off the ground in the US so the US has its own unique problems you know and its own Unique Systems I mean it's just not adopted the metric system uh yet in the you know the rest of the world is ahead and so you're saying that the US you'd place them at the bottom in terms of closer to the bottom lower court quartile anyway in terms of crypto friendliness I would I would just say that they are um they're just behind where everybody else is right on this on this process because we want to have um clear rules not regulation by enforcement and that's unfortunately what we've been seeing so I think they would certainly be you know behind the rest of the pack in the sense that we have not seen you know white papers we have not seen open consultation papers there hasn't been transparent rulemaking that the industry has been invited to engage in but we have seen that in the UK we have seen that in Europe we've seen that in Japan we've seen it in Brazil we've seen it in Singapore we've seen it in the Middle East we've seen it in Australia we've seen it in Canada the list goes on right um but we have not seen that uh on the U.S side so I think from that perspective um you know they are they are lagging we hope they can catch up it can be faster but you know uh think again about Europe 27 countries came together to agree hundreds of pages of very complicated text multiple different languages but they managed it and they started three years ago but in the next year and a half a lot of these regimes are gonna enter into kind of application and you know I hope that the US will be kind of part of that Journey seeing this like Global landscape kind of like play like a chessboard when different parts of this landscape are becoming more difficult to play on in other parts of this landscape are becoming easier to play on is it I think a useful mental model there's two parts of this conversation that I think are worth um separating and one is like how you're easy does parts of this chessboard make it easy to play on and then what are the values of those locations right so the United States makes it very very difficult to play on that part of the board but it's a very valuable part of the board because the United States Market is huge and Wealthy um and uh that you know it's always shifting right the global relationships to the crypto industry is always shifting and everything just like in the moments of at post 2022 it's just a big conversation of like how is this board Shifting the I think and that's like one side of the calculus I think once the big question that that I think users are primarily interested in and like what just the gut reflex is is like is there going to be a queen base International right and we've seen this model before there's binance US versus binance there's FTX fftx FTX us and then also FTX right is that kind of the mental model that we should be thinking is there going to be a coinbase us and coinbase international is that how we should think of this or how should like users and consumers of coinbase think about this so maybe we can come back to kind of the Bermuda announcements so we are going to have uh coinbase International Exchange um and and that's the new thing so that's so that's so that's a new thing really excited about that um so we have a full license kind of now there and you know we're just starting effectively um new product um so Perpetual futures um it's gonna start with just Bitcoin and ethereum kind of contracts with kind of wholesale institutional kind of clients moderate kind of Leverage to kind of kick off but you know that will then kind of like scale and proceed and we'll bring kind of you know our retail users uh into that and we'll make that available in in select markets across the world so kind of we're excited by that we've moved I think sensibly uh into that space we haven't rushed um we choose High bar regulatory jurisdictions um to your point we kind of almost seek out the parts of the chessboard where it's a little bit harder because we know that if we're able to do that that's a badge and people will then trust us and you know our brand is about being safe and trusted and easy to use and we don't necessarily want to rush into things and do them wrong we want to take our time and do them right so that's why we've taken a bit of time to launch this new product but we're very excited about it and I think that will you know that will kind of scale um you know over over time so we will have a US exchange we will then have a non-us International Exchange and then coinbase will have a localized experienced kind of banking rails in the go deep markets that I described kind of you know beforehand and we'll continue to announce kind of exciting developments as we as we kind of continue conversations in other parts of the world the Middle East and other places okay so there's U.S coinbase which we all know like that's the the known quantity the new thing is yeah coinbase International which is going to accept certain jurisdictions certain citizens from certain jurisdictions that get approved to access the International Exchange and then there's also kind of like one-off more call it proprietary I guess just like more Niche coverage of the rest of the world in one in more one-off particular Fashions and then you add all of those things together and that's coinbase right that's right that's right and you know and going back to the and going back to the kind of the chessboard analogy as as different GEOS move through that through those three phases of kind of figuring out you know the AML kyc travel rules first and then the license custody and stable coins and then the implementation and by the way there are other steps around kind of defy and other things but we kind of hope they come later the you know it gets harder and harder right to operate in those in those jurisdictions but in some ways you know that's a good thing uh because it means that there's you know there are more compliance requirements okay that's difficult but we're hoping that that is just going to bring more people into the crypto economy because there'll be more trust uh in the system and there'll be incentives for people to be onshore and in those High bar Regulatory jurisdictions and you know some of those situations the FTX um uh events and others that we saw were effectively we had exchanges in offshore more lightly regulated jurisdictions getting into trouble I mean hopefully that will be that'll be lessened as we kind of move forward but that puts a lot of onus and burden on centralized exchanges like ourselves so we need to be thoughtful and judicious about you know where we go deep and and you know making sure that we get that right learning about crypto is hard until now introducing no an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to

question but I'm going to ask it anyways the other offshore derivative exchanges that is now coinbase is like adding into themselves into the category of are binance and bitmex and FTX and maybe a few other ones that I can't remember but just like it's not necessarily a great list to be on uh and so like what's what's coinbase's Internationals like strategy around that like what what are the thoughts about that uh shorts look we we only see kind of high bar kind of jurisdictions and you know just to spend just one second on Bermuda Bermuda is is being hugely impressive right to us they have um one of the first kind of digital asset kind of legislative Frameworks the da but they call it the digital assets business act which came out in 2018. um the current Premiere who is extraordinary articulate and sophisticated uh who speaks the consensus and others Premiere but he was the Finance Minister that I think took that bill through Parliament so he understands this very well the BMA which is the Bermuda monetary Authority they also look after kind of a Global Financial Center for reinsurance um so they only wanted to attract you know high quality digital asset kind of exchanges and players they have an ecosystem of about 17 vasps I think at the moment so they have experience they have expertise um I think they are well connected to kind of you know other Regulators globally in international standard centers through the kind of the Ensure Insurance play so it's a very different place to some of those other more lightly regulated jurisdictions that that other exchanges have decided to kind of place themselves in so we feel we feel very good about Bermuda about you know the the robustness of which they put us through that licensing process um and we're exciting to be kind of you know kicking off our new kind of perps offering in in that jurisdiction so um the list that you cited is is a is an interesting one um we hope that that's not gonna be you know we hope that we're not going to add to you know to to that list um certainly Bermuda I think has been cautious about um you know finding the right kind of Partners and we are you know our reputation for being you know trusted and easy to use and compliant forward is incredibly important for us which is why we're going to take this step by step um and incrementally kind of build the product and make sure that um you know everybody comes along on this journey with us so um two versions of coinbase one coinbase international the other is kind of the the coinbase that maybe many retail investors in the US sort of use I just want to emphasize or get clarity there will be a different set of products in coinbase international those derivatives that you mentioned for Bitcoin and eth a little bit earlier to be clear they are not available for us uh consumers like you can't actually we don't have the regulatory framework like what's preventing you from getting those products onto coinbase in the US because I'm betting you would have had them already if you had the ability to do that so what is U.S retail missing out on so I think about 75 of of kind of daily trading volume is in the kind of the purpose Market rather than the spot Market um so it's a it's a product that is extremely sought after by kind of clients it's where a lot of the volume is but we want to make sure that we we do this in a regulatory compliant way and so you need to have very clear rules of the road and in the US right now that framework doesn't exist which is why you know those products will not be available to kind of U.S retail users which is why the the exchanges are is a offshore highly regulated exchange and we'll make that it will make those products available to select kind of GEOS but outside of the US so again we we are hoping very much that the US will kind of catch up we've petitioned them to kind of create the clear rules both for the spot Market but also on the on the derivative side as well and you know we're hopeful that we'll get there but we're not right now and so you know we have to kind of adapt um but equally we have to kind of follow market demand and clients want trusted counterparties in that in this kind of perps Market and so we're kind of stepping into that role it's a very helpful product for people to get exposure to to the asset class it helps them with their hedging strategies Etc so we want to be in that asset class but we have to do that in a compliant way and the best way of doing that part of what I'm I'm just disappointed with Tom is because why can't we have that in the US too how come because I'm an American I don't have access to those same products and what's actually happening is it's not at to your point you said it was 75 of the actual demand was for purpose products right um it's not like the US not allowing this uh you know makes the demand dry up Suddenly it just shifts the demand to other jurisdictions in other locations and what was actually happening with FTX they were receiving a lot of that demand a lot of people by the way we're Americans in an unsafe way so I'm just expressing the frustration that what it seems like American regulators and legislators don't understand is if they don't provide clear guidelines if they don't allow the demand to be expressed in a safe effective way in the United States they're not like they're like the ostrich with their head in the sand like they're Imagining the demand is suddenly going to evaporate it's not evaporating it's just going somewhere else guys and not in your economy it's not adding jobs to the American system and and and Retail Americans don't get access to these products when they actually want it so that's a frustrating place to be I imagine for coinbase it's also frustrating as someone who currently lives in the United States agree we make this point it's a great point we made this point to um you know a lot of different policy makers around the world which is if you don't create onshore regimes you're not going to stop people from accessing these products necessarily they're just going to do it they're just going to do it in a less protected way and you're going to force them offshore and you're going to force them to provide us right that are not doing things in the way that you want them to do um you know even even jurisdictions like India and other places where you know there was a lot of hesitancy around the kind of crypto Market I think they you know everybody's realized Now That We Can't Ban We Can't Ban crypto we can't put it away it's a kind of a global market it's a real asset class and the best thing to do is actually to create kind of guard rails and rules around which you can actually incentivize people to engage but you can kind of do so in a safe way otherwise to kind of you know put as the ostrich putting the head in the sand you you effectively you ignore the problem you don't get rid of the problem and effectively you kind of create more risk uh for your for your own consumers without without any rails and and that's something that's the point we've been making consistently across a number of years we've used the the metaphor and Bank list a number of times we live in a financial prison inside of the United States right like we can't access our air drops uh the IRS looks at our 600 venmo transactions we can't do fun cool Financial toys we can't have those fun toys uh which I know are for sometimes professionals but toys nonetheless so yeah we live in a financial prison and I'm one thing I'm actually bullish on at least to really just drive this point home to a lot of the the average Americans who only understand a little bit of this is that there's going to be coinbase United States and coinbase international and I will rename these just for the era of illustration of coinbase neutered and coinbase fun zone right one's going to be the constrained version of coinbase that has to con that lives in the side of the financial prison and only has certain products that can only be accessed by Americans and it's going to be like sterile not fun coinbase and then there's going to be coinbase International which has all of the products that are actually in demand as shown by the market and that is where coinbase is going to be able to serve the customers who want those products and so it it fits into this model that we've had of the United States of kind of being this Empire that's kind of rolling over and like it's closing down the capital controls it's raising up the walls and is preventing its citizens from being able to to Access Financial tools that are also Freedom tools and so like I don't really have a question here but like the idea is like I'm kind of interested in that discrepancy between coinbase International and coinbase United States being crystal clear to average coinbase users and hopefully that can start to hopefully like turn the tide of winning hearts and Minds to actually being able to open up some of these more um more vibrant products on the domestic United States landscape yeah um I I guess I would only say coinbase fund is still going to be coinbase safe um so I just want to make you know I just want to make you make that clear that you know yeah yeah it's not it's definitely not that it's going to be you know it'll be coinbase safe and constrained and coinbase safe and and less constrained uh in this in the sense of the kind of the products at the moment but we heard that that is not where um things are going to remain um and again I mean hopefully it was useful to provide that International perspective on the U.S domestic debate because you know I think if we can unlock that um and this you know security commodity concern if we can kind of get through that and if we can make a few steps forward on the stable coin um legislation and things then we're kind of positive right um and we're optimistic and and we're pushing and we continue to hope but you know in the meantime we were very focused on on International because you know there's a lot of growth there a lot of excitement and the regulatory Clarity is forthcoming um and you know as I said by the end of this year I think we'll have Global rules we'll have Mika done we'll have the UK on a clear path forward we'll have you know Australia out there we've got Japan we've got Singapore we've got the Middle East we've got Canada we've got Brazil um you know all of these GEOS are kind of moving forward um and we really hope that you know the US can get on that bandwagon just to if coinbase had its way it would just be one coinbase though right it wouldn't be coinbase us coinbase International and then the bespoke more Niche parts of the globe it would just be coinbase and I mean what we would need for that to for us to be able to get there is a lot of nation states working together to make the regulations and rules more um congruent with each other uh but that is that is what coinbase would want right just like one coinbase correct yeah yeah no I mean you know again we we want to uh we want a billion people in the economy we want to increase economic freedom um so we want kind of you know the world to start adopting this technology and we want to see a growing consensus around the rules that's why we're very invested in the status setting process of the G20 FSB iosco kind of level as well because that will create hopefully a framework with within which multiple countries hopefully including the US can come together and they can adopt rules that are more or less the same and that just kind of helps the whole Market operate more efficiently in traditional Finance derivative markets are Global and you know whilst there are specificities in each different jurisdiction um you know there are more or less kind of the same rules of the road and that is where I think we kind of need to get to I mean look no Global player wants to fragment liquidity none of us want to kind of duplicate our operations and infrastructure in every single different country there will be an element of kind of necessary local governance and things like this but ultimately what you want to do is you want to be providing you know the best products and the best execution to your clients and and that is done by having um you know a regulatory framework which is uh more or less consistent across all of the main kind of jurisdictions such that you can then operate seamlessly between them and offer good prices deep liquidity Etc and we can focus on on building great new products and things like that and focusing Less on on having to kind of spend you know so much time with with policymakers trying to get us from zero to one but one thing I'll note is that that idea of one coinbase of course um that can come to fruition hopefully easier and maybe easier in the non-custodial side of things so there is right now only one coinbase wallet for example right uh and hopefully we can maintain that moving forward because there is only kind of one ethereum and one Global Network State sort of starts to yeah one internet starts to dissolve some of the geographic boundaries and start with the Brinks Blank Slate that's why David and I are also perpetually bullish on on D5 of course and I know uh Tom that coinbase kind of splits the world of uh centralized um you know Fiat to crypto sorts of services and also getting into d52 so that's important I guess the last comment I would make and uh we can kind of close on this is here's a reason why I'm bullish and I want you to maybe test my logic is that um of course it was going to happen this way of course there were going to be Geographic jurisdictions that were going to push the envelope others that would fall behind and see those that are pushing the envelope and aim to catch up and it just seems like the us right now is falling behind but it exists in a game theoretic ecosystem of competitors and it looks across the ocean and it sees Mika and it sees Europe attracting more of the crypto economy and capital inflows and interest in growth from the space and I know one thing about the us at least this used to be true I hope it's true in in moving forward in the future the US doesn't like to be second or third or fourth or fifth place okay America wants to be number one and so it has work to do in order to catch up and so this is why I think partially you're going back to Hong Kong why maybe Hong Kong is starting to open up it's it's China sort of seeing the the pressures of well if we let this if we Outlaw this crypto thing it's just gonna go over to Europe and other places I want you maybe you could kind of reflect on that because to me that is the the the long-term game theory of this and it's it's a hopeful scenario that all of these jurisdictions are actually competing for crypto long run a crypto is ultimately it's a global phenomenon it's Unstoppable it's you know not going to be squeezed out of one jurisdiction uh completely and and be ended it's it's going to leak into other jurisdictions and there's this competitive pressure that will um ensure that all jurisdictions eventually pass the type of of crypto regulation that we want uh is that too hopeful or do you think that uh we're on to something here well I'm an optimist too Ryan so uh so I'm gonna subscribe so that I'm going to subscribe to that um look there's a there's a fear of missing out right which which we kind of see everywhere but equally risk and reward kind of has to be kind of balanced but you know we should see uh GEOS whether it's Europe whether it's going to be parts of aipac the Middle East but we'll see kind of jurisdictions move ahead with their own crypto kind of Frameworks and the ones that work and they balance risk and reward so the ones that help to kind of actually Foster Innovation but at the same time they make sure that we're protecting Market integrity and financial stability and investor protection but balance that kind of crucial thing about allowing you know Innovation but not stifling it but making sure that we don't see too many crashes Etc um that is going to prove the concept right and it will happen like the you know the asset class is not going away the technology is extremely exciting um we were just talking um amongst a number of us here at coinbase in the kind of leadership team around base we're seeing a huge number of developers coming into the space we're seeing You know despite what potentially is happening with the kind of prices we're just seeing masses of kind of activity um we're seeing a lot of work from policy makers some different approaches being kind of tested here but one of them kind of will work and will emerge as kind of the right uh kind of way forward and I think other countries will gravitate to that because they will see jobs they'll see Innovation they'll see kind of growth they'll see productivity move to those areas right where that kind of the regulatory framework exists it provides Clarity it provides security but it's attracting investment and and all of those good things so um I'm hopeful that we will kind of get there not everybody's moving at the same speed but some of the global processes that are taking place this year that will culminate in September I think will be a kind of a good signal post to to kind of you know where where we're going and that consensus will start to emerge so 2023 I'm optimistic this is going to be an inflection point for what more or less the kind of version 1.0 Global guard rails should like for kind of crypto policy where Innovation can excitingly take place but with the the downside risks kind of sensibly kind of mitigated to the extent that they can be um and once that concept has been proven um then let's hope that the the markets that are moving slower the US and others can get on board catch up and we can kind of continue to to innovate and uh and take it from there Tom with the coinbase international was there like a timeline on that on the International Exchange um yeah we are um uh so we've we've launched um and that is you know so that's up and running and you know we will then we'll be kind of building and scaling that uh with different clients and different products um you know through the through this year kind of moving forward but no precise kind of timelines or anything to flag for you guys just at this moment so but a lot a lot happening and more announcements to follow so watch this space Tom thank you so much for joining us this has uh been very helpful and uh we're looking forward to a big things from coinbase International glad you're not abandoning the US just yet though and are keeping uh fighting the fight because we definitely need the help uh we appreciate what you're doing pleasure risk and disclaimers of course guys gotta let you know none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky so it's D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot foreign
