gary gensler new sheriff in town the revenge of the sec so much to talk about with gary gensler maybe we should start here um they gary gensler did an interview with the washington post called the wayforward cryptocurrency i don't know if you got a chance to watch this this interview but i know you saw this clip any high-level takes on this uh before we get into the detail yeah it feels very much like uh nanny gary gensler like coming into our industry and taking care of us and making sure we're super duper protected and we have all the regulations it's weird but it's weird that he was really asking for like more transparency out of the financial products that he sees in crypto i'm like dude like how much more transparency do you want literally it's a public ledger you can't get any more transparent like what what are you actually asking for and so it seems to be like he's just using all of these very basic words to convince people that don't know about crypto that the sec needs to regulate crypto there's definitely been an anti-gary gensler anti-s8 sec vibe that's that's going on in kryptos because the sec feels like you know it's increasingly uh combative with the industry right like canceling coinbase uh lend accounts and um removing its ability to to come to market um and this is kind of another step but what i think is interesting is gary chose not to at least for this specific interview i'm glad he's engaging but he chose to do it in the washington post which is like hardcore institutional media right a lot of other crypto media organizations that would love to talk to him bankless included so if uh gary or anyone from scc is is listening we would love to have gary on the podcast to talk more about these crypto specific issues but this was very much for the washington post audience uh and like kind of the the institutions even the interviewer i i felt like i don't know david did you watch the did you get a chance to watch the full interview no no i haven't no but um so i i watched the video and i had like a few notes a few takes on this you want to hear him absolutely hit me alright so like the first is i think everyone who's listening to this has to realize that gary gensler knows his like he knows his from a technical perspective so at mit he was a professor at mit and he taught about crypto and blockchain courses and i saw a number of those courses he knows what he's talking about he knows his way around the technology he knows enough to be dangerous in this space and his feedback in this interview was i find the technology very interesting he says this i do think this technology is interesting it's pushing central banks he said it's pushing fintech that's why he chose to teach it at mit so he thinks that technology is like maybe academically interesting and he thinks that it's a catalyst for change which he seemed to appreciate so i guess maybe that's the good side um one other thing that i think came through in this conversation is he's definitely not interested in sitting back so he wants to be ultra proactive it kind of is like hey jay clinton was the old sheriff you know he did some stuff not a lot but there's a new sheriff in town crypto and i plan to get ahead of some of these issues he mentioned that a number of times he said this quote i don't think technologies last long except outside the public policy okay and i feel like he has badged himself and made it part of his mission to bring crypto into public policy to like merge those things together even if um like the policy isn't ready for crypto or maybe the policy was written in the 1930s and does not pertain or needs to be rewritten i don't think he quite sees it like that he he wants to see uh emerging so he intends to be really proactive okay those are those are all interesting takes i'm worried that gary gemsler doesn't actually want to talk to crypto people i think he wants to stay inside of his own comfort zone when it comes to media um he i remember hearing about how he used the term stable value coins when he was referring to um when he was referring to stable coins and people were uh speculating that that was alluding to stable value funds which are an sec uh regulated product and so i think he's being very strategic with what he says and where he says it and i my suspicion is that if he were to come on a show like bankless or any other crypto show it would him he he wouldn't not be in like friendly territory right he wouldn't have the freedom to craft these narratives because we would totally call him out on some stuff we would want we would drill down into specifics we would ask the questions that we would want to ask and we would have and we would he would not um have the like the home field advantage so i'm con i'm worried that like gary only broadcasts to the crypto industry but doesn't actually come and join us what's interesting is like and definitely actually speak louder than words but his words are actually the opposite of that david so in the in the conversation he was having with with the interview of the washington post um he said this our door is open but people aren't coming in it's kind of like hey industry crypto industry you guys are a bunch of like cowboys like i understand what you're doing is like technologically disruptive but if you want to do something come and ask doors open just like come ask our permission we'll have a good faith talk about it and then you'll be off on your way and um you know it'll all be fine so he very much maintains a posture of the doors open but it's again it's like you're saying actions speak louder than words and if he was serious about opening the door he would do what hester pierce did i think what some cftc commissioners in the past have done is just like show up at crypto conferences right engage the community um talk to us i mean we're not criminals we're not hucksters we're not like trying to defraud people we're trying to grow a better more transparent open financial system for the world i think there are some some shared goals one of the goals he went back to in that conversation david was like the interview asked why does the sec exist and it's like to protect investors but he said it i i'd love to dive into what he thinks that means right because like crypto has a shared goal of like wanting to create better conditions for investors as well but the sec's uh like way forward means protecting investors from like four percent yield on a coin based lend account right like is that really protecting investors um but one of the things i was the reason i watched the full interview too is i was trying to figure out like new cop on the beat he said that they have robust authorities over crypto and they're going to use them these are some of his words it's like i was trying to figure out where's the sec going to target next and it felt to me if you read between the lines and you sort of inferred some of this to you is if you raise money if you're an ico like lookout okay number one so if you raised money from unaccredited investors in the us i think you have a target on your back uh number two stable coins i feel like have a target on their back as well i'm not sure how that's going to play out i think that's going to be a combination of sec plus treasury trying to take some sort of action maybe it'll require a congressional like new legislation through that process but i think that's got sort of a a target on its back particularly centralized stable coins right so the the usdc's of the world and the third area is lending and staking which he didn't get into a lot but like those three areas i feel like have targets on their back and particularly he kept using the term platforms which i think means more centralized exchanges centralized entities so the coinbase is in gemini's and block fives of the world uh less so decentralized finance he actually said something positive about decentralized finance being a catalyst for change um but if i was in the con those three areas i would be like relatively worried i guess yeah no i i do think that the sec is kind of like prepping for um bigger and bigger moves when it comes to the crypto world yeah uh absolutely i mean he's clearly sort of an institutionalist um i i don't think this is the end of the world right i think there'll be some enforcement actions but like at the end of the day it'll be fine i do feel like david the crypto is kind of like ddos attacking um the regulators right right so like how do you bring uh thousands of tokens like to court and like do you even have the staff to to go do that right maybe this goes to a conversation we'll talk about a little bit later but um this was also interesting at the same time this conversation about crypto was published in the washington post gary gensler tweeted this right after which was a an appeal to freshmen in college or any college student to start saving early and start saving regularly right so if you stock away five dollars a week you know eight percent yield i guess that's investing in the stock market you know uh by the time you're 65 you'll have a hundred thousand dollars right um i think this fell to many in crypto like the wrong time for this sort of um you know this sort of appeal to you to millennials and and gen z what's your take on this yeah it uh i generally have more nefarious thoughts about this um because like he's he's saying like hey just say five dollars a week all you got to do is save five dollars a week the united states printed 26 of all outstanding dollars last year and so like if we want to uh view like the value that and that changes the value of what you save and when he's saying like you know save five dollars a week what he's saying is hey put five dollars a week into your bank account so the banks can go get the yield right and that this is what banks do they take your money and then they get even more yield on it and they don't give you back all of the yield that they get they keep it for themselves and and so like gary genser who like like you said is an institutionalist to me he's just advocating he's like indoctrinating all these young folks in the world to like be a part of the banking system which has cut out so many returns from so many of its customers for the last like for decades uh and so it's it's very much the opposite of uh the values that i stand for and it's it's the same advice that we've heard for the last like 30 years and i i think there's a lot of institutions out there that are taking advantage of that the fact that like this is the quote-unquote like formal advice you're like oh yeah save five dollars a week that's not working for people it hasn't been working for people it just feels like an elite baby boomer take on this right it's like millennials if only stop spending money on coffee and he actually mentioned coffee coffee and avocado toast right and just save your money and and put it in the bank account right then you too could be rich one day right it's like nothing against long-term thinking and and saving but like i the reason i don't think he it's actually effective indoctrination david is because college students aren't dumb right they're looking at a point zero one percent interest rate in their savings account and they're going like wow right like like why and and they're looking at the stock market right and you know eight percent average maybe over the long run but they evaluate stocks versus crypto and what do you think they're buying so uh you know i i think gary gensler is about to have a bunch of college students who are like asking questions about crypto during his office hours rather than rather than people asking you know how they can save their money and put in a bank account it just feels like patronizing you know it's like crypto is the largest opportunity for our for our generation for millennials for for gen z and to not acknowledge that it even exists or that's viable and to like crack down on it without giving viable alternatives i think is uh is terrible it's short-sighted it's frustrating it's annoying and no wonder they're getting some pushback on this stuff yeah and this is why literally every other generation gets frustrated by the boomers right because the boomers just say think that because it worked for my generation it'll work for your generation too forgetting that like the boomers haven't let go of all of the institutions that made them made their generation one of the wealthiest generations of all time and so i like i said it's very very nefarious where he's cracking down on coinbase uh lens products while he's saying oh yeah save five but meanwhile don't look at this crypto thing save five dollars a week like like you said he talked about like hey instead of going out for coffee you can make coffee at home all right so you're just gonna suck the joy out of life like hey like coffee at the coffee shop tastes better and he's saying like no suffer suffer and and save so you can put the money in the banks i mean we haven't even addressed like student debt and the rising cost of going to university which is like a whole nother can of worms but let's keep going because we're not done with the sec story another thing that happened while you were there was an attendee actually a speaker at the missouri maine at the maynite conference right the mainnet conference was actually um served papers right subpoenaed by the sec um there's some conversation like we don't know who exactly this person who this person was some say it's the one of the founders of uh the tara chain dokuan i believe others like there's some conflicting reports about that it almost doesn't matter it's like wow the sec actually when they show up at a crypto conference they show up to serve someone papers right that's an interesting message do you think there was some signal about this oh absolutely i mean even if they didn't intend for that signal to be signaled they should have they should still understand what they're doing right like maybe they didn't intend to intimidate everyone but that was the net outcome of what they did right and so regardless it's an intentional choice was that the vibe at missouri or people like oh like people are still coming to terms with it there wasn't too much conversation about it but i do know that ryan selkis was like fired up well let's talk let's look at his tweet but before we do um jake jake says this two reasons the scc might do this this is jake travinski the target lives outside of the us and is hard to serve at home but sec knew they'd be in new york city and took advantage of the chance for personal service number two the sec wanted everyone to see this happen live to send a message or intimidate the industry that second one is uh is particularly concerning this is what ryan selkis said why don't you read it out david yeah ryan says if you're wondering when i actually decided to run for senate it's when these efforts came to my event didn't buy a ticket and served one of the speakers a subpoena enough talk more war on our out-of-control regulatory state um ryan was definitely like feeling himself at this conference first off it was a fantastic conference a huge success and it's the conference that ryan selkis who's the person like leading the charge into trying to uh you know reform governance so go reform our policies transfer currency too right yeah totally uh and so like it's kind of it's kind of ironic that like the the guy that cares the most about this issue was throwing a conference and the sec showed up to serve one of his speakers there he follows up this tweet saying celcus 2024 time to activate the crypto political machine do you think he's actually going to run for senate i hope so i mean we need more crypto native people in the halls of our government this is kind of the bottom line this is the only way this is going to change either we convert them and convince them and you know show them the values of crypto or someone crypto native actually enters their turf uh so i hope he does something like this um definitely a lot of messages happening from the sec i guess this last one this this was kind of a quiet dropping from coinbase but um apparently coinbase dropped formally dropped their planned lend program this is a program to lend out crypto assets like bitcoin and eath um stuff like this happens at celsius and blockfi and uh gemini but they they plan to drop it after the sec warning so some terms of service i guess were updated to say that so the sec basically scared coinbase into not offering a four percent yield account to retail investors which rather than not have your coffee would be a good way for college to save money on a fintech app on their phone where they're comfortable with no no less i'm kind of bummed that coinbase didn't take this opportunity to take the fight to the sec um but who knows they could be playing some different type of game uh who knows how they're playing it it seemed very clear at least from their social indications that that coinbase does intend to fight in some way so we'll see how that shapes up
