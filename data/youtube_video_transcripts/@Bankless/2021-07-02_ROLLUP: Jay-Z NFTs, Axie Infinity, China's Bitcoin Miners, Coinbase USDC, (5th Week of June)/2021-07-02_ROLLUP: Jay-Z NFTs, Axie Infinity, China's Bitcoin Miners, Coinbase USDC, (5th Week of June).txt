[Music] hey bankless nation it is the fifth and final week of june we have begun july and it is time for rollups weekly roll-ups david you ready for this absolutely i drink my coffee i've got the energy i'm ready to roll up the weekend crypto with you ryan dude it's almost like the the fourth of july are you celebrating this weekend uh yeah tomorrow i'm going on a boat and then uh on friday i'm watching fireworks as one does excuse me on sunday yeah as am i and i i was kind of curious as like what stage do you think we'll be in where uh blockchains have their own holidays do you think that'll happen like there will be a day like maybe in the future was it december 1st eth2 staking first went live will the ethereum community celebrate that as a as a holiday right well i can tell you the united states of america would will not be celebrating that because that's the nation's state holiday not a blockchain holiday so really it would only kind of be for like the ethereum native to like have kind of their own day but then holidays right it's like it's like hey i'm it's it's the uh 10th anniversary of eip1559 like not coming into work like no like that's not gonna happen all right well maybe we'll celebrate on bank list anyway sorry for the digress guys this is the quickest way to get crypto downloaded into your brain every week we cover market releases news takes and then what we're excited about this comes out every friday with your morning coffee live not live but it comes on youtube and also on the podcast i want to get it feels pretty live um david we should talk about kyber first because we've been promising this for a while but they just rolled out a really cool liquidity program what's going on with kyber yeah kyber is doing a liquidity mining program both on the l1 but also on the polygon l2 this is part of the d5 summer thesis layer 2 edition uh is that there's going to be a bunch of liquidity mining rewards existing on the layer two so if you're looking on the screen you can see all of the different ways that you can get some extra yield on your yield yo dog i heard you liked yield uh so if you are supplying stable coins get yield on your year if you're supplying stable coins take a look at uh kyber's new raid maker liquidity mining program there's a link in the show notes below where you can find out how to get some extra knc and some extra matic tokens if you are bullish on those particular two assets guys 25 million in rewards over the next three months not a small amount so check that out make sure you check that out all right david you ready to get to markets let's do it ryan let's talk bitcoin first what's going on with bitcoin price since last week bitcoin started the week at thirty four thousand dollars dropped all the way down to thirty thousand dollars which jumped up to thirty six and a half thousand dollars and is currently at the level of thirty three point three thousand dollars that's what happened with bitcoin last week is this crab season it's just a little back and forth sideways it feels like crap season yeah we go up a little bit people get bullish we go down a little bit people get bearish at the end of the week we're at the same level we started with crab season crap crab season crap summer okay what about you same story dude these charts look similar yeah no actually that's cause it's the same chart nevermind yeah i have bitcoin price twice the story is going to be pretty much the same ether started the week at two thousand dollars fell down to the low low price of seventeen hundred spooked some people uh and then it jumped to 2300 got people excited again now it's at 2 100 and then once again started how or ended the week how we started it roughly at the same price crab season yo let's see if we're seeing any story in the ether bitcoin ratio what's this ratio showing uh are we up or down in the week uh we are up on the week we tapped the a a new local low of 0.055 but ether seems to really be allergic to anything below that and so we jumped from point zero five five to point zero almost point zero six six uh so almost up ten percent versus bitcoin on the week uh i tweeted out uh there was there was a day where ether really uh jumped up first bitcoin i think it was like two days ago and i tweeted out uh btc up eight percent uh if resume flipping talk and clearly that tweet product market fit because it got over like 8 700 likes in like a day and a half have you seen some flipping talk yet though i haven't seen as much as i told people to resume it so i guess we'll see okay so now after the roll up guys you can resume flipping talk you know what i want to take some credit for this tweet david because i said this in december 2020 uh this may be hard for some of you to hear but eth will outperform bitcoin again in 2021 quote me i said i threw that out there david and you know what at the time it was really uh bitcoin maximalism season very much like bitcoin was just like wrecking everything else uh and uh here we are six month in bitcoin is up 16 year-to-date eth is up 188 percent uh this is right after about this prediction this was right after defy season right after everyone was bearish on ether because all the defy tokens mooned and ether just lagged behind and then you tweeted this and then it was like oh yeah ether took the reigns for the next like six months uh but ryan question to you do you think yes is it going to happen again what about them for the next six months like you mean the next six months outperform i want to say yes but i'm not pulling putting my full weight into that prediction david where i'm putting my full weight is i think by end of the year if you look year-to-date eth will still have outperformed bitcoin i feel really comfortable with that prediction i'm not sure what the next six months will bring i still feel like it's probably true although look at this man ethan's already up 188 whereas bitcoin is up 16 it's like it just has to kind of hold that uh and uh the prediction comes true so i'm being sort of conservative i i think it'll happen but i'm not too sure we'll see what that ratio does granted bitcoiner said very similar things about bitcoin versus ether throughout 2019 and 2020 because bitcoin really outperformed ether and really it was just kind of signals like well maybe i should rotate then because if you sold uh bitcoin for ether while bitcoiners were talking about how bitcoin has outperformed that was the right move or just don't worry about it and hold hold hold both you know that's a that's a secret okay let's talk about d5 pulse what's going on with total locked value in d5 we're at 52 billion down from the highs still haven't hit that like that 100 billion mark seems kind of far away at this point but what's happening here just grabbing we're just crabbing uh stay keeping the head above 50 billion dollars locked in at d5 ave staying around 15 dominance not really too much churn going on right now i would say all right how about dpi these this is our index of d5 tokens uh looks like that's kind of also flat on the week ish shocker crab season how many times are we going to say in the market section not not another time let's talk about the dpi index two ethers so this uh this is a different seasonal benchmark oh man we're below 13 david we are below below 0.13 yet i am still feeling good about the dpi bottom it's still approximate to 0.13 i didn't get the specific number but i'm feeling good and the ballpark it being the bottom uh and i remember when we had ledger on the state of the nation fantastic episode you should go watch it he talked about how like the the 0.13 level could be like a good entrance and it might like dip below it and then and then kind of zoom back up for hopefully a dpi bull market maybe but like i'm still feeling good about the bottom like maybe the 0.13 wasn't the perfect call but like if if this is actually the bottom the 0.13 call will be great entrance if of course it doesn't go any lower but i guess i'm just kind of like biting my own tail here guys we know that's important to david so buy some d5 tokens and support david's cause he doesn't want to miss that one please i'm buying dps that's what embarrassing stuff what's this this is l2 beat i know you guys looked at this last week but um this this feels like the d5 pulse of layer 2. it's it's like total locked value in ethereum's layer 2 platforms what is this showing us right so just like d5 pulse it shows you all the value that is it deposited into all these various layer 2s there is 322 million dollars in l2s last week it was 340 something million dollars uh so down on the week but this is something that we are going to track moving forward uh this is very reminiscent to very early d5 pulse pages where you know when we were initially looking at the value locked in d5 we were looking at the tens and maybe even the hundreds of millions of dollars whereas now we're looking at the billions of dollars and so i'm pretty sure this story is going to be one to follow which is why we're going to come back to l2 beat frequently just to track the growth of layer 2 on ethereum it's kind of cool that it's pure layer twos it it doesn't include um polygon right for example if it did it would just like drown out literally everything oh my god polygon's got many billions now it's billions and billions yeah which is why which is why we know that there's this is coming right like optimism and arbitrary i'm gonna open up in july that's really where this game is gonna start going all right guys we are going to be back with the hot releases for the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancers mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer.fi the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in heath i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave dot com all right guys we are back with releases david we gotta start here compound is doing some cool things they launched the compound treasury which it seems like provides institutions the ability to earn four percent apr that's like 30x what you receive in a traditional savings account so not insignificant i think the difference is they're offering this to like a different audience it's not the defy natives and crypto natives it's institutions any thoughts on this yeah these feel like the base hair follicles of the d5 bullet this is where the d5 grows out of here's a there's a super weird metaphor for you but yeah beautiful yeah this feels like a compound just advertising hey just use us for your yield figure out how to attract capital that's your guys's problem but come to us for yield and we'll we'll solve that yield problem for you uh so compound opening up surface area for the d5 mullet more here mullet david sure check this out man yeah current uh already current is uh look at this now i do yeah they they say they're not a bank but they kind of are a bank right they've got like bank connectivity but look at this improvement upon a bank sure yeah but look at this we're excited to work with compound treasury to be able to offer our members access the protocol's interest rate through simple unified experience d5 mullet fintech on the front compound on the back it's really cool to see a single solid hair growing out of current out of compounds hair follicles all right how long should i take this metaphor for keep going all episode i'm really digging this i'm really digging this okay ten thousand word article coming in um the dissection of the mullet all right polygon launches avail a veil what is a veil david yeah a veil is a data availability layer on polygon so for those that are familiar with uh the con the project of lazy ledger uh this is a similar uh data availability structure for the polygon layer two uh so if you're into the world of cryptography and blockchain and consensus you kind of know what i'm talking about if you're not then you're probably really confused which is actually kind of closer to where i am but basically there's this data ability problem and there's a number of different ways to solve it and avail is trying to solve it for the polygon ecosystem rollups have this limitation too right storing data on chain is one of their limitations so this is really an effort to like further scale l2s and roll-ups by offering a data availability layer on top of ethereum i haven't dug into the details i'm sure this means even more to some of our listeners but this is another scalability tech uh being based on ethereum that's going to really propel the roll-up road map uh which is super cool super exciting and this is one of the bold cases for polygon is that any chain that nick can and needs to be built will be built uh and so that's kind of why matic token is so highly valued at least in my opinion it's kind of cool too it's it i think it's bullish for for polygon too it's like they're not stopping with ju chain right and i know they've said they're they're coming out with rollout roll ups and um zk roll up like tech and that sort of thing but um also a whole data availability solution i was not expecting that it's kind of cool all right um cream finance announcing integration with polygon 2 so what is cream they're deploying on polygon another protocol part of the theme here but like um what are they cream is a money market just like compound in ave i put them on there's a different risk spectrum that every single money market really likes to take on compound is kind of known as the conservative risk off money market that's why they have such few assets on there and that's why they can do the d5 mullet that's why they can do the d5 mullet yep and protocol sync thesis uh ave is kind of more in the more in the liberal camp of of risk but still not still pretty good right in the middle ground cream is like yeah let's let's open up and open up the floodgates of all the assets let's list all the assets uh a little bit more risky but you know to some degree you can only get liquidity on many different assets using cream and now cream is on polygon there you go very cool all right let's talk about perpetual protocol so they have launched a um cross margin trading limit order multi-collateral protocol this is basically um on arbitrum that they're launching as well it's called curie what's special about this uh about this data there's just a number of different use cases for financial activity that really can only work on layer two and perpetual swaps um is definitely one of them just high frequency trading or just people that want to be really active with their trades um and anyone who's day trading really it works a lot better on layer two so perpetual protocol i'm actually doing a meet the nation with them i'm recording with them at two day so that will probably be out sometime early next week if you guys want a deeper dive into perpetual protocol but overall it's just a suite of trading activities uh and now it can be done on layer two speaking of meet the nations actually i think state of the nation we had element protocol on not too long ago their founder was on will and uh now it looks like they have finally deployed to mainnet which is super exciting what is element protocol david what's the tl dr yeah element finance takes one asset and splits it into two and so you have the principal asset and the yield asset and it allows people to kind of break apart the different properties of a single asset and allows people to express their opinions about what they want in more granular ways do you want really the yield side of an asset or do you want the principal side of an asset and allows you to express your financial opinions about the future in in different ways go check out the state of the nation for for more details one of the really exciting things about element is the the team uh a bunch of ethereum ogs both on the team itself as well as the advisors um uh just core ethereum consensus like with ethereum one builders along with uh just ethereum l2 advisors as well eric connor is on the advisor danny ryan is an advisor um so just an all-star team with an all-star product very cool all right um we also have more yield happening this time on coinbase so this is super interesting to me coinbase is now going to start offering four percent apy on usdc coin inside of coinbase so previously i think they have sort of a savings light type product but if you have usdc on coinbase it offers like something like point one five percent like i thought it was i think it was like one point five percent when the last item was at one time but then it dropped all the way back down um so it's not real it's it's more like a bank savings rate a little bit higher but not much this is something different this is where coinbase is actually lending out your usdc similar to how a block fi might lend it out and it's providing that that higher apy that four percent rate so kind of interesting it's unclear where they're getting the interest it's kind of like like block five it's sort of like a black box david um it's a little bit coincidental that you get four percent on coinbase and compound gives you four percent with their feature i was going to say this same week kind of interesting i mean they could get four percent from compound right that would be protocol sync thesis uh absolutely um but uh anyway interesting that they are offering this certainly competing with with uh the block fives of the world maybe doing some protocol sync getting into compound we're not sure but we're actually going to have robert leshner on state of the nation on monday so uh he's been very involved he's a founder of the compound protocol to talk about compound treasury involved he's very he without robert it wouldn't have happened very involved very active contributor yeah i may have downplayed that a little bit he does some work for compound uh kind of a big deal there uh anyway he's gonna tell us hopefully maybe about maybe i'll have comments on this coinbase four percent apy um because i know coinbase and compound have been close in the past too so there you go sort of interesting what's going on here david we gotta we gotta end releases with this we have a couple of raises to talk about but uh a new crypto comedy show has been released yeah dude i watched it it was fantastic yeah i love not having to like do the work to produce it by the way but like i could just enjoy it so what it what is this what'd you guys put out there yeah this is top signal the newest show out of the bankless ecosystem with bankless's newest anchor newest co-host uh michael wong one of my actually the person that hired me for my first crypto job ever and so we go way back it was a an ico advisory company back in 2018 and that actually kind of led into our first like gag that we did where we presented the three guests it was defy dad kevin owaki and anthony cesano we presented them with two icos one of them was real one of them was fake and they had to pick the real or the fake one uh all three of them got it right so it sounds like we need to become get more creative on our icos but we also did a a crypto and on crypto twitter fantasy draft and so each person had to draft their favorite uh and on crypto twitter uh personalities and so we got to like kind of you know jostle for who wants to pick what uh crypto and on and and the pitch our team and how our team's better than the rest and we did some around the horn just quick takes on different topics it was it was super fun uh the the through line or the the kind of the tagline for for uh top signal is that it is in a superposition of a complete psyops or the best alpha you've ever seen or just a normal factual statement it could be any of those three we don't know because we don't do it we don't do any fact checking on top signal yeah it's just kind of fun and i don't know what you guys have in store for the future but maybe some rap battles that's a rumor hayden adams and carl florsch we guys we want you guys as a rap battle duo on on top signal where it's gonna happen at some point in time that would be amazing it's just a fun show i can't wait for the next one it sounds like there's no real like schedule like um when's the next one going to be david as soon as we can as we as soon as we corral the guests and get them on to the show it's going to be different every single time uh we have alexandra botez the chess streamer and she's going to come on with her co-host because she's actually also producing uh ethereum content as well and we're i'm going to try and find the four best chess we're going to try to beat them in chess yeah we're going to try and 4v2 them and see how far we can get but overall it's just gonna be a fun time that's awesome all right guys let's uh switch to some of the raises really quick um so one is uh nansen so nansen is kind of like a blockchain data analytics provider yeah and they they provide a lot of ethereum data so they just received a funding from a16z 12 million dollars not an insignificant amount any other takes on this yeah no i think this is really important infrastructure for just people who want to view the chain for data and the ethereum blockchain has an insane amount of data and so you need systems to parse and consume and like digest that data that's what nansen does um and so this is gonna just be really important infrastructure moving forward also with layer twos man all this data needs to be digested and consumed so super important there um also the tracer dao closed 4.5 million dollars in a raise some pretty um pretty solid vcs were behind this so one framework ventures and we've had in the podcast but also some um uh also also some angels like mariano conte were part of this and uh what is this protocol it seems like it's it's perpetuals again so it's another story and they're deploying on arbitrum as well so it's another layer two first deployment not main chain which is kind of interesting we're seeing that trend any anything else to add about tracer dow david yeah the dow tag line makes me think that it doesn't at all stop with perpetuals i think it's going to be kind of something similar to a dx dao where they're just making a suite of financial services that's owned and operated by the dao and those suite of financial services makes the dow money uh and there's really positive statements by and basically everyone involved um uh mariano conti is somebody i definitely trust for signal so when he says that he's excited about something i pay attention so tracer dow i'm gonna be looking at you guys mario anaconte the the maker mafia maybe that's the thing now um all right david let's talk news man first is some ethereum stuff this deserves our attention a defy education fund was proposed in uniswap governance of course we've talked about before uniswap has an absolutely massive treasury it's mostly in uni tokens you hear it every single time on in the bankless ad millions exactly that's right uh so but now this is a governance proposal to actually create a defy education fund in quotes this is a non-profit so a 501c4 nonprofit based in the u.s and it's it's trying to fund all the following maker education oh interesting lobby type stuff thought leadership and research legal fire power messaging grassroots advocate advocacy and best practices it has people like jake cervinski on has people um in the uh in the d5 space as well a lot of dow experts here as well a lot of dow experts a lot of legal minds and defile um and this is i feel like david this is d5 starting to flex this muscle and saying hey we want a voice in legislation in and we want to expand into hearts and minds and we have the money and funds to do that so we're going to go deploy them what are your thoughts here yeah they are asking for 1 million uni tokens which is a lot that is uh 15 18 million dollars uh depending on the state of the market let me go check the price of uni right now 17.7 dollars per unit token so 17.7 million dollars at the time of recording is what they are requesting which is a large amount of money but also like what the hell is the is the uh the treasury for if you're not gonna open up the purse strings right and so these are absolutely the right people to ask for this amount of money uh and so i'm kind of pretty excited to see what they can get done with this there is uh definitely some opportunities available for people to go and capture this so kind of think i'm pretty sure think of this as like its own like micro uni grants right they are they are taking unit swap money and then they are going to also give out grants with it so it's a grant giving grant uh and they have definitely goals and objectives that they want to reach and there's a decent amount of things that the listener of this show could go and and produce if uh for for money uh and so they are looking for exa my eyes go to the thought leadership and research uh post where they say we need more written and video content explaining defy and its benefits in a medium that positively impacts the public perception of defy yo like ryan you and i can do that and so uh we might be going after this bankless dow i challenge you guys to go after this bankless listeners i also challenge you guys to go after this money this money is for you so long as you can produce what these guys want you to produce yeah and what what this really speaks to is i think defy is now fighting for hearts and minds and it's deploying capital to fight for hearts and minds and this is not just like going on the offensive narrative exactly going on the offensive but also like regulatory which is really good to hear because guess what banks have this kind of regulatory firepower even crypto banks have it we're going to talk about some ftx news they're deploying capital and you know all sorts of ways so d5 needs a voice in our legislative halls and i think this is a step towards that so kind of cool um david let's talk about this so brian armstrong ceo of coinbase put out a post called embracing decentralization at coinbase and the headline here is basically talking about coinbase creating uh kind of an apple app store experience right but treating d5 protocols as first-class citizens so d5 protocols being kind of the apps and coinbase custody being sort of the like the custodian solutions being sort of the user interf like the the um i guess ui and the bridge to all of these apps um kind of cool david because i think this is the protocol sync thesis in action coinbase is recognizing hey we don't have to build all of the apps we don't even have to have maybe the most liquid trading markets in the world we could just provide an interface to uni-swap and charge a fee on top of that this to me is the future of banks now we'll have to see how they enact this um but um i do think it's going to be good for d5 protocols uh overall not everybody's ready to hold their own private keys they need some hand-holding at least at first to get into this space any thoughts here yeah they really advertise the crypto app store which gives me flashbacks to 2017 and 2018 where people were like oh yeah we had we used to have apps in the traditional app stores google ios now we have these d apps and so we're going to fundraise a hundred million dollars to build the d app store not realizing that d apps don't actually exist as something that you can download like imagine going to your phone and downloading uniswop that's like a nonsensical thing to do but that was like the vision back in 2017 but now this this can make a little bit more sense now i think if people are um people are looking for familiarity when they come into crypto they are straight up looking for like the defy tab in their coinbase wallet or like where where's all the defy things uh and so maybe it's actually a really power play to put all of defy into one single ui uh and really make that available as a consumer in the ways that they are used to when it comes to the app store so they can literally tap on unit swap and then they open up uniswap um yeah i i was never a fan of the 2017 like dap thing like we're creating an app store and like that was just such a because it was very unfocused but i am a fan of this because i think money apps are the thing that is the thing that we are producing in crypto it's a better banking system a better financial system for the world and so this seems much more focused remember the d-apps of yesteryear could be anything like it could be like a decentralized social media thing or it could be like all of these weird things that no one was actually using but like hey if i can get four percent on my um my usdc on my stablecoin by using a uh an app through coinbase i don't have to figure out d5 then cool you know sign me up so uh dave let's talk about this coin keynes glorious return so kane um of the synthetics product he he co-founded that uh he has now returned to save the project what's going on here what i didn't know synthetics needed saving was it in trouble yeah so kane likes to joke how he had taken a step back uh from the benevolent dictator to kind of just the guy that writes blogs over at synthetics because like to some degree like he is the vitalik of ethereum for synthetics he is the satoshi for bitcoin for synthetics and and if we like decentralized apps we want our applications to have leaders but there's a friction there because you know to some degree leaders are leaders for a reason uh and it sounds like after kane stepped away there was a bit of a unfilled power vacuum that never really got filled by the the dow and so it sounds like kane's coming back in to really just kind of be that that guide that synthetics needs dowing is hard and so maybe we do still need to you know come to terms with the fact that while dows are cool they do need like maybe some one single person kind of calling the shots uh until these things really grow out and mature yeah it seems like it's going to oscillate back and forth between that and the dow structure where you like you decentralize and then you maybe do it too much and you need to like you know re-centralize or get some more structure and then maybe do that too much and you kind of ebb and flow until you get the exact combination maybe that's how this is working this seems like it's uh the next ebb and flow of uh synthetics though um david let's talk nft stuff man we got to start here axi infinity the gaming platform is absolutely booming i was amazed when i saw this so this is um william pister who writes the bankless mediversal newsletter uh he just put this post out today look at this dude um last 30 days wow axey infinity has provided 11 million dollars to its players wow like that means you're playing axie and you're making money while you're playing video games my god that was my dream as a 12 year old boy growing up like it's here i can literally like there's a generation too late ryan right i know man why like i can play video games for a living and not just stream it like um you know the twitch streamers these days but like the items i'm mining and the skills i have in this game i can actually these are real items with real world power it's like man it's all my childhood fantasies are like happening now david dude i'm a kid again imagine if diablo if you could have made money from diablo 2. like imagine how much money like a bail run would have gotten you oh my god imagine how addicted i would be though yeah right like yeah maybe bank list wouldn't have been existed you'd still be playing um it's crazy that axi infinity is making a substantial amount of more money at least again at least in the last 30 days 30 days not a short amount of time then make or doubt actually is it infinity pulled in 11 million dollars in revenue versus uh maker dow's 8.4 million dollars uh i'm not i'm not sure if that 11 million revenue for axe infinity goes to like the axi team or is that if that's more like going to the players who are playing i think it's going to my understanding you earn these things called like love potions and there's a market for love potions and then you can sell the love potions that you're earning on like uniswap for for money so this is like again the intersection of like gaming nfts and defy all mashed together totally and this is actually not the first time that we've seen uh the story of people generating more uh income than their minimum wage in their home country uh we saw this with gaza and chain there was a story of a some brazilian player who is making like two to three times the minimum wage just playing gods unchained and collecting scarce assets um i think this is uh the signs of the thing things to come yeah look at this axia infinity this is um linda um talking about actually infinity players in the philippines earning living wage through this uh really cool how global this is as well uh all right david on the nft subject uh twitter is dropping its own nfts on wearable uh that seems like a big deal what's going on yeah uh jack jack dorsey is on one side of things telling us that lightning network is coming to twitter yet twitter seems to be coming to variable to issue nfts first that's an interesting little juxtaposition right there uh i i don't know why these nfts are valuable they don't i think i don't really think like they're testing they're just testing it it seems like yeah this cheats up like a test right like these aren't historical twitter moments it's not like jack's tweet where he actually did sell that uh these are kind of just random little twitter creative drawings so it's kind of the fact that the the verified twitter account is selling these things that's really the big thing it's not necessarily nfcs themselves back to your comment about dorsey though um somebody asked him um or somebody said this i've talked about jack being a maxi in the past a bitcoin maxi that is but ever since um following somebody he's looking into it more only a matter of time before he buys into eth jack dorsey buying eth and then jack dorsey comes in this thread he was tagged on and says no no he is not buying eth and uh i love this follow-up i think this is the follow-up chain link god says how did you pay the gas fees to mint these nfts then jack must somebody bust them on either somebody twitter somebody is buying either it's jack or twitter itself is this cognitive dissonance like why does j why just capitulate jack it's okay just come on okay let's have a talk about it we will be really nice there can be more than one coin there can be more than one store value it's possible okay a couple more things going on in nft world the first is uh tim berners-lee has sold an nft this guy was one of the main people behind the internet that we know and love today he sold some original code in nft form for 5.4 million this is another piece of crypto culture excuse me internet culture getting preserved and valued as an nft any thoughts here yeah i really think this is one of the core legitimate purposes behind nfts not people just like spinning up some 3d animations and graphics and selling in that that's cool too but nfts are art and art is partly historical and if you want to own a piece of history that's kind of the role that art serves and if you want to own a piece of internet history that's product market fit for nfts and so this going for 5.4 million dollars that's actually kind of where i see nfts uh kind of like planting a flag and saying this is what we are for there's many other many many other things there was an nft mania that happened but the high-priced one-of-ones of deep internet culture that happened before in nfts were even a thing i think that's that kind of phenomenon is here to stay so congratulations for tim berners-lee created something open source for free and then got 5.4 million dollars like 30 years later do we know who bought it did please or now get it or please or dow did not buy it i think they voted against buying it oh interesting well you know what it's unknown every every time this happens though david um it makes cnn you know like and that in itself is cool that's a great thing for crypto all right well cnn has issued some nfts last week uh not apparently what fun fact yeah we don't have to go into it because they were a bunch of bs but they're also in the nfc game all right you can't can't not be an nft game i guess even if you're jay-z this is crazy dude um this is d5 dad tweet never thought i'd see jay-z with a crypto punk in his profile so jay-z bought a crypto punk and turned his profile into a punk is that right we don't know the first part uh but we don't know if he actually bought the crypto punk but yes his avatar is a crypto punk it would be a weird it would be a transgression if you didn't own the crypto punk that is your twitter avatar um uh yeah that's a hot crypto point yeah simple features looks like jay-z you know uh black eye funny hair gold necklace like looks like jay-z um yeah that's the right crypto pun for him so we don't know if jay-z bought that or like somebody on his team bought that but somebody knows what they're doing with respect to like nft culture and crypto culture to do that and good brand i guess was that because he's minting an nft so he minted this nft and maybe we could talk about it but he also looks like has uh hov dot eth oh yeah has an ens address hove.eth he's got 99 problems but minting81 i love that man what's going on here yeah so he minted an nft contract and if you are paying attention to the ceremonious event of minting a token people like to put an asic art into their token contract just because it's free space why not uh and so they put in this big asic art jz into the token contract that they minted for whatever this nft that jay-z is issuing uh i don't think that jay-z is knowledgeable about crypto punks or asic art in token minting contracts himself i think that he uh hired a very well informed just like assistant or somebody to help guide our advisor and that advisor is doing a great job so uh jay-z nice pick on your advisor bro it looks like somebody from the ethereum community got him hove.eth2 which is really cool um all right so this is the actual auction so he's releasing this nft on sotheby's so again mainstream like artist rapper cultural figure meets mainstream art distributor meets crypto nfts another pretty big event i don't know man it doesn't seem like nfds are dead to me it seems like stuff is still happening no i think nfts are just becoming more precise that's what's going on is a lot the sheer number of nfts be being issued is definitely going down but like the nfts are left behind are going up up up in value right mm-hmm yeah rumor is katy perry uh katy perry nfd next artist all right it's crazy california girls here we go bitcoin stuff bitcoin minor migration man that's been a big story it's a life story what's happening bottom line is all the bitcoin miners are leaving china right now due to oppressive china state regulation essentially as they're doing that hash rate going down down down down down down of course this adjusts algorithmically every couple weeks or so but the hash rate does not the bitcoin or the difficulty adjustments adjust to accommodate changes in hash rate right so what what what's happening here are we just seeing the the results of um the the migration going on in hash rate and difficulty adjustment people turning off their asic units to put them in boxes and ship them elsewhere uh anywhere else i think there's a lot of that's a really important thing to find out each different farm texas yeah people are really optimistic that it's coming to america uh people and bitcoiners are really trying to stamp their feet saying like hey like america is the right place to set up your bitcoin shop it's good it's good for just the pr of bitcoin if more hash rate is onshore in america where bitcoin is largely going to be become regulated so favorable regulations if flashback moves onshore uh people like that but also the other conversation is that uh china's really dirty really dirty energy lots of coal and so anywhere moving anywhere else out of china is positive towards like the whole green energy narrative that bitcoin desperately needs david i'm gonna skip to head this this one um but this is bitcoin mining firm terra wolf orders new machines so a hundred million dollars in bitcoin asics it seems like they just ordered i actually i don't know if this is exclusively yeah it's it seems like it's exclusively bitcoin asics um what is going on here so companies are still investing quite heavily in uh in bitcoin asics a hundred million dollars here how does this link to the bitcoin uh minor migration story and what what do you think the lens on this is yeah and this actually isn't the only story of its kind this week there's actually been a number of stories going around about uh just mining firms just allocated like raising a bunch of money to purchase new asics this is something that as a bitcoin miner you have to do you have to always be cycling through asics but like this very high this is the high the highest number that i saw 100 million going to purchase asics what the strategy for bitcoin mining and this isn't true for this is just true for bitcoin mining across the board is that you buy like 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin asics and then you are going to mine bitcoin at a discount for the next like three to five years so that hundred million dollars of asics turns into somewhere between 200 to 500 million dollars worth of bitcoin over the next three to five years you get fixed costs that you have to amortize right exactly the the point that i would like to make is that this hundred million dollars going to purchase asics all of that hundred million dollars and all of those asics are going to be deprecated probably by the end of five years and five years is already kind of long like it's three deprecated you mean you can no longer mine using them they no longer profitably mine and then they can't like that's the other problem with asics is they can't be repurposed uh and so like to some degree like that's that's nice for security as in like there's nothing else for asics for the shaft 256 mining algorithm computers to do other than mine bitcoin and so when you purchase an asic the only thing it can do is mine bitcoin as soon as it's dead like you can't repurpose it you can't plug it into a different system there's only bitcoin and so three to five years there's a hundred million dollars of asic waste that happens because these things are just literally trash and and to me this is this is why people say that proof of work is just proof of stake with extra steps if you are purchasing a hundred million dollars worth of asics you are locked into mining bitcoin that's the only thing you can do with your 100 million dollar investment you are locked into these asics you are you are uh locked into the value of bitcoin the value of the bitcoin blockchain and the value of btc and then you get discounted bitcoins over time for the next three to five years and but it's not even efficient proof of stake because you have to keep on spending capital to buy more asics and the asics keep on getting burnt and wasted and so like this is this is uh just i wanted to bring this up just because this is good anecdotes and good lessons for why proof-of-stake is what it is it's the same there's the same similar properties to proof-of-work just it's just cuts to the chase which is that proof of work is just proof of stake with with extra steps involved and a lot of waste stake is just tokenized asics we've said that before i think it's true here two other points i want to make on that david is is one we don't often talk we talk about the energy consumption of of bitcoin mining but we don't talk about the hardware energy consumption of bitcoin mining all of those machines need to be thrown away and there's a whole energy esg debate here they're totally trash after a few years but i will say on the flip side bitcoiners will say that's actually an advantage david because what it does is it recycles some of the capital right so like it distributes capital in a way like they'll they'll say that um staking asics if you want to call them that but they don't deprecate they never so that establishes a uh ruling oligarchy plutocracy in the network that that bitcoin doesn't have um i think we've had justin drake on that kind of to kind of debate that and what's interesting about that debate is like the actual amount of bitcoin that gets distributed at this point in time from that is like super small like relatively small um compared to the cost to the system to to do that distribution and then the other thing is i guess like who's it getting distributed to right it's definitely not getting distributed to the mom and pops because they can't they can't afford a hundred million dollars to run asics in a data center no one's mining out of their homes so i you know there there is a a counterpoint that bitcoiners would say about this about it being a good thing um i don't know i have my counterpoints to those counterpoints i don't know if we want to keep on going lay him on me real quick okay so the the whole proof of stake rich get richer thing is like you know it's good that asics deprecate because then if you are a mining operation you keep on having to expend capital to keep up interesting take that doesn't mean that like proof of stake is the complete opposite where like the rich only get richer if you are staking and you are a hundred million dollar fund or you're an individual with just like three ether you are receiving the same rate of return same rate of return and so like yes no economies of scale the the stakers are getting richer as a proportion of the overall e-supply versus non-stakers but if you want to participate in consensus the whole reason why proof of stake is so cool is i can do it for my laptop i can do it from my home and i have the access to the same rate of return as a gargantuan hedge fund and so to some degree like it's not a distribution problem if everyone can access this stake right if everyone can access the upside uh and that's a really important point to point to drive home the other thing that that bitcoiners often talk about is how like you know bitcoin is going to be green because it's going to incentivize energy production and bitcoiners and bitcoin uh mining operations are actually going to be the source of energy because they are going to be paired with an energy generation facility and bitcoin miners are actually going to get their energy for free this is this is a a a thought a theory as to the future of bitcoin miners this is articulated by bitcoiners the problem with that is that once bitcoin miners get their energy for free then it's the same critique that they were just critiquing proof of stake about where the rich get richer because these miners have zero capital costs because they're getting free energy and so there's there's friction there's tension between these two narratives articulated by bitcoiners that you can only pick one while we're on bitcoin david let's talk about kathy woods arc invest they are planning to create a bitcoin etf called arc b now whether they'll be successful who knows no one's been successful previously but this is really interesting they had been buying grayscale in bulk and they're still doing that they're buying both uh grayscale gbdc and the e version of grayscale this is kind of a departure to kind of cut out the grayscale middleman and apply for an etf directly whether they'll be successful or not who knows only the sec knows only gary gensler and crew are in control of that um but it is an interesting move at any rate it definitely shows bullishness on bitcoin and crypto at large the the pile of proposed bitcoin etfs just continues to grow i really feel sorry for the sec because they are really you it's easy to have a way out for the sec just approve them oh yeah but you have all of them and then if you don't approve all of them how how do you select which ones to not like approve like it's definitely not credibly neutral right it's not not a credibly neutral choice and they've really backed themselves into a corner on this one but um you know kathy wood love what you're doing uh i really hope that you get your bitcoin etf and i hope you come on bankless yep that's been coming soon hopefully um all right let's talk about this conclude bitcoin news adults in el salvador are getting 30 in bitcoin as el salvador is unveiling details to make crypto a legal uh tender we talked about this a couple of uh episodes ago it's big news right making legal tender making bitcoin legal tender and el salvador is big there's always this question of okay how are the people going to benefit from this this is kind of cool david looks like the el salvadorian government is going to give individual citizens up to 30 in order to promote adoption they have to buy that bitcoin from somewhere they can't just mint it they can't produce it this is not a fiat currency right they have to buy it in order to get it or mine it maybe some volcano mining i don't know but uh it's kind of a cool story and uh i think it's great for the bitcoin community and great for bitcoin adoption and if you are an el salvadorian citizen and you are skeptical about el salvador's usage of bitcoin perhaps this money helps me free money health is literally the purpose of air drops right uh and also if you want to generate a bitcoin native economy inside of el salvador you need bitcoin to be in the hands of people like imagine if you're just like if your family in el salvador is talking to this other family in el salvador and they're like oh bitcoin is legal tender now do you guys have any no no we don't have any bitcoin oh well now you do now you everyone just got 30 in bitcoin so now you can actually start that in the bitcoin native economy inside of el salvador i think this is a really good move that really indicates that um the president of el salvador naib his his heart's in the right place his heart and mind is in the right place so uh good move good move i saw naib um shaking hands or standing next to peter mccormick um a podcaster it's what what a crazy world we live in david like uh media podcaster shaking hands with the president's presidential nation to talk about bitcoin um kind of wild stuff anyway we'll be following that as it progresses in the future let's talk about binance and uk regulation this is our regulatory section the uk is cracking down on binance ordering the exchange to cease operations in the uk i'm not sure how much they're able to actually restrict binance's operation but it seems like they're trying to and he takes here yeah the the longer that binance continues to exist the more and more it's going to just come under the purview of nation states it's a meat space company under that's operating under meat space laws the meat space is going to come after finance at some point in time and it's going to have to bend the knee to nation states that is my take all right let's talk about the fed now so this is a vice chair of the federal reserve board um randy quarles and he authored a paper called paper parachute pants an article that is and central bank money which basically he argues the tl dr is our existing banking system is fine our payment system works well it's getting even better all of the time and we don't really need a cb cdbc stablecoin at all or a cdbc strategy to compete with china um he said this and then he also said which i find very interesting but yes we should be saying yes to stable coins to private stable coins so his take is no cbdc we don't need to create a you know centralized china style cbdc but yeah stable coins are fine like private uh you know stable coins acting as sort of a proxy cbdc that that's okay um so it just shows david that there continues to be some division i think within the us government and the fed on what its strategy is unlike china which seems like no we're full steam ahead we're doing the cbdc thing we're going to digitize everything the fed is kind of waffling on should we do one or right or should we not we're not really sure and it keeps going back and forth it seems like yeah on the last weekly rollup with anthony suzanna we had a topic about how the fed is continuing to research and look into central bank digital currencies like oh great more research more more more talk um this is interesting that a fed vice chair is saying hey let's let the private market produce the products i'm aligned with this actually that makes more sense to me i mean do fix your banking system is not what you said it was if that was yeah let's be real here uh and also stable coins are the solution to that um but i also agree with you we do not need a central bank digital currency for the us dollar all right let's talk crypto banks really quick so uh ftc ftx which crypto exchange crypto bank as we call them uh has just recruited tom brady and giselle tom brady's wife to be the spokesperson for ftx i've given them some equity some investing uh as well some money in exchange for this really interesting how crypto banks are starting to saturate into mainstream but we talked about this from a regulatory perspective but now like mainstream influencers i'm not on the d5 bandwagon but like on the crypto bank bandwagon um i don't love this i don't hate this what's your take yeah my question is do you think sam bankman freed is really all that much of a sports fan oh my god no i don't think he is i don't think the answer that question is no but is he a savvy business person yes is he a new level banker right using all the tools at his disposal to make more money and make ftx bigger yes yes that's exactly what's going on well i don't know how this ends i guess it's okay for crypto i don't know long term if it's good for decentralization i feel like there's some final bosses out there but there is a mini boss where d5 might have to fight the the crypto banks at some point in time right boys thought that right um we'll see how it goes i like fdx uh sbf has me blocked on twitter but if i could tweet at you i'd be like hey come on bankless let's talk about what your plans are yeah let's talk about it all right let's do some drive-bys david well um icp that's not insane posse what is icp what are they doing uh icp is the internet computer uh is that what that means i think that's what that means it's the token for dfinity and dfinity has been largely critiqued by its large high production launch and high media just overall just like a ton of marketing ton of pr time taking forever too taking forever to get to get their product out the door people who pay attention to uh dfinity say that their code is really interesting um but i think that they have just taken all of the opportunity that they could have had to be a legitimate product and they crumpled it up in a piece of paper and they threw it in the trash because the team dumped so much of the tokens into the free market that it just tanked the price and so the the dfinity team walked away with i think something like uh come back can you go back to the first screenshot ryan something with 300 uh they dumped 20 million icp tokens dfinity tokens as the average average price of 300 walked away with 6 billion in the first two weeks of trading so they said hey all you people that are bullish dfinity that's great we're gonna dump on you and there's no way there's no faster way to just ruin your legitimacy as a project than to dump on the people that are willing to buy into your project on day one like big mistake big mistake it's it yeah we'll see how it goes i mean how do i say it's a mistake they made six billion dollars but also you ruined your legitimacy yeah it depends what their what their intent was and legitimacy i think as a as a currency as a money it's gone in particular it's gone yeah it's uh that definitely feels gone at least it would take a lot for that to come back um let's talk about visa visa makes five strategic crypto hires and placements dude visa is doubling down in crypto we're gonna have the guy behind this um q sheffield on bank list to talk about what visa is doing hopefully at some point in the future they just have to get that cleared by legal but i want to hear what visa is doing man because it seems like they've got a crypto strategy and they're gearing up david this last thing um usdc stablecoin is now expanding to multiple blockchains could soon be on 10 networks so this is not just ethereum but it's tron it's i don't know wherever else can support i'm sure uh solana i'm sure uh any any thoughts on this expansion it's just inevitable nope the us dollar owes no allegiance to any blockchain um but i expect the majority of the uscc to stay on ethereum all right guys we are going to be back with some hot takes but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dals have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in

we're going to get to memes so stick with us the first is from uh gajesh i think gajesh.eth.com in the 90s dot eth in the 20s the 2020s that is kind of a cool take are this is like the new internet that's what this is saying dot com to eth any thoughts here yeah to some degree i i i'm also not paying attention to this but the world of like dot eth addresses like you know i got david hoffman.eath you got rsa.eth like there's a world of speculation to be had in there and i don't know why that's not a bigger world like gotta you gotta claim the enesto names if you think that this is true i'd i'd pay a few hundred dollars for uh davidhoffman.eth like even now dude i offered the guy that owned david.eth five eth for for david dodie but he wouldn't he the the lowest bid was thirteen eighth and i was like oh no i like you [Music] that's a lot you know funny story we can't get bankless.e either somebody's got that um actually no we did get bankless.edu yeah we have it we do have it you bought it sorry you bought it i was about to say you told me you got it yeah no we spent uh we spent three thousand dollars on that yeah we spent some money to claim that that was good sorry i was thinking of banklessdow.eath that we can't do it there we go somebody else that oh my god i don't even know the enns names we own we have bankless.eve guys never fear you know what jigesh is also he's like a 13 year old kid do you know this david so um he listened to bagless he's the m before he's a blockchain developer he's a kid he's got almost 20 000 followers um and the meme for his headers like he this guy is yeah crypto culture the godfather yeah he's with it man yeah how many how many people do you think like listen to the show who are like 18 or like under 18. i don't know maybe the instadap brothers who made instadap they were both under 18 and when they started working on instagram i think the youngest one was like 15 when he started working on instadap and then they raised some a couple million dollars a few years later before one of them hit 18. it was crazy this is awesome man this is millennials handing the torch over to zoomers like we kind of started this thing but like you guys are going to take to the finish line so that's awesome to see all right let's do this take um so this i think it starts with uh gutenberg why don't you read this out david yeah uh this is a tweet from greg eisenberg he says the gutenberg launched the printing press when 96 of the people in europe were illiterate that's how it feels to be building in web3 crypto today it's just early uh there and there's an interesting like you know thought experiment to be had where like imagine you're inventing the gutenberg machine and somebody some investor comes up to you and goes why would you invent the printing press when only four percent of the population can read like that doesn't make any sense no one's gonna want you bad ux bad ux turns out it was a printing press that taught people to read and then became the most influential piece of technology of like the next 500 years so anthony cesano quote retweets this tweet and says this tweet has been messing with my head since i saw it yesterday and then friend of the pod josh rosenthal the guy behind the crypto renaissance podcast goes zazzle is in the know it's a great point and even more spot-on than uh than uh the original poster of this tweet josh says permissionless communication drove the renaissance combined with ledger-based fintech in the 1400s unraveling hierarchies and empowering communities links to a youtube video i'm pretty sure that's our podcast and that's why that podcast was so good and if you haven't listened to the crypto renaissance podcast you got to go listen to it uh links to a specific part in this podcast that's great dude i love this tweak i think it's i think it is spot on how like how many people are learning finance through crypto today right this is how i'm learning finance yeah absolutely all right um let's talk about this coinbase this is brian armstrong again he says we plan to list every crypto asset we're legally viable this is a departure i think but i'm glad they are at least broadcasting this because there was a time and place where coinbase was seen as sort of a gatekeeper for retail right like they would help you avoid bad investments like terrible assets and i think now they're they're saying like we're making no statement as to whether these assets are good buys or bad buys or complete scams or not scams if it's legally viable we're just gonna list it right it does feel like that is the lowest common denominator for exchanges like if binance is listing it how can coinbase base not listing it so i understand this approach and um like i i guess i appreciate the clarity there it's like just because it's on coinbase doesn't mean you should buy it guys totally they used to have the coinbase like asset framework to really gauge the quality of an asset and they would score on different like different scores and that was kind of like a cover your own ass strategy that they were doing and i think actually that might have backfired because if you start talking about the different natures of the different properties of the asset is centralized who owns the supply blah blah blah well then you actually start to get into a realm that you maybe didn't want to get into into the first place which is delving too deep as to the nature of the assets and so instead of having that like five part like point level system that there was the original framework they are just doing a binary one or zero like is it legally visible illegal or is it not right uh and to some degree that like you know removes responsibility for even commenting on the quality of the tokens so as a profit maximalist and a business maximum perspective it makes it makes sense it makes sense you know it's kind of fun as uniswap doesn't even check for that it's even more credibly neutral it doesn't even rely on the legal system is it an erc20 asset or not that's the only level of gatekeeping permission you need for uniswap which is a beautiful thing all right um let's look at this vitalik quote david this really uh this is really cool and it's a vitalik quote from a long time ago actually um but it's held up like a lot of things vitalik has talked about or done over the years whereas most technologies vitalik says tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks what blockchains do is automate away the center so instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job blockchain puts uber out of a job and lets the taxi driver work with the customer directly i think that's a super powerful quote because um what he's talking about is like a new architecture for the economy we just had this conversation with some folks about the creator economy our panel that we just had yesterday david and we talked about this being a uh more friendly era and economy for individual creators and i think that's what that's what vitalik is is talking about that blockchain is actually creating a mechanism for creators to interact directly with the market without having to go through a big web 2.0 middleman or an uber uh for instance that is kind of the end state goal of this uh and super cool if we can make that happen yeah this reminds me of another vatella quote where he says like the cool thing about ethereum is it doesn't put the taxi cab driver out of a job it puts the ceo of uber out of a drop or it puts the middle management or the bureaucracy out of a job and bureaucracy by almost definition doesn't add value it's just an efficiency and and yeah it's just like it's not the value creators the value creators are the uber drivers or the content producers or whatever and this is actually the original version of dao's uh dao's these days are really kind of just nicknames for digital organizations where people just exist in a discord and have a plan and a goal the original vision of doubts was code at the center and humans at the periphery where uber drivers would come interact with like the uber app the uber dao that you were d app and the uber d app would autonomously ascribe them like tasks and then they would the uber humans would do the tasks and then the uber dao would you know award money to them code at the center humans at the periphery that was the og version of dallas and that's still yet being built out like stuff like airbnb and uber and the sharing economy stuff really hard to do but that's the vision that vitalik is articulating here and i still think that's the vision for ethereum it's just like probably the hardest thing to tackle and jesse our friend jesse walden would say this is the ownership economy so it's not just the uber driver earning money the owner the uber driver is actually earning ownership which means equity in the platform network and so upside right which is super cool and a way to flip capital markets on its head um let's talk about this so uh kupatrupa another participant in the dow panel that we just had so guys check that out if you haven't yet i think um that's on youtube right now we're probably putting it in the podcast too oh it's already already broken it's out on the podcast wrote a great piece on the dow landscape david what are what are some of the highlights from this um article for you yeah cooper is a great writer and he he's just paying attention to dow's at large and so if you are we keep on talking about dallas on bank list and if you're trying to get up to speed with daos definitely check out this article from cooper he both like just talks about the current state of specific dials as well as more high-level broad just uh ideas or thoughts about how dows are organized and some good mental models and graphics to go along with it all right david it's that time of the week what are you excited about david hoffman i got an article coming out on the bank list newsletter next week and it's been a while since i've written and it's been a while since i've written to this level of effort some of my most recent articles i've kind of just written it and send it out but this one i've really been taking my time really going back and editing it's all about the march of defy capital efficiency uh in the lens of ether the asset right so defy is always in a competition to become more and more and more capitaly efficient every new successful d5 protocol is successful because it's a more capital efficient version of any predecessor uniswap v2 is a improvement on the capital efficiency of v1 unit swap v3 is a capital efficient improvement on v2 balancer v2 is a capitally efficient improvement upon valencia it's all about capital efficiency it's all about capital efficiency layer on capital efficiency to how eth is the native asset of ethereum and receives all of these capital efficient tailwinds and that's completely aside from ether as ultrasound money ether is ultrasound money specifically at the protocol level ultrasound comes from the ethereum protocol defy is doing something completely differently which is also putting tailwinds behind ether of the asset which is allowing ether to become the most capital efficient asset of all time that's what i've been writing about still still in the editing process really trying to make this as punchy as possible but i think this article is going to be a good one and that's what i'm excited about this is new for you you seem oddly bullish eat which i've never heard from you before david i've come around to ether lately it sounds like an article uh from like 2019 or 2020 when like you were writing these big thought pieces on how d5 protocols were going to kind of consume and eat up uh ether as an asset so man i'm super excited to read that um yeah that's another interesting way to put it yeah it's always been the game for defy applications has always been to gobble up ether right and the competition for defy apps become more capital efficient is just incentives better and better incentives for people to deposit their into they're either into these defy apps defy apps want your ether they're trying they're trying to eat it and so they're trying to convince you to put it in there and they do that by making a better product it's crazy competition competitive they're competing for your eat yes we always say competition's good for the consumer in d5 competition is good for ether absolutely ryan what are you excited about i'm excited about dallas man i'm feeling that doubt energy did a conference uh about dallas i i need to get caught up with we had a crater economy panel on daos i'm seeing what's happening in the bank list out we had four hours of dow content on bank listings oh my god so much content um and i'm uh listen to your meet the nation with coordinate which is awesome they talked about at the end about like kind of dao theory and i'm just appreciating this this dow energy and seems so simple right what are dows they're programmable llc's um but this is so fundamentally important like programmable capital coordination tools you got multi-sigs which are like the the programmable treasuries you've got um tokens which are like programmable cap tables you've got this all built on top of ethereum as a programmable banking system it's global it's nate internet native it's completely open um koopa troopa said this too lately uh where he said basically nf dows are where nfts were a year ago and i feel the same way about dallas as i felt a year ago about nfts which is like i knew they were this really exciting really awesome primitive that were so early in in using um and i know that dials are going to be absolutely massive jesse walden said we're going to have a dow sometime in the next couple of decades that is bigger and more important and more complicated and interesting than uh social media tech like facebook wow like bigger than the biggest companies in the world i like i plus one that i agree with that but here's the interesting part david is like i know they're going to be absolutely huge as a primitive but i'm not sure exactly how right like i expect to be surprised just like nfts last year at this time we started doing some nft episodes before they just blew up and became absolutely massive and um that's what's so cool about crypto is like you know this stuff is going to be big but it's it's so emergent you don't know when or exactly how um you just know uh that this is gonna be massively impactful so maybe something in gaming i don't know like which communities haven't gotten a hold of of these dao primitives and technology before uh we'll have to see how how it plans out i mean world of warcraft guilds feel like the original dows right like people coming together from all over the internet fighting over scarce resources sounds like a doubt right so we've seen this energy before i think when koopa says um daos are just a year behind nfts i think it's i think i'll add that like it really feels like dow tooling is is really the subject matter that really needs to that we are currently building right now is doubt tooling is kind of where nft tooling was a a year ago or so and this is why like the people at coordinator are doing fantastic work dows need tools dells need help you can't just put people in a discord and minted token you need tools to help facilitate how to dow uh and so i think this is we are about to embark upon the golden age of dow tooling and once that once that gets finished up and once we figure out what are the tools that dallas really need to dow then the the 1 000 will flourish yeah and guys if you're listening to bank list you're looking for some alpha right i think that this is this is alpha remember when we were talking to the founders of uh nifty gateway they're like we always believed nfts would be huge right right we were saying this in 2018 we're saying it 2019 we're saying it in 2020 and now suddenly early 2021 the whole world understands it but like we've been building and saying this the entire time this is what dalles feel like to me so if you're looking for opportunities in the space to plug in to work for like maybe work for a dow earn some income maybe invest in some of this underlying infrastructure or some of the dows themselves now is the time you're still front running that opportunity but um it's going to be big i think it's going to blow up in a big way so uh maybe some alpha there um we'll have to see if jesse walden thinks that there's going to be a dow that becomes bigger than facebook over the next 10 years like if you can find that like nine years before if you can find that one if you can find it like that's that's yours and here's the thing okay so facebook was not open to investor like to main street investors wasn't open to the world just a small set of people who are credited investors in the u.s could invest in facebook and realize those early gains like facebook didn't ipo until like right i don't know 2008 2009 something like that right um with dows you have immediate access to buy into a dow and earn some equity from day one massive opportunity yep all right don't miss it don't miss it uh let's drop something cool really quick and then we'll talk meme of the week uh david what are we looking at here uh so this is a cool map made by a member of the bank list dow perche shout out perche and there's a link for this in the show notes if you want to go and look at it yourself but it's just one of those maps that has something in every single corner uh and but it's overall the bankless nation right we got bankless dow in the top left connected to bankless llc i think we i think we are a radio tower ryan that kind of sounds that's kind of cool um we got we got the charts for the mountain range we have hard cap hills for bitcoin we got the cold storage deep in the mountain range got the yield farms got centralization harbor there's just a bunch of cool little easter eggs all over this map and so it was really just creative work uh out of out of the bankless dell out out of percy and i really enjoy just going around and seeing what's in here yeah it's really cool definitely it has kind of like a lord of the rings type feel medieval type feel to it too i think this that citadel the bitcoin citadel that looks a little familiar maybe sauron's tower i'm not sure is it quite the great eye i don't have to say the quiet part you think that's coincidental okay anyway it's uh it's a super cool drawing so make sure you check that out all right david meme of the week explain this what are we looking at this is the classic anakin and padme uh meme uh and so uh anakin has got laser eyes on in the first panel and he goes laser eyes until a hundred thousand dollars a hundred thousand bitcoin and then padme says you're gonna take them off if there's a bear market right and then the next panel is anakin still with laser eyes just now with a mcdonald's cap on his head so no you're not taking it off even though it's a bear market and really this is just a meme about conviction it's like i'm going to go to mcdonald's and work for mcdonald's before i lose my conviction in bitcoin so that was a pretty fun meme the mcdonald's crypto memes just won't stop they'll always be here with us when when the bear market's on um good stuff all right um i think that is it bankless nation thank you for joining us for another
