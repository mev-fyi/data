here what's the outlook how are you feeling what's going on yeah i can't remember the last time like it's been a while since we chatted and where we were in terms of the macro state then but i'm imagining it's probably not that different like eth has been around that one to 1.2 k mark for for ages now um i mean if we zoom out and look at you know cpi inflation those numbers came out today 9.1 percent it's not great but i mean the crypto market at least hasn't reacted that bad i think i think almost like some of it was certainly priced in people were expecting it and it's like business as usual now so i think that's honestly the way ethan has been holding 1k is like extremely bullish to my mind and yeah so like that that's like the macro crypto and world markets in the nft space we're still like at this trending sideways state where volumes are low like you know very low compared to say april and earlier uh high compared to say you know early last year of course so we're still like not in a terrible state and we're still in this free mint meta which is interesting i didn't think it would last this long but we're seeing a lot of free mints continue to come out most of them are not doing well maybe they pop off for a day and then they fizzle off so i think that it's it's high risk as is with most things in this space um and then on the other side we're seeing like blue chips kind of perform decently well um bought apes like back up to 100 eath moon birds ran up i think they're like 26 27 28 they hit like 40 for like a minute because there were a couple of big sweeps uh doodles is holding pretty strong and then artblock's generative art is really like i know i talk about it a lot because i'm obsessed but it's like you can tell like looking at metrics it's having a significant movement prices are like going up across the board a lot more new eyes on it um which is great it's fun but it's also like where things get frothy and dangerous and like if you're trying to fomo in now um just like just don't fomo like take the time do your research this is something that's going to be around for decades centuries so it's a marathon not a sprint on that front um yeah macro i think it's it's still if to sum it up in a sentence business as usual are you feeling bullish like do you think there'll be much change over the next let's call it 12 months or do you think we'll continue along this trend of blue chips doing well uh or do you think there's more pain to come on the nft market side yeah i mean it's a million dollar question i obviously don't know no one knows i think i would say over the shorter term the next few months i don't really expect any significant or massive changes i'd be surprised if like prices all of a sudden start truly rocketing up across the board we're always going to see like certain projects perform well uh 12 months is a lifetime in this space uh i'm just gonna say i have no idea like honestly i have no idea yeah yeah of course i i think i'm feeling nervous i i've said this before on the pod i just i've been impressed by how well nfts have held up and actually i think eric connor said had a had a tweet that said something very similar where he was basically like it's impressive to me it's pretty remarkable how well nfts have held up in eth in east terms during the bear they have clearly outperformed nearly every token i think people feel more attached and a real sense of community with their nfts so the panic selling isn't rampant or isn't as rampant which i think is clearly true i've been pretty impressed by how well nfts have held up as well um but i i think this eric sort of talking about this it may be premature i think there may be more pain to come i don't know i'm tracking this conversation around are we in a credit bubble and will there be a credit collapse and and have consumers really been hit as hard as they will be at a certain point i think some of this some of the problems we're experiencing right now are on the supply side and obviously the fed is doing everything they can to try and crush demand but i don't think they've like fully necessarily done so yet and and if they do how will that then impact the nft market and will we see more sell-offs so i'm i'm still a little nervous that there might be more pain to come yeah no it's hard to disagree with that uh at the end of the day like nfts exist in the the scope of the macro environment and at the end of people need money for food on the table or like you know living expenses basics if there's more fear people start to really clamp down and hold on to what they have and there's like a flock to stable coins fiat eth even but um not necessarily jpegs although like like eric said um you know we are seeing these communities rally behind it and i think it's such an interesting psychological dynamic where it's it's like we're all in this together and if we just collectively as a community decide it gets into like what's the value of these things but if the community decides hey we value it bought apes at 100th we're not going to sell blower than that that's the full price if somehow you got 10 000 people to agree to a thousand eighth floor price that's quote unquote the floor price it's not the value because you need buyers and that's i think a mistake a lot of people make they conflate floor price for the value but um if there's as long as there's liquidity which the current like there's several sales a day i don't know 5 10 um for board apes it's yeah it's just interesting experiments so yeah i don't know i guess we'll see this will this will lead us well into a project i want to talk about with it which is the wizards project but i i will say it was funny i was um tracking the cpi release this morning i bet it came out at like 8 30 a.m et and it's hilarious if you look at like the the east the eth chart you know it's like like you know like 8 25 it's one thing and then at 8 35 it just drops down by like 30 bucks but it wasn't a crazy it wasn't a crazy dip and then it started to rally back up so i agree i think it it seems like people maybe were pricing in that the cpi number was going to be bad and it's not or people maybe are feeling like it's lagging and that prices will be a bit better in august and so um so we'll see but let's let's let's go into wizards have you been tracking this this project at all it was also one of these freeman ccos i think a little bit yeah yeah i think so i think it came out um what like a few weeks after goblins yeah and has a similar vibe in some ways to goblins you know it's wzrds um and yeah it feels like it has a goblin's vibe and is clearly trying to trying to ride that trend but they did something really interesting recently did you did you see what they did yeah where uh holders could burn if you had your token staked or something you could burn other people's tokens if they had listed it for sale something like that that's right so basically they you can stake your wizard if you stake your wizard you earn shrooms and then you could use shrooms to burn any wizards that they called cowser it's like it's like wz-rds and then they call them cat you know cow wizard and cowards like c-o-w-z-rds any any um wizards that were listed i think for under 3.2 eth i think you can't burn them if they're above that but if they're listed for under 3.2 eth you could then burn them and um they had like a thousand wizards tokens get burned and so yeah and then you know there were only like 67 listed left yeah yeah so i first saw what i first saw that just the fact that they did that and i was like this is interesting i don't know that it's like replicable particularly or meaningful particularly but it got my attention because it's conceptually i i just find it fun conceptually and i like fun conceptual things in this space um i then started to track some of the controversy and was like oh wow this is maybe bad yeah kind of a horrible practice which we can we can maybe talk about did you have an initial reaction yeah uh pretty similar to yours i was like this is i hadn't seen this before i was like oh that's cool that you can do this with smart contracts interesting mechanic and then uh i felt a little bit i guess like just sad for certain people who had theirs listed and they were burned because they weren't tracking the twitter they weren't in the discord checking and and there's that whole element um and then it's sort of it it is basically it reeks of like market manipulation price manipulation like all right we're going to just establish a floor price as this and and true introduce mechanics to sort of make it like that it's not something i think we're going to see more of and it's not something that i want to like encourage or think is great but it's certainly interesting and maybe there are other use cases um like within like for a gaming project imagine like being able to burn other people like true 10k collections and then you just burn each other's collection until there's yeah like that to me someone who someone listening to this some smart dev go make this project it sounds so fun true 10k projects fighting yeah so i think that's a great point i've been tracking this a little bit gosh i'm gonna forget his name there's a guy he actually went on g-money's podcast there's a there's a game dev i believe he's a game dave he's a dev certainly who's working on like these fight to the death style games um where you know if you enter the arena you actually risk losing your nft and he was sort of flagging that as like a a good use of like scarcity and blockchain technology i think there's a lot of times where we impose artificial scarcity in this world so we have these games where we have an artificial amount of land or a super you know artificially scarce land like in theory there's no reason the sandbox can't have infinite land and increasingly i i you know i've spoken a lot and sort of i'm not a huge fan of the scarce land plot model um for practical reasons but also it it feels skeuomorphic it's like why are we imposing web to like not just web 2 but like physical world rules in a digital world why don't we create things that take advantage of the inherent uniqueness of an of a digital world so that's what this game dev was really getting at like that was his initial theory and he's like okay well these nfts um can be burned and destroyed in battle and like that can create this sense of adrenaline and that's native to to the digital economy i know a couple others actually who have talked about that um in some interesting capacities of like upping the annie for media and content like what if you were watching a show on tv and you had nfts that were a part of that if you're watching game of thrones and you had certain game of thrones nfts and they would get burned if based on something that happens in the show and when i think about what an adrenaline junkie culture we are and how like our shows have gotten more violent or more sexual or whatever like we keep having to raise the bar to keep our attention spans this feels like a really interesting next domain in that yeah to me of like you know we want a sports bet because we want the we want higher stakes and it's like how can we get higher stakes now in our tv and movies so a tangent there based on what you just said i think that's i think you're spot on that that's a really cool idea of like battle games where you actually um winners and losers like get their nfts burned or stolen or something along those lines we saw a little bit of it i think with wolf game and like all the copycats after that where i think you know wolff would kill a sheep but i think it was like you weren't actively burning other people's tokens based on your actions it was if you were like claiming your wool i think if i'm remembering correctly if you're a sheepholder and you claim your wool there's like a percentage chance that one of your sheep will get burned and eaten and i think that yeah yeah just more of like innovation on that front like say what you want about wolf game i think it was really interesting and it still is like you know there's a really strong community around it so that's yeah i'm excited for the future basically as always the innovation to me will be when it's more based on skill rather than walk like wolf game was was a chance game and when like what i loved about what you put forth there was more like maybe there's a way for it it has to do with skill and you're actually playing or you're battling or you're doing something that where then the best player based on xyz skill sets wins and the others gets burned as opposed to just these kind of like lottery mechanisms which are fun and kind of thrilling as well but um i'll just flag before we move on from this the the one of the tweets from a wizard community member who was disgruntled about this said had my wizard burned by the community just for having it listed so great to have an nft i paid .37 eth for burned without my authorization just because i don't follow the tweets he was a little disgruntled really great community project this and he said definitely didn't intend for this tweet to blow up but i guess it's a good debate around whether this meta is a good thing i in general i wouldn't have had as much of a problem with it if there was a more clear like warning to anyone buying ahead of time that this would happen yeah and then funny to all the people who are saying they should have paid more attention like it was only tweeted two hours at a time so i'm really sympathetic to that um and and and the other thing is that it now has a 3.28 floor you know because nobody lists below in case they get burned but it doesn't actually mean anything because if you look at the sales it's like point three one it's people making bids in weak on wizards and then people being willing to sell them to the bidder for point three or one eighth or whatever so we've sort of um lost like a natural market yeah it's very weird you know we don't necessarily know what the what the natural prices of these so i don't necessarily feel long-term bullish but i think it was an interesting uh interesting thought experiment yep absolutely okay we have new celebrities coming into the space have you been tracking the the celebrity entrance at all not so much i've like heard about them on like my periphery but i haven't really been paying attention have you maybe you can catch me up a little bit i mean truthfully i uh i i'm almost finding it more interesting now simply because i find it interesting to have these celebrities entering in a bear market you know and then maybe it endears me to them a little bit more though it hasn't been going particularly well you had um sia did her souls drop which i think is is arguably the most exciting of any of them because it feels like sia actually maybe of the celebrities that have come in like most genuinely appreciates the space she's been in since like december like this feels like it's been many months in the making um and her project did all right they they they've got at least last i checked like 2.3 000 sold which isn't terrible by any means and um they're doing like her souls community will have apparently input in creating like new music with her and and it's it feels like they're making a genuine effort there so um and then and then you have kevin hart and chris brown kevin hart similarly i'm intrigued by i think maybe he's launched in a bear market i think he maybe is coming at this genuinely his discord is pretty active and and um the posts at least give lip service to them kind of getting the space so um that one came out this past week and i think they've they've sold like 2.1 000 out of i think 5 000 is their total supply um and what's cool about that drop they're doing it through moonwalk i think is there is like their partner on it and um you can you can buy with a credit card so it's like 0.055 eth about 65 bucks and they're doing the credit card thing which i think is great i think they're really trying to make an effort to actually draw in chris brown fans um i don't know how i'm sorry kevin hart fans from outside the space um chris brown is is the final celebrity who's entered and that's gone pretty atrociously i think at one point last i checked it was like 300 had sold out of i think it was like a 10 000 drop um but they priced them at 450 bucks which is just it was which is expensive um for a project that i think it's and again kind of giving lip service to you know it's like a fan club but it was a little vague what exactly you're getting for it and so for 450 bucks i think uh i think that's where they they probably went wrong yeah no 100 i agree with what you said at the beginning it's really interesting seeing them drop in the in a bear market and it doesn't surprise me that they haven't like done astoundingly well um but it's nice to hear that i've heard like some chatter around the souls dropped from sierra and people are talking about it and there's definitely definitely interest there and um yeah good luck to them i think yeah yeah i think the order of interest to me is definitely sia kevin hart and then and then chris brown and i think that's reflected in sort of the numbers they've done um but yeah you know i'm not somebody who's tracked the celebrity drops closely throughout this whole space but i was like oh you're dropping in like kind of a really bad market does that does that speak to maybe you have really genuinely long-term aspirations here and and i'll give you credit for that so even chris brown i'll give you credit because unless he was just unaware of what was going on which i doubt is the case i think um you know you might be here for the long haul if he's dropping it now yeah okay the new jenkins the valet or jenkins of la dropped a new website and and has an air drop coming you want to catch me up on this i think you're better smith than i am yes um so they dropped a new website for as a bala which is like their world like the world that their story is being told in and i think there's going to be like pfp characters and it's it's really an excellent website so i recommend everyone um maybe you can find the link put in the show notes goes checks it out because it's like there's sound and it's like an interactive experience really true to their style they take you into this this world and it's very rich in storytelling and lore and so that was like i think two weeks ago three weeks ago maybe they dropped the site and then sometime over the last week they had i don't think it was an airdrop per se but basically they released the um some nfts for their book which they had been working on for you know i think a year um boredom dangerous is the name of the book it's uh authored by neil strauss he's written tons and tons of books and uh it was where they had i think it was in december they had um this like open call for the community who wanted to who held the jenkins token to license their ape to be featured in the book in some capacity um or to receive royalties in the revenue i don't know 100 how it worked with the licensing agreement but this is like the culmination of everything that they've been working towards like since day one they were like hey let's write a book around this character jenkins of la get community involvement and now um they released those as nft tokens i'm actually not sure what the relationship is between the token and and the physical book is there an nft book i think that there's some burn mechanic where i think you can burn one or maybe two of the tokens into a a dow token and and there's like really interesting tokenomics at play and it's performed fairly well so i believe it was a dutch auction i don't know what it started at like maybe one eighth or maybe point eight and then a drop to point two i think was the resting price maybe 0.15 um and i believe it sold out and for a while it trended on secondary it was i think 0.3 floor now we're i think pretty close to mint but there's different rarities and different um types of books i think different titles or subtitles have different value um and i think the airdrop component or like the maybe there's an airdrop coming up and excuse my ignorance because it's yeah it's a little complicated but there was definitely a if you held the jenkins token you could mint at like an allowance guaranteed mint at 0.15 so i think like the the resting floor might have been 0.2 and then i think there's an additional airdrop of like a few thousand tokens that has either just happened or is coming up soon um for some subset of the community and yeah it gains some buzz and like in this market anything that sells out i think is impressive um although i did have a conversation earlier today actually where i shout into someone about how you know go back six months four months jenkins a valet did a follow-up um anything it would have like been a gas war like dutch auction at max like point a would have gone they would flow out the window was this one went to wrestling price and like secondary isn't and i think that's just like a statement on where we are in the market um and if anything it's it's certainly a testament to like jenkins everything they've built and the goodwill and the community that you know they did release more nfts and they're performing relatively well yeah so you know i know jenkins is is a tally labs project and we've talked about tally in the past they they closed a pretty fundraising not [Music] they've built a whole available around him where they have jenkins nfts that had come out is that is that right again i'm embarrassed that i don't know this but uh and now they're adding to that community is that how it is yeah basically so when i shouted to him i think it was like i don't know oh god time flies maybe like eight months no six months ago so it would have been just after the six months ago when you interviewed jenkins i think so maybe longer it's time this year has means nothing like last year felt like a century and then this year is just flying by um i'm actually going to try and find when i did interview room but oh here we go hang on well i got it um five months ago five months ago the video was released i probably chatted with six months ago yeah that's crazy um but anyway so he was telling me about like their plans with pfp with a dow and that kind of stuff so this broad and dangerous book nft basically um basically i just looked it up you can either burn it for an azer azure route which is a sacred item within azerbaila that can be redeemed for a pfp so that's one option or you can stake it for membership in hawthorne which is a dow dedicated to reimagining collective creativity so which is exactly what he said that the plans were six months back he was like we're gonna you know there's a dow element we want to incorporate the community in a significant way there's a pfp element we want to build on the storytelling and and get that emotional world building lore um involvement and and this is their uh i would say that their next significant step in that direction since their initial initial mint do you own any of these tokens yeah they're creating a map i do i i i think i have like 10 or 10 or 12 of the original jenkins tickets and then i i i minted the um the borden dangerous book um i don't know what i'm going to do with them yet probably like half and half is my assumption yeah uh speaking of burning things we have the damian hearst currency burn this week was it this week or last week ongoing uh it's it's ongoing the the deadline is coming up really soon i don't know the specific date but it's like i think towards the end of july so the quick highlight here for anybody who didn't know damian hurst quite famous contemporary artist british right damien um he had created this piece called the currency you've probably seen it's a lot of dots and uh he issued him as nfts always with the premise that at a certain date which is is at the year mark i think you know this this time this year you could choose to take your currency and burn it burn the nft in exchange for a physical damian hearst currency print um or you could keep the nft so it's a commentary on like digital versus physical art i'm gonna go out on a limb zadka and say you have some currencies that are in the process or have already decided what you're gonna be doing with them is that fair that is fair um i have two i i got one at min shocking a year ago and the intention was basically always i was like well the the thing to do is right you get if you can get two burn one for the physical keep one as an nft um and i guess i like left it kind of late like i think this was a fairly obvious play you could have seen this coming that as we got closer to burn floor price would go up because more people would be like well i can't decide i want to and just generally more media attention on like there is right now we're talking about it because it's an event coming up more people become aware of the project um so my plan is to burn one keep one i've seen some like videos and images of the physicals and they look i mean they're small they're like a postcard size but they look really i mean the texture is cool the colors are vibrant and like owning a physical damien hurst like he is one of the greats in terms of art art history his contribution like he certainly can be controversial but you know owning a physical damien hurst that is not something that many people will ever realistically be able to say so i think that's cool i think the entire project is a really great experiment um and i listened to some interviews when he launched it last year and it was clear that he got it like he this was not a cash grab this was for starters he doesn't need money for second two thousand dollars was the mint price it was price and fear is actually not that expensive at all for a damien hurst even if there's 10 000 of them um and and just listening to him talk he was like really fascinated by the outcome of it and i think he his prediction at least back then was that more people would want to burn the nft and redeem the physical because he's like well clearly there's more value in a piece of a physical piece of my work than a digital image um but he did acknowledge that there's a possibility that the nfts would win and he'd be fascinated by it and it might make him rethink his world view or his everything very just deep thinking went into it it wasn't just a real cash grab people on the surface look at it the art is a bunch of colored dots and they all look very very similar like that is that you can't dispute that you get 10 of them in and you probably can't tell the difference without really really digging into them um the naming is interesting he's always had like his names for his traditional contemporary artworks they're like really elaborate um and for this i think there's an ai element for for choosing the names and then they're pretty cool uh and yeah it's just a really interesting project i looked up that the burn date is it's coming up in 13 days and 20 hours from now so i believe that's the 27th of july um do you know how many have been burned last i last i heard it was like 17 had been burned yeah you know what the burn rate is right now yeah so there's 10k total at this point um 2100 2132 have been burned for the physicals so 21 22 have been burned there's still almost 8 000 nfts um clock is ticking obviously i yeah i need to burn one i did sort of see some people who had like serious shipping issues they were like they had to talk to customs and like go back and forth and then in order to get it's like that like gave me a little bit of pause but i i still really want to yeah figure out how to how to get a physical and buy one keep one i mean the floor is around is 8.25 each now it's basically just been trending upwards for the last i don't know three months um it certainly had a big lull dip end of last year started this year and then as to be expected as we get closer to this it's been trending upwards from i think it dipped to like the three-ish range three to four for several months um and it's also an interesting project because i think a lot of people will price it in fiat so as the eth price drops um they might be more comfortable saying again like the original mint was priced in fear there's 2 000 us dollars equivalent so people might be saying well i'm happy paying 10k for a physical game you hurt or i'm paying happy paying 5k for a hurst and so it just readjusted in uh terms as eth dropped maybe yeah it's funny to hear you say that damien's expectations were that more people would burn it which of course makes sense because if you've spent your entire life as a physical artist for whom people want will pay a lot of money to get your art you're like you understand the value of that but you're you're speaking primarily to a community that's very invested in the digital so like for me i'm like if i only had one i think i would keep the digital because a i don't trust myself with physical art i feel like especially hearing you describe the size of it i'm like oh you know i'm losing that thing in a move at some point or damaging it or in some other way yeah which again speaks to why i'm quite bullish on on digital art because i just like the uh the safeness of it i mean scams in the space aside you know put it on a ledger and i feel like yeah more comfortable with that than i do um than i do having a physical but i'll be so i'm i'm honestly quite excited to see where this shakes out because it is a really cool experiment that i think will have some insights to be drawn absolutely it's also really interesting um because it's not just necessarily personal preference in terms of like do you want the physical due on the nft it's also scarcity and value like if if everyone decides if like 9 000 people say hey i want the physical and burn and there's only a thousand nfts and the nft becomes so much more rare so if i had to guess i would say we would get to like pretty close to the 50 50 mark and i think yeah i don't know which side like in my mind i think more people will probably want to burn um and maybe 60 burn 40 um keep the nft um but the other part is like yeah like a lot of people who have two will halt burn one and and keep one so that gets us closer to 50 50 as well um honestly and you're right and people are probably waiting to burn because they're waiting to see where things shake out so they know which one is scarcer yep yep and yeah like it makes very little sense to make a decision until like the day of unless you 100 know what you want to do or you're worried that you might forget which is where i'm at why i put myself in that category um i was going to say one last thing but it has oh yeah no that was it like i think there's some subset of people who've literally just forgotten like they didn't mark their calendar that the burn date is 27th of july they maybe minted or they bought it eight months ago a year ago and they're like and maybe they've just like the bear markets hit and they're like well i'm not going to bother checking in on my nft and crypto portfolio and and so i i don't know what the percentage but but i think that because of that maybe we end up with fewer burned yeah 64 final answer 60 40. strategically held 60 40 40 burned and 40 burn for for physicals i like that bet i'll i'll uh i'll take the oh gosh we're already at 22 so i'll take i would actually probably go the same i'd probably but for the sake of um we doing a bet here i'll take the over in terms of it being closer to 50 50. i'll take it no i'll take the i'll take it closer being like more than 40 i'll say like fifty percent burn fifty percent keep as nfl um so i it's also a bet in my opinion on where you think the future of art will land uh could could factor into the calculation right like the the thing that i find so interesting is to the extent i think art is in part a store of value in today's market and world art is in part um just aesthetic you like some the way something looks in your home maybe and then it's part social signaling and the social signaling piece of this i think is increasingly going to be more powerful online because you're going to reach so many more people you already reach so many more people with your digital presence than you do in your home like the number of people who have come to my apartment is microscopic compared to the number of people who um you know see my instagram so i i that's part of the reason i'm bullish on digital art is i just think to the extent that any of this is social signaling or just showing who you are and your tastes digital art should become more valuable yeah no i i totally agree metamask is the leading web3

immutable.com let's talk about some of the blue chip activity that's happening we have doodles uh and the bucket auction that went off again i'm gonna let you walk me through this a little bit i have to say i'm i'm having a harder time than usual tracking the whole doodle's ecosystem i i have talked quite a bit about their maybe decision to to move on to flow i have thoughts on that and i think they're i i like their premise of we need to get millions of people into our ecosystem and that that's really how you you win in this space i don't know if that's how you win from a price perspective to be honest but i think that's how you win in terms of creating long-lasting ip um so talking about this doodle's bucket auction i know they were auctioning off wearables and maybe how that plays into the the broader ecosystem here as far as we know yeah so as you said they've basically come out and said that their plan is to grow the ecosystem the doodles brown eggs and buy like millions and release millions of nfts and i think that that's great it's great for adoption it's great for the brand it's probably not great for like short-term price appreciation or value for like until there's clarity about how their value goes back to the existing holders and of the nfcs they release um but generally speaking i think it's a right right approach especially for a brand like doodles that really wants to take on the world partnered with pharrell and go to music and all sorts of interesting ip plays so their bucket auction that was again time is weird but like maybe a couple of weeks ago um which is basically they were selling these uh doodles boxes like i think they're called genesis boxes um and and i believe the the unboxing or like what's in the box is meant to be like wearables for your doodle you can interchange and you can like where you get dress your doodle up you can trade these nfts you can swap them around um i'm not sure like the specifics and logistics of you know is there one wearable box is it a collection of wearables how that all works out i'm not on top of that and this was something they actually launched um in nft nyc so part of their physical event and activation was they had like these massive machines that you know people who were there they could go up to i think that you had to pay um in my mind 123 dollars is is a number that's just floating around for that um but you know you got one of these nfts and i believe that they allocated four thousand for that and then they said we're gonna do a bucket auction release um 20 000 additional um of these boxes and the way it worked was i think that they um started the auction and they ran of like three days and you could go to their website and make a bid and basically saying how much you want to pay and uh you you could bid any amount you could bid point one eighth you could bid 500 eth and they would take all of the the bids and look at i think roughly what the average price is or i can't remember the exact mechanics of the algorithm that they use but they act i believe that the way that they worded in explaining it was like at the end of the auction we will have all of these bids and all this information and all these pricing and we'll be able to find like quote unquote the fair market value and allocate based on how much people pay so let's say you put 100 ethan i think pranksy jimmy i think steve aoki for whatever you want to say about that added a whole bunch and like let's say we decide the fair market price is 0.5 put 100 ethan that gets you 2 000 is that what i'm thinking put 200 um nfts whereas if you put in 0.6 eth into the auction well then you'll get one box and will refund you 0.1 and the end result to my mind so it basically it's settled at the 0.5 mark um and you could see where it was in real time and it sort of trended upwards as more people put more money in there was more money in the bucket so obviously the price is going to go up people were bidding higher and higher um and it was just a really interesting experiment i i really appreciate that they did it and tried it and i think they genuinely found like pretty close to fair market value um because if you track secondary market for like several days afterwards it basically floated around the exact same price as mint 0.5 um i believe now it's down maybe like 0.35.4 um is i'm trying to look it up um is is where it's at and i think that's not necessarily an indication um 0.37 i i don't think that's necessarily the indication that the pricing was off per se but more of like in a statement on liquidity where like people said well i'm happy to to i i'll pay 0.5 or whatever but then we're all juggling liquidity in this space and it's like well now what i want to go mint something else i'm going to sell this and it's not doing like people have short-term short attention spans and despite the mechanics of the auction certainly there was some percentage of people who were like i'm gonna min and then flip it for 3x or try and flip it which is i think if you understood how the auction worked unlikely to happen but um a really interesting experiment nonetheless and a good way to expand the ecosystem again like the doodle's floor price was like i don't know probably between 12 and 16 eighth which is it's been hovering out um so in order to like expand their ecosystem and have a price point that's accessible for new members who are like maybe wanting to be part of the doodle's ecosystem this was a really good entry point it still is 0.37 um in a way that doesn't dilute the original either it's like very distinct it's not more pfps it's not just another 10k collection it's something separate um and it it does get a bit confusing all the moving parts and um how they the auction worked and where they're going with it all like you alluded they might be going to the flow network i think that they've said that they're exploring other blockchains and especially if they're thinking millions and millions of people and onboarding quote unquote the masters or the normies it makes sense that they look for options that are credit card friendly low gas cheaper and stuff like that um whether that's flow whether that's a layer 2 uneath or something else i don't think it's 100 been decided but i have been hearing a lot of chatter about flow but it might just be people i've heard like criticism or like people being like hoping that they don't go to flow um yeah that that's like that's my summary of it all i love it okay my thoughts i agree i i find this bucket auction model really interesting you and i actually spoke about it months back uh roughly this concept because it was something kai turner who is on the pod today we're recording this on wednesday july 13th um uh he had floated this idea to me many months ago is something he was talk he was interested in and he he's quite friendly with with jordan castro poopy of the doodles team so i wouldn't be surprised if they had maybe talked about it as you know kai has talked about liking this blind auction model and and it avoids that scenario in like a dutch auction where like at the last minute everybody sees what it's gonna go for and then you have a gas war and it's you know difficult if you're new trying to get in so um very cool of course doodles it just it amazes me how frequently i think they handle things really well and how few missteps i feel like they make the flow thing interestingly somebody had put out a tweet thread that i discussed and i think linked to in last week or the episode two weeks ago that folks can find who stated quite definitively that they were moving to flow which is where some of my confusion came in and he seemed to like he made some comment of like my friend my friend jordan or my friend you know acting like he had inside info which which may be totally untrue it may have been to gentle land actually uh who tweeted about it um so that had led me to think that it was definitive though i had also heard jordan say i think on a twitter space that he would prefer to settle on ethereum and and have that be the settlement layer which of course would imply like an l2 so i agree until i hear something definitive out of the doodles team i won't assume anything is locked i would like to see them on l2 i've talked about that previously i think you know i think you don't want to like bifurcate your your collection and and kind of lose the liquidity and the the interoperability it's not so easy it's not it's kind of not easy getting anything off of flow from what i understand um and so let alone kind of transitioning from flow to ethereum and so i would love to see them on l2 but um but as always i kind of feel like i trust they'll end up making a smart choice because we've just seen so many smart choices come out of this team um so cool all right well i'm i'm glad to be more up to date on that let me ask what did this have to do with the duplicator and was the duplicator the machine from which you could buy the genesis box in person at nftnyc that's a really good question i i don't know what the interplay with the duplicator is i know that they like revealed the duplicator and like basically it's just a bunch of different rarities like they they just said that uh you have a very common a common or a rare duplicator and that's kind of all we know in that respect so yeah i i heard some funny criticism about how people were like do they really just call it very common because most people get there like oh great i have a very common that's that's great thanks doodles well i had a bet going when they first announced it because it was back in i was at permission list so it would have been in may i guess that they announced the duplicator and my my hypothesis was that this was going to be something where you as a doodles holder could put could like wrap your doodle or like almost create um like a second nft off of your doodle that could then be sold and from which you would derive royalties as a way for them to expand their base of doodle holders while continuing to to to um reward their original holders sort of like the licensing models we're seeing playing out where it's almost like you're licensing your character to be remade as a future character for future players so it's not a security because you know you're you're getting paid basically for that licensing um and and i think that's a a really interesting concept b it's something that that jordan had sort of hinted at when he was on the show months ago and b the name duplicator felt like it lent itself to that um so i guess it's somebody can tweet at me and tell me if we already have the answer to exactly what that is but that had been my bet as to what that was going to do yeah no i think that makes a ton of sense and i think we'll probably see something like that yeah i look forward to it okay uh yuga has stress tested the other side metaverse we know that in just a few days by the time this comes out it'll be tomorrow i believe so this will come out on friday i believe it's saturday july 16th that they are going to be doing this this some beta testing with the community for the other side game and metaverse i am with baited breath waiting to get more info on this because i've been a little critical of this i don't i don't think that i have sort of it's the opposite of my feeling with doodles which is i think that yuga is obviously a very talented team but i don't think i've seen the same level of just like innovation and i feel like they've locked into things and haven't necessarily been as like thoughtful about driving things so i didn't love obviously the other side execution was was a little bit botched but on top of that i don't love that they did a land sale in the first place so i am i'm really waiting to see what we're gonna learn about this game on saturday because that'll help to inform how i feel about the land sale yeah i think we're all sort of waiting it's been uh obviously the yuga other side land was like the crypto the peak of the nft market coincided with the macro world collapsing and like yeah there's insane expectations i think so it's going to be hard for them to meet them i i would say that so i participated in the first stress test they had two stress tests or load tests i think they called them over the last week or two where they just said hey we're anyone who has another side you know come in we just want to test some stuff out try out our servers see how it goes and it was a better experience than i was expecting i don't know what i was expecting but they're like two and a half thousand people users when i was in there like running around in this 3d environment it was really smooth it felt like um like running around like call of duty or maybe fortnite a game like that uh it was so much more advanced than um like like a voxelated game engine that we've seen most of the metaverses be built on so i think that was cool and yeah again i have not i don't really know what other side is going to bring what the beta is going to look like but yeah and they have impossible expectations but yeah let's see like hopefully they execute well and deliver something awesome your expectation for saturday is that we'll find out a bit more about the game itself is is that sorry right because that's my expectation okay yeah and what you've seen thus far is really just like the the world and it looks great but we we really don't know anything about how do you play what do you do it i would say the world feels great it was literally just a white void with like a bunch of platforms you could jump on so you didn't actually see any of the the the world itself but um it felt clean and smooth and like it was the experience was was yeah it was nice all right good for them yeah that's uh we'll see we'll learn more as it unfolds uh i want to talk about our blocks you mentioned it earlier obviously they're having a they're very hot topic very hot drops you've got a dutch auction today again it's wednesday the 13th uh three minutes so i know you've got a hard stop here in in like two minutes so maybe this is a good timing okay yeah all right fair enough so um what is the what are the projects you're keeping your eye out for have you been you know i know you've been purchasing are there any any projects that you were sort of watching once they got low enough that you were going to buy into and then that seems to have prompted this this craze we're in yes a lot like i love to like name one or two because there's i've just been watching the whole market and there's there's been dozens of projects that i mean uploads had a giga peak blow off top last august it's like the nft market had a peak and blow off top i'd say art blocks was like an order of magnitude higher than that and so it crashed in order of magnitude harder than that when um almost like in october november december last year that first mini bear that we sort of went through before the real bear that we're in now um art blocks crashed there and was like dead in the water for like three four months in terms of like certain collections that you you'd go look at the open sea activity and like they hadn't been a sale for two months and that was like prime buying time i think in opportunities to to pick up collections that you really wanted i was definitely buying through that i was still minting several like uh i basically every curated drop i would mint and then other ones i will keep an eye on um and now yeah we're in this stage where there's a lot more attention on it um it's very frothy i would say like generative art as a whole more people are tweeting about it myself included uh kevin rose had a podcast uh their roundtable came out like a week ago talking about anti-cyclones and we saw a run on those squiggles had a whole bunch of activations like in new york they had a big thing there's a partnership with wagmy united this football team um you know eric snowfury's flying around speaking in all sorts of places jeff davis the i think ceo or or partners flying around speaking and there's just a lot more attention on art blocks generative art you know other platforms fx hash is is really gaining traction and momentum as well um yeah it's it's an exciting time but it is it is a bit frothy so i loathe to like recommend or suggest people like mint yolo buy right now um definitely keep an eye on it like 100 i think it's worth keeping an eye on looking at prices seeing where they go and all that kind of stuff but this auction literally that started right now is going to be super telling because last september august september when we had they had implemented dutch auctions you would see people like mint at the max price and the secondary would run off afterwards but then it would come crashing down because so many people were just there speculating and trying to flip and i can see right now there's 25 transactions pending so it might mint out at the top price of three eth and i think that it's probably not going to sustain that price so i'm uh probably not going to mint even though i really like it maybe i'll get one a sigh of disappointment yeah i was hoping it would go lower but i'll pick it up on secondary a little lower it sounds like at some point exactly snow fro i interviewed an hour ago two hours ago so that'll be coming out next week um and you know he talked about the froth as well and like you know really just like i don't like it you know i like it when new people can can come in and everything is cyclical though right so of course it happens the way it does which is that it gets really frothy it gets really big that gets attention on degenerative art which is a fantastic thing and then it crashes and then that that paves way for new holders to come in and the people who maybe started to track it during the bull run can actually get in on unreasonable prices i know you've been tweeting you said um like equilibrium has been restored or something like that when uh when the fidenza floor once again went over 100 and we had a fidenza sell for half a million dollars yesterday two days ago so um the uh the ogs and the the the are are doing quite well yeah yeah i mean it's for those that believe and had conviction long term i don't think it's necessarily surprising that we've bounced back it is a little surprising that we're yeah outbox is like pumping while we're in a bear market and things are going going sort of pretty terribly everywhere else but um yeah my long-term conviction has never wavered in terms of uplocks generative artist movement um i think we're still in the very very early stages we're gonna see a lot more eyeballs and attention placed on on gen art um but at a time like this is when people are attracted just because of the money and and and are trying to flip and it gets short-term profit um like case in point this auction was it's basically minted out already um at the top price three eth i heard a really interesting stat yesterday in the history of art blocks there's only been that there's been a bunch of mints that have minted out higher than true eth there's only one that has a floor higher than two eth right now so i think that alone is making me go i'm not going to mint this at 3 or three point seven maybe i'm eating my words in a week or two and the floor is 18th or something um but yeah i'm i'm hoping to buy off the bottas when they undercut each other on secondary let me see if i have that stat right are you saying that of the projects that minted out over to eth only one of them still has a floor over 2e i believe so i think fragments of an infinite field is the only one that falls in that category the eternal pump is like a slight exception to that that minted out is only a collection size of 50 and there was ages beforehand so i don't think that counts um i'm not 100 sure that that's accurate but i'm like 95 97 sure um do you think there are any bargains right now on our blocks uh any bargains i would say squiggles i mean i think that you can never go too wrong well i wouldn't necessarily call it a bargain but i'd say it's a pretty decent buy it's a good bet on our blocks and in usd terms it's pretty close to like the yearly lows um in eth terms it's not it went to like 5 16. um yeah i would say there are some collections that are less there are less eyes on it than others but uh the bargain time was two months ago three months ago um now we're in the sort of more eyeballs and adoption who knows like i reckon i mean i again with my level of conviction i think many projects will be bargains now if you consider it from like a three-year five-year 10-year time horizon you know maybe like 70 percent of all of their curated collections you know whatever it is maybe not maybe all of them um but in like if you if you look at where we are now and and by looking at it in a month maybe we're like a little local top maybe we go for another one to two months and then crash again as it's very cyclical but um yeah i would say long term time horizon everything's about everything is a bargain but in in terms of local and where we are locally it's um it's been frothy and and just be careful yeah i want to ask you about a topic that i ranted quite a bit about on my last recap episode which was a solo i always miss you when i do solo zenika it's it's a very odd experience talking to a microphone alone which is the ens domain craze i mean i think as we talk about projects that seem to be doing well during this time ens domains have been one of the ones that have popped and specifically these like three and four digit ens domains we had porno.ethel for like 200 000 so um i don't know if you have an opinion on this or if you've been doing any buying in this space but would love to get your take yeah i'm i'm not i don't really know about like the whole numbering thing i'm not fully versed in i understand like the appeal of like three digit ens names um just like people have uh license plates like number eight on a license plate that's worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and stuff like that um so i can understand that and i think that there's there's value i think as it again it got really frothy and people started extrapolating four-digit five-digit and then other languages and all that kind of stuff and i think that that's when things got a bit crazy and unrealistic um but fundamentally like i would say the core of some of those numbers and then some of those names i think that there's value in it similar to how we look at domain names you know um whatever sex.com surely is gonna be worth a ton of money um nike.com so like today we saw a bunch of brands sell i think starbucks.com sold for like 50 or 68 nike for a similar amount um a few like that um and just you think in the future when a brand comes in it makes sense for them to want to have their ens domain name um and they're willing to pay up for it now or in the future i have friends who sort of bought a bunch of domain names you know six months ago eight months ago um i think all like the most popular ones have been taken obviously nike starbucks but then they look for like niches and like well stuff like that and there's there's probably still value out there yeah yeah yeah i mean that was more or less my take i won't bore people with it again because i i actually did rant about this for quite a while because i'm i'm quite skeptical on this number craze like i get it i understand that like license plates with short numbers are are cool but i think it's a just such a speculative risky play as compared to the point you just made which is the brand names and to me it's like if you're gonna spend two hundred thousand dollars which i guess porno.et you could argue is more on the brand side but somebody bought zero zero zero dot eth i think for like three hundred e yeah like if you're going to spend that kind of money buy a brand that is going to clearly need it like i made the point that i don't think but you know i sent an email to 000 gmail.com and i got like a bounce back and nobody cares or has noticed so that's not an email address or that that's not an active handle on twitter and i just but for sure you know exactly starbucks and nike are going to notice if they don't have nike.com so um anyway okay i want to get your reactions to some tweets that came out this week um this one comes from and we'll link to them from mike3 and enjoy your he says if you didn't get rich from nfts already you aren't going to you're not early you're very late to a mature collapsing ponzi and regs are coming you can still make money in the long-term rise of art but you'll not be turning 500 into millions by flipping free 10k mints on plebes what do you think i think there's a reasonable amount of truth to that um i would argue that like well i think we are very early still like there's no two ways about that if you look long term time horizon if nfts web 3 were going to be around for decades centuries forever you know we're in the very very early stages um and i would also say that uh it was never that easy to flip 500 into millions like even last year i know so many people there have been so many people that were in the space they were tracking it i really appreciate you saying that as somebody who did not do that right yeah i mean i got lucky i think so many of us got very lucky to be where we are um and again like it was never easy to do it and it's not easy to do it now like that part hasn't changed sure it i would say relatively it was easier might have been more opportunities but like during a bull run it's just easier to make money than in a bear run but i don't think that means that there aren't tremendous opportunities still and it's not extremely worthwhile spending your time to learn the technology the space network i find that i think without giving financial advice i think that there are still amazing investment opportunities or things that you can buy that will be worth a lot more in the future um but of course it's high risk and it's not easy it's just never been easy yep i i fully agree with this i mean i think this is a like with what you just said and you know i think his take is a slightly like uh you know it comes across a little aggressive and cynical and harsh and um but i do think the sentiment of we might be at the end of of flipping like to your point it was never easy to do it but the fact that there were so many people who did manage to i do think that's we're probably at the end of that era of like here's just here's a i don't know i can't think of a great example right now and probably don't want to like you know  on anybody but like here here's something and then it's just going to kind of do this run up into hundreds of thousands of dollars i i don't know i could talk myself both ways in it which is why i wanted to get your opinion on this tweet rather than only pause it my own but i do think we're we're probably entering the next phase of maturity in this market in a really positive way but it does come at the cost of just like you know flipping your way to millionaire status which to your point was never easy but which we did see more than your average number of people do um in in the world as a result of nfts yeah uh rubble pyle this is the next one i want to get your thoughts on had an interesting thread where he pulling it up he said observation on nft communities why the stupid hoops to jump through for everything it has become near impossible to stay on top of projects you were already involved with allow lists freemans airdrops mints registrations dutch auctions blah blah and all the things to just get to some next level of utopia the promise of riches or breathlessly a game this makes it super hard for anyone but degens i'm all for gamification but this is starting to look like a game for a game's sake with the ever promise with ever the promise much like the path to a goldman sachs partnership endless carrot lots of stick he goes on but i won't um i won't you get the you get the gist there what do you what do you think yeah i mean i totally agree i think that and i think that most people agree that we we went through that really which thing with this phase was thankfully over it's like they're grinding for like a minuteless spot um jumping through hoops being in discord you know drawing some fan art um all that kind of stuff it was like quote-unquote the thing to do for a while and it worked and it got engagement and got people talking about your project so people did it but people hated it and thankfully it's kind of over now um so like i i think projects need to rethink their approach and something that we're seeing more and more of that i've like been feeling and talking about for a while is that this idea of like well discord fatigue wallet fatigue project fatigue it's it's the more projects you you buy into and invest in you can't realistically track be part of an active community member in more than like a handful at once i would say and even that like in five communities at once is a little tricky and difficult and i'm this is i spend all my time in this space and and like as someone like maybe you have a full-time job you have a family of you're studying you have commitments um it's really difficult to say on top of stuff and then it adds stress and anxiety because you're like oh am i going to miss out on a free air drop or a claim or you know a mintless bar and then and then you find out about it later on and you feel regret because you missed money and all that kind of stuff so um totally agree i think that projects should rethink their approach should should simplify as much as possible um that's like a grander thing that i'm thinking seeing and feeling more of it's the idea of like keeping things simple and like as ecosystems get more complicated pixel vault and and the punk's comics thing i think is a great example it's really convoluted and complicated and i've like basically i i meant it i've been there from day one i have no idea what the hell's going on i don't track it or follow it anymore and i'm missing out on value for sure in certain instances but um and i'm not alone and i think that just it almost sours me for the project a little bit and other projects like that whereas if someone can do it relatively simply um i appreciate that and i think more and more people are becoming appreciate that it's funny because what came to mind for me hearing this is like it feels like a game for game sake which i agree with but it i think it was born out of the one utility question it was born out of having these communities that were constantly asking for more and wanting more so on the one hand we all hated the the having to keep up with it all but it was also you know us in the macro sense that that drove this behavior i don't think that founders wanted to have to be doing all of this either you know we've all been tired but it was um in the in the chronic crazy bull and and you know it felt like it's what you had to do in order to um create value or be seen as a legitimate project or hell just to be seen as not a rug i think in some ways it was like if you're not talking or doing things well you're a rug then and so yeah um you know i do think those are the things that we're keeping or those are the things maybe to some extent even still with some projects that are keeping values propped up um and so i this maybe ties back to where i think there might be more pain to come like if we rethink all of this in in the short term i think there may be concern like like you know what what is kind of keeping the the value there for for certain projects if you don't have um some of this going on so uh we're in a as all bear markets are you're in a reconfiguring stage and i'm i'm excited about where we'll be on the other side of this but i think there might be some more blood on the streets you know over the next 12 months as we as we reconfigure yeah for certain projects like absolutely yeah it's it's gonna be a tricky several months year ahead final tweet that i want to get your thoughts on so this was from uh nansen like the nansen intern account so nancy being like the um metrics what's the word i'm looking for you know you can track all sorts of different information about nfts and tokens who are the whales that are buying analytics yeah like it's an analytics platform um and so this tweet says why i'm confident that three of the four most profitable nft trader wallets are owned by the same person or entity and then they proceed to give a thread showing that they tend to have activity around the exact same time they've all interacted with each other they all came online these three different wallets all came online at the same time they tend to buy similar things um compelling case i won't i'm not you know it's kind of visual so we'll link to this tweet and then i'll ask folks can go check it out if they're interested so i've i've been like loosely persuaded that three of the top four most profitable nft trader wallets are actually one person and i guess my question is does this matter at all are there any implications to this are there any hot takes to have from this or it's just like oh wow there's somebody out there who's even richer than we realize um i don't think it matters too much uh i mean i kind of already i'm i'm wondering who it is like there's a really profitable problem prevalent prominent trader sneaky ninja pants is his like screen name and i wouldn't be surprised if this is him i know he has true wallers that are like at least up there and have been extremely profitable so um it makes sense like a lot of uh people have multiple wallets and i guess like the the cynical and nefarious angle could be if they use one wallet to slowly accumulate in the other wallet to do a massive sweep causing the price to go up and then they dump from the other wallet and then um but in many instances it's like all is fair in in love and and blockchains so like it's it's publicly decentralized and you know people can view it like like this dancing person has and as like in terms of ethical behavior i think i think it's fine as long as they're not like going on twitter and shielding it and pumping the price up and then immediately dumping and doing that um it's it's just like yeah i'm not too turned off by it or anything or even necessarily that surprised by it yeah all right fair enough no hot take i didn't have one either but i found it striking and i wanted to see if uh again you can tweet it us if somebody else out there has a has a hot take on the implications of this all right then well i think that is our show for this week we'll be back you'll be back in a couple weeks i'll be back next week talking about more of the same and uh thanks as always for joining amazing thank you for having me this was this was wonderful and uh i i did get an art block so i sniped one on secondary um while this was happening oh what'd you get what'd you pay for it uh i paid a little high it was uh i might not age well 4.6 eth but it i think it's it's really beautiful and it's it's very rare it's number 12. running room running moon number 12. yeah but i'll say this moon is the yeah what's the name of this this drop today what was the name of it running moon by uh lucia he uh oh hey i might be probably mispronouncing that um it is it's really beautiful but um it's it's very clear that the the the drop was botted there's a fight there's 500 in the collection 207 are currently for sale so within like 20 minutes um 40 is up for sale so it is to my mind almost guaranteed to drop um i i just happened to see this one that i thought was beautiful at a reason like even if the floor drops to 1.5 ethan i think getting this for four and a half was still i'm happy to pay that for it um but yeah bots and i i think bots are going to get wrecked thankfully it's fun like if you like spend time in the uploads discipline community most people sort of saw this coming and there's like this um uh like almost like screw the bot's attitude we're like well we're just not gonna buy like we are the collectors and most of us if we just decide not to buy price will tank and we'll buy them when it drops like when they keep undercutting each other and the floor gets like two eighth one eighth whatever um but i do think it's a really beautiful collection and over time um it will bounce back and perform well um one one last note and then we wrap up it's it's it didn't help the collection that it has moon in the title of it running moon that's just like rife and mean lords yeah i'm gonna go check it out right now i'm excited i will i will close on this i know i always people never want to hear about things outside of nfts on podcasts and i know that
