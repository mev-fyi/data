I think that we will look back and see the reason for why we had a bull market in 2024 and 2025 what's that reason layer 2's base coinbase specifically putting all of its marketing and weight behind a base layer too because they are like I said printing money on it but they are going to take ethereum layer 2 specifically base because they now have the incentive they are going to take it mainstream vehicle station it is the second Friday of August David what time is it uh Ryan it's the bank with Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier how are you doing this week my man uh I'm doing great man I've got my uh I've got my coffee we've got our stable coins going um some big news this week PayPal launched a stable coin on ethereum I think that's a big freaking deal every kind of topic though yeah yeah what else are we talking about base gets dropped with already 105 million dollars in total value locked kicking off on chain summer coinbase just putting all of their weight behind the base launch and so we're going to talk about all those details and more and then something out of arbitrum tell us about arbitrum yeah they got a little bit more decentralized at least they're preparing to so we gotta cover that with their bold new proposal David do you like that one you did it in the show you can't keep on doing it I can keep doing it this is a different show I get one per show also yeah last time whatever let's move on polygon and ZK sync they are throwing some punches back and forth at least on Twitter we got to talk about that uh there's been some wallet ux breakthroughs I feel like recently this is making me pretty bullish so we'll talk about that the SEC isn't done yet they are striking back and lastly David is Joe Biden a bitcoiner what words I never thought I'd see right we'll talk about that too uh before we get in we've got a message from our friends and sponsors over at stator what's stator David Stater is a LSD protocol that helps you stake your ether and also run a staking node if you so choose so state are one of the cool things about stator is that the bond The Ether that you need to deposit into the state or staking protocol can be as low as four ether which is the lowest capital requirement I think that is in the industry and you get to charge other people a fee forsaking their ether when they stake on your node and so if you want to both stake your ether and then get a little bit more juicy ether yield you can do it with stator there is a link in the show notes to get started uh it is steak season I I feel that very strongly it is it is eighth season for sure oh yeah well let's talk about the other Seasons too when we get to the market I gotta ask you uh what's cracking my friend to open up the cracking charts yeah it's become a thing I'm doing it uh let's see what's cracking with Bitcoin USD on the price charts well nothing is cracking Ryan because we're only up half a percent nine twenty nine thousand three hundred ending at 29 400 100 in Bitcoin it's not much um so are you bored but you know the thing is like I would be bored except for how incredibly good the news cycle is like the Innovations like it is there's a huge decoupling disconnect between what is going on with announcements and innovation in the foundations the fundamentals if you will and the actual prices and so people are getting frustrated about like PayPal they just dropped a stable coin on paper on on ethereum and it didn't even move the price wow don't be frustrated by that that is Alpha let's look at it no price movement here this is the low price on the week what are we at are we flat eighteen hundred forty three dollars to eighteen hundred fifty dollars we went up seven dollars what it's flatter than a pancake I used that like yeah a sheet of paper that's how flat we are on the on the week and don't even ask me about the ratio it's flat uh next you're gonna tell me the global cryptocurrency also flat is 1.2 trillion dollars no it's not flat though two things yes Layer Two tvl and Layer Two scaling factor is uh so we get to cover these in our Market section every week from now on we have added this to the template like total value locked on layer twos coming in at 10.57 billion dollars breaking through that 10 billion amount so because we are adding something to the template David I feel like we have to explain these metrics first time bankless Nation you only get this one-time explanation and then every single time you're expected to know it you expect it to know it okay so what is total value locked in Layer Two why are we looking at this chart on a weekly basis forever and more yeah tvl kind of the same thing as AUM assets under management it's just like how what is the total market cap of assets that are deposited onto layer twos and if you aggregate all of that together on all layer twos on ethereum you come up to 10.57 billion dollars uh well actually technically it is flat it's up half a percent over the last seven days but it's been incrementally growing for all this entire bear Market um the other thing that we're going to look at is scaling Factor uh so if you hit the activity tab on the right you can see a scaling factor of 4.8 x 4.83 x that is how many more ethereums all aggregate layer 2 economic activity is adding so on layer twos there are 4.8 ethereum's worth of economic activity happening that are settling to the ethereum layer one which you know is one ethereum pop quiz Ryan um how many how many times larger is the ethereum layer one in 2023 versus 2015. how many more ethereums is 2023 ethereum versus 2015 ethereum are you just talking about kind of like ignore the ignoring the layers just just the scalability of the layer one because the reason why I'm asking this is I don't actually think people appreciate that the ethereum layer one also scales and so that is a shifting number so when we say there's a scaling factor of 0.4.8 X layer twos to the layer one well the layer one is also growing as well I bet the layer one on its own and and these are through uh primarily primarily client optimization so you know the team over at Geth for example doing a lot of work to kind of optimize how fast Geth can run and um you know there's some juice to squeeze there versus 2015. I'm going to say um three to four x from 2015. pretty good the answer is 6X so it's ethereum that's better than I thought ethereum throughput from 2015 to 2023 is six times larger than it once was and like you said this is layer one client um improvements uh networking improvements um just bandwidth just Hardware as Hardware gets better the ethereum layer one is actually allowed to increase in scale conservatively because that's our philosophy but over time the block size the data throughput of ethereum has gone about 6X from 2015 to 2023. and layer twos are 4.5 x times on top of that and they are not even at Max Capacity now so we are at like between 24 and 30X if you multiply that all together yeah if you compare to 2015 but like 2015 was like primitive primitive era Stone Age and crypto yeah we didn't have much to do on chain just like so remember remember I do remember keep it all right but those are the stats we're going to go over on a weekly basis so scaling factor 4.83 x remember that number and Assets in uh locked inside of Layer Two is 10.5 billion dollars well let's uh peepeth outside of the crypto markets here David and go into the traditional markets inflation Rose 3.2 percent in July that's the year over year and of course I'm talking about inflation of the dollar I'm not talking about uh inflation Vita because that's deflationary of course uh this is a small uptick from three percent in in June so it's three percent in June uh 3.2 percent this commentator is saying this is good news that inflation Rose a modest 0.2 percent for the month of July alone that's an encouraging sign that inflation is moderating so inflation moderating is one of the takes here uh this is the stat kind of over time and this is uh annualized so you can kind of see this let me look at a different view see this this is all the way back from five years ago uh where we used to be under two percent around two percent that's where the FED likes it and then of course covid cranked us all the way up over to nine percent or so and now we are back down but there's a little look at this little bump it's like we're going hey things go up things go down if you if you teleported me back to the peak of that inflation back when we were at 10 and then you showed me what the future curve would look like I'd be like wow this is good that's best case scenario soft Landing is that that's what you see here that sounds like successful manipulation of our economy manipulation of our economy yeah it's going to be interesting to see of course this is not exactly what the FED wants but it's pretty close so we'll see what the August numbers look like I also think David this number is going to get increasingly political why because the U.S gets increasingly political during election season right every four years so we're uh creeping up to 2024 in a presidential election so some people are going to say this is a this number is too high others are going to say it's it's it's too low um what the FED says is a good question I I think there's also this debate of um you know does money printing actually cause uh inflation because what we're seeing right now is I don't know if you saw the headlines this week you know the U.S is at a 1.8 trillion dollar budget deficit as fiscal government spending this year right so that's a lot of spend going into the economy all the while the FED is is tightening and some of that spend goes to like interest payments that kind of thing um so you know to be to be determined on what inflation where that goes next one thing I will say is it does seem like asset inflation is continuing to rise uh as always so there you go um another thing I wanted to mention this part of the market David this is your quarterly reminder that Home Depot you know the stock price of Home Depot is actually higher than the total market cap of ethereum right now I saw this uh apparently I said this back in May because it blew my mind when I was looking at the largest assets by market cap and ethereum was trailing um Home Depot I think Home Depot is really good numbers yeah even worse I hate Home Depot Nestle as well it's below Nestle hello Merc they have a monopoly code so that's that's Adobe yeah Bank of America all of these things are worth more than ether right now than ethereum Platinum is higher than ether I know medium is higher than ether yeah at least you need to like you know build houses people need houses people don't need Palladium all right maybe they do yeah Palladium I'm sure has tons of use cases David but uh there's ethereum number 50 in terms of the world's largest asset so we got our weights to go you know how are you feeling though in this market you were talking about it a little bit when we were getting into sort of the you know the market section in the intro and um I think for me I'll answer for me before I you know I ask you maybe yeah if you hand it off I think it's gonna be dangerous I think for me we might be entering my favorite part of the market cycle say more yeah yeah it's so um things aren't annoying yet and a lot of the a lot of the stupidity has been burnt off right kind of the the frauders and the scammers were sort of uh found out and the market isn't completely irrational it's still kind of a a builder's market and it's quiet so we're not getting all the hype and kind of the you know the chilliness this is sort of the quiet moment where you look at everything that's going on and you were talking about it earlier in terms of the fundamentals and the news and the building that's going on and you realize that doesn't match with the price because the price is still under 2 000 and you're just like oh this is a very obvious trade this is a very obvious purchase I feel very comfortable right now the last time I felt this way was um 2020 before covid by the way before right and then yeah then after covid when we realized the world wasn't ending you know kind of toward the end of 2020 and that has been consistently my favorite part of the of the market cycle just before things get stupid and you're in this kind of like ah we're building we're doing the right thing that you know like we've we've we got hit by the US Regulators right that's not going to get any worse at this point right like we bottomed on uh fading the US coming out of the hole we're coming out of the hole on all kind of the scams and the frauds and the centralized exchanges and all that crap from 2020 too and now it feels like this this recovery phase but it hasn't been a quick recovery so it's not yet stupid and I love that part of the market so I I think we'll get some months here and I'm actually excited about that I think what you're saying is we're in this like Goldilocks zone in the in the crypto era where like if you were a tourist if you weren't going to make it through the bear Market you're gone you've you're gone by now anyone who still left is here for the right reasons and here for the Long Haul and we get to see all like all the announcements and progression and like I said fundamental growth of this industry that the rest of the world is not accounting for and so all of a sudden like in the bull market alpha is hard because everyone is chomping at it but in the bear Market Alpha is easy because there's just not that many people left this reminds me of a take that I had this week that I tweeted out so we'll pull it up here I tweeted out once upon a time there was this six month period between the 2018 to 2020 bear market and then the 2021 bull market where eth broke 300 and hit 450 for the first time in three years and multiple times a week you would see people on crypto Twitter tweet out something like personal news I'm leaving my job and I'm starting a thing the entire set of crypto Twitter which is all knew that it was on it being the bull market and that we had made it and it was just the best time uh it was great because all you would see all of your friends who were like you know had to commit to their nine to five job to in order to make it through the bear market then all of a sudden have the foundation to go out and build their own Venture I tweeted out one of these tweets right before going for my last job to bankless um and it was this great goalie box moment where like ether price was appreciating but there were uh it was all us everyone was just it was all us buying rather than like necessarily like new money because everyone was positioned for it and so all of the gains were plus and then and then you realize because like oh yes that's because people are about to come in and then I follow this this tweet with like little did I know the incoming bull market was gone for me for a life yeah totally I mean so are you ready for another round of this like I could use a few more months but that's what I did we're at the beginning of that phase yeah we're gonna get some time in the Goldilocks period uh yeah that's cool I'm glad that resonates with you too it's just it just sort of hit me this week um this is how merp puts it though if you aren't happy single you won't be happy in a relationship true happiness comes from ethereum breaking 2k not from anyone else hey today is pretty achievable we have happiness on the menu yeah I'm okay under 2K though to be honest like just keeping the Goldilocks period of time you know what else is going up though die savings rate is now live paying out eight percent at no additional risk hey that's above T bills what's uh the die savings rate David the die savings rate is the yield that die out of maker Dow naturally produces it's one of the core Primitives that as part of the makerdale building blocks is we kind of call Ether staking the stake the risk-free rate of ethereum the die savings rate is just the risk-free rate of holding die so if you're holding die you can get eight percent at no additional risk compared to actually holding die you're not lending it out it's just part of the protocol um kind of like in the same way that holding a United States Treasury is you know not really any different from holding dollars if you're holding dollars you might as well turn it into a treasury yeah you just park it in t-bills and it can it can stay um in the in the DSR can it be fungible as well yeah yeah so uh chai chai money uh oh yeah I don't know why they call it chai but chai is it's like how there's our eth or staked East for ethereum chai is uh the die savings rate version of die why why and where is that eight percent coming from it's part of the maker Dow protocol gosh back in my maker nowadays I would be able to very fluently explain this but that was like four years ago um uh there's just a demand for diet and it's creating yield uh yeah and not everyone is is in the die savings rate as well right so that's why the yield is higher than normal that's what roon reminds us to raise so high because there are currently not that many people using thigh settings right only eight percent of die holders use DSR currently so the more holders the more that goes down of course a reminder that you can access this at spark protocol but not if you're American or use a VPN because we live in a financial prison yeah VPN users hands off yeah the specific mention of not available for VPN users I'm pretty sure that's a wink I'm pretty sure that's a wink right I don't know we can't interpret that right but of course the smart contract is unsensorable it's just people have to um screen out on the uii side or else uh big bad American government gets mad with all of your financial access David another interesting stat I dug up this week um did you know that world coin is spending money on ethereum block space well certainly not just how much a little bit a lot 500k in the last 40 days so if you were to annualize that which we can't exactly do but if you were to annualize that that would be 4.5 million dollars in gas fees and so my take on that is this of course the the bull take comes out companies will need to hoard eth the same way they hoard other essential Commodities ethereum blocks base is the new oil what's really cool to me is something that we've predicted for a long time about ethereum is companies actually purchasing ether as a you know a right as access for Block space in the future in the same way that maybe an airline might procure uh barrels of oil or like Futures on oil or something to hedge against future gas price costs it's very cool to see third parties actually spending on block space and that being a driver of demand rather than just users and if you're curious about what they're actually spending on DC builder of course he is a Dev over at worldcoin he gets some context here for context this is the world ID identity manager contract the biggest cost here are insertions and not ZK proof verifications which are mostly happening on optimism so this is the part the insertions uh part is happening on ethereum main chain most of the other activity for World coin is happening on optimism anyway it's interesting to start quantifying that and you know companies actually purchasing block space in this way speak talking of companies coinbase just releases Q2 earnings this is from Ram alawalia former bankless podcast guest who says this is a first quarter where reoccurring revenue for example uscc income staking in subscriptions exceeded transaction Revenue as in like trading Revenue 51 to 49 so coin has cut its reoccurring expenses by a whopping 50 as well as all the layoffs and all that stuff and they also still rolled out new products like coinbase wallet and also base and so inside of the product Innovation section they say we are expanding our Focus towards crypto use cases Beyond trading of course they are that's been there ever since going public that has been basically their number one Focus as a company is to get away from being dominated by trading fee revenue and so they've opened up new lines of Revenue and it's been working uh and so as an example of course base is an investment in blockchain infrastructure where we expect to drive down transaction costs and increase transaction speed of course the point of a layer two but also a way for base to make a coinbase money uh also stated in the regulation section we're beginning to see a pathway for bipartisan legislation that could enshrine Consumer Protections in an equitable Market structure framework AKA soon the regulatory trials will be over so it's still pretty early we are 24 hours into base but base yesterday generated 213 thousand dollars in fees that is 78 million dollars in annual run rate 15 of that goes to the optimism Collective coinbase Pockets the rest huh yeah so like brand new business model poof out of nowhere you're like 70 million dollars in annual run rate for coinbase because of base and that is again before the layer 2 bull market kicks in I kind of like that um coinbase is a publicly traded company because then they get to explain how layer twos works for Wall Street and all they got to explain is 70 million dollars yeah and they're like that's all they have to say Wall Street Anderson like wait you could see that on chain I don't have to wait for the annual report like oh wow okay that's really cool I think it'll totally educate them on um how to start evaluating crypto protocols and crypto networks so remember that old um website current website still running Mariana Conti put it together diestats.com it's just like a live audit of maker Dao it's like every every Theory and block it gets updated somebody should make that for base coinbase should make that for base base economics and they can just have this in their investment reports but they can just link out to it like hey are you curious how much money we are printing in this very very current moment on base you should just go to basedats.org to look at that and one of the themes I think is happening is that like Fortune 500 companies are being shown the way to Mint their own Layer Two using the op stack and that website would go very very far in helping that narrative yeah I think so we can we can pill Wall Street if that's what we want to do I don't know I'm still comfortable in the Goldilocks zone it's just like waiting with that that website could be under development for a while it'll take him a while to catch on Bank location coming up next PayPal is dropping a stable coin coinbase is dropping the base there's a layer two summer party and you're all invited and bankless is also dropping something big to help you navigate all of it coming up next is all of those details but first a moment to

coin it's backed by short-term U.S treasuries and similar cash equivalents for all intents and purposes David this looks to me a lot like usdc here's the contract address this is very cool to see this on ethereum live this is pay this is Paypal US dollars right here and you can see some of the activity on etherscan right now David do you think this is as big deal as I think it is yeah uh I mean I can't imagine why it wouldn't be it's just like well it's just another usdc clone but it it just indicates that hey perhaps the market doesn't think that the United stable coin Market is saturated like we can enter the game with further stable coins uh PayPal USD 27 million dollar market cap at the current time of recording 12 holders 12 total holders I don't think it's actually like live in the app yet but hey we have a contract address and we're watching 182 transfers going around in this very moment I mean PayPal has weight PayPal has size in terms of users and demand and like we don't know the tvl of PayPal but there is a number of PayPal somewhere well there is I mean when we had Jose on in the you know the public stats are 450 million active user accounts on PayPal and and think about the significance of this too PayPal really pioneered uh payments on the internet in the web you know 1.0 days before Web 2.0 right and so now here they are in crypto innovating on this front and and doing this first um this is issued by paxos it's kind of the you know the bank machine behind it paxos who are they had to give up be USC binance stablecoin and I'll pull in a Harry Potter quote for all the Harry Potter fans trading a nut for a galleon giving up binance in all of its regulatory gray areas in gaining PayPal as a as a client as a customer that's that's definitely a win that's what you call a dub so just like usdc you're going to be able to transfer PayPal US Dollars between PayPal and external wallets so that would be bankless wallets of course you could send it person to person so peer-to-peer you could fund purchases with PayPal US Dollars by by selecting it at checkout right all right so like your different you know check out using PayPal you can use this as an option and you can convert any of PayPal supported cryptocurrencies of which there are there are many now to and from PayPal US Dollars uh this definitely feels like a a big win to me there's some comments on it of course in the crypto Community this is one from saigar who says so the PayPal stablecoin contract number one is written in an extremely old version of solidity number two allows the owner to pause all transfers number three allows the owner to freeze addresses to prevent actions number four allows admins to increase the total Supply at will so centralized but transparent at least you can see all of those controls in the code what do you think here David do you think that these um these these centralization vectors are an issue for PayPal US Dollars all the properties that he just listed allows owners to pause transfers allow owners to freeze addresses allow admins to increase total Supply at will these are like table Stakes for centralized stablecoin service providers you have to have all of those functions you need to increase the supply because if you get more dollars in the bank you need to issue more stable coins of course you have to increase the supply and then in order to be compliant at all you have to also be able to pause and freeze addresses like imagine if somebody starts you know sending this money to North Korea like PayPal is going to need to do something so I don't I don't think that there's the any Pearl clutching about this this is totally expected usdc has all of these things this is why we call it a centralized stable coin it's not a decentralized stable coin it's not a crypto native asset in any way and some people are saying well as a result of that why are you crypto people celebrating David Ryan why are you so excited about this why are you even excited about this what's your response to that uh how many million accounts did you say uh it was in PayPal 450. they now they have a much more direct bridge to ethereum and going bankless that pipe is easier and more direct because of this so they can go from PayPal to ethereum to a decentralized stable coin in like five fewer steps now and and while we would like to all have the world go bankless that is a spectrum and people will choose to go as far down the bank list Journey as they would elect and some people will elect to stay in centralized stable coins and that is just fine in my opinion yeah I agree with this uh this is a step right this is slightly more just slightly more bankless than the existing status quo of dollars inside of the PayPal platform and why is it good as just what you said increases adoption so we get more private keys in the hands of more individuals there's now an off ramp we load this into your metamask wallet also this is a big normalization event I think for crypto used to be like the you know the crypto exchanges the coin bases of the world the Krakens of the world who are into kind of the stable coin business and now this is pain PayPal it doesn't get any more fintech mainstream than this uh the last point I would make is this is another example of a third party a publicly traded company actually paying gas fees on ethereum every time you pay gas fees on ethereum you make ethereum more secure uh and that cannot be understated I think economic bandwidth the value in the price of ether corresponds to Security on top of the ethereum we don't get any of those attributes and any of those wins with just a Bank coin inside of the PayPal app which is what we had today so this is not like a Panacea this is not pure decentralization we're celebrating we're celebrating one step forward uh and that's why it's exciting so stable coin transfers Ryan our number the number two most gas intensive activity on ethereum as it burns the most gas after swapping and we just saw like this table the stablecoin contract for PayPal uh they're gonna start burning plenty of ether too yeah and but also that's going to be a cost to the business you know how PayPal can turn that cost into Revenue I got an idea but why don't you tell me yours why don't they just do the thing that coinbase is showing the world that's possible and make their own Layer Two and all PayPal stablecoin transfers they can collect their own sequencer fees for hmm huh that that's a good idea a PayPal payments Network in addition to the PayPal stablecoin the one of the strategies that's hypothesized about the partnership between Circle and coinbase and the base layer 2 is to make circle USD transfers on base free and turn base into a payments Network for Circle so and also they're going to generate revenue for from that because of Layer Two why doesn't PayPal just make its own Layer Two for its own payments Network that's really smart that feels like the next step I mean yes dude you should get a job they should I should be a consultant for PayPal PayPal execs if you're hearing this David David is uh you know excited about this opportunity bringing you guys a layer too all right I also think there's another like point to all of this is with the addition of PayPal US Dollars we didn't lose any of the decentralized options we didn't lose ether as an option or die as a stable coin like those are all still options and you can still use those right if you want to use something a bit bit more decentralized so this is only adding to the option list that's why I'm personally excited this is Anthony sassano summing up his take yes PayPal's stablecoin is centralized no that doesn't make it any less cool that PayPal has a stable coin ethereum being a settlement layer for all types of value means that different types of assets will exist on the network and you get to choose which ones you want another sub point that I think is interesting here I don't think that PayPal would do this without regulatory confidence I said regulatory cover but but I mean regulatory confidence here the US government I think wants stable coins to work at least some portion of the US government does subconsciously more people subconsciously it does and and so I think that you know this this happens at an interesting time where I'd say 2023 was one of the most bearish years for for us crypto from a regulatory um front but I still think that people are massively underestimating the chances that the US government might flip bullish particularly on this stable coin issue they might look at it and say hey we need a payment rails to export the supremacy of the US dollar and this is one more step towards that the stable coin step with with PayPal of course not everyone on Capitol Hill feels this way this is Maxine Waters who says she's deeply concerned that PayPal chose this path versus the federal path and Matt Walsh makes the comment the federal path for issuing a stable coin literally doesn't exist what planet are we on so some politicians are still complaining about this even though they haven't provided a path to actually register a stable coin with them Maxine Waters being deeply concerned that PayPal is creating a stable coin while also being the person who blew a kiss to SBF is just like I forgot what lizard people are controlling this planet dude oh no I forgot about that yeah of course she's deeply cancer that does look awkward this is Mike selig crypto lawyer banking Regulators have essentially said Banks can only issue stable coins on private blockchains PayPal will issue its stablecoin on ethereum this regulatory Arbitrage has put a lot of pressure on Congress to pass a stable coin Bill ASAP the free market always wins yup one of my takes in my last article was that crypto is an Unstoppable Force but the nation state is not an immovable object and that's what we are seeing here that's a good take yeah they could definitely be influenced another stamp approval and legitimize it before long um David base ship this we're up in the base okay what is happening what do we need to know the base layer two is now live and open to everyone with a two-way Bridge so if you ever make some meme coin gains you can finally get out uh over a hundred applications and service providers are already ready to go inside of the base ecosystem and there is an nft limit so if you want to get on base in mint and nft mint base day one to join the story of bringing the world on chain that nft is available to you already over 12 000 transactions and 3 point six million dollars has happened not on base but on uniswap V3 on base yeah okay yeah uh so 155 million dollars part of the tvl of uh the the 10.5 billion dollar TV on layer twos bass owns 155 million of that all in the last 24 hours up to 159 159 uh six transactions per second yeah not at capacity so pretty good uh and so base we are going to watch the base story with great interest I think that this we will look back on and see the reason for why we had a bull market in 2024 and 2025. it's based that reason layer two's base coinbase specifically putting all of its marketing and weight behind a base layer too because they are like I said printing money on it but they are going to take ethereum layer 2 specifically base because they now have the incentive they are going to take it mainstream there was a a conference not a conference a festival uh friends with benefits Festival over in California and coinbase and base had a very significant presence there and it actually didn't really go around crypto Twitter circles because it's all like culture and music and not nerds and normal people coinbase is taking like base marketing to mainstream culture and so they're just broadcasting and advertising the ethereum role of centric roadmap on our behalf which golf club golf club this you know this is very cool this is going to be very good I think for our uh our metric that we're talking about earlier Layer Two total locked value so you you said there's already look 100 it's gone up as we've we started this episode uh almost 160 million total value locked by base right now it's cool to see them on layer 2B and if you were asking the question which you very well okay so how decentralized it's already number five damn okay and if you're asking the question how does central realize is this thing well layer 2 beat has the answer for you right it's getting there it's there's five slices of the decentralization pie that you need to turn green from red to Green for base base has two of those on Layer Two beat it needs three more so um some upgrades to State validation upgradability itself and proposal failure we need to get those to a state where they're more decentralized but you know the first step is launching a roll-up and that's what bass is doing here so the security pie that you're looking at on layer 2B that the base security pie and the optimism mainnet security pie are actually the same because bass actually is governed by the optimism Collective because it is an OP stack chain that is a part and so this is like the first chain in addition to the main net the base chain is the first chain to be formally a part of the super chain which is this thing that Meme that people are talking about which we're going to after you cover in a future this episode with Jesse and Ben from optimism but they are the first major chain to join the collective and so the base train is governed by oh the op token and so when optimism main upgrades to fill in whenever they get in their um validity proofs then all of a sudden bass will also gain validity proofs because that's how the collective works Santiago Santos has a take on this let's take a moment to appreciate the novelty of a centralized public company launching decentralized public infrastructure coinbase is a mission-driven company and will likely go down as the most impactful company who pushed crypto to mainstream 100 base is to web 3 as the iPhone was to the smartphone industry big statement wow Jesse and Brian on the coinbase podcast they have their own show now called on-chain Summer Stories because one of the they are just pushing the phrase on chain on chain on chain online on chain online on chain so let's hear about Jesse and Brian talk about their uh collaboration with the op Collective you know the collaboration we've had with optimism by the way is really incredible and we're a huge shout out to them um the collaboration has been good and it allows it's allowing us to move very quickly with this uh particular L2 solution and we hope it gets broad adoption across every kind of product out there in space yep yep and a huge plus one to that on optimism you know when we were just trying to kind of get started building an L2 we obviously uh thought about kind of how do we want to approach this and I think the the thing that was a North star for us was decentralization it's like how do we get this decentralized network incubated inside of a public company and then like fully decentralized over the next few years and as we were trying to figure out how to do that I think what we identified was having a partner having like a collaborator in doing who could kind of help lead the way on decentralization help kind of push those boundaries for us and help us figure out our path was gonna be really valuable and I think that's where optimism has really kind of uh been a great collaborator and really I think the main thing that I want to get across in this section is that Fortune 500 companies coinbase is showing them the way to becoming on chain to being on chain this is going to be the first of many just like how I said was saying hey PayPal could have its own payments Network they are showing the way for Fortune 500 companies to spin up decentralized layer twos because we have the technology in the year 2023 to get that done yeah that that is very cool and and by the way we're going to have another opportunity to sit down with with Jesse at uh permissionless which is coming right up David you're doing a panel I believe with uh Ben Jones and Jesse of bass and coinbase at uh permissionless so what are you going to talk about there yeah so probably we're going to unpack the relationship between coinbase the centralized company and the op Collective a decentralized dow that governs over the op stack there is just a ton of nuance to unpacked there and I think as a permission list is coming up we're a month away yeah one month away uh and so there's gonna be a lot of conversations about like okay but what is the super chain how do these things form together how does a decentralized organization like converse with a centralized organization lots of questions all about that and that's happening a panel that I'm moderating between Jesse Pollock and Ben Jones from optimism but that is not the only conversation I'm moderating at permissionless new this week that we just got finalized vitalik it's coming to speak at permissionless remotely uh me and vitalik are going to talk about ethereum for the future and just as a little teaser for all the people that you know for some reason are not going to Murphy's I just don't know why you wouldn't um ethereum there's plenty of use cases that we talk about who let's put Wall Street on chain let's take you know nfts and make them for Brands but what about all the future use cases that we can't imagine because we don't know the future what about the future things that ethereum the future technologies that ethereum will be a platform for so that's a conversation that a vitalik and I are going to kick off permissionless with right after Eric Voorhees and right before we have Dan grad and a few other ethereum people talk about the ethereum road map just the future use cases that we can't imagine because it's not here yet so we're going to do our best to navigate ethereum for the future and that is going to be Talk number two at permissionless grab a ticket guys the September 11th it's coming right up so get your ticket and there's a link in the show notes as always uh David we're talking earlier about base and it's kind of security pie on L2 beat actually arbitrum took a big step forward in getting one of the slices of its pie from yellow to green and becoming a bit more decentralized this is not in production yet but the plan is in place the Dow just has to vote code needs to get pushed to production and then we're good to go they are calling it arbitrum bold bold stands for bounded liquidity delay can you give us the tldr of the arbitrim release this week yeah bold basically allows the protocol to enable permissionless validation for all arbitrum chains it removes the permission validation set improves decentralization like you said validation via fraud proofs is currently permissioned in arbitrary because the protocol is vulnerable to denial of service attacks but bold is a protocol that anyone who is running arbitrum software of the operator on the infrastructure can uh is it helps that help solve that problem so a single honest validator is now has the means to win disputes against any number of evil validators we call this an N over one security model as in you just need one honest person to be participating in the network in order for the network to be honest it is the gold standard of network security if you only need one honest person to maintain the network then you can basically have as many as the strongest Assurance as possible that that network is going to going to work so that is bold in a nutshell and as soon as bold gets voted by the arbitrum Dow into mainnet gets merged then all of a sudden one little yellow Slice on layer 2B is going to turn green and arbitrum will have the most green slices out of all layer twos I think it already does but it's going to have even more Terence diet from Arboretum he tweets out a great way to explain this before bold in order to submit a fraud proof it would be terminate style and you would in order to win you have to defeat all your malicious opponents one by one by one and now we're with bold there's one gigantic fight where you have the superpower to knock out all malicious opponents at once the Royal Rumble and then you have god mode yeah exactly right you are given God mode inside of the Battle Royale yeah that's very cool uh this is uh an entire episode that we did earlier this week on Bold and arbitrim so if you want to catch that there's a link in the show notes and also on your RSS feed and even also at permissionless because oh yeah as well David what a guy coming up next coming up next what's going on with Hobie should you be concerned curve hacker returns some of the funds with a cheeky message and Michael sold some more CRV to pay back his on-chain loan is Michael the founder of curve gonna make it and then a judge rejects Ripple's ruling precedent in Nate in the terraform Labs case we're going to unpack all of that and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask portfolio I know you use metamask Bank list listener so therefore you have metamask portfolio

Technologies mantle formerly known as bit doubt is the first dao-led web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built differently from the other layer twos that you may be familiar with mantle asks the question how would you build a layer 2 if you had a technology of 2023 mantle network is a modular layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 compared to other layer tubes but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for mantle to Applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries in default which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web 3 space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of mantle like game 7 for web free gaming or edu Dow from the world of DSi and and buy bit for TPL and liquidity and on-ramps so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle polygon and zksync had a bit of a scuffle this week over crypto Twitter primarily but is Spilled Out into other channels uh David give us the scope what happened yeah so polygon ZK sync two creators of the ZK evm probably the the two most Frontier creators of DK EVMS had a scuffle over attribution about whose code was who so polygon wrote this blog post called protecting the open source ethos which is tldr copy pasting copy and pasting source code without attribution and making misleading claims about the original work is against the open source ethos and Hertz the ecosystem in the world of Open Source there are like these rules of engage engagement for citing open source work and polygon is saying that ZK sync did not follow those Rules of Engagement and did not provide proper attributions when ZK sync borrowed some of polygons code that they created and so that is the claim from polygon about Z case Inc and then zksync of course has a response from Alex glukowski on Twitter saying we actually did all of these attributions uh polygon just didn't feel like they were satisfactory and then started making citations about when but they were using their own code versus plancky 2's code which is polygons it was it was a fight of who owes who credit uh and it elevated and got into the world of front-facing crypto Twitter most of this stuff most of these fights happen you know just between these two organizations behind closed doors but it surfaced and got into quote unquote the real world that's the that's the tldr a bit of drama huh um you know the kids are going to fight I think that's that's what this looks like so this is a little spicier in the layer two War space and I would have enjoyed all the other Layer Two Wars has been pretty fun this one was a little bit it was too spicy yeah a little bit of a downer a little bit I don't think mainstream is paying attention to this at all this is very much an internal it is a question of like legitimacy right that is the big question here well I'm happy to leave that one in the rearview mirror so moving on uh speaking for every mirror actually last week curve was a big subject on the roll up and particularly is curve going to make it was CRV and some of Michael's the um the founder of curve were some of his positions on uh on lending and borrowing protocols going to be liquidated would that cause a Cascade that would be bad for those protocols and bad for defy in General David this week it's looking like Michael is gonna make it he's gonna make it yeah maybe what happened this week barring any sort of further Black Swan events which I would consider as why Michael was under dress in the first place it was a Black Swan event of the days day one bug in Viper so first an exploiter returned some of the stolen funds from alchemics so 4820 alchemics ether was returned as well as 2258 actual ether which is about 15 of the total losses in the curve exploit and then Michael as well also sold 75 72 million CRV to 15 entities to generate 42 million dollars to pay back some of his loans and so some good news Michael's positions are becoming more secure the curve exploiter is returning some of the stolen funds I think one of the funny things is that in the trend transaction in the call in the data for the transaction the exploiter wrote this message saying I saw some ridiculous views so I want to clarify that I'm refunding you not because I think you can find me it's because I don't want to ruin your project maybe it's a lot of money for a lot of people but not for me I'm smarter than all of you it's what the exploiter said yeah what a dick yeah wow so curve Finance has extended a bug bounty to offer anyone who's able to identify the exploiter 1.85 million dollars and so if you know who the exploiter is you can get paid 1.85 million dollars but the curve exporter is saying you can't find me Nina Nina boo-boo [Laughter] it seems like the the curve trauma is is sort of over though is curved price recovering Michael's not going to get liquidated Michael's probably not it's like he's gonna make it he's probably fine whether the I mean the curve price is definitely hurt but it's not it's definitely it's definitely still alive it's doing just fine there's a comment a summary from Michael Bentley from Euler who says this if there's one thing that's clear from recent events Dow governance of lending protocols is not a great idea most people are simply not qualified in possession of sufficient information to determine appropriate risk parameters and complex protocols whose risks evolve in time I should say Michael from Euler of course has a lending and borrowing protocol that does not require governance of this type but I think he's making the commentary on some of the governance decisions in protocols like Ave that allowed so much curve to actually be deposited into their protocol there was votes about this we talked about this last week and the votes passed even though the CRV deposited was kind of very clearly owned the vast bulk of it owned by one individual there's some you know risk issues that that fell out of that do you think that's a fair take from this uh this entire episode I'm yeah I'm glad you asked because I actually think that governance free Protocols are a very core component of the bank list thesis of the protocol sync thesis if we can do all of our decentralized financial activities without governance then we ought to governance I've always thought is like a stop Gap means to an end and it's exactly what happened with Ave where Gauntlet submitted a governance proposal saying hey there's risk here you guys should take care of this and Avi was like no vote no 100 to zero and then exactly what uh Gauntlet feared what happened would happen and like I talk we talk about the Federal Reserve and their human control over the economy all the time and then we juxtapose that with ethereum and its algorithmic balance seeing Dynamic monetary policy and we applaud ether and I think we should do the same for all of our governance applications should be looking to minimize governance as much as possible that's my articulation of the bankless thesis I don't know if you agree yeah no I totally agree that like governance is sort of a hack but sometimes it's necessary like sometimes we really need it and sometimes you need it for kind of scalability I mean how could you do real world assets without that sort of governance and so I also think that governance will level up over time so now in Ave another lending and borrowing protocols they'll see where this went awry maybe they won't make the same mistake in the future so long as they have skin in the game that that that I think is the the main point and um right so it's kind of different than than the FED who actually I mean what are they what do they care about the decisions they make um Ave holders are being stuck with the bag and the FED can do whatever it wants that's a good point um this is interesting David Phantom is exploring adding optimistic Roll-Ups to connect to ethereum all right you're laughing why are you laughing oh it's because the L2 thesis man dude there are just like I was sitting and reflecting upon this agenda and just over the last few weeks there are some bankless Theses that we have put forth that are coming true in the best of Fashions like it was one thing when the cello organization voted to move to a layer two but now Phantom also looking at this and like oh we could become a layer two and now if there's a meme that when you see memes about this stuff you start you know that it is becoming deeply solidified in people's mind share what we are looking at is somebody has made a bingo card of all of the of the layer ones that could potentially become layer twos like some things you probably haven't thought about in a long time Iota EOS V chain flow flux Canto eth classic would be hilarious never do it you think so yeah probably not near near might Tron probably not anyways we have cello and Phantom so we have one two three four five five five twenty five I actually think Tron might David I could totally see Justin's on doing that maybe yeah actually that's a good point Okay so we've got 25 squares with 25 layer ones two of November turned green because of cello and Phantom well Phantom actually has to do it so maybe we're at one and a half but this has been a bankless thesis for so long and and I'm just uh I just sit back and be like sometimes Theses just play out exactly how you expect that is David there's David Hoffman Victory lap I am Victory lapping so well I think I do think this is a narrative to watch right is um which side chain evam side chain is going to become a roll up next and that's what this is kind of articulating uh this is a tweet from Sam CZ Sun who's kind of the savior of crypto it's a a white hat and a white hat yeah white hat of white hat that you know finds our issues before they happen uh in most cases over the past few days I've been working with a group of white hats Auditors and other Security leaders to try and solve the hardest part of responsible disclosure finding the right person to talk to and he's got a uh an image of the bat signal here um what's the take for this why are we including this in the agenda so this is a telegram bot is basically what's going on so there's a telegram bot that anyone can use during emergencies to get in touch with trusted members of the security white hat community so trusted white hat hackers and their extensive network of contacts it's basically 911 for D5 protocols um it's it's it yeah I actually think I'm so proud of Sam obviously he doesn't need to be any Yes except it shows it is an example of self-regulation and self-management of this own industry not only is it a public good but it is also a sign of maturity for what needs to happen if we are also going to have permissionless yeah I don't think we can make that point enough honestly it's like The Regulators look in and say crypto is completely unregulated and the crypto markets aren't doing anything about it and then I look at things like this it's like no we're we are doing exactly what you should be you would never be able to do you know what and I also look at uh you know it's another example of this is L2 freaking beat okay this is very better than anything the SEC is or cftc has ever put forward for disclosures in crypto is creating a staging process for how decentralized our layer twos are right and creating a scoring map that is the industry regulating itself and I think that should be commended uh so very cool to see uh Sam CZ doing that David this is also cool nearly three million dollars in sales in the last 24 hours for DraftKings nfts I guess the theme this week is companies buying block space and using crypto right so this is DraftKings you know DraftKings is a um it's a fantasy sports sports industry Sports they're in the sport yeah sports fantasy betting do you know this is a let me show you a stock have you ever oh it's a public company wow it's a public company DraftKings it's worth about two billion dollars uh something like this 12. 13 billion dollars 13. no 13 billion dollars two million in Revenue uh so 2 billion in Revenue last year 13 billion dollars sorry I'm a little a little rusty on uh financials yeah and uh they were um according to Sandeep here they were the number one collection by sales volume on polygons they beat board Apes they beat a lot of other things so they beat boarded on the ethereum layer one three million dollars in sales on polygon which is the number one of sales across the nft industry in the last week crazy yeah right yeah and I don't even know about this because I don't I pay no attention yeah I don't watch sports it's very cool to see that that's bleeding outside of crypto culture though um but going back to crypto culture what's this from uh Frank to Gods yeah so polygon gets a dub but then also polygon takes an L Utes gets heated from polygon to ethereum so Utes is two d-gods like mutant Apes R2 board Apes basically the derivative project same team uh uses like the expansion collection um D Gods Utes they were a big nft hit on Solana before migrating to polygon we actually had um Frank from the gods on the show to talk about this after moving from polygon uh from moving from Solana to polygon as the bear Market wore on uh economy shriveled up including the Solana ecosystem so polygon gave a three million dollar Grant to Utes to migrate to polygons specifically so fast forward to today deacons has done well on ether layer one and it actually has given the D Gods Utes eat Ute y00ts team Utes it's giving them confidence that they actually can be a blue chip nft on the ethereum layer one they actually don't need polygon so they are migrating from polygon to the ethereum layer one they're also returning the three million dollar Grant to polygon as well uh and so that's the news so from Solana to polygon to ethereum that sounds like just a pure business decision to me what do you think yeah that's right well it also shows the gravity well that is the ethereum layer one so like if the the the goal of all high value assets is to be on the ethereum layer one David uh did you see this this clip this is a Joe Biden clip you ready for this ah it's drinking coffee look looks mug look at his mug I like my coffee dark what is that what's on his Vlog Dave for the podcast listeners he is drinking a mug of Joe Biden's bust 2024 with some glowing deep red laser eyes laser eyes laser Bitcoin Bitcoin laser eyes wow where did that commentary yeah I I don't think it's related I don't think it's really unfortunately David even though there was some hope or speculation I think this is a different meme from a different corner of the internet that uh crossed into uh into crypto for a brief moment here it's like a dark Brandon meme I think that his campaign is using let's not it's nothing to do with Bitcoins all right well let's try to unpack this a little bit even though we don't know too many details is Kobe insolvent that is a centralized exchange I believe they are based in China uh and a fairly large one at least like you know at some point in time is top five I'm not sure where they stood right now but there's some questions around around its solvency what do we know so far yeah so some Financial media organizations in Hong Kong have reported that several Executives at Huawei have been taken away by police in China a spokesperson for huobi denied this um who will be stablecoin exchange balances dipped by 33 so they lost a third of stable coins um so almost 50 million dollars has been withdrawn from Kobe I'm pretty sure I remember this story happening like two years ago exactly as written as with Ryobi with huobi yeah rumors of who will be insolvency Executives taken away by Chinese government and then nothing happened and so what do you think no is that is another I don't know I don't know I don't know all right well don't keep your funds on centralized exchanges kids it's another reminder David you'll never guess this headline with AI booming Gary Gensler wants to keep Finance safe for humans the head of the SEC is focused on the risk to markets and investors when AI is making trades and recommendations David this is Gary Gensler he is pivoting from crypto to AI great great yeah keep on focusing on AI I I think this just like this is the Emperor is wearing no clothes and it proves it it's just like Gary Gensler it's just Trend following as the influencer that he is and now he's focused on AI because AI is totally going to disrupt Securities markets like crypto he actually has some like some Foundation to stand on because these are these are Financial assets what is going on in the AI Market that needs scary guns so you think he's just uh fear chasing just narrative chasing yeah he's in he's being an influencer yeah so Gary is going to say like I can't next year he's gonna or next week he's gonna rotate to semiconductors it's gonna be great I can't think of anybody who actually wants him to do this like what is he how is he going to keep gear keep Finance safe for humans in the world of AI Rogue human like what practically does that even mean speaking of weird headlines in FTX lobbyists tried to buy a Pacific island called nehru in order to create a new super species what this was a species yeah the younger brother of Sam bankman freed his name is gay bankman freed and he tried to buy an island to create a new super species of human beings genetically modified human beings is this even real like what is going on okay so this is called the transhumanist movement uh it's not actually all that cringe except when you pair it with SBF and all the effective altruism groups and all so all the wealth that they have then it starts to get really weird so yeah he wanted to buy an island to create a fortified a complex apocalypse bunker state in the event where 50 to 99.9 of people die for some sort of reason to protect his philanthropic allies and create a Genetically Enhanced human human species this is the headline that we are reading to you wow uh yeah I don't know what to say I'm sorry you don't have you that you don't have to say anything we can just let the headline stand on the zone and move on please David this was a really cool demo this week um I feel like this is a major unlock for wallets Goldfinch wallet this is uh their unipig moment do you know what I'm talking about when I say unipeg moment I do I bet you about um 80 of bankless listeners does not okay what what was unipig unipig was the demo between optimism and uni Swap and it was a the first iteration of an optimistic roll-up deployed to ethereum that was just meant to have be a uniswap application so back before we knew about layer twos in the way that we know them now it was the first implementation of layer twos and it was like everyone was having this like Breakthrough aha moment when after being used to uniswap on the ethereum layer one they used uni Pig which was a unit swap Fork on an optimistic roll-up very early version of optimism as a layer two and everyone realized that oh it's Roll-Ups Roll-Ups are where it's at it was a breakthrough it was a breakthrough demo and we were still years from getting uh Roll-Ups to mainnet but everyone this was 20. everyone who saw this yeah we were like oh okay this is how ethereum is going to scale yeah so I saw something similar when I saw this demo um this is a wallet demo you can access it at D5 for the world and basically in about like 15 seconds you can open up a wallet with no seed phrase biometric signing as well so it works on your phone kind of you know face scan it's self-custody okay so private key accessible there are some compromises on it but like it just felt so easy to use and set up oh I should mention full account abstraction so gasless transactions and deployed on base deployed on the player two as well right so this is the diagram of of how it works there's a you know a web standard that's commonly used it's called passcode that can you know use the secure Enclave of your phone every phone has a secure Enclave that is authenticated via you know pin number or biometric access uh you know ID face ID and then the private keys are actually stored inside of a third party called TurnKey that's probably the point of weakness for me but TurnKey has a really interesting uh component anyway this this another third party called zero Dev bundles this up and makes um account abstraction work and the whole experience is you get a wallet in about like five seconds and it feels very fintech the most dangerous wallet possible inside of inside of five seconds I would say so right um there's a few weak points maybe but I would say so and what's exciting to me and why this is comparable to the unipic moment for me is like okay now I see the future the big next step for crypto is we have to make wallet ux easy if we're going to get to a billion users and they're not going to use some centralized exchange or service we have to make this whole process of setting up a wallet and holding your own private Keys very easy and this was a big step towards accomplishing that so really cool exciting demo another paired announcement TurnKey which is what we were talking about that powers this whole thing it's out of private beta and is now available for people to play with no widgets no pre-built generic ux's no limits on what you can create there's a link in the show notes to get to get started TurnKey if you so choose perhaps this is the Cambrian explosion of wallets going into web 2. moving on to Zora Zora has introduced protocol rewards on-chain rewards for creators and devs possible by zores of mint fee which now automatically splits across creators and developers all right getting into raises of the week and we've made a decision in the template for the bankless weekly roll up and so we're gonna articulate what we are going to do with the raises section we've had trouble in Times deciding which races to talk about and which races to not talk about because we didn't really have a standard for making this concrete so here's what we're going to do going forward any big raises that like reverberate throughout the crypto ecosystem that is like news we will talk about and then we are also going to include anything that banklets Ventures is investing in so as a Inception of the moment of a conflict of interest whenever bankless Ventures our VC company our VC firm invest in something we will also include it in the raises so big raises that become larger enough to be news and then also the moment of inception of a conflict of interest about when bankless Ventures invested in something yeah so this week there were really no big raises that were on our radar so normally we would skip this section but there was a bankless ventures investment this week puffer Finance they just raised a 5.5 million dollar seed bankless Ventures was part of that David why do we invest in puffer and so puffer is a LSD protocol in joining the ranks of like Lido rocket pool stator Diva swell and so it is going to have an LSD it is different from all of these it's got this one unique differentiator that I think really sealed the deal for me personally which is inclusion of trusted execution environments inside of the LSD ecosystem and so trusted execution environments it's this primitive that are a part of just chips and Hardware that puffer is incorporating into their LSD and so things like scroll and eigenlayer that need trusted execution Services can have those Services specific typically enabled by puffer and allows for the puffer LSD to get extra yield by providing tee to the ethereum ecosystem sriram from eigenlayer is an angel investor as well as a member of Obel which is also a perhaps a user of tee and so that competitive advantage of te as a service is What attracted me to and and bankless Ventures to this deal yeah congrats to puffer on that race we got a lot more coming up next including some questions from the Nation eth versus layer 2 token value capture we're talking about that again in some hot takes from crypto Twitter including why the Bitcoin ETF is a bigger deal than you might think as always make sure you like And subscribe if you appreciate the content we'll be right back introducing polygon 2.0 the value layer for the internet for too long the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifled user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging groundbreaking ZK Innovations such as polygon ZK evm the next iteration of the Best in Class plonky 2 proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer polygon 2.0 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity right now there is a polygon Improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake if approved polygon proof of stake would become a layer 2 ZK evm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves are you planning to launch a token is your token already

bank list or click the link in the description below questions from the nation this week this one from C yogi.eath is there a reason to think that implementation of massively lower cost l2s won't tank the demand for the use of ether which is one of its pricing factors and what do you think about that we get all this cheap block space on Layer Two does that tank the price of ether yeah so this is the conversation of our layer twos our ethereum Layer Two is parasitic to Ether and the answer is yes and no but I would definitely say mostly no and I think we saw this in the episode we're going to talk about Utes migrating from Solana to polygon to the ethereum layer one while polygon does pull tvl from the ethereum layer 1 to polygon or any layer 2 does this also ethereum itself is its own gravitational pull for liquidity so there it's it's a yes and conversation uh ethereum layer one is going to have the most Central liquidity in all of its own landscape and so the massively lower cost of layer twos are going to actually induce new transaction types new types of economies that require low transaction fees whereas the ethereum layer one is going to be the epicenter of liquidity and high value transactions and so I always have said that layer twos will actually induce net new economic activity rather than being more parasitic to the ethereum layer one but then also eth will become money inside of all of these networks and so the the way the way that layer 2 economics works is that ether it sacrifices the value of the transaction economy the value of transactions you know gas fees to the layer 2 tokens inside of each respective Layer Two but it wins a pluralist network economy that all these networks use ether as its Reserve currency so in order to give room for these layer twos to exist it gives up the transaction economy the gas fee economy to the layer two tokens but it wins another Network that uses ether as money and to follow through on this on this thread I put out a tweet this week last bull market ether was money only for ethereum this bull market ether will be the money for the majority of chains for polygon for arbitrome for optimism for Bass and then I finished with saying this cycle each becomes money for the internet is my bull take of the week yeah I think that's right I would add this take from sudo L2 business models are actually really simple layer 2 fees minus layer one settlement Cost Plus verification equals profit layer twos are really value-added resellers of layer one blockspeed I don't think they're any more competitive than states are competitive with the federal government in this world of course there's always that one stake who could get really really really really really big and uh then threaten to secede from the federal government um but I don't think we're there yet and as always the US dollar and the kind of the United States becomes the currency of all of its respective States uh in the union so that's that's how I expect that'll play out hey we got some takes of the week this is the first one from David Bailey it's not just the insane flows the ETF is truly the definitive integration into our financial system you can own ETF shares tax-free in your IRA your bank will recognize ETF shares when you apply for a mortgage you can borrow against ETF shares you can margin ETF shares you can lend out your shares and gain yields if 100 billion flows into the ETF next cycle and the price of Bitcoin is 10x one trillion dollars of ETF wealth will cause trillions of new credit within the financial system tens of millions of Americans will see their assets balloon in value this is really the bull case I think for the ETF which is the Bitcoin ETF which I still am holding I think it happens this year or shortly after but I'll say this year is a shortcut we will get a Bitcoin spot ETF that represents after how long has Bitcoin been in existence 12 years 13 years okay that represents thirteen fourteen fourteen thirteen okay so close to that third that represents financial integration into the traditional system which is absolutely crazy that we've come here like gotten this far in just over a decade the ETF will be an absolute massive win and I think we're on the cusp of it I think to put this into language that I think bankless listeners will be familiar with the ETF is a money Lego that is very important for getting Bitcoin into Trad fi so that it can go in margin accounts and it can go in yield accounts and it can just be expressed in tradfi and so it creates induces a ton of reservation demand for Bitcoin it is the building block that we need for Bitcoin to be incorporated in tradpy yeah um this is a take from dankrad PSA if it doesn't use ethereum for data availability it's not an ethereum roll-up and therefore it's not an ethereum player too wow that's a spicy tank rad the hardliner all right there's some uh back and forth a lot of commentary sort of debating that right and this goes to what's the definition of a layer two and what's the definition of a roll-up and I think we're playing kind of like uh games of uh words in games of definition which by the way is not a bad game to play I think we need to be precise in our language and in our definition so think dankrad is making the case that it can only be called a layer two and or an ethereum roll-up if it does two things one consensus on ethereum which is of course based but also data availability layer on ethereum okay so that would cut out a class of what some people would call Roll-Ups called validiums which they you know Park their consensus data on ethereum but data availability it could be somewhere else you know arbitrim Nova is an example of this you know a middle able has lots of versions of this there's all sorts of uh you know the polygon proof of stake system is moving more towards a validium type of architecture so it's really a question of what gets it to call itself a layer two or an ethereum road map and dank grad here saying unless the data availability is on ethereum it's not a roll-up at least according to him what's your take on this I think I think that's right yeah so we have ethereum Roll-Ups and then we have Roll-Ups and both can both can hook into the ethereum layer one but dank red is saying in order to be a roll-up that is an ethereum roll up you must use ethereum data availability and so he he's like presenting the hardliner argument for how you legitimately call yourself an ethereum roll-up but then it's leaving room for non-etherium Roll-Ups to still settle to the ethereum layer one you just use a different data availability solution like eigenlayer data availability it does yeah because eip4844 is used allowing ethereum block space which is the most pristine World War III resistant block space in existence to be allowed for layer twos and so if they want to use it's supposed to say like hey you can use this and have the best insurances it's still going to be the most expensive version of data availability even if it's a hundred times cheaper than it already is today because you can also just use like a self-run database and that will be even cheaper for you and so there's always there's going to be a different different ways to use data and Dan Craig is saying well if you want to be the gold standard which is ethereum you need to use eip4844 you need to use ethereum and if you don't use the gold standard then you don't get to use the ethereum brand as your roll-up name which is not out yet by the way eip484 it's not it's not available yet but it will be soon um yeah I I could see that I think for myself until this is sort of the dust settles with what the you know the community decides is you know kind of how we're going to name these things I'm going to start being a bit more deliberate and talking about an ethereum roll-up versus a validium right uh David you gotta take here I'll read it out the chapter of 2021 to 2022 scammers is coming to a close but our 2024 to 2025 chapter of scammers is about to begin oh that doesn't sound good David those who would harm this industry walk among us today let's not repeat 2022 let's stay vigilant the SEC and mainstream media aren't going to help us it's up to us Uncle Sam picture pointing at us David are you uh charging us with some responsibility during the next bull market almost always am I charging people with responsibility so this is just a continuation of my take from last week about dokwan Alex wassinsky SBF three hours Capital Richard Hart all going to jail or being fined in some respective way so we get to celebrate about that but also reminder bull markets attract grifters and so if we are going to enjoy a bull market we need to also be aware that it is going to attract grifters and is going to bring us a new cohort of scammers and so we should be cognizant about how that is also going to happen and take our lessons of 2021 and 2022 forward so that we can be better in the future that's a good take uh what do you bullish on this week man both on the op stack man I've been bullish on the op staff for a while the I made the op Stack video about like what the op stack is and why I think it's exciting in November of 2022 and this was after I wrote my evm equivalence article this is my second uh Victory lap of the week of the episode per week okay I I first I just like am so proud of the optimism team for having the conviction and the vision that they had from day one one of the original things that they wanted to do is connect transaction ordering to public goods sequencer fees to funding public goods uh raw degeneracy and moloch turning into ethereum's Phoenix and funding sustainable open source projects that can scale out to the world and this they've had the same convicted thesis from the gecko and now coinbase a public company in crypto launching a layer two using the op stack which is meant to be forked and meant to be iterated on and meant to be spawning ten thousand chains all of a sudden they're creating the op Collective which is going to have weight and bargaining power for public goods and it's going to be financed by the op's people forking the op stack and wanting to join that Collective it took such strong vision and execution back in 2018 2019 when the optimism team came together out of the plasma group and they've just followed through on it and I think fantastic sense and and it I just it's beautiful when you see a plan come together and also a plan that I think just goes so deep to the values of ethereum and scaling ethereum values it's just nice to see it's just nice to see what I consider to be the good guys take a huge dub and so just big clap to the optimism team it all started with unipig didn't it yeah uh yeah very cool I I think the thing I'm bullish on is um is similar but also broader which is this I'm bullish on all layer twos in particular this um this really crafty approach I feel like ethereum the ethereum community and ethereum Foundation had with respect to layer twos this is an episode that's not out yet but I got pre-listened uh access from our pod squad team and thank you for recording it David which are you talking about the Sci-Fi roadmap for ethereum with uh Justin Drake Drake and Tim Baco um by the way I haven't finished it yet but I can't wait to go back to it's not an RSS feed I'm gonna do this weird you know Google Drive anyway um so I'm I'm listening to it and then Justin Drake is is describing basically layer twos and what's incredible to me is when he talks about how layer choose are basically funded massively funded by investor dollars by VC dollars and this is the private Market taking the execution layer for ethereum and launching like 50 different incredible experiences experiments on it and then accelerating those experiments so fast because they have all of these disparate teams and all of this this this Capital going and attacking the problem at once and it just struck me as he was talking about how genius's strategy this was for this particular layer of the stack you focus on consensus for ethereum and then you watch like you know a hundred private company type of experiments on top and some of these might be able to turn into into public goods as well and then what ethereum plans to do is take the best designs and the best experiments and enshrine them in an enshrined roll-up inside of ethereum and so make the best projects like private company projects kind of public infrastructure again anyway it's it didn't have to be the case this was not the original strategy for ethereum ethereum originally was going to develop everything and this strategy this play worked out very well and uh yeah I'm I'm very bullish on everything that's going on in kind of the layer two ecosystem as a result yeah that episode comes out next week there we go David we got a meme of the week what are we looking at right here meme of the week this is coming on uh from uh David Phelps uh he goes every crypto company's pitch deck right now and he's got a uh two by two uh grid here and one has been one one spectrum is has not been hacked and has been hacked and also is in jail or is not in jail and all of our companies competitors have either been hacked or are in jail but this company the one you're getting pitched Bank was listening our company is both not in jail and has not been hacked that's all you need where do I send my money you're still standing oh God our standards are on the floor yeah that is the game though you just gotta survive for sure gonna end with our standard risks and disclaimers in a minute but first we disclose on the show today we mentioned a few projects that David and I are advisors for including some of the layer twos like optimism and polygon and ZK sync I am also an investor in Zora a small Angel check and both David and I as always we hold a whole bunch of eth we are long-term investors not journalists we don't do paid content and there's a link to bankless disclosures in the show notes and of course gotta let you know none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot foreign [Music]
