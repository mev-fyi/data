and this is a 36 hour long Endeavor of people trying to figure out reading spft leaves is what the hell he is doing with this tweet thread while he does this David Beckley station happy third week of November David what time is it oh Ryan it's the Friday bankless weekly roll up and Ryan I have never been so intimidated by an agenda that we have to get through today yeah is it the content or the length it's a little bit of both definitely the content the craziness of the content yet Ryan we persevere into the frontier nonetheless you know what happens when you plug in Bank lists and Twitter in the search box right now oh my God thankless crying he's number one how you feeling this week David I'm feeling a bit better uh yeah yeah yeah um if the theme last week for you was like this sucks I'm disappointed what's the theme this week what's David Hoffman feeling like uh the theme this week I think is good riddance yeah uh covered in sport sure and like because this is turning out to not just be like oh another drama in the crypto world no this is like one of the greatest frauds of all time yeah and I think it Like For Better or Worse like we're going to be able to like move forward from this in a progressive way so my yeah if there's a theme of the week it's good riddance well uh you gotta admit when SPF does something he does it big he goes all out not only the the number two exchange uh but also maybe the number one fraud of all time settles but topics of the week we're going to be talking about three things number one SPF number two FTX number three Alameda I mean pretty much the agenda right that's that's the whole thing there are some other things that happen this week but we're gonna have to wait until the second half of the episode to hear hear all the normal things that went on and the high level is the fraud that is SBF continues to get to get bigger this is kind of Enron this is theranos this is Bernie Madoff we got it all a little bit of it all so we're going to talk a little bit about how bad the contagion was David before we get into the episode we have a message from our friends and sponsors at infuria and I think there's really good news coming out of infuria because we need to build this entire space on decentralized Rails this is what we've we've learned here again recently it's been reinforced and infuria is taking a big step towards that what are they up to so infuria is calling for all web 3 infrastructure providers who are interested in being a part of this new decentralized infrastructure Network that infuria wants to lead so they need help they need you to help Foster their decentralized infrastructure ecosystem because they are working on decentralizing a very important part of the ethereum stack the RPC endpoints the nodes and all of this stuff and so this is a this is a pretty big centralization Vector of ethereum and overall any chain how user wallets and just broadcast transactions and spinning up nodes and so this has always been a part A A moderate problem in the ethereum ecosystem and inferior is tackling that centralization problem head on and also needs help decentralizing their own stack and they want you to take a part in that so there's a link in the show notes banklist.cc slash inferior for you to sign up for the for the Early Access of their new decentralized network infrastructure so go do that go click that link yeah it's really cool we all use inferior um yeah behind metamask behind a lot of the wallets that we use not the only one but it's one of the larger ones for sure all right David let's get to the markets Bitcoin what are we looking at on the week after this two-week disaster here yeah Bitcoin is down on the week down 5 17 50 or 17 000 500 down five percent to where it is now at sixteen thousand six hundred dollars uh cool we expected it down how about youth uh down again eight percent down eight percent uh so Bitcoin down five percent each down eight percent ether start of the week at thirteen twenty currently at twelve seventy twelve seventy you know what's that right nope it's down 12 to uh 12 10. my numbers are all okay 12 but 12 10 12 70. it's been hovering around twelve hundred yeah I actually am surprised that it's as high as it is yeah some people are saying oh that's low right like no this given what just happened yeah like the nuclear bomb that just detonated in crypto and we're in the 1200 range um I don't know if that makes me weirdly bullish yeah it's like it doesn't seem to want to go down anymore is this down resistance maybe we'll talk a little bit about why that is when we get to some of Chris berninski's takes but um Park that in your mind thankless listener why is eth not down more than um you know then you might think it should be given the sentiment yes by the time you hear this we'll have triple digit I'm sure tomorrow morning um eat Bitcoin what are we looking at in the ratio and ratio is down just a little bit is down from .075 to 0.072 there we go crypto market cap down down from 920 billion to 860 billion surprise 360. do you remember the lows of well what the highs of the last uh bull market the highs of last oh the 2017 bull market yeah yeah it looks like it's kind of we're a little bit above that right now but the highs of the last in January 2018 we're about uh 760 billion dollars and we're just above the highs but not very much above the highs uh that's interesting to take note of uh David let's do some takes on the crypto markets right now um first maybe a quick scan by Bitcoin miners I don't think very often about Bitcoin miners but they're in a lot of pain right now what's uh this tweet showing us yeah so this is a tweet that's showing a new metric that this guy created uh he says a free open source indicator which tracks on-chain data to highlight when Bitcoin miners are selling more of their reserves than usual so I'm guessing the inputs to this indicator are the Bitcoin price and probably average uh electrical cost to produce in single Bitcoin and according to this indicator we are bad it's bad uh so they're not profitable they're Bitcoin miners are making less uh underwater in terms of Revenue a significant percentage of them I mean this is just like kind of a global average but it's basically saying that like it's really hard to be a profitable Bitcoin miner right now so they are running on reserves which means they are selling I've always wondered about this like so if you're bullish on bitcoin like the asset itself why would you try to get exposure in Bitcoin mining facilities and Bitcoin mining companies why would that make sense relative to just like purchasing Bitcoin OTC yeah because a single Asic in theory a single Asic is meant to be like a discount on a Bitcoin over the long term so if you buy an Asic it's like you if you spend like a hundred dollars on an Asic you get like a hundred and fifty dollars worth of bitcoin over the long term but a ton of variables go into that uh so but do you though you have energy costs you have like um you know Asic um obsolescence degradation uh there's all sorts of other things anyway uh I've not understood it but I'm not in that space what is uh Dylan LeClaire showing us on bitcoin miners what's this chart yeah these are just like the equity prices of all these Bitcoin mining companies uh negative negative 10 negative nine percent negative six percent negative 13 negative it's like publicly traded companies publicly trading Bitcoin minor companies yeah all down bad all day right iron Ben F Mara hunt estig Hive interesting uh bernitsky's take on the bottom all right give us some context for berninski because I know you had a conversation with him um a little bit earlier in the week on Twitter which actually the entire conversation I think it's like a 30 40 minute long conversation yeah 50 minutes 50 minutes is available to bankless premium members right now on the RSS feed we're not releasing that to the the regular RSS feed um Chris wanted to keep that a little more private so just bankless premium members only have access to that and David I haven't listened to it yet but you're missing out man you're missing no no I'm not going to be because I I'm scheduling this for my weekend I'm going to be listening because you know why relaxes well well it's probably relaxing because I I think Chris is flipped bullish is my uh understanding my sentiment and I just want to provide some context for for this individual first of all this is the individual probably second to crit to Andreas Antonopoulos but I actually count him first they got me into crypto I read his original book on crypto assets what did he publish that 2016 2017 something like this got me really excited about the world Beyond Bitcoin uh not only that Chris uh he's a VC he's got ethics that I align with in this space I respect him a lot um he developed a lot of the original kind of on-chain analysis that we see today and others have carried that forward further so he's got that piece then he's a VC but but somehow he finds a way to like um call the markets fairly well and he does it in a different way not as like a Trader so different than an Arthur Hayes all right much much different than somebody doing ta uh he does it based on kind of long-term I don't know uh fundamentals it's this mix of a thesis fundamentals and actually like observing the space and he has has been bearish on crypto for like over a year he turned bearish sometime after May of 2021 and he was bearish and he was bearish even as like we hit new all-time highs and he was like saying this is It's too contrary yeah he was very big big yeah a big contrarian uh and he in my opinion has just been proven right in fantastic fashion well he was the anti-super cycle you know there's this whole like super cycle crypto assets never gonna go fully down again no that's BS and he actually got more and more um I don't say shrill about it but like loud about it to the extent that um others in the space just start like in some of the last circles that uh I hang out with started to get annoyed at him why is Chris always uh bearing just like the bear uh Chris bearish again yeah I was not annoyed by that at all it's just like it's his take and I know Chris is not like thinking he's trying to manipulate markets here right he's not just um I think think he actually believes it anyway give us the context for the tweet that we're looking at and what Chris's take on the markets is right now yeah so Chris treats out it may be a crawl upwards but I still think the capitulation bottom is in and so as a result of all of this FTX drama as a result of all the liquidations Chris is saying that that was the signal that he's been looking for to confirm to him that the bottom is in uh and uh I remember him tweeting out after the three arrows Capital liquidation and that event and he tweeted out something along along the lines of the the Lehman of crypto is out there lingering I was like in that in my mind I was like ah Chris is being bearish again well yeah it's like how can we go down even more than that Chris uh and then but he called it man he called it just off of his gut instincts as there's literally a lemon out there yeah there's and there was literally a Lehman out there it was three it was uh FTX and Alameda they just found a creative way to plug the whole temporary rarely but that Lehman has been discovered we are now dealing with that contagion and now Chris is one of the conversations that we had in the uh as a Twitter spaces was that he just can't find any more big sellers um Genesis is the one that comes to mind in the moment uh but we are watching that play out as we speak uh and so particularly and I I again I'm just uh I haven't listened to the episode so you correct me if I'm wrong but I'm particularly he probably means the large cap assets that don't have unlocks like Bitcoins yeah Bitcoin who's gonna sell what he means Bitcoin and eth at this point yeah and so just to kind of preview the conversation with him he talked a lot about like these indicators that he uses uh and uh I'll actually not tease I'll not say which ones those are so you have to read the article that comes out of bank list today but like Bitcoin indicators oh we're doing an article on this too yes it should also come out as an article on the newsletter yeah uh in comparing and contrasting the turning points of the last bear market like whatever four sellers we have last but then also like we talked about the crypto markets showing strength we talked about like the merge and how like The Ether price is uh up 50 from the May lows where Bitcoin is down 10 uh and we talked about like how he's calling the bottom on on crypto also with equities uh so equities are down 80 a comparable amount to the.com bubble but these equities in contrast to the.com Bubble are real like money printing organizations uh and so like that he thinks that that's oversold uh and then also inflation is turning over and so like these aligning of the stars is like convincing him that uh that the the bottom is in but all of those details and more are available in the uh the bankless newsletter and then if you are a premium subscriber you get access to the audio for the Twitter space as well God you're such a tease I want to tease you it is so is Chris berninsky here here's his new uh pin tweet bullish from near the bottom hope to see you all at 10 trillion I remember David and I just read out we're at 850 billion 10 trillion well a little 10x here is expecting yeah and we'll see you there this is the tweet that I retweeted I said uh Chris brniski flipping bullish is like a changing of the seasons for crypto and it makes me so happy I actually think that's true um all right Hayden Adams uh this is some interesting stats coming out of the FTX collapse of C5 uh debacle I I tweeted this out early in the week because I think it's true C5 dead sea fight dead like right now when you talk about centralized Finance Beyond kind of exchanges right Central is lending and borrowing like it's down bad I mean they're not all going to go out uh like out of business and go bankrupt but like who's trusting him at this point the question is who are the beneficiaries of that of that trust does it completely flow out of crypto and back in traditional Finance or does it go somewhere else I think Hayden is making the case that maybe it's going somewhere else and we're starting to see some numbers what tweet are we looking at here yeah so Hayden says deck's starting to replace centralized exchange question mark total eth USD volume uh and then he lists off the three biggest exchanges binance unit Swap and coinbase binance coming at 1.9 billion you can swap at 1.1 billion in volume and coinbase at 0.6 billion so uniswap has now taken the spot of the number two most liquid exchange for eth USD David that makes me so damaged I'm very happy do you know why you don't have to give your private keys to uniswap custody no one can stop it it's uncensorable this is D5 these are the types of exchanges we need to uh base this entire system on um all right well we've got a lot more to talk about I just don't almost almost clicked over almost all about FTX that can contagion the Genesis halts Genesis is a large trading firm we've got to talk about that they halted withdrawals also talking about mainstream media where they dropped a ball so much more to cover

blur uh there was the 14th uh Monday evening and um SPF just tweets out what what so it's SPF always writes a thread like he's a thread or it's kind of his Meme and so he always writes these threads with like one parenthesis like you know kind of like a bullet fashion like one parentheses two parentheses just to like label my first tweet my second tweet my third common common thread uh etiquette to do that uh this one was weird because he goes one parentheses what and Then followed by two parentheses H the letter H followed by three parentheses a and he is tweeting these out with hours of space not interesting fashion not in Rapid you're supposed when you write a thread you you write all the all the tweets and then you send them all at once so that people can go through the thread like you just goes like a normal goddamn person uh so what he does is he goes one parentheses what Waits two hours three hours and then goes two parentheses H the letter H three parentheses three hours later a and then he ends up spelling over the course of like a 24 hour period what happened over like 10 tweets and then the 10th it goes in parentheses not legal advice not Financial advice this is as I remember it my memory might be faulty in parts and then 11 I'll get to what happened but for now let's talk about where we are today and this is a 36 hour long Endeavor of people trying to figure out reading spft leaves is what the hell he is doing with this tweet thread well he does this David who the is this like who does this like why would you do this what what is he trying to get attention is he just like toying with us yes I mean he stole like 10 to 16 billion dollars worth of our money being a meme Lord on Twitter dude why I mean this can't be so I had I had thought like another thing a normal person would do is like uh here's my Twitter account give it to the lawyers like no this is him tweeting this out some people do you hear some of the early speculation there's always conspiracy theories around this that he was like um you know tweeting out some sort of code dead man switch right uh something that would unlock I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't even know what there's so much I mean he didn't he let's let crypto Twitter run its imagination as to what he was doing I mean but this is uh it's more than what happened yeah and more than tweet number 10 is the rest of this thread worth reading he goes through 11 to 21 is there anything here that we really care about um says truth and Beauty what it do I do it's all weird man and like he says a lot he says a lot and everyone is like Kobe is like dude shut the f up until you tell us how you lost 10 billion dollars like everyone is saying dudes just stop just shut the hell up just like go away he's saying a lot yeah uh I mean so like like the other conspiracy was that like he's going for an insanity plea he's like I'm just gonna be insane on Twitter so I can plead Insanity later and then I remember uh Jake Stravinsky was like uh you don't get to plead Insanity for becoming insane after that those lawyers they'll get you on the technicalities okay so like this is not the most insane thing that he did right did you see the fox article I saw some of that I mean oh my God okay before we get to the Vox article okay there's a theory of like uh you know ego um there's a theory of insanity also read a lot about you know pharmacological influence amphetamine use in this whole scenario in fact the the weightless wrong guy um did a whole post about this and uh you know there's a there's a lot of evidence that not only SBF but the entire team is on some sort of combination of amphetamines I'm not talking about meth I'm probably talking about yeah Adderall and stronger versions of Adderall basically and maybe cocktails of all of the above and so there can be side effects with meth I'm sorry with meth I don't again they're not there are side effects with meth yes don't do math kids um amphetamines though which which which can increase your uh prickly to shopping sprees and gambling and risk seeking type behavior and it doesn't have to turn you into an all-out gambler but it can kind of move the risk curve even a little bit and you have to imagine something like SBF he's a Trader in cryptocurrency right he already is well that's the other thing but he's already pretty far on the right side of the risk curve in in terms of the you know point zero one percent of the population who engages in this type of seeking Behavior if you're on this sort of drug influence maybe it moves you even further you know on on the side of riskiness so could that have been a factor is that is that something do you think he's he's even trying to um push as a legal defense I do I have no idea I don't think we anyone can uh re think that they can step into the mind of SPF but also just to double down on that point like all of that stuff is true and then also imagine having like your gang of similarly aged cronies who are also engaging in that behavior apparently like it was common at FTX to like as for for new new employees they would get like I don't know indoctrinated into this weird coal and they would be like okay here's like the slew of amphetamines that you can increase performance with and so it became a part of culture to do amphetamines uh and and so like when you were on phentermines all the time you're already your mind is going to get shifted but when all of your friends are also doing that too and that's just like the company culture that you have yeah like you just totally lose touch with reality that's really what's what's happened here with SPF he has just completely lost touch with reality yeah and those around him too because let's let's let's remember he he couldn't do this alone he had to create this kind of cult this reality Distortion field in order to do this okay now tell me about the Vox article so is this the one with the text back and forth yeah text back and forth okay yes there's this uh reporter uh at Vox Kelsey Piper I guess is uh the reporter that the the SPF was texting with and like no SPF knows that this person's a reporter for Vox and SPF just DMS this guy pages and pages and pages of communications just talking about everything and it's like Kelsey's not a guy but yes uh oh pardon me uh and so yeah DM's Kelsey like all of these things that you would just as a lawyer would not want your client to say uh things like uh I was like the effective altruism was just like a PR move for example uh like the number of incriminating things that he gave to this reporter in DMS who then they took the screen took screenshots and then posted them into the article uh is insane man it's absolutely but let's go through some of them so uh Kelsey asks SPF this question you said a lot of stuff about how you want to make uh wanted to make regulations just good ones was that pretty much just PR2 and he goes this yeah just PR F Regulators they make everything worse they don't protect customers at all [Music] he went on a debate talking about like regulators and how much we needed to work with them and go to the table like this is someone who is uh also a pathological liar quite clearly here he's saying to Kelsey F Regulators that was all just PR all of my participation was just PR and the whole regulatory Fiasco Kelsey asked uh says to Sam you were really good about talking about ethics for someone who kind of saw it all as a game of winners and losers and SPF replies yeah he he I had to be it's what reputations are made of to some extent I feel bad for those who got effed by it by this dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shobola eth I don't even know what that word is and so Everyone likes it basically saying yeah the effect of altruism thing was just a front yeah I'm going to continue to see you kind of don't believe in like doing unethical in quotes as anything other than a judgment we bestow upon the losers and then SPF replies and goes a month ago CZ was a walking example of don't do unethical or your money is worthless now he's a hero is it because he's virtuous or because he had the bigger balance sheet and so he won that's what he thinks this like there's just not a base level of uh taking responsibility and there's not a base level of Ethics is this is not the type of person you want to entrust your your money to okay so so here's one uh SPF says to Kelsey I effed up big multiple times uh but you know what was my biggest single uh f up he's actually saying the word uh and then Kelsey responds oh question mark the one thing everyone told me to do I'm trying and then Kelsey responds I'm trying to guess but I have no idea and then Sam goes chapter 11. so of all of his regrets it was filing for bankruptcy that SPF regrets the most also if you read more of the text messages he actually still thinks there's a chance he's like I didn't want to go bankrupt because I can still raise 10 billion dollars like right now I used to be the best that is lunacy yeah it's lunacy it's it's just off like it it's completely um cut off from reality yeah yeah detached completely detached from any form of uh reality and there's delusions of grandeur there maybe I don't know I'm not a psychologist but like dude that's what we saw with the Eric Voorhees like that's how I would describe that debate with Eric Voorhees detached from reality but the fact that he still thinks yeah at the end of this that he can still just like save the depositor's money I don't even know if he thinks that I don't I don't know what he thinks because he doesn't have any ethics and he could this could be another PR thing but all of his tweets recently David even this week have been all about um I'm just my number one priority is is uh saving customers money and protecting the customers and depositors and so at the end of this he still thinks he can raise 10 billion dollars someone's going to sink 10 billion dollars into this uh failing ship and this this broken Empire so here is a fantastic summary thread from uh Genevieve uh and she tweets out I read the 30-page FTX Bankruptcy Court filing how bad were ftx's internal controls question mark here are the worst examples example number one employees submitted expense reimbursements over chat a random manager would accept or reject these reimbursements with an Emoji number two party related party loans Alameda research FTX hedge funds gave Sam bakemanfreed a 1 billion dollar personal loan they also loaned director of engineering engineering 543 million dollars including him money loaned yeah three very few records were kept most decisions were made over chat with the message automatically deleted after a certain time so apparently Sam largely communicated with his employees over signal because you can delete messages and Signal okay but but go back to that so they gave SBF a billion dollar personal loan they just gave them a billion dollars and one of his director of engineering half a million dollars yeah so uh and that's actually not all of it because uh and so in this the picture that the Genevieve is tweeting it says related party loans receivable of 4.1 billion dollars at Alameda research consisted primarily of alone uh by two paper bird Inc a loan of 2.3 billion dollars and a loan to Mr bankman freed of one billion dollars you know who owns paper bird Inc right I'm gonna guess it's uh it's Mr Sam Beckman Mr Sam bankman freed so actually it was 3.3 billion dollars that he got a loan from FDA well named it really was a paper bird wasn't it Jesus dude FTX number five FTX had no cash management system management had no idea how much cash was on hand at any given time or even where their cash was at all number six FTX did not keep proper records of who they employed employees and contractors co-mingled throughout the different companies without proper documentation of how their time was spent certain employees can't be located seven corporate funds were used to purchase personal use real estate and employees and Executives put their names on homes purchased with company funds eight crypto deposited by customers weren't even recorded on the balance sheet presumably all crypto assets went into one Central slush fund used for whatever what nine the filing makes it clear that Sam bakeman free does not speak for the company and that his erratic and misleading public statement should not should be disregarded yeah I guess so yeah yeah yeah so like this is just a a house of cards like sticks and like constructed business with a bunch of amphetamine riddled kids who were like oh sweet we got a billion dollars let's do but you know what's crazy it's the amount of uh VCS like they they raced it was a two billion dollars from like notable VC firms this year a number of which are coming out and and um this is apologizing distancing themselves this week maybe we'll get to some of that but uh the fact that this was going on I guess shows you the level of I don't know due diligence some of these firms are doing or the lack of it or the fact that they are I think some of these VC firms are just like they bet on people they bet on individuals and so they don't vet the the core mechanics of the business they don't look at the books they're just making a bet on SBF and he was able to con them yep yep what's this next uh tweet we're looking at so this is a thread I thought was pretty interesting from this uh petrify TCG Twitter account that documents a lot of Sam Trabuco who was the former head of Alameda and uh Sam Trabuco put a thread together back in 2021 uh and he kind of just did some some forensics and basically he documents the uh going from Alameda at the very beginning of Alameda which was a delta neutral trading hedge fund and uh which was just like a normal thing where they just they just Market make they don't take any risk they don't take positions in the market uh but then they decide to take more risk with like defy yield farming which is more risky but you can still kind of control your losses to some extent if you're good and sophisticated and then as it goes on they just totally take directional bets on the money on on the market and again totally fine if you're not using customer deposits which they were and so you you kind of see the documentation of Alameda going more and more and more risk on as the bull market went on because like everyone's a genius right everyone's I was a genius in 2021 not as smart by in 2022 but I wasn't using customer deposits so that's fine uh it's pretty smart though yeah and so like it's basically like you can see the degeneracy of Alameda go higher and higher and higher as the bull market continues and then just like not position themselves at all for the turning around of the market it sucks it's brutal this is so ugly when you look into this um there's a there's definitely a case I mean it's very obvious right now that Sam knew exactly everything what was going on no it's not even like he was like new about it him he's like he definitely like orchestrated it there was a message so remember all of those crazy tweets from Sam that we started off with yeah we saw we there was a leaked photo of the company slack of FTX that I'll read out uh the inside of the company FTX somebody says why is Sam trolling on Twitter as if this isn't a serious situation question mark exclamation point question mark did we not learn that trolling on Twitter got us here and Sam replies in slack I'm sorry uh exclamation point maybe it's wrong I took the approach because something needed to break through the mob mentality but I'll likely be more straightforward going forward what mob mentality uh anyways uh the employee responds Sam respectfully this is not helping nothing broke through the mob mentality in fact your tweets just made the people more mad that you had the audacity to tweet something cryptic When people's lives have been destroyed I don't think anyone understood the cryptic nature of your what happened tweet thread if there's more meaning behind it please enlighten us because we are lost your employees lost everything they had on FTX wow FTX users lost everything that they had on FTX everyone that chose everyone that chose to believe in you lost everything you Tweeting what happened in 10 tweets spread out over 24 hours it's just peaking everyone's in anxiety in addition to the money that they have lost I was also personally also super anxious after every tweet you sent hope hoping for some positive outcome I request you to only tweet if you think you are adding value to your users investors employees and if you have any plans of making us whole anything else would infuriate people even more a lot of us idolized usam and you have let us down in my in my opinion you don't have anything of value for your users investors employees please refrain from tweeting it's a change that this hasn't come from an employee of sdx inside of slack it's sad it's brutal man uh good riddance right back to the theme thank God this guy is is out of here but um it's been a slow train crash I guess toward toward the end all of last all of this week felt like this uh we're looking at some court documents I think and there is a new CEO at the helm so of course yes FDX goes under uh bankruptcy Chapter 11. that means SBF no longer has power governance power the organization he has to step aside bye bye new CEO John rain John Ray came in uh and uh he writes some scathing reviews of what was going on this is somebody who's coming externally and helping to uh I guess organize this company for bankruptcy and so in these chapter 11 bankruptcy documents the this new CEO says I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience I have been the chief restructuring officer or CEO of any several of the largest corporate failures in history I have supervised situations involving allegations of criminal activity and malfeasance Enron I have supervised situations involving novel Financial structures Enron and residential capital and cross-border asset recovery and maximization nearly every situation in which I have been involved has been characterized by deficits of some sort of internal controls Regulatory Compliance human resources and some integrity so that's the that's a he's setting himself up for a punchline and here it is never in my career have I seen such a failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information has occurred here from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented this is the guy that oversaw the Enron restructuring saying that this situation is unprecedented oh my God my man's been doing this for 40 years and he's like this is the worst I've ever seen in my whole career of seeing terrible things like Enron doesn't even hold a candle to this uh here's another tweet thread of the chapter 11 first day affidavit this is the affidavit filed by that John J Ray uh anything we could take from this it's so bad Ryan like we've talked a few about the things already like the reimbursing with Emoji codes uh there's some other crazy stuff that employees uh were paid through online chat uh and like SBF and Gary Wayne controlled all of ftx's digital assets personally using a group email account to share private Keys oh my god dude like it's like just if you want to read the train wreck just like the links in the show notes uh well here's one uh Alameda had basically special privileges they had kind of access of the FDX exchange and Alameda of course was Sam's private hedge fund dgen trading firm right uh there was a secret exemption this is from the court documents the secret exemption of Alameda for from certain aspects of fdx.com's Auto Liquidation protocol Alameda was exempt from getting liquidated automatically on FTX so Alameda could leverage long on FTX without fear of liquidation so basically have no rest in line for liquidation everyone else gets risk why would you ever come to this uh platform to trade what a terrible stain yeah it just every Everything stacked against you they're literally preying on their users now ultimately they've stolen All the Monies it doesn't surprise me well I think this is like one of the reasons why the whole thing uh fell through is uh Alameda took a leveraged long position then the market turned over and then they were never liquidated so who's paying who's paying for that hole oh well it was FTX AKA customer deposits because they didn't liquidate their own trading firm on their own Exchange okay let's get to Contagion here's the big story Genesis who is Genesis and what's happening with Genesis right now okay Genesis is like the biggest lending and trading desk in all of crypto they're kind of the heartbeat and this is this was the contagion that Chris bernitski was saying that he was looking for right and so if Genesis is impacted then you kind of know we're at the center of things so Genesis they tweeted out that they had 175 million dollars in FTX which is now gone and as a result of that they have had to suspend withdrawals in their lending business and so they that their their lending desk is closed um I'm sure they have plenty of money on the table do they have all the money I think we're still we're still waiting to to hear as a result of that but this of course bleeds into Gemini uh and anyone else that has like a an earned product so Gemini earn has paused withdrawals and so of course this bleeds into anyone that gets yield out of of um Genesis uh Gemini earn for example Gemini earned has paused withdrawals out of the the Gemini team and they say that they were working closely with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the earned program as quickly as possible I think they just need to wait for the dust to settle and like see where their accounts are this does not impact any other Gemini products or Services the Gemini exchange is uh responsibly firewalled from Gemini earned because of you know good common sense and Regulation and I actually withdrew like I had like 0.1 Ethan Gemini and I was able to withdraw that yesterday so I can speak from experience here but this leads us back to kind of how like genesis was the biggest lending desk in the space so we'll pull up a tweet from Dylan LeClaire here that gave their Q3 Market activity snapshot 8.4 billion dollars in Q3 loan originations 2.8 billion dollars in active loans 18.7 billion dollars in derivatives uh traded and then uh 9.6 billion dollars in Q3 spot volume traded and Dylan continues after like putting out some of these numbers he goes not only does this perpetuate the contagion domino effect but this is also will further the liquidity crunch being felt across the space as institutional uh players reach for additional financing uh and so we don't really know I don't really know the knock-on effects of this yeah so so the the bottom line is um Genesis paused withdrawals pause which means they're they're clean out of liquidity that doesn't necessarily mean they're they're underwater and you know their their liabilities exceed their assets doesn't necessarily mean that but they've run out of liquidity we don't know it doesn't seem super healthy and because Gemini earns program was based on Genesis essentially now withdrawals are frozen on Gemini urn by the way David guess who had some funds on Gemini earned too no way this guy right here I haven't missed yet what like fortunately uh very very small amount because again it's just like me testing these things but um yeah um now I I cannot say you gotta collect all those parts right so so uh Celsius is gone obviously I mean like dead right block fight probably dead unless it gets a CZ bailout right and that would be sort of the Hail Mary Miracle shot uh my take on Gemini earn I think there's a chance I think I'm feeling pretty good about that over 50 I think that Genesis going under would be a really big freaking deal yeah and Gemini and then the combination Genesis going under it and then Gemini saying sorry all earn customer care like that would be very damaging for Gemini's business right so it feels like they're going to probably find a way or they could I don't know I'm giving it like 50 50 odds and that is not based on any data or any science it's just Ryan's gut feeling right now having having been through them all right now I've got some experience on this uh so not good and of course this is block five they sent out an email earlier this week we were shocked and dismayed by the news regarding FTX and Alameda we like the rest of the world found out about the situation through Twitter isn't that fun uh and basically they're saying they're trying to protect client funds they have no Clarity everything's frozen I don't know what block five is going to do um it's a it's a really bad situation to be in especially because they're getting double dunked here right they basically went underwater over the summer as a result of um it was it was a trade it was the gdbc trade when that kind of fell the floor fell out from that as a result of the year's Capital they they got wrecked there and then they got a bailout but who'd they get a bailout from FTX the Ponzi King himself comes and bails them out and now they're back underwater again so pretty brutal situation to be in I'm not sure that they're gonna make it out of this but um maybe there's hope well so I feel bad for blotify because like this they got bought up and just like subsumed into the Ponzi and so why did Sam buy them it wasn't out of the good graces of his heart was it no not at all so this is autism Capital tweeting out this Twitter account is something else they did a great job reporting this week uh it's despite the the name from a block fi employee the only reason FTX bailed us out was to get our users funds onto their platform to use in their shell game they applied immense pressure to get blocked by funds migrated to FTX custody employees were told by Executives to not ask questions about the move wow oof bad yeah very bad um yeah so this is a Wall Street Journal again saying block 5 prepares for potential bankruptcy as the crypto contagion spreads I you know I'm interested in that though I'm yeah I'm not going to call then to the contagion either even after this week I think this will take a few like a few weeks to pan out fully yeah we're getting close I think we're getting close will be about this for all throughout 2023. yeah galwa Capital had 50 of its funds on FTX multi-coin cop at Capital 100 million that's 50 of their Holdings yes Tire fund got wrecked yeah multi-coin Capital lost uh 10 it was 50 of their assets um not all of their deployed Capital but yeah fifty percent of multi-coin assets were lost while they're down it's not uh so I think they got at least 10 maybe more actually stuck ten percent of the fund yeah so like of their liquid assets that they had it was like uh 10 50 of them but they have a lot of other Investments 55 number is is their um the drop in the fund's value including the write down of like all the the ftt tokens and soul and everything else that they had in their fund was a 55 down um yeah so pretty pretty brutal and that that I'm not talking about over the year I'm talking about over like the week like a two-week period right you're down 55 yeah so Circle also had some contagion with uh Genesis I actually haven't been able to like get some numbers on this one but circles yield the yield that you get uh with circles goes from point two five percent down to zero because Genesis was one of the few places that they were getting yield in the first place to be clear usdc is fine uh do uscc is fine yes uscc is not going anywhere yeah uh why was that going anywhere like that's hard for to say right now but I've always knowledge yeah uh so like we have to ask ourselves like why why was this at the center of contagion you know it kind of was reminiscent of like the Thrills Capital where like Thrills Capital was just taking loan from anyone that would give it to them well FTX and Sam was kind of in the same position everyone was like Sam take my money you're like this money-making God please take my money and so because he's a sociopath con artist uh he would say yes so this is Frank Shapiro that said just spoke with an LP in several crypto funds uh he said when he asked funds why they did lazy due diligence on FTX they responded with basically he was on the cover of Fortune Magazine he was a big name that was why they invested in FTX and so Frank concludes there's going to be a lot of lawsuits and a lot of funds will shudder uh basically saying that if funds didn't do enough due diligence to investigate what's going on with FTX then they might get sued they just gave them gave him a pass because he had the social proof and he had the credentials and they just fomo'd right in because everything to that point that Sam had touched turned to money so they needed to be part of that that's why they they did the lazy due diligence and Frank Frank continues with a quote like uh it's just like theranos but then it also responds even theranos had a board of directors which FTX did not absolute Insanity like their nose but worse um all right so what's going on in sort of the legal side of things a few things number one the U.S House Committee just announced that they are scheduling a hearing on the FDX collapse great that hearing is apparently happening in December at some point in time that will be an eventful hearing I'm sure that will be crypto being scrutinized I don't expect to see a lot of distinction between C5 and defy uh I I don't know that's going to be an absolute mess David we're obviously going to talk about a lot talk a lot about that as a as it comes but I'm not looking forward to that it's um yeah pretty terrible for the industry also what's happening to the influencers who supported FTX and and advertised for them yeah so Tom Brady lady Larry David a few other supporters uh Chef Curry also oof uh they are there's a class action lawsuit against other celebrity promoters uh who promoted FTX which I kind of like Larry David was just in the commercial like he was just hired to do a commercial Tom Brady why is Tom Brady getting sued just because like he had was like a he was a paid spokesperson like Tom Brady is the person you trusted due diligence I don't really understand this one but people are mad and they're just trying to sue people yeah I I don't know what will happen with these types of lawsuits but yeah people are very mad but don't take Larry David from us he is a National Treasure please um so okay so there's a bunch of like reactions of course the entire crypto world is reacting but I mean positively uh so binance uh has announced that their intent to do to a what a vitalik buterin flavored proof of reserves system so CEO binance CZ reveals plans to implement a new proof of Reserve System protocol developed by vitalik buterin so that's a nice healthy response uh also in line with binance crypto.com also intends to audit their reserves using a proof of Reserve System as well and then also we kind of alluded to this earlier with the uniswap volumes at all-time high self-custody is at all-time highs and so uh gnosis safe saw almost a billion dollars of inflows Into The gnosis multisig Ledger the The Ledger Hardware wallet sales at all-time high trezor Hardware wallet sales up 300 percent uh and so this tweet is just saying the flight to self-custody is here and then of course this is uh this is Andrew Thurman who's saying most D5 Protocols are up double digits in users and transactions while exchange exchanges have huge outflow crypto as measured by on-chain activity is doing great despite FTX fraud and he's actually retweeting uh some of the Joe weisenthal's tweet that says uh a lot of like Joe reisenthal is making fun of crypto being like Oh yeah but this isn't real crypto making a claims like yeah it's not real communism uh which is he's always so cynical about it he's always cynical doesn't grab the Nuance of it but right anyways we have the data to prove that we are doing the responsible reactions to this to this event cynics won't believe me but like this is this is good for crypto this is healthy and this is good for bankless money systems overall that we detox and get this uh centralized um you know flaw in our system addiction really was um all right so we had some mainstream reporting about this entire situation uh some pretty bad mainstream reporting we also had we also had um Democratic Democrat influence of course so SBF was the number two largest donator to the Democratic party uh and some other folks within FTX organization contributed a great deal to to Republicans as well what tweet are we reading from Ryan Shea yeah so Ryan Shay says this is crazy Elizabeth Warren is known for being the anti-crypto senator who helped her draft the tax legislation bill in 2016. none other than Joseph bankman father as of SPF uh here's where and then he follows up here's a reference to the bill on her website where she thanks Joe for the endorsement this legislation has been endorsed by dozens of law professors and Congress including Joe bankman and Stanford University wow and then he follows up with a tweet from Elizabeth Warren and Elizabeth Warren tweets out the implosion of FTX must be a wake-up call for Congress and financial Regulators to hold this industry and its Executives accountable too much of the crypto industry to smoke and mirrors it's time for stronger rules and stronger enforcement to protect Ordinary People okay that's an interesting tie uh how about this uh so cold-blooded Schiller tweets out honestly this headline and write-up is awful for from the Ft from the financial times uh cz's actions uh this is a quote from the article cz's actions left Sam bankman Freed's FTX filing for bankruptcy as in CZ the consequences of cz's actions forced Sam to file for bankruptcy no it's FBS actions that left FTX and hundreds of more filling violence yeah they have to correct that that's amazing pointing at the finger at CZ is a weird angle for the media to take and there's this weird like caricature of CZ in a very not uh gracious illustration of CZ it's a bad look it's a bad look and this is the Ft man uh another one saying bankrupt FTX gave 18.2 million dollars to early covid researchers who cast out on Ivermectin and hydroquoox the queen this is like I just butchered that pronunciation but this was like these like non-vaccine like solutions that were really supported by the right uh and the claim here is that FTX gave 18 million dollars to researchers who were able to cast out unlike these right conservative aligned solutions to covid dude and like why doesn't this headline matter I don't understand this so like go to the next one where where the title is FCX collapsed Dooms Founders effort to prevent another pandemic wow the sub one is flush with crypto cash Sam bankman freed spent tens of millions of dollars on on campaign donations and projects intended to bolster Public Health how is he doing track emerging viruses what this is what we're focusing on how like Sam would tried to stop the pandemic are you serious I don't even understand actually this is because like the mainstream media doesn't is like he's he's a darling and they can't they can't are you sure mainstream media is still reporting out that he's a like I don't consume much mainstream media okay so go go to balaji's tweet because belagi's tweet will will uh summarize it pretty well uh the net result of FCX is at billions of dollars was stolen from crypto investors to give to Democrat aligned politicians non-profits and journalists this is why there may be no process are you serious is there really not going to be like this man should be in a jumpsuit right like this is very like the fact that he's not already is insane well this is very like this is very clear this is very clearly like fraud a scam like the biggest Financial Heist that we've seen since a Bernie Madoff um and in Bernie madoff's case it was investors at least this is literally the guy stealing from depositors he's like operating a bank and stealing the savings accounts and he's not going to go to jail for this there's not going to be like responsibility I I can't believe that's true David I I I hope it's not true but like some of the takes from mainstream media that missed the ball like CZ triggered ftx's collapse uh FTX collapse founder tried to stop the pandemic just like some insane headlines man it's it's it's crazy and remember Balaji always goes after uh the New York Times for being like woke media yes uh and so like if fbfs is SPF is donating 70 million dollars to like the woke political party then all like the woke media like don't go after the actual point we'll see I want to give it some more time I can't believe mainstream media is coming out on SBF side how is that even attainable if they're coming off on SPF side they're just missing the point they're they're they're missing the point about how he should be in a jumpsuit um okay how about uh how about this from Brian Armstrong I'll read this out Twitter's broken just about every piece of this FDX story using blockchain analytics well New York Times is writing puff pieces on a criminal feels like a turning point for City in journalism and loss of trust in mainstream media yeah I totally agree uh the coverage from what I just saw now and have been seeing has not been good um I hope we get I don't know that I have a lot of Hope other than look we public blockchains give us accountability into Financial systems like this and so anybody on chain can see what's going on and Report out and they're actually doing the work I mean individuals are doing the work they're uncovering uh where the money is Flowing what's actually happening and it feels like mainstream media is just off on another planet uh at you know at worst and like three steps behind at best so high school trade summarizes this nicely where he just says lost count of the number of mainstream media articles since uh since uh recently that have focused on cz's role in this spf's Ambitions and also SPF sleep schedule while failing to address Alameda FTX relations backdoors misuse of customer funds the convenient hack constant lies reassolvency like again missing the point David did we even cover the hack we even talk about the hack I don't even know what to do with the hack because like the yeah so FTX got hacked we don't know who's got the money it's like now the 30 30th largest ease holder I don't even know what to do with that information so there was some sort of hack that um even kind of the new owners chapter 11 owners of the people trying to reorganize restructure FTX uh agree was a hack by some sort of third-party feature I think it was a rogue employee and we don't know all the details and how much do they they come out with it's like hundreds of millions of dollars right it's like almost a billion dollars right we were seeing this on chain as it was happening this is earlier in the week right and they were converting from like different staple coins and ultimately into into ease and now they last I saw they were like the 36th largest e holder yeah and so we don't know who this hacker is it's because of all of the mismanagement and the lack complete utter lack of security at FDX um a whole bunch of people could have done this uh including someone Rogue and external from the organization so so no they were sharing private Keys oh my God it could have been anyone meanwhile there is a Redemption Arc starting from uh our friends at three arrows Capital David Fill Us in here yes yeah so like a number of people came out of the woodwork a number of like destroyed reputations came out of the world in the last like two weeks like dokwan showed up on up only and then both Kyle Davies and Sue Zoo started tweeting again and so like people are just like like saying like now is the time that you guys just returned because they don't look so bad relative to yeah because there is a bigger somebody lost more money than they did uh and so like both Kyle Davies and like three and and suzu are like saying like oh like here's my like story like suzu put this like tweet thread together about this metaphor for surfing then how he like crashed on the waves because he traded and then again everyone was like shut the hell up you like lied fraudulently about the state of your balances so you could borrow more money you have something else as who does CNBC mainstream media Finance decide to put on their show to talk about to comment on SBF and FTX Fiasco Kyle Davies three areas Capital did you did you hear the question that that she asked I did yeah it's okay let's play it Andrew it's it's Becky um I take it you're not in Bali because of the G20 are you there because Indonesia is one of seven countries that won't extradite you back to the United States uh no um well for for one I I I haven't lived in the United States for like a decade I've been in Asia but uh for two no it's just a good place to be so Ryan why do you think uh Kyle Davies is in Bali well I think we all know the answer like what I'm shocked at is Kyle appears on TV and he doesn't expect to be asked that question right I'm like it should not be a surprise but part of me wonders do you think CNBC is like I mean why would they have Kyle on Davies to comment on this do you think that they are actually just mocking crypto is this like a Supple let's bring on some of the biggest scammers of of 2022 and get these crypto people to comment on SPF well to embarrass the industry so you guys know how to scam right can you comment about like the state of SPF yeah I don't get it uh yeah so anyway look we're still probably gonna be talking about this sadly next week um we'd rather be talking about other things in fact after we come back we're not talking about anything not we're not talking about it yeah for a little bit anyway maybe towards the end we will again but uh coming up next want to talk about l2s because they are coming in hot still building stockware has a new token the starknet token also bankless doing an nft release what a little something not a big one but a little something really cool I didn't know that we'll tell you more about that I know that right when we come back after these fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible trufi is d5's largest credit protocol connecting Global lenders with institutional grade lending opportunities trufi has completed over 1.7 billion dollars in originations and paid out nearly 35 million dollars to lenders proving that Defy is ready to take its next big leap into the 8 trillion dollar credit Market trufi gives lenders like you access to sustainable high-yield opportunities backed by real world Investments usually reserved for high net worth individuals at the same time fund managers use truefy's Financial infrastructure to bring their portfolios on chain benefiting from the global liquidity cost savings and transparency of D5 trufi is a decentralized financial utility the protocol is owned and governed by the true fight Dow and trufi is here to bring defy into the Golden Age Bridging the power and access of crypto with institutional grade lending opportunities and portfolio tooling explore the diverse Financial opportunities available on truefly or launch your own portfolio at trufi dot IO if you've been listening to bankless you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network we all love token drawing I know you like tokens did you know that the starknet token is now deployed on ethereum that is cool uh the starknet token is called s-t-r-k so now deployed on mainnet ethereum so um I actually haven't even had a chance to kind of look at the price or any of the details around this uh do you have anything there is there is not much they just have a token and they said that they are going to work on distribution all right work on it work on that distribution uh businesses can now accept usdc with Apple pay that's a pretty big move yeah so usdc now getting into wallets like Apple pay it feels like some stable coin saturation here yeah uh still waiting on the actual details of like how that actually shows up in my wallet if I can put uscc on my phone and pay with Apple pay that is a huge unlock but uh I would I would like to see how that actually gets uh shown up anyways uh Solana actually sadly is getting uscc taken away from it so this was interesting both binance and okx have halted usdc and usdt deposits onto the chain so binance says binance has temporarily suspended tether and UCC deposits until further notice and also okx did it too this is FTX Fallout stuff right I I think so I think it's because uh Alameda was the large like Market maker on Solano using these stable coins and now the sensor is no Market maker there is no less liquidity I I that's the rumor that I've heard I don't know why they made this choice but the fact that both of them made at the same time it was interesting Salon is definitely taken a hit um from this um I think they'll recover but um yeah it's going to take a while for this wound to heal let's talk about some nft stuff so Yuga labs are buying some people stuff people's getting involved with Yuka Labs what's this so yugalabs has acquired uh people's platform we knew along with its Flagship nft collection 10K TF which I actually didn't know existed and beeple uh Mike AKA will also become an advisor to Yuga Labs so cool interesting development didn't see that one coming uh also didn't see this one coming uh Nike Swoosh platform to allow users to buy digital uh wearables and build a community around these digital wearables uh AKA Nikes uh Ryan you're gonna line up to buy a digital Nike you know I don't I don't really I'm not a uh a shoe guy in real life so uh I won't be in the metaverse either and surprise it's on polygon yeah Nike and polygon uh partnership Biz Dev from polygon continues to absolutely crush it uh Sony just got a patent for nfds and the blockchain so Sony doing some things I guess all companies are still doing things in crypto even despite this bear Market yeah so uh they say the patent is for tracking in-game Assets in video games and it lays out Mechanics for tracking changes in ownership visual appearances or metadata of digital assets kind of seems like it would uh it's a skin kind of thing it's like oh yeah it changes as you wear it and if you trade it it goes I don't know something like that that's what I imagined we are experimenting with nfts too so we promised this before we cut to sponsors uh bankless is actually doing Collectibles for some of our podcasts so these are sound Collectibles I know you and I David have been on a little bit of a kind of a music sound nft binge where we've acquired some of our own at least I have I don't know if you have you've certainly been bullish about them uh so we thought why not try our hand at this and convert some of the historic legendary bankless podcasts into Collectibles so we are actually releasing the first mint the first bankless collectible podcast today if you were listening to this I think at 12 p.m East it uh it will go live and the first episode that we're releasing as a collectible nft so a sound collectible nft is actually the SPF and Eric Voorhees debate now all of the proceeds from this collectible uh we have decided to allocate towards a coin Center so it's already tuned up so that anytime one of these nfts is minted or any of the royalties on a resale goes directly all the proceeds from that go directly to the coin Center eth address so if you buy one of these nfds or if you sell it percentage of the transaction fee on the on the sale of royalty fee will go to coin Center and the idea here David is we're going to be doing more collectibles in the future but this episode in particular I mean some people have said this episode sort of almost was the the prick that popped the the balloon here is the start of the Fall of the House of Cards yeah yep it helped us uncover everything with uh with SPF and uh we all know that not only in this in the conversation all of the regulatory actions all the kind of the Smoke Filled uh rooms and meetings that SBF was having with with Regulators with lawmakers behind the scenes he's done a lot of damage to crypto in DC particularly I think damage to D5 protocols uh and um you know donation to coin Center I think through this nft can can it's not going to undo the damage overnight but it can help right it's something coin Center is doing fantastic work they are educating our lawmakers they're are fighting for our legal rights so we kind of owe it to them their jobs just got a whole lot harder yeah so uh anyway the starting price of this I believe is 0.05 eth there's only a hundred of these and then they're all they're all sold out so we'll see how this goes but uh we're pretty excited about it and if you are a holder of 35 000 bank that price is actually 0.04 ether uh we took that snapshot today and the other cool thing about this is SPF talked a big game about effective altruism Ryan but with this it's the donations to coin Center are in the code the money goes from you to them because of the code and so you don't gotta trust us uh the way it's meant to be absolutely and of course this is uh this is going to be the first of many Collectibles this first like I said 100 of the proceeds are going to uh to coin Center we'll be doing more in the future too so we've got the legendary bankless podcasts yeah this is called the Genesis collection so this is the first of four others that will be released there's five in total in the Genesis collection we're not going to tell you what the next podcast will be but they're some of our favorite these are the legendary podcast episodes that uh you can begin collecting if you're into that kind of thing uh it could be a fun way to experiment with nfts as well meanwhile moving on to different ecosystems Cosmos the community has voted on the atom 2.0 proposal and rejected it actually interesting uh but basically the community has largely vocalized support for the general direction but they wanted more clarity and refinement on some of the finer details uh so just taking a little bit back to the drawing board with the atom 2.0 white paper uh they're still gonna do it right they're still going to improve the monetary economy Comics or pieces of it General support for the vibe of the white paper but they want more specifics so they voted no chop it into Parts maybe yeah exactly like this yeah uh and you know how we usually joke about like how our the FED is like researching cbdc's well the private markets Citigroup HSBC Wells Fargo MasterCard and a few others have actually joined forces with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to actually explore a cbdc trial we will see what comes up out of that yeah absolutely neither am I Davidson cool releases this week uh the first from defy llama what are they up to oh they have a aggregator so they are joining matcha one inch now defy llama aggregator oh very cool uh and how about uh this this is really exciting I'm so excited permissionless uh it was a great conference probably definitely the best crypto conference I've ever been yeah it was I'm sure I can also say it was one of the best it was that definitely in the top three crypto conferences that I've been to in the last two years and I've been to basically all of them well this is one that we are helping to throw uh we helped to throw it last year with the team at block works and and we're doing it again this year and this year it's going to be bigger and better better yeah um and when I say this year by the way I don't mean 2022. sorry I'm talking about September 2023 Austin Texas September 11th through the 13th more precisely yeah so we're going to Austin because we need a bigger venue for this and uh the news is that right now you can get tickets at the lowest possible price that you'll ever be able to get it because in 13 days the price of this thing increases general admission passed the permissionless conference is 199 dollars you buy that now so if you know you're still going to be crypto in September of next year if you're a tour a settler not a tourist you're gonna want one of these tickets and the big benefit of course is if you are a bank tankless premium subscriber you get another thirty percent off on this so bankless premium members not only do you get that uh fantastic Chris berninsky episode and your premium RSS feed but you get 30 off of the general admission pass at permissionless there's a link in the show notes where you can click and actually redeem

guys we're back takes of the week Jake travinsky number one what's he saying here a lot of people think the collapse of FTX is evidence that crypto doesn't have a future for me it's the exact opposite this proves why crypto trustless permissionless uncensorable crypto is the only path forward for the future this week we grieved next week we build good words from Jake travinsky I think we've made this point earlier the week that crypto's kind of bifurcated into two paths we're gonna have the centralized path we'll always have that that will be more tightly regulated from here on going forward the other path the bankless path is the D5 path and I'm hopeful that we continue to build on these permissionless uncensorable trustless protocols the D5 protocols from the base layer up space in the middle that FDX tried to occupy no longer exists no longer exists and uh was not a good space to occupy to begin with what's this tweet from Eric Voorhees Eric for he says crucial lesson to D5 Builders do not take a Victory lap do not let your guard down do not seed an inch to complacency in your code audit often and from multiple parties and assume the audits failed use guard guardrails to scale cautiously defy wins with vigilance I think this is just emblematic of like this state of mind of uh just like just being more just militant and Mission driven about why we're here in the first place and when somebody like SBF and FTX comes and crashes our party what do we do we get better in spite out of spite uh and I feel like that fits into the the theme of this week which is good riddance yeah I I really I love having the ability to view Source on these assets and some of these decentralized protocols right it's like and um that's the way all crypto should be right the fact that we had no idea what was going on in fdx's balance sheets that is so anti-crypto that's so anti-defi um what's this from Chris Chris berninski talking about the dark lord read this out Chris says everywhere I look there are Muggles who don't know that dark lord has fallen and the Wizards are free I think it's just like emblematic of just like yeah the Wizards what does he mean the Wizards are like crypto natives right and we're free from because the dark lord is dead yeah basically basically we just uh Voldemort just um is gone now to a better place and so um you know it seems like it seems like everyone's sad and upset because you know I guess there's this blight on on crypto but Chris is looking at the the removal of a cancer from the system yeah and he's saying No this is actually the best news I mean Chris it almost seems from his tweets and even what we read earlier in the episode he definitely seems jubilant about all of this and yeah not not obviously the events and the people impacted you know nothing like that um but just the fact that it's about only from here yeah it we have felt messy down bad any worse no and we've we this is the right kind of pain to feel like um these are tough lessons but we're learning them and uh you know through learning these lessons we can we can make it out into the other side all right David I could ask you uh what do you bullish on this week I think you've got something to uh to show us today yeah yeah yeah uh so last week I was down bad I was very sad I was a sad boy as listeners of the weekly roll up would remember uh and like the amount of just like hate and Flack I got out of that on Twitter was like surprising like people are just like I think not you were the poster you were like the a poster boy for all of kind of the down bad crypto people I think even like in so there was two groups that I I saw because David you almost became a meme last week right yeah there was definitely the internal crypto if you're familiar with bank list remember with the show like know who you are yeah and these are people like from I don't know the hex Community the communities that I have offended previously yes or that I don't know they have some beef maybe with bankless or something that you've said and so there was a lot of and you know even strong Bitcoin Maximus communities like there was a lot from there but then I also saw you in kind of outside crypto uh cultures like there was this uh Mega streamer with like I don't know three million uh subscribers watch these crypto Bros cry he was watching you over and over on a cycle I watched it 30 minutes of this where he was just talking about it and it was just like and I think he was using that as a uh you know all the crypto all the crypto are crying right now look at this guy he's legitimately yeah that piece probably I mean that's outside of the right you know the crypto tribe and they don't know you right it's just like whatever okay so the part that people didn't see and this is what I'm bullish on Ryan is just the bankless family I felt like there was a family here and the just insane amount of outpouring of messages that I got and I think you got a bunch of them too just in my Twitter DMS inside of the Inner Circle Discord was just like it was Pages Ryan of like and I took a screenshot some screenshots of them and sent them to you just be like dude look at look at like all of these people like like saying like how much they've just appreciated Bank list and like all the stuff that we've been doing over the last year and especially over the last week uh and uh I didn't not any one of them was really emblematic of of all of them but until I got this one Ryan which was somebody wrote out an entire letter entitled pep talk from a long time listener uh you and Ryan have put your hearts and souls into helping make the crypto space more accessible and meaningful to the average non-technical user user and you've done it tirelessly week after week you are to the space where Andreas Antonopoulos was for Bitcoin back in the day only to you're operating at the bleeding edge and I'm sure it must feel exhilarating at times and futile at times like now if anyone gives you for emotion you displayed in the video that's their issue in a space that can become so incredibly mechanical toxic mercenary and seemingly devoid of humanity you guys have constant consistently been the light that brings the human element back into the focus and it's heartbreaking to see one of the good guys in despair and I I this this goes on I just want to thank the the bankless community and everyone who's listening and everyone who's just like it's nice it's always nice to to know that you guys are there uh and it it was a nice moment just to know that we're doing the right thing and we have people that are along the bankless journey with us so thank you for everyone who's been listening to these things these weekly Roll-Ups over and over and over again and thank you for your for your words of support I definitely appreciate it yeah 100 I appreciate it I David I'm not gonna lie it I was feeling pretty down like this past weekend about about everything right just like just SPF crypto getting a black eye but then also just um some of the infighting in crypto like yeah it got toxic a lot of the blame they were looking for people to kind of burn at the at the stake and you know anybody who had a YouTube channel anyone who had a podcast like uh sometimes we were sort of thrown under that bus too um but what more than compensated for it was letters like this and messages like this and uh hundreds my DMs were filled yeah I had I did not expect that yeah and this is kind of just the I don't know the silent majority I think of of uh good people in crypto uh and I just want to say we appreciate you guys we appreciate the the bankless community in the bankless nation and um I mean ultimately you guys are why we do this um you know I don't think I would have the energy to continue doing this I mean God how many episodes have we recorded over the past two weeks all-time highs oh in the last two weeks oh my god oh and by the way um podcast just hit 30 million downloads too which is really cool and we just appreciate knowing you guys are are there for us and listening in week to week and you guys are the silent ones that reach out when uh when we need help and when we're in crisis so yeah um we're doing this for you um wow I don't have another one to top that David I don't know what I'm bullish on compared to that I'm definitely bullish to the bankless community um I think I'm I'm bullish about an opportunity to rebuild though sort of like you know the the dark lord is dead kind of idea with uh with berninski here um I think that SBF and that circle of Trader Finance I'm going to call it Finance bro says shorthand but that whole culture was sort of the the last distraction for me that I felt like now it's very clear what's in front of us we've got decentralized finance ethereum and related communities and then we have on the other side we have some of the crypto Banks like but the finances of the world and it's these two these two camps um and not say binance is always doing bad things of course I think they have some crypto values but they're not building on yet anyway on base layer protocols like ethereum and Bitcoin and so I I feel like the last distraction is gone and we know very clearly what we need to do and how we uh need to rebuild this industry and Revitalize it that doesn't mean it's going to happen overnight but um you know I know where I'm going to be and uh I'm just excited to get the last remaining toxicity out I I do feel like we've cut out kind of the the final cancer and uh we are on the the road to recovery and uh we're in remission right now and you know things are looking good our chances look very good from here on out uh so that's what I'm excited about yeah and it's what I'm optimistic about like and this is exactly what kind of Chris verniski was saying it's like yeah we're down bad but like it's up only from here yeah yeah any worse that's right so you can only be optimistic all right meme of the week what are we looking at oh my God The Big Short number two Sam bacon free dokwon CZ and Michael Saylor oh my God I hope Michael Saylor actually doesn't get liquidated that'd be bad for all of us no anyways coming soon to a theater near you I hope not but it's a good meme guys you gotta stick around for the Moment of Zen it's another song by the song of Damon I think he captures the SPF Fiasco pretty perfectly so you can enjoy this of course as always wrists and disclaimers crypto is risky so is D5 so is Heath all of this stuff is you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot okay [Music] New York
