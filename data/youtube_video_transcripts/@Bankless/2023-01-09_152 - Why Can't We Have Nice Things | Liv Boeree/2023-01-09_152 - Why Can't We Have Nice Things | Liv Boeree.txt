welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more thankless guys Liv bori is on the podcast today she is a game theory expert a legendary poker player and an extremely interesting person some takeaways for you today number one after this episode we think you'll be able to answer the question why can't we have nice things important question number two you'll see how cancer and nuclear proliferation are actually the same problem and some of the same problems that infected crypto in 2022 as well and number three it'll put into perspective an important theme what is crypto here to do a very important theme as we enter 2023 David I know we've got lots to talk about with live this is a really interesting episode but what do you want to talk about during the the debrief I really want to talk about just the subject matter of this episode Ryan is at like the basement of the universe like it's at the bottom of the whole entire thing and so for if you a listener do not know the name moloch you're about to become very very familiar with moloch uh and this is something that uh long time bankless listeners will be familiar with it's a theme that we've had throughout Bank list but I haven't touched on in a while uh and if you've never heard of the name moloch before you're you are going to be a different person on the other side of this episode that is the power of moloch and how crazy this story is once you understand moloch you can't unsee it it is a before and after moment in many many people's lives we brought many people along this journey of understanding moloch back in

development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free Bank close Nation I want to introduce you to Liv bori who is a former professional poker player perhaps one of the best in the world but we think why she is such an amazing poker player is actually because she's a master of Game Theory thinking in systems and understanding the world of complex systems in The Human Experience and she is one of the few people in the world teaching the lessons of moloch the study of human coordination and which is why we are having her on Bank lists today but before we bring live on we want to play a short clip from a video that Liv made about moloch the subject matter of today's episode so here we go [Music] foreign [Music] now you might not have heard of me but you've asserted me felt me for I am the force behind Fortune the power behind progress and the shaper of all success and what a success even you could be if you just listen to me for I alone know what it takes to win to be the most adored and the most beautiful and you do want all those things don't you yes well listen close because there are things you can do to tweak reality weapons you can use to crush your enemies anybody use them because if you don't your enemies are going to use them to crush you you see in the end the world wants winners not losers and life it isn't just a game it's War alright Liv welcome to bankless thanks for having me really excited to have this conversation but before we get into the story of what is moloch this thing with this weird name can you explain your journey here how did you get here what is it that brought you to moloch was it was it game theory was it just observing in life how did you get to the conclusion of moloch yeah so I I guess it sort of came about well I was always a really like pathologically competitive person um from a very young age like I just had to win at everything um I saw everything as a kind of contest anything where there was some kind of metric you know who got the highest score on an exam you know who scored the most goal in in the game goals in the game of netball um you know throughout my childhood it was definitely a defining feature that I always like I really cared about winning um and maybe that's what led me into you know certainly maybe fall in love with poker because I think it's hard to certainly to sort of throw yourself fully into poker unless you are a competitive person it's you know pretty ruthless game um in many ways and then sort of during poker you know I got to you know you get to see the sort of full gamut of human behavior around you know how people behave when they're in a sort of rivalry situation um and that some people would would be very good at handling you know competition and that you know they would play they play a game um against their friends their friends might Bluff them out of a huge amount of money or you know they they screw up or they get unlucky or something and some people would be able to sort of dust it off and then go down the pub with their friends afterwards and talk about it and learn from it and others would fall out with their friends or you know they'd really take it to heart and I would notice this sort of this tension Within Myself too like some days I'd be really sort of wise and be like okay well this is a learning experience and I can improve this way and oh my they outplayed me good for them and other days like that old sort of um desperate to win child would sort of like surface in me and I would be full of sort of Rage at either the situation or myself um and it was just like sort of like a generally unhealthy headspace that I would sometimes go into and then beyond that I would notice how some people seem to sort of view the world in very zero-sum ways and others would see it more as a like you know positive sum win-win situation and that there were certain games that seemed to have what all games seem to have externalities you know when we say a game is is usually we think of a game as a zero or something and technically poker is a zero something right um but the reality is there's always externalities to every single one of these interactions and sometimes these externalities are positive and sometimes they're negative so that sort of one track that led me to it which will become clearer as to why that's relevant to molok um and then meanwhile uh I got involved in I learned about sort of branch of philanthropy known as effective altruism which is kind of like how science in in its truest form is the process of like trying to understand the way the world works and and um be able to predict reality better uh it is less it's less of a body of knowledge although a lot of people think seem to think of the science these days as this body of knowledge effective altruism to me is like the process of looking at okay there's so many problems in the world how do we figure out where you know how do we triage them and so on and this sort of this resonated quite strongly with uh the reason why I'd never been particularly interested in charity before because it was like oh it doesn't seem like people it doesn't seem like any real processes to knowing what's a good thing to do versus not um so that then introduced me to this idea of like okay there's there seem to be a lot of consistent themes with the problems that keep arising in the world where you know whether it's environmental degradation um or scary exponential technologies that sort of are turning into an arms race or you know nuclear warhead proliferation there seems to be the same kind of process going on which is somewhat it's arguably like a game theoretic process where people are optimizing for a short-term goal um at the cost of like the long-term Commons the health of the commons and so those things sort of simultaneously I guess poker and learning about you know existential risk or you know catastrophic risk in in Civilization moving forward um led me into I don't know I guess actually then I started reading uh place our codex is is the next step um I'm sure many people watching this have read meditations on Malu yeah this is a logical conclusion for people going down their murloc path they everyone ends up at that meditations on my live blog posts all parts lead back to Scott Alexander uh and I read that and that was honestly borderline spiritual experience because it just put into words this thing that I'd sort of sensed was going on in some way or could I felt to have noticed it's in like different aspects of My Life um and and it put a name on it and put it into language that sort of made sense it put it into sort of game theoretic economic terms um so yeah that's roughly how I got there okay so Liv um a lot of things I think we're going to get into some more detail right the positive versus Zero Sum thinking the externality is related effective altruism with which of course I think Bagless listeners are mostly familiar with we could give some more definition behind that unfortunately recently in crypto it's kind of gotten a bad name with uh there's somebody else with a three character name SBF we could talk about somebody named exactly uh we've got some existential risks catastrophic risk of course you know crypto is is um working on these types of problems too but I want to get in your headspace uh you said it was a borderline spiritual experience the first time you read meditations on moloch it was incredibly impactful for me too and I think you've called it elsewhere like one of the most important written pieces you've ever read um can you describe why so this is a blog post will of course include a link in the show notes for bankless listeners we highly encourage you to go read this post by Scott Alexander but can you explain what was going on in your head as you read that and as that kind of settled in your mind why was it so important to you why was it borderline spiritual well I think what he does so well in it is he actually combines well it doesn't many things so he really takes a it's very long on the post it's like you know it's not your average oh I'm going to read a blog post on my commute home in for the next 20 minutes you know it's like an hour and a half read roughly um it goes very deep but it takes the reader by the hand and just go through lots and lots of little examples um he does a very good thing where he he leads he does his explanations by giving examples examples examples and then says what's what what's the common thread between all of these different scenarios oh it seems to be this okay so that's pointing in this direction and so on but what I think it does so well is it actually draws on a piece of art um so it's centered around this poem written by Alan Ginsberg in the 60s called Hal which talks about this thing called molok and you know as with often the case with a lot of esoteric poetry it's it's not always that clear exactly what the thing is and he gives lots and lots of examples um and uh oh it just pulled it up yeah so each line is like it's a different pointer of what this thing molecules but it never it concretely says oh therefore Malik is X um and so what Scott tries to do is yeah I like like almost like a great English teacher is is look at all these different lines and use it's almost like Parallax to assemble a picture of this thing that seems to cause problems within our society um but again I tried me trying to reduce it down into a couple of you know two minutes of explanation doesn't do it justice people just need to read it yeah certainly and and everyone really kind of resonates with moloch because it's a part of the human experience and we should probably spend some time to actually start defining this thing uh but as when people were listening to the clip that we put in into the intro I'm sure they started to like catch the vibe catch the drift and this is why everyone has some sort of just like like you said a spiritual experience when they discover moloch once you see moloch you don't unsee moloch like there's it's a before and after moment of your life and it's a little bit of like seeing the Matrix right like you can kind of see how it works and and defining them defining what moloch is and why it's so powerful is always interesting because everyone has their own different words of explaining it so Liv maybe I'll ask that question to you like how do you define moloch foreign yeah so I would Define it as it's a force of game theoretic incentives that can lead agents and I'll say I'll use the word agents instead of people because it doesn't have to just be um a human-based thing but it usually is um that leads agents within a competitive system to sacrifice more and more of their other values in order to win so it's kind of like winning for winning sake if you were to put like a mindset It capture like encapsulate it in a mindset but it's a also like the outcomes of it tends to be um destruction of The Wider ecosystem that is containing that that game so you know there's like this sort of short-term game that people optimize for winning but it comes at the cost of uh the environment around it and whether that's you know whether that's an informational environment a physical environment um a health environment Etc and the outcomes usually of that is it causes a lot of suffering and destruction um yeah I will save the complexities after later uh but perhaps like the most succinct way I like to Define it as actually is just like it's the it's the god of unhealthy competition it's not the god of competition competition is a neutral thing it's a it's a form of interaction just like coordination or cooperation um and competition can be used for good and it can be used for bad and molok is when competition turn is is used for for ill essentially so I've heard a similar definition of moloch being the god of uh coordination failure the god of coordination failure and that that sounds similar to what you're saying with uh unhealthy competition um what is an example of unhealthy competition or coordination failure that you know people might be able to to to think upon because these words like unhealthy competition uh I think are easier to understand when we when we look at examples yes and that's what Scott does so well uh so perhaps a the simplest example that comes to mind is this idea of you've got a crowd of people in a in a football stadium and you know everyone is sitting down watching you know they're comfortably sitting in their seats and they've got a decent view just because the way it's set up you know there's usually a range so that everyone can somewhat see the pitch everyone's happy but everyone's happy but then a few people down the front get really excited and they stand up now the people right behind them can't see anymore so they have a decision like well do I want to continue watching the game or not well yes I do so I'm gonna have to stand up too sorry people behind me and now those people have the same thing and so on until the whole thing right ripples back and now everyone is forced to stand up and because it's a loud football game uh you can't you know no one can just shout and go hey you at the front sit down like there's it's the environment doesn't enable everybody to coordinate properly um now everyone is stuck standing for the rest of the game or unless a few people at the front sort of do manage to sit down and then it trickles back but it's it's such a precarious system you know if you sort of could map it topographically it's like it's not like it's not like a stable equilibrium when everyone is sitting down it's actually a very unstable and it's not equilibrium essentially they're in um it's more like a ball that's perched on top of a on a on a point and just a little nudge of a few people near the front can make the whole thing fall down and now everyone's stuck no one's gained anything no one's got a better view once everyone is standing no one really has a better view than before but everyone is actually a little bit worse off because now they've got to stand for the rest of the game so that's one of the most sort of concrete examples like clear examples I think of um the sort of basically how a system can be poorly designed whereby bad incentives cause it to sort of fall off a cliff essentially um more Salient example well one I give in this in in the video that you saw that that clip from later on in the video and maybe this doesn't apply so much to bankless uh listeners because I don't know what they're all doing proportional they're all dudes yeah it seems to be a common theme for me like crypto poker is always like 97 dudes or something but anyway I'm sure people could you know just bear with me so as a girl on Instagram um for my sins you know I noticed what usually when I post a picture on there if it's a post picture where I look good I just get a lot more likes you know a lot more comments and you know the algorithm is is happier when it's a picture where I look good and it's a few years ago these Beauty filters started emerging where with just a click of a button it would make your face look absolutely incredible you know it would just be automatic makeup it would even do these little tweaks where it you know gives you like almost like a little subtle face facelift where but if you don't see the original picture you wouldn't even notice it it's so so subtle and because you know if your goal as a you know say you're a a girl on in on Instagram trying to build her following as an influencer it pays to look hot you have this really strong incentive uh pressure to use these filters because if you don't well you know that you because you know that everyone else is doing it right so you're incentivized to sort of even though even if you don't want to and you feel like you're misleading your audience and you're even not being integral to yourself you're incentivized to use them anyway and it's like this kind of slippery slope and as these filters get better and better each time it's like a new little arms race you know oh well I use this one oh but now Snapchat have just released this one and it's even better if you combine it with that and now and it just keeps going and going and then it sort of ends into this like race to the bottom where everything's becoming progressively more and more artificial creating this like wave of body dysmorphia and so on same thing applies you know to again female example but models who you know don't want to risk is using lip fillers or these little these little subtle things um so that's another example for in sort of woman space yeah and importantly everyone is unhappy about it uh in the first example uh everyone is standing up and they're probably everyone in the stadium is like it wouldn't it be so great if we could all together just sit down all at once yes everyone just sit down like but no you can't do that because as you said like Stadium's too big we can't coordinate same thing with with women using social media and like uh just like terribly uh psychologically unhealthy Beauty filter just like what if we all stopped well they agreed let's not use it it's just not to do it and we don't have that power because we don't have this coordinating power between all of us and so this is why in the crypto World we've called this the god of coordination failure you call it the god of broken incentives there's a couple more examples of of malach that I I want to bring up uh one of the very very big ones and that illustrates why the power of moloch is so incredibly strong is nuclear proliferation uh if and just the the concept of nation-state militaries at large it would be great if we could uh invest in infrastructure and education and child mortality and nutrition uh and we do invest in those things some to some degree but the how much we invest in military far dwarfs that now why is that true well one say let's start with a blank slate and we have two agents in this game and each one's a nation state whichever nation state invests more into their military can gobble up the other one right whichever country has the bigger military can just take take all the other countries and so by definition every single country has to over invest in security and defense and then we end up in the state that we are today with like enough nuclear warheads to blow up the world ten times over and they're all at like you know there's just a button away like that's not a good state to be in and it's also why we can't uh have nuclear dearment because no one wants to be the country without the nuclear weapons that's a bad state it can't be the country without the beauty filter right yeah right and uh right you can't you can't just you can't just check out the game if you want you know be like oh okay we're going to become radically hippie country we're just not going to invest in any any weapons get invaded that way don't you right you're just going to get invaded that's that's the trouble and the the other example I want to bring up which illustrates the power of moloch outside of the human space because this is not a this not in stuck inside the world of humans it also can exist in cancer where a cancerous cell can grow and it's a system of bad incentives because that cancerous cell wants to grow and grow and grow to the point of killing the hosts that it exists inside of and all of a sudden the cancer itself then dies because it grew too much and so this is something that is baked into just like how nature it's like at the basement level of the universe which is why it makes it so like hard to to deal with because it exists uh outside of our ability to control it that's that's so crazy by the way that's why people get obsessed with Bullock and why we've become so interested in talking about this and why it's become I think part of the mission of crypto to help solve some coordination problems and help solve some some moloch problems because look what we just did we started with a silly example of football stadiums right then we scaled that up to like social media social problems and we scale that up to nuclear proliferation and the destruction of humanity and now we even see that at the at the basement layer of nature like that's what you were saying earlier David is once you see moloch in one place you see it everywhere and then you become obsessed with this problem of like how do we slay this beast and did you hear some of the examples too um you know comparing moloch to a cancer right it's very similar and moloch itself is just I mean some people get um thrown off by that I think a little bit live because like what are you guys talking about was this a a devil or is this like some kind of like ancient uh god of death and destruction like what is this moloch thing can you tell that story a little bit where's the analogy to this um this ancient god coming from yeah so it actually came from I think it's an old Canaanite Bible story well basically there was this uh supposedly there was this cult that again well they were so obsessed with winning they they wanted a stronger and stronger Army that they had this God that they would worship that they believed that if they could sacrifice that which they cared about the most to it then it would reward them with military power and so they would literally sacrifice their babies to it in this like burning Effigy they would throw their children into the fire because they believed that that it would then reward them um with uh yeah military power they would they would defeat their enemies which is arguably the most you know deranged instantiation of that mindset it's like that that's one way Scott describes it it's like throwing more and more and more of your other values under the bus in order to win this one narrow prize um which is where I think it this this concept of what is the molecular mindset because it's like kind of like two things that it needs to thrive it needs a poorly designed competitive system whereby you know these bad incentives make it sort of fall off a cliff uh and go into a race to the bottom but it also needs a minimum threshold a minimum number of people within that system to want to win that game in the first place to to have the to lack the wisdom to realize ah actually do I even want to win this or is it really worth sacrificing this other stuff for this one narrow prize um but anyway yeah that's that's where it originates from that's the first sort of story of it which is interesting because you know I'm not a particularly I've never read the Bible um probably should uh but that this sort of that it's something that's so old this this original concept does speak for some kind of truth because you know civilizations have risen and Fallen throughout history and one of the only ways that information really gets passed down you know the lessons that we can learn from the fall of the Bronze Age or the fall from uh fall of Rome um is the mythopoetic stories that got passed down that were so strong and Salient that like civilizer you know the generations would continue telling them to their story so I think there's some real wisdom in that um you know I don't think you need to be a student of the Bible to see that um yeah so that's that's kind of where it originally came from so it's it's it buried deep in kind of our our social our social systems and and even kind of the the narratives uh that that we share in past from generation to generation in fact I think the fall of civilization you could say often's due to some sort of uh you know corruption in the underlying system and that in itself is a lock trap but we also think like we're calling this thing a coordination failure as well I want to go back to kind of the the stadium example where you know the people in the first row stand up and then everyone else has to stand up uh after that um this is a coordination problem but you could imagine if there was somebody on some kind of Megatron loudspeaker saying hey everyone on the count of three let's all sit down right this loud voice booms out over the stadium one two three and then everyone sits down that is a possible solution to coordination problems like this where we have sort of a centralized coordinator we have one person uh who has the stadium mic and has the ability to project this message to the entire Stadium right and that is a possible solution to moloch problems a centralized coordinator and yet that in and of itself has flaws and has problems and can be prone to corruption but that is one way we have addressed the moloch problem that we see everywhere is you have this centralized coordinator that that image was just coming to mind there I don't really have a kind of a question or a follow-up on that other than to say that that in itself can become a moloch trap because then you have a problem of what happens if that centralized coordinator also becomes corrupt and starts shouting out the wrong that's a lot of power to have in one person's hand you have the ability to control an entire Stadium I don't know if you have any Reflections on that live and I don't want to jump the gun and get to solving moloch yet but it seems like this coordination failure problem is is Central to the issue and we don't have a lot of tools at our disposal to address it but we do have some and one of those tools is centralization yeah I think you hit the net on the head that it is a solution to have this sort of top-down decentralized essentially a hierarchy um of you know one sort of almost omnipowerful agent telling you he's forcing all the other agents what to do um but as history has shown us uh when we try and whenever societies have tried to be too authoritarian the Devils of human nature still end up taking that over because you know a lot of people often conflate and actually one of the reasons why I think Scott wrote meditations on Malik was because he felt that too many people thought that Alan ginsburg's poem is about capitalism purely and he's like it it's touching on something that capitalism is involved but it seems to be something deeper and more fundamental than that and he's in my opinion absolutely right because communism you know which is if capitalism is maximizing out on how much competition there is allowing competition to sort of decide and Market forces to decide how things are distributed and communism is the other side of that right where where you turn competition down to nothing it still goes wrong and there's still a way for like moloch to do its bad thing because humans will still end up trying to optimize for something else in a communist system you still need to have these centralized power figures right so they have this they have status that they're optimizing for there's this different type of power that they're going for um which then creates all these awful tyrannical problems and uh I don't know if you're familiar with like some of the well both um the vulnerable World hypothesis uh posed by Nick Bostrom and then uh some of the work of Daniel schmaxenberger who sort of Builds on that um he describes how basically there seem to be these two you know our society is if our society seems to be going in one of two directions either one towards more centralized top-down control um on probably a global scale to try and keep a lid on all these little powerful technologies that are becoming more and more democratized you know whether it's the ability to crispr some deadly new virus into existence for ten thousand dollars and release it and kill everybody um or whatever the new scary technology is or you have the other retraction which is more like just Anarchy and mass decentralization and both of those end up you know the Anarchy one is very vulnerable in that eventually some some terrible thing will be released that ends up wiping people out and then the top down one is terrible because that leaves the world very very vulnerable to tyranny um and authoritarian authoritarianism so what whatever solution there is needs to be some third attractor where it's almost like on a different dimension we we have to think we have to figure out what what the net what a higher dimensional answer is that isn't just this like trade-off between these two options yeah and then we've actually had uh Daniel schmuckenberger on our sister podcast with uh green pill and Kevin Milwaukee not on the bankless podcast we do hope to get him on one day uh and you know in order to really dive down this question of like how do we defeat molok how do we solve coordination uh first it's got to be with education right because we got to teach people about this problem uh and I kind of want to start this story at the very very beginning which I think starts with the prisoner's dilemma and so Liv can you connect the dots for us between how the prisoner's dilemma relates to moloch because it's really about like short-term versus long-term thinking right mm-hmm well so they standard version of prisoners dilemma usually that people think of is the single player one right where it's just this one-time thing where you don't know what you're the other prison is going to do but there is a clear dominance strategy in terms of payoff which is to defect um you both both prisoners are incentivized to defect um which then leads you know to to then I think they end up getting worse outcomes right um because of that because they both end up doing it um but then there's there's the more realistic version of the prisoner's dilemma which is an iterated version whereby you actually know you're going to be playing against this person maybe many many times and in that situation then the the I mean there's various different sort of ways you can look at the dominant strategy but there is an incentive for you to cooperate because if you cooperate at least in the beginning then you you show to them look I'm a Cooperative person we can actually do this and we'll both we'll both do better let's keep doing this and then depending on various factors sometimes you want to defect when they defect as a like punishment Etc um it's actually a really cool website that I would recommend everyone go and play with it's called the evolution of trust um which talks you through these like iterated prisoners dilemmas but you know putting it into Monarch language Malik is the thing that would make you always defect because mole looks like well what's the short term win here how do I gain the most oh I do it by defecting so I'm going to do that um and whatever the anti-molecules would be the thing and I do have a name for it which we can talk about uh is is whatever the the anti-modern thing to do would be to take this long View and zoom out and go okay but what would happen to the ongoing game if I if I always choose defect things will actually be worse off not only for the other person but for me in the long run um so that's kind of how it plays into it right and those are all properties of uh the games that you described are like properties of two people when they have the ability to coordinate but I want to remind listeners that we're talking about systems that have many many people n number of people that cannot coordinate right and so uh really the power of moloch to me is instantiated in the fact that like moloch rewards the person who defects the most first as in it is the most enticing for the person to who defects the soonest and so it really is this like race to the bottom thing because like if you would imagine like whoever is standing up in that Stadium whoever stands up first momentarily has the best view in the stadium uh and whoever uses that beauty filter first momentarily is the hottest person on Instagram and so it really rewards people for to defect quicker than everyone else and but then it makes moloch arrive sooner than everything like sooner than not right and so it's really about just like the the the set the setting of the stage for win moloch is going to come is actually and this is like this crazy Catch-22 which actually is like kind of existentially like intimidating is that the place in which moloch arrives is when uh everyone is coordinated because when everyone is coordinated that's when the incentives for defecting are the highest and which is why moloch is such like a a difficult Beast to fight is because as soon as we get to this place like Hey we're all coordinated we're all on the same page the incentives to defect in that one moment are at its highest and now I don't know if you've thought about this facet of of moloch live or how you solve this problem but like what like can you just elaborate on like what the conditions are for molok's arrival and like when he when he or they the god of that is moloch is the most dangerous well I mean it's at its most dangerous when it incentivizes people to come up with new newer and newer ways to get a competitive advantage and that's unfortunately where it ties in with technology and you know we are now in the era of exponential technology which we were not I mean I mean some you can always argue that technology has always been on an exponential curve but you know if if you think of like a thing like um again like a synthetic pathogen or something like that uh it spreads virally which is you know by definition it's an exponential grow growth thing and if you can if you couple that in a system whereby well maybe that's not such a good example because it's you know that's that's only ever going to be used for bad perhaps something more better example is like AI right because there are all these different companies now working to be the first to build super intelligence um or even a narrow it doesn't have to be a broad superintelligence but even a new you know who can create the best text to video AI um or any powerful um AI driven driven thing there's such an incentive to be the first one to do it because you're going to get the economic reward or the status or the prestige or whatever it is that you're chasing after and the more the more power you can throw into making your technology the better and the more the the more and more safety measures that you discard the greater your competitive incentive and so it just always drives this process faster um so I would say that it's at the most danger it's at its most dangerous when it's combined with some form of exponential technology um cliched but like the paperclip maximizer is kind of the ultimate instantiation of it if anyone that I'm sure people are familiar with this is elieza utkowski's thought experiment of like just you know if we build something that is incredibly incredibly capable of building paper clips as a just arbitrary example um it will be technically more intelligent that you know if we build something that is more intelligent than us I I.E it's better at manipulating its environment into making that one thing um so it can do you know it can turn atoms of of everything around it into paperclips which includes maybe human bodies the atoms within your body into paper clips and so on uh then that will if it doesn't also have the wisdom to realize that by doing that it's going to be a self-terminating process eventually it's going to run out of atoms and turn into paper clips then that's that's mollock basically it's it's the ability to drive progress and win without the wisdom to ask itself should it even be doing that in the first place like what is the long-term after effects of this uh yeah that kind of answers it I mean when you see this too this is uh more like is really the reason we can't have nice things right um that's the tragedy of it and uh when paired with technology as you're saying live it makes it even even even worse than that it could actually spell the Doom of of civilization of humanity right it could reset us back to the Stone Age if we really get this this wrong but what is what is kind of the answer to this because you made earlier in our episode we were talking about it you sort of made this distinction that I thought was uh notable and I wanted to come back to the different difference between healthy competition and unhealthy competition right and so like one way to slay moloch is you just somehow I don't even know if this could be done but you somehow get rid of all competition but that's not a good thing because isn't competition healthy live and like how do we make progress or you know some people might uh go back to kind of the idea um I think uh Ted Kaczynski and the Unabomber had this idea of like well let's get rid of all technology maybe that's a way for it and yet doesn't technology bring so much good uh to our lives uh helps us decrease uh infant mortality helps us have the conversation that we're having connect with others it's brought so much good to so many people so we can't just disconnect from technology can we and yet technology makes the moloch problem even worse and even more viral so how do we how do we deal with this like a competition unhealthy competition do we get rid of Technology like do we keep it how do we start to think about solving moloch traps yeah so it's the quadrillion quad Dollar Question um I don't have an answer to it so I'll preface with that there is no clear you know I don't know what the process looks like but what I do have is an aesthetic of what the solution is so uh if Malik is the god of unhealthy competition so in other words if of negative some some games zero-sum games dressed they're negative some games dressed up as Zero Sum games they seem like when would lose but in reality the externalities are negative I was thinking like okay what's what's the opposite of that if it's the god of lose lose then what's the god of win-win I'm just gonna call it win-win so what is this thing what does win-win look like uh and how would it if if molecules dislike you know I tried to get into sort of the the the feeling of how molec is when I would have that in myself as a kid when I had to win it's like this narrow focused blinkered thing like ah some laser focused on winning this one goal and blind to everything else so win-win and and it's not very fun it's not very nice and it's not very fun but it is good at doing what it does so what's win-win well win-win is like it likes to play games it loves playing games in fact it's like oh you want to play yeah let's have a game oh I might win you might win or we'll see but it knows it has the wisdom to sort of ring fence the size of the game and go okay that's that's how big that Zero Sum pocket needs to be so that the externalities are positive so it's got this like wisdom and to to slap down molok essentially when it gets starts getting a little bit too powerful so I don't know I don't even like to call it the anti-malek because that puts it on the same it puts it in the same Dimension as monologue which win-win is not it is something of a higher order of emergence much more potent much greater much cooler and and then in terms of it's just like it's personality it's just a really good time it's not like Oh we must all coordinate and everyone must know it's because then then it's like kind of like almost like weird communist Stalin Vibes and it's not like they say fair oh everyone do what they want all the time no it wants to maximize choice for people it wants to empower people so that they have more options to do the things that they think are good but it also wants to imp it what it wants to in maximize People's Choice making abilities so not necessarily optionality but like people's ability to make the right decision so it's it comes Laden with like wisdom but wisdom of how to have fun and have a emphasis you're painting is it like kind of this this God of like uh and again we're just using the analogy of God but um this God of like wisdom and like freedom and choice is it is it progress progress is that it yeah but not progress for progress's sake it's I I think the the first the first word to use were better definitely like Freedom choice but keeping the game going it you know it I don't know if anyone's I'm sure you guys have read finite in infinite games that really touches on it as well you know if you're in a sort of more and again there's there's another uh some formulation of it known as game a game B which uh Jordan Hall and again Daniel smacktenberger and some other Jim Wright talk about um so gaming is sort of fundamentally built on like this like rivalrous zero sumness um which unfortunately if you combine that with technology on a on a limited playing field which is on Earth uh is self-terminating game B is like the the upgrade to that is this next thing which whatever that is again is very win-winning so it's it will have lots of coordination within it there will be a most probably the majority of the stuff that happens in this kind of system will be very Cooperative but it gives space to have small pockets of competition because ultimately what okay now we're getting really uh sort of philosophical but like if one thing that molec seems to do is as an as an outcome of its processes is that it's a complexity Destroyer and what win-win tends to give rise to is more complexity so like systems that are richer with more information and more diversity and that's and that's the key thing so a purely top-down coordinated thing where everyone is like you are doing this and you are doing this and you're doing this and there's no flexibility within it it's actually a very steady state thing and that would like create this lock-in for the rest of time that would be very sad um because it would permanently curtail the amount of complexity that could arise and emerge within the universe uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets unislap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the game but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop there there's some interesting Aesthetics here it's kind of like a contrasting life versus death I feel like something like life is is very organic and it's pushing things forward it's kind of like reversing the entropy of the universe it's making these more complex uh biological systems right whereas death kind of an entropy sort of break all of that down make make things less interesting uh it also seems like moloch is very um narrow in its focused with this idea of the the opposite of moloch this win-win would be you know much more broad much more wise it would be much more long-term in thinking than kind of this single-minded narrow game that moloch seems to play these are some of the Aesthetics I don't know if listeners are getting a picture of kind of the the systems that we're talking about or the the coordination that we're we're hoping for um what else would you add to this aesthetic and then and then are there some like more practical examples of this live that we can sort of see playing out so one thing it doesn't do so one thing that molec tends to do or at least the way that molec gets into many of our systems particularly capitalist systems is that the trouble with you know and I'm not knocking on capitalism I think it's still the best system we have thus far but the problem with it is that it tends to reduce very complex things down into single metrics so for example the biodiversity and richness of the rainforest which is more than just like you know regulating weather patterns and oxygen levels and and so on there's there's so much going on there we don't even know we you know we're discovering new species all the time right even at the rate of species loss we're having there's so much computational richness within that and yet molechy forces are pushing locals there because they're just trying to survive to turn these these incredible range of trees into Lumber that gets turned into a piece of furniture so again to use sort of smack some bugger words it's turning this complex system into something complicated it's this reduction of value into a single measurable metric and that's the downside of capitalism because it's you know we have to measure stuff somehow markets have to measure you know we we money is great but it is a very some perverse bastardized way of encapsulating value in in a sort of single Dimension and when you do that that is a that process of reduction of of value and informational richness is a monarchy thing so again win-win is something that doesn't do that um or at least allows that to happen in very constrained ways you know like not all deforestation would necessarily be bad like if we you know we still need wood for furniture right let's find a way to turn a Barren piece of of you know useless land into growing forests for you know pine trees that we can then cut down and make wood from like that would be okay that would be a way to sustainably continue um foreign to still have the the lifestyles that we need and want as humans um without decimating this incredibly Rich complex thing that we actually depend on to survive um so again that's pointing I realize it's not giving a concrete example of what win-win is but it's the best I can do right now um is to sort of Point At You know what it's not and to just throw out adjectives and descriptors of what the vibe is of this thing because that's the thing about win-win as well it is a Vibe what is a Vibe it's like you know this Vibe you get when you're at a festival you can't really commodify that right right it's very hard you can try and reduce it down to words and describe it but you still don't Vibes of Vibes because they are this feeling that we have that like connects us to something greater and like almost like more sacred that's that's the direction and in terms of like what for example the crypto Community could be could be doing again this is like Way Beyond my pay grade I'm not a crypto expert but what it seems like the technology is you know of blockchain and decentralized Technologies are good for is a way of building some kind of higher order of collective intelligence of of you know essentially turning us humans into into a network of intelligences where we're like nodes in a larger brain anything that can bring the hive mind into existence um but then a hive mind that is wise to the more naturally well some of the monarchy behaviors that humans tend to fall into because again humans are not they're neither good nor evil they're both we can we're all individually capable of both so how do we design some kind of hive mind structure where we have where we maximize the good stuff and minimize the bad stuff um right and this is a highly similar to the metaphor that Ryan was talking about with the man over the the voice over the the megaphone at the stadium you're asking for a new higher order organizational structure for humans to be able to come together and coordinate and this has been one of the big themes that we've talked about on the bankless podcast like Once Upon a Time religion was the hive mind coordinating uh nodes on a network where all of a sudden like everyone's on the same page because we are reading the same book and that one book tells us how to live our lives and then all of a sudden we come up with nation states in that is another higher order coordinating thing that I think does the thing that you're talking about win-win does which is balance Order and Chaos inside of its domain and allows for competition to arrive Market forces to take over but under rules under loss and allows for some freedom for people to do exactly what they want so long as this doesn't involve other things like killing people in tax evasion like stuff like that right and I think that's kind of the Call to Arms for the crypto spaces like can we do that and I think I live earlier in the podcast you talked about like a ball that's perched on top of a hill and what moloch is is like the moloch tends to that ball can fall off that hill at any in any direction right and this hill is like optimization right you want the ball to be at the very point that the highest peak on that Hill because that is humans trying to optimize for something yet moloch that ball can fall off that hill in any direction there's Infinity number of ways for the ball to fall but only one way for the ball to stay perched right and then there's and that really is just like human effort we just try we just try to figure it out and there is no magic bullet it's just like every single case of moloch rearing its head has its facts and circumstances of like humans kind of need to figure out how to coordinate around that trouble and sticking with that it's it's not it's not molecuous necessarily the thing that pushes it well it it molecs through humans is the thing that pushes the ball off the off its perch but it's also the landscape itself that topography it falls into yeah well the fact that it was designed in the first place in such a silly way whereby it just takes a little nudge by a you know a molecular infected human mind at that in that moment to do that um is also the problem so it's we've got to not only sort of change well in many ways level up human nature so that we're less inclined to do this but we also need to change the landscape itself change the game to something smarter whereby we don't need to worry so much about you know it's not so vulnerable to these pushers so did you just say that like malark a way to define moloch is actually the nature of the landscape the optimization of the landscape itself as in like there's this invisible like plane of existence of like kind of good or bad for better for lack of a better word and moloch is the fact that this landscape is hard to stay away from bad or hard to say away from bad it's easy to be susceptible to bad coordination traps and harder to find Peaks on that landscape where everyone's happy is that is that a fair way to define moloch he is the landscape yes I think so it's it's you know I don't want to sort of broaden the definition of it because then it just starts you know everything that's bad is more like and I think we need to be careful not to fall into that um but yes because it is this combination because if everybody if every person within you know at this crappy landscape let's say is actually infinitely wise and has the mental strength to not do the quick selfish thing you know it's a resist all the Temptations and bad incentives then it wouldn't the bad outcome wouldn't happen or or everyone could be actually really self-interested and selfish all the time but if the landscape is so well designed where the ball is actually like the the the the local the local maximum is also actually a a universal minimum so actually the real the only way is up then that's also not a problem right so it's the it's the combination of both which is why I like to break it down into like monarchy systemic issues and molec mindset because those are two directions we can go at to try and fix this thing um we can be designing better Landscapes better systems that to take into account the crappy parts of human nature and make it so that those incentives don't work against us and we can also spread just better like memes to people and be like look be more aware of like just think about are you acting in a molecu way right now are you are you optimizing for this short-term goal and not thinking about the bigger picture and how it might harm others or even harm yourself in the long run you know so live Europe I love the name Maliki yeah it's same uh so you live your version of of slaying moloch is basically kind of at the individual and education level uh where we're slaying moloch in the mindset you know of people so we're bringing attention to them uh that this Force exists basically and um changing the way they they you know maybe think about this or maybe they behave um also but but I want to get to kind of um the systemic view of moloch as well because because you mentioned something just now when you were talking about changing the game and we do have these I think humans have developed um better and better coordination protocols over time for things in fact like that's in a way what what technology sort of is is a is a coordination uh protocol even something like money for all of its faults at one time was a better coordination protocol than the thing that preceded it which was maybe a barter versus you know type of system or maybe a type of system where you have something that I want and I will hit you over the head with my bat until you you give that to me right uh so violence it's better than violence isn't it money in this this kind of credit point system um what like how can we think of of changing the game or how do you think of that um David and I often talk on Bank lists about um embedding some of these like changing games from Win Win Lose games or negative some type games to win win games um by uh changing our underlying protocols right for instance um one of those we we see in maybe some of the the social media problems that that we have today right so we have Twitter profiles that we don't own we have um all sorts of kind of algorithms that are targeted to slurp up and seek out our attention can we change the rules of those games are there certain things that you can see where um it's it's like humanity is stuck in these moloch traps we don't even realize it if we get a mindset reflecting on on moloch we can start to change the underlying systems what are some systems in your mind that are kind of ripe for Change and uh where do we where do we start I know you're coming out with a video pretty soon on media and I imagine that's going to tackle social media can you talk maybe about that in this context for a bit um yeah well actually the video is killing social media I started writing it like a year ago so this is like part two of this of this uh of the one that you started uh this this podcast off with that one minute clip um originally he was like oh man yeah social media these algorithms they're clearly optimized for um again they're reducing The Human Experience down to a single metric of like likes and retweets or you know shares and this therefore is very ripe for um viral molecule type Behavior behaviors um and the more I dug into it though because I'll say why are we basically the video is trying to answer the question of why is everybody so angry because it seems like everyone's just gone a little bit insane over the last few years more you know don't get me wrong the pandemic is obviously very stressful sort of world event on a like Global Consciousness level but it seems like there's something even this was happening before then people have been going nuts for like the last 10 years at least and and uh like why is it you know this divisiveness and rage that we're seeing so that's what the video tries to answer and it's where I actually ended up going more because I think people don't think about this sufficiently is that the media is it's kind of got two arms to it it's got the decentralized kind of bottom-up social media of information generated by lots and lots of people which is vulnerable to um you know people optimizing for click bait or you know whatever the most triggering thing of the day is to get likes and retweets but then it's still got this old like Legacy top-down stuff from these old centralized companies you know the New York Times is the the cnns the Fox News Etc all these old Legacy ones that are trying to still compete and stay relevant in in the media space and so they're also under these crazy incentives to like optimize for whatever they're just most profitable spin of the day is and it unfortunately seems like out of all the sort of emotions that humans have fear and rage are the most effective at driving engagement and more than more than yeah I mean some comedy can be but nothing will get you clicking faster than like oh my God like there might have been yeah I'm just thinking of like when the that that weapon that um Missile hit Poland right and it was like oh God where is this gonna you know this might now escalate the the Ukraine Russia conflict even further uh and just if you paid attention to it you could like I swear I could feel like the excitement within the media of like oh man this is a you know the the not the individual journalists they're probably scared themselves but there's like this there's this force that wants drama because drama is what pays and so it's this really [ __ ] incense incentive model we have whereby the more crazy shitty things that happen in the world the Richer the media gets at least temporarily so it's deeply monarchy um and yeah so that's that is deeply modern uh yeah uh and um so in terms of how do we solve that that's really I think that that's going to be a hard one to do from a systemic level because you're basically like how do we decouple media entities profits from divisiveness and drama and and scary stuff that I don't have an answer to but again if we can get enough people aware of the fact that just just how badly the media are incentivized to stir up you know polarization and so on and drama then people are going to be less inclined to share share and click on that or at least we'll have that Moment of clarity and be like oh this isn't good for me this isn't good for the world I'm not going to keep giving them my money essentially you're mostly in kind of the mindset game though like like the step one is really being aware that these forces exist and that this is happening to you and like the reason you might be mad today is because you've read too much on Twitter or the reason you might hate yourself is because you've looked at too many Instagram images and all the filters right and that is that is kind of step one to try to I guess detoxify us individually and if we all do some of that then uh maybe we can start to um I don't know detox collectively and and figure this out and start to solve this um I don't know David what do you think do you think crypto has any answers to uh to some of these problems like you know the problems that Liv was just talking about with the media for for instance because it seems like we're incentivizing towards anger and detention and we're not incentivizing towards truth and isn't that the thing that we actually want our media to to deliver us yeah I I I've gone back to Liv's personification of the opposite of moloch win-win so we have lose lose which is molok and we got win-win which is like this in my mind this Whimsical kind of like fairy creature that is very fun to play with and it might be a universal growth I don't know yeah yeah yeah it is very important it has the ability to be edgy it's it's not like pure it's it's it can play with the darkness too because it's yeah right and so like lose Lou we have win-win and lose lose clearly the universe that we live in has progressed where it was uh 10 years ago 100 years ago a thousand years ago there is an arc of human progress which means to say that win-win tends to be winning over lose-lose as in like over like just by the facts and circumstances of like I'm talking to you guys over my computer like the internet's working great there's a supermarket down the store I'm not getting better at coordination there's like clearly we know we don't know how to do it but over time we are doing it there is like something about that and I think that's really what the tackle what we're trying to get down to the basement level of here on this podcast is like why are we winning like what we don't know why we're winning but we are sometimes it feels like we're losing like nuclear proliferation we've definitely lost it feels like web 2 as a whole has like lost to Milwaukee so I feel like lost the internet with web 2. sometimes yeah the crypto crypto Community feels like we've lost the war of the internet but web3 is our place to like it's a blank slate we can get it back we have more tools of coordination now uh and so like I'm kind of just focused on like all right we've been winning how do I how do we identify how we've been winning and how can we like double down on that yes because it seems kind of been doing it seems haphazard and accidental it feels accidental that's exactly right and like how do we make it on purpose because that's like a big unlock it's like how do we approach this from a more meta standpoint I don't know Liv if you have any thoughts on that yeah one thing that's coming up is like if you look at all the history of um there's a Wikipedia page of it listing all the near-misses of nuclear war or these potential flash points that could have like is okay it's not like they were like oh was it 50 50 that it was going to be nuclear war it might have been each individual one might have only been two or three percent or even one in a thousand but the point is there was like 11 or 12 of these things and these small probabilities that compound to the point where you're like it almost seems like we're in kind of a lucky universe or even still here in this you know in this we're in the branch of the Multiverse where no nuclear war has actually happened so that that can then like do you know the um the quantum suicide thought experiment where it's like if you have a a a gun hooked up to some kind of yes no Quantum event uh technically if we live in a Multiverse then you're always gonna you know and the gun is at your head you will uh you'll only ever find yourself observing a universe where it didn't go off you know you won the that you won the coin flip essentially and you can repeat that a trillion times uh and even though from you know therefore it's like two to the trillion that you would actually have made it oh sorry one over two to the trillion that you would have made it but in the you're always only going to observe yourself in the one where you have made it so there's like this weird Observer selection effects things that make me wonder if like that's where we're always going to find ourselves in the one where we've seen like oh man we got lucky anyway um I think I think you're touching on something so again back to Scott Alexander he wrote a beautiful sort of I don't know if it was intentionally complementary piece to meditations on mollock but it is it's called the goddess of everything else everyone should go read that because it talks on this thing of like yeah it's great it's like there seems to always be you know the monarchy thing happens but then the goddess of everything else who by the way is very win-win she's just like ah yes well you did that because you wanted it to happen but look here we are here's a positive outcome that she always finds a way for that to be like the next positive outcome and the new game to try and make the right choice so you know I don't think the fact that we have been winning therefore we we it isn't evidence that we will therefore make it you know on an objective not that you know who knows if there is actually any objectivity but on an objective level the prognosis is not looking good like it's hard to see right now while we're in this like very uh Monarch vulnerable civilization and particularly with all the like craziness that everyone is actually getting just by spending all their time on you know plugged into the to the current instantiation of the internet uh it doesn't seem like we're heading on a good trajectory but the fact that we have been winning is very useful in terms of giving us some hope because it's out of that hope that we will build the structure which will enable us to actually go on and flourish and survive um so yeah I don't even want to put probabilities on whether we'll end up making it on versus not but the way for us to make it is if is to believe that that we will you know what I mean um but it requires the effort so that's why like I want to be careful saying yes well we have been winning so therefore we'll probably be fine because then people will not like I want the put what you're trying to do with this podcast right is to get people into action because the time is now the time is yesterday but the time is just as good now and tomorrow let's get on with it so uh oh and one other thing I just wanted to tell you we might have failure via complacency yes yes um also via panic that's also the other knife edge we've got to walk Panic is no good either win-win doesn't panic um there's something of there's something about this uh moloch fight that we've been talking about we're like Morlock wins when people choose defect in the prisoner sulama right the molok wins when people break from coordination and they prioritize short-term incentives over long-term incentives and one of our big themes on that we've talked about on the bankless podcast are this concept of like settlement assurances in the crypto space which is just like confirmation that your transaction went through right if you can if you have that Assurance then you can play by those rules and this relates to things like laws in nation states where if you are given assurance that this law is going to be a law from now and for forever you can build a business around that truth and that can allow you to think in the short term and that's really what a part of the role of a nation-state does is that they keep things stable it's called it's not coordination technology right let's let's have a strong economy that doesn't get too hot or too cold let's keep laws the same and and hopefully make more clarity and build more laws so that people can operate around these rules so that we can create a foundation of long-term thinking we can reduce the need for short-term Thinking by creating a country structure and an economic system that allows businesses to not feel like they uh need to be focused on the next quarter but they they can actually focus on the next decade and that can lead them to creating like fostering new employees and new businesses and new arms and all of a sudden like we have Prosperity we have greatness and and so that's a great thing about a nation-state but also that's it is the coordination technology but also it is moloch itself as in like the United States nation state is the thing that's participating in nuclear proliferation it is the thing that is like oppressing people with violence in the and the Monopoly over when you slay moloch there's another moloch behind it that's even bigger and more different you have to defeat that boss and then there's another molok it's like and then the infinite it's all the way down just like the infinite game this is the infinite battle that we always have to fight yes although I think it's important to different differentiate it the United States nation state is not monarch it's normal because it's right yes it's it's again a neutral entity that can be a very powerful entity that can be co-opted by for monarchy reasons or it can be cooperative can we fall into the moloch trap in the same in the same way only at a nation-state level rather than an individual or a company level and same with the International Community you know like what we're seeing the tensions between Russia and and you know what Russia is doing to Ukraine and the tension between China and America and so on like it's it's the same it's it's this it's this rival Risk game that's playing out on a on a very large state scale and and this and the stakes are so large that if they actually go to war it breaks a playing field right you know right so like thank you the United States for producing roads and laws and Supply chains you guys are making my life great also there are hundreds of thousands of nuclear warheads that could end all of that tomorrow both of those things one is the solution and one of them is the failure of moloch and you actually touched on a really key thing that I it's very important to hammer home molok is not any one individual thing and the way that molec actually wins or like the thing that would please more like if it had a brain enough to be pleased is is if people mistook individual things for it so you know right if everyone's like yeah you're right like it's part of the problem with this happening in America that I see is that like people you know I'm a recent immigrant to the US but I'm stoked to be here I think there's so much great stuff going on and there's so much like loathing and shame and hatred of like people like hating their own country and I was like man like don't hate your country hate the things that hate the force that has made your country do shitty stuff yeah but love the force that has made your country do great things you know so give it credit where credits do and the way when people mistake the when people don't see the the bad Force for being Malik and and think it's the actual and the thing that's been corrupted by molok and they blame the blame the thing that's been corrupted that's when Muller gets and gets to do its power basically uh a hundred percent agree and then so people fall out of this trap all the time live don't they it's just blaming capitalism for for instance or blaming just nation states or a particular Nation or something like this and not blaming the the root Force which is this coordination failure and for game theory in this unhealthy competition problem well can I ask so we we've talked a lot about um um kind of uh the the idea of getting this into our heads individually and then we also talked briefly about um systemic um I I really feel like systems designers are the ones that we need to rely on to help us out of these types of situations and by that I mean I mean you were talking about the United States just just a minute ago I do feel like the systems designers of the US operating system that is the Constitution actually did a fairly good job thinking some of these things through and that that is something that I think um Americans and and you know people all over the world should be kind of like proud of and should look to as a success like the idea of the Bill of Rights we have individual rights and the idea of this kind of balance of powers through three separate uh branches of governments that one can't go molecule and and take control over the other one um this is a pretty good idea um I feel like sometimes uh live we are all running so fast and in creating our new you know social apps and our new technologies and even honestly uh bankless listeners are crypto Proto calls that we're not thinking about the system design and the externalities that these things might cause I don't know if you have any thoughts on that but like imagine if our social media designers the people who who wired up like the zuckerbergs of the world who wired up you know Facebook and um you know Twitter and all the social apps had looked a little farther I had had the foresight to see some of the problems down the road how might they have designed their systems better um that to me is one way out of this is we have to get better system designers and systems designed that are designed with kind of long-term societal benefit uh you know in place rather than kind of these short-term things they need to be adaptive because they can't be rigid they need to be adaptive as well yeah do you have any thoughts for us there is there like any any hope is there like a school of thought Within game theory which is just like people thinking about designing social networks or designing Technologies or designing social protocols even for the long run and so that we don't screw ourselves over all the time in terms of sets of rules um well you absolutely touch nail on the head there David was saying about adaptability that flexibility adaptability is is key because if you have the you do need the ability to amend those rules if it looks like the landscape is changing in a way where it's now favoring molokova win-win um this is going to sound super cliched so I we might even want to just not I'll just say it um some of the best set of rules that I've ever seen that created the closest thing to like a protopion because I hate the word Utopia is Utopia is bad because again Utopia defines some kind of fixed end state that it's like a goal that you get to and then once you're there everything's done no that's that's that's actually hell protobe is where things are evolving and going and going and and will always there's always option for better and and Improvement and adaptability again um foreign like it I remember when I went there and I was super skeptical like that like everyone's singing but it's Praises how it's like there's a wonderful thing I was like it's a stupid hippie [ __ ] I got there and I was like man humans are rad like this is what humans can do in the right circumstances with the right design I've never been more entertained in my life I've never learned more in my life I've never been more shocked in my life never had my like paradigms and I'm not because I just did a bunch of psychedelics like it's truly I've taken people about it my parents there who did nothing and they came away like I like did not know that that was possible and the thing is is that it's based off a set of core principles Like rules basically like these cleverly designed starting conditions kind of like the Constitution which have tried if they've tried to sort of build a thing out of the an abundance mindset instead of a scarcity mindset so things like everything is people think it's about bartering no it's about gifting it's like someone needs something if I've got it here you yeah if I've got Surplus yeah of course here just have it you don't expect anything return so that's one of the rules of gifting man yeah implied social contracts yeah it's right but you're right it's just a it's a guideline it's a guideline gifting take it bring if you can more than you need so that if someone is in need of something you can you can help them out so it's there is no bartering there is no expectation it's giving something without expectation you might get something in return great if not you've helped someone out one wonderful there's still a win-win the other thing there's like 10 of these principles uh you know there's like radical self-expression um don't leave trash you know the city stuff like that but I mean real real stuff but not important uh but another key one is decommodification it is there is no sponsorship you are not you are not there like that is like a cardinal sin though if you were to like flap a Coke you're a DJ who wants to be paid and you know DJs perform there for free really big DJs because there is no exchange of money going on you are not selling a commodity um there are there's nothing commercial nothing whatsoever because that is one of the problems with capitalism is again it reduces something of value down to a single metric and it's also more lucky okay because if somebody does it then we all got to do it right exactly because now they like the arms race has started you know and that's how you get the competitive advantage and yet there are still plenty of spaces people are playing games there like zero thumb games so there is something to this idea of having smart guiding principles like the Constitution or like the you know the Burning Man thingies to do to from which a good system will start to emerge but this is where I I don't mean to defer to others um to like answer this question but I really recommend you have Jordan Hall Daniel schwaxenburger get them on and ask them this same question because they those are the guys who have been thinking about this exact question of like what are the system design process um particularly in crypto that can that can give rise to the kind of infrastructures that we need these a completely novel form of Institutions essentially is where that we can do this collective intelligence you know decision making basically Hive minding these really tough problems and find easier ways to to coordinate and essentially change the landscape in favor of of human flourishing instead of Badness so um that's what I would say unfortunately that's it's good living so okay so David and I are coming into this episode the beginning of 2023 right and um we've had to ask ourselves some serious questions I think particularly uh at the toward the end of 2022 about crypto because here's this technology that we believe in so much that is human empowering you hold your own private Keys you hold your own assets isn't that amazing the idea of decentralized Finance for instance no banks no intermediary it's just kind of you in the code and the protocol and you can exchange back in and forth anybody around the world with internet access gets access to all of these systems the best banking system in the world you know it's phenomenal the idea of a Dao is anyone can create a permissionless capital structure pulled together and create some sort of weird quirky idea like like like a burning man for instance only online turn your Discord room into sort of a some collective to to accomplish some purpose it's all magical and yet what we found in 2022 is guess who took advantage of this um scammers right uh fraudsters people who are playing pump and dump schemes SBF um this is just like moloch instantiated in a world where we had hoped would be a solution to moloch and so we end last year 2022 and we begin 2023 kind of asking ourselves this question of like once again for crypto is how does our industry not fall in these small traps how do we design better systems so that we can actually go out to the rest of the world and be like hey there's something cool here we have fixed a portion of banking why it's because all of our decentralized finance protocols completely open source you can audit them you can see the assets that back them so there's no possibility for fraud so anyway I I guess there's some some existential crisis I think in crypto right now which is like we've created these Fantastic Tools where everyone can do all of these things but we worry sometimes that we've enabled scammers to just do all of these things and take advantage of us and uh you know the story is not fully written on that problem yet but that's where we set the beginning of 2023 hmm yeah it's it seems like you know and I I don't think crypto should be too hard on itself as a community because every new community and Technology will be in some way vulnerable to this that's the thing there are these core facets of human nature unfortunately that May or I mean maybe someday we will evolve out of them but it ain't happening anytime soon and the mistake that the crypto Community has made like almost every other community in the past that you know runs into some kind of Crisis is that it was too Pie in the Sky it was essentially naive and thinking like oh we've got the answer just decentralize everything um and and it will you know that that is the answer and we don't need to worry about the the sort of edge cases or like the Psychopaths that will come and co-opt it but the trouble is that there will like what is it the percentage it's like something like one percent of people have these Psychopathic traits um and no infrastructure will be robust if it doesn't factor in if it doesn't design itself in a way that these one percenters can't push the ball down the hill push the ball off the top of the hill and so I don't know I I mean crypto will come out of this stronger provided that people are honest with themselves about okay these are the mistakes we made we were too Pie in the Sky um and you know but at the same time not too hard on themselves because ultimately it was like you know these Bad actors that came and did this but you have the responsibility if you're trying to design an entire new Financial system don't delude yourself about human nature because there will always be the Psychopaths that will come and try and defect unfortunately uh you just need to Define design your infrastructure so that they're they're their behavior is constrained and ideally that you design incentive structures as well whether by it even plays on there you know if you can like if you can optimize so that the the the psychopath behavior is also actually then good for the system even better uh I don't know how you come to that but that's presumably possible too I'm sure it exists in possibility space and I'm sure we can therefore come up with it Liv I think that's a great advice I think what you're saying is um your encouragement crypto peoples live in that protopia rather than that Utopia right and um we have to adapt to that um this has been fantastic and I gotta say and we have Dave myself uh and I'm sure many bankless listeners we love the way you think it's very like crypto aligned way of thinking kind of a super rationalist way of thinking uh and is tremendously helpful I think for for what we're doing the space and what we're all trying to do I guess um to kind of close this out if you could sum up everything you've learned from moloch and give us kind of some words uh for for moving forward and sort of the takeaways of this episode there's one thing you want folks to take away from this episode about moloch uh what would that be yeah one thing that's popping up is the idea of um the city but like molok starts at home okay let me rephrase that win-win starts at home because that's let's shift let's shift the perspective here while I agree that this the audience listening to this right now is more empowered than the average audience I would ever speak to or any of us would speak to to actually think about this like systems design stuff um it's very very important you cannot design a good system if you are not living the win-win mindset and you're not integ you're not in Integrity with that in yourself and that doesn't mean that you're not going to screw up like like I do molecule stuff all the time but the point is like like I've I've reduced a lag time with which I notice when I do it you know like again there's no Perfection I'm not talking about become magically and you you're not allowed to build a new system until you yourself is perfectly enlightened no I'm not saying that but a to this thing that we need to build will emerge it's going to start emerging by itself out of the people who are living this integral like living in integrity and and like just trying to imbibe this win-win vibe um which sounds again very hand wavy but it's a a very strong intuition but that is the case so um just yeah just start paying attention to the the to the little micro things where you where you catch yourself sacrificing stuff in order to win a quick goal um and they have some faith that this thing will emerge um which I'm confident it will out of out of this community I love this great advice I'm just curious as we close for for you personally it sounds like you've uh you started in place in your life where you've been in uh in stuck in the unhealthy competition Zone and you've maybe matured and and um uh gotten more wisdom on that account and you're in you know a place where you know it's more healthy type competition was moloch part of that Journey or how did you make that transition personally in in in kind of your life from somebody who's maybe competitive which is good but channeling that competition towards healthy competition rather than unhealthy yeah I just started building the muscle of looking for you know even when I busted out of a poker tournament I was feeling really shitty and like oh I screwed up or someone who I viewed as a kind of competitor to me in poker like that for more like concrete monarchy thing like feeling jealous at someone else's success because I like you know felt like oh well they're stars shining brighter so therefore mine's not you know that's a really monarchy thing that kind of jealousy when it doesn't even need to be jealousy um just like building the muscle of going like okay but there's probably a way that this you know if I'm just not being imaginative enough to see how over the long run this thing could also benefit me you know me busting out this tournament because I played Aces wrongly or something like that where is you know it's almost like pathological optimism like what there has to be a win in here somewhere that I can extract if I just make the boundary of the game big enough um and I don't know it just it was just long as I got older it became easier you know I think it generally speaking it becomes easier to for people who have lived more of life and seen that the thing that seems like a loss in the in right now and that is usually a there's usually something positive that can come from this if I if I just look hard enough so yeah it's just about it was just it was just practice and getting older honestly you know I'm 38 I'm almost 39 like I don't know just give it time you'll it'll come to you I'm not sure somebody um needed to hear that after 2022 and some uh some crypto losses maybe in their portfolios as well that that's a great Learning lesson pathological optimism I love that phrase uh live thanks so much for hanging out with us and talking all about moloch we appreciate you oh can you also tell folks about your YouTube channel where they can catch um the newest episode that you're doing
