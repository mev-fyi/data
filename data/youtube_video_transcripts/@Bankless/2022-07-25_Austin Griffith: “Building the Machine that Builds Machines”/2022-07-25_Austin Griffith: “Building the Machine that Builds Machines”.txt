like the pied piper of ethereum developers over here where are you leading your troop of developers hopefully it's not a traditional top-down structure we're trying to build like a hyper-structure of education and building trying to build the machine that builds machines right we want to have a self-fulfilling system in a lot of ways where there's more and more developers coming in and they love to contribute like all of them are just like this was such a good program how do i contribute back how do i do more and it's like go build something and let's turn it into a challenge i think the overall goal is lots of devs coming into the space having the right tools in education to go on and do their own thing but if they do want to contribute back having a system that allows them to do so in a way that keeps the machine going kind of builds more challenges and builds more community
