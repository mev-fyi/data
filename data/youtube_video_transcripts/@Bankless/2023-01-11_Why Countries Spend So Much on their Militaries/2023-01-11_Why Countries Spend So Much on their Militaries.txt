the concept of nation-state militaries at large it would be great if we could invest in infrastructure and education and child mortality and nutrition and we do invest in those things but how much we invest in military far dwarfs that let's start with a blank slate and we have two agents in this game and each one's a nation state whichever nation state invests more into their military can gobble up the other one and then we end up in the state that we are today with like enough nuclear warheads to blow up the world 10 times over and they're all at like you know there's just a button away and it's also why we can't have nuclear dearment because no one wants to be the country without the nuclear weapon you can't just check out the game if you want to be like oh okay we're going to become radically hippie country you're just going to get invaded that's that's the trouble
