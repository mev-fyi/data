[Music] welcome to banqus where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here once again with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we have a fantastic episode this is our second in a series where we're tackling the top three d5 protocols this is how to go bankless with unit swap what are we going to cover david and why is it important we are going to cover the complete scope of the uniswap protocol which is not a small feat while uniswap is very simple the uniswap rabbit hole goes very very deep there's a lot of layers to uni-swap that it goes beneath the surface and we're going to peel back all of those layers and explore all of them in this episode yeah this is going to be fantastic uniswap is cool because it is one of the most decentralized defy applications on that defy truss spectrum that we've talked about in previous episodes unit swap is not a bank it is not a company it's not a user interface this is a protocol it lives completely on ethereum completely on chain and the possibilities that it brings into the open finance ethereum economy are incredible um and we're going to dive into all of them but before we do want to take a minute to talk about our fantastic sponsors the first one is for our u.s listeners primarily so if you have an ira or a 401k a retirement account chances are it's jailed inside of your brokerage that means you don't have good access to crypto if you try to buy crypto inside of your brokerage it costs you 5x the price don't do that don't get ric ripped off what you want to do is break your retirement account out of brokerage jail rocket dollar can help you do that they'll set up what's called a self-directed ira or a self-directed 401k they'll help you with the paperwork they'll help you with the transfers they will help you get to a place where you can buy crypto on the spot market on coinbase or on gemini in a tax sheltered retirement account this is a fantastic a financial hack for you guys and if you go to rocketdollar.com you can get set up today just use the code bankless and you'll get fifty dollars off that's rocketdollar.com use the code bankless we have a new sponsor on the scene one of my favorite ethereum applications dydx is the leading and most performant decentralized exchange in crypto and the really amazing thing about dydx is like uniswap it is entirely on chain and so it is a non-custodial exchange where you are not trusting people with your money but you still get to access all of the cool features and services that you would expect from a centralized exchange things you can do on dydx are spot trading margin trading you can borrow eth you can borrow die you can lend eth you can lend die dydx has originated over a billion dollars in loans over the last year and a half a billion dollars in trading volume something pretty new and innovative that dydx is doing is they're bringing bitcoin into d5 through perpetual contract markets which it's not live yet it's starting it's launching in may so you can sign up for that alpha today you'll be able to use bitcoin inside of dydx inside of the application which which is pretty exciting i i like it whenever i see some sort of defy application starting to integrate bitcoin and the bitcoin price into their their product and services so we have a special offer for bank list listeners if you sign up with the bankless link you will get 10 off of trading fees using our referral link and that referral link is trade dot dydx dot exchange slash r bankless it's a bit of a mouthful so it's in the show notes if you want to go get it there dydx is one of my favorite protocols they really do it all they're basically anything you can do on ethereum you can also do inside of dydx so check them out okay before we dig into the episode let's talk some big picture stuff david so a couple things that are going on in in the crypto in the bankless sphere so the first is this coinbase is adding a d5 oracle so david i i got a question about this because i tweeted this out and um somebody said well ryan i mean doesn't this make oracles on defy in ethereum more centralized if a crypto bank like coinbase is providing an oracle what are your thoughts on that yeah it's an easy thing to slip into because you know anyone who's in d5 is always harping on centralized exchanges and that habit is easy to slip into but i would contend that this any further addition of more oracles always makes oracles more decentralized so it doesn't even matter if like the white house or the federal reserve provided an oracle for defy it's just one more oracle to add to the list and so this is really good news and and coinbase of all companies of all institutions is definitely aligned with the crypto vision and so you know their incentives are where we want them to be uh i was once having a conversation with a friend of mine talking about how you know the only way you can get bitcoin is on a centralized exchange uh and he countered with you know well if there are 30 different centralized exchanges all over the world that are very easy to get onto well then bitcoin is actually decentralized and so you know if if coinbase copies this model and then binance is also an oracle and gemini is also an oracle and huobi is also an oracle you know we start to have more and more options which with where we can get our oracles from and so we you know we're not we're not beholden to just using one oracle right the more oracles the better uh the really cool thing about this story was that um compound the the compound finance team was really pushing for this forever ago and i believe robert lescher had this tweet where he was talking about how centralized exchanges need to be oracles for the defy ecosystem uh and the the oracle standard the code or the the model of the oracle that coinbase used came from what compound published uh so tip of the hat to compound and robert lescher for for spearheading this a really long time ago and i'm glad it's now coming to fruition robert's gonna be our next show so episode 11 folks so uh tune in to that we'll we'll ask him about this too but yeah i um i tend to agree with you on this david so i think like if you look at the way the maker oracle works and that of course uh maintains the the peg four dye and and eth and is a is a key component of the entire maker system but it has a dozen or so different oracles some of these are known by operated by known entities some of these are operated by anonymous entities so say it's it's 12 or 15 oracles adding another one from coinbase and then taking the average price of all of those oracles that's net additive to the system it increases the decentralized nature of the system as you're saying because you are gaining an additional node an additional price source and you can still take the median across all of those price sources in order to get your ultimate uh make your oracle price so i tend to agree with you and we're actually going to be talking about another oracle design inside of this episode that is even more decentralized still uniswap actually can be used a byproduct of its exchange and trading capability is an actual price oracle and that can be used inside of these d5 systems too and further decentralizes the oracle so coinbase adding an oracle good news for d5 actually good news for decentralization and exactly as you say i think it will lead to all of the other exchanges incorporating creating a defy oracle in order to keep pace with coinbase coinbase has really shown their colors i think with uh the commitment to large amounts of usdc and usdc liquidity into defy applications and now with this defy oracle i'm pretty happy with with what coinbase how they're positioning themselves they're definitely defy friendly and having somebody like coinbase which is the leading exchange in the united states i would say uh you know making pretty bold statements about how they are d5 friendly a d5 friendly company is is pretty pretty cool i mean they they offer interest rates on your usdc in your coinbase account now those interest rates are extremely low it's like 1.5 percent but uh i i think your protocol sync thesis ryan where uh you know companies like gemini and coinbase uh integrate uh d5 applications like the dsr uh i i'm bullish on that and i think the the friendliness that coinbase is offering d5 is a good sign for that dude are we gonna do an episode on the protocol sync man absolutely 100 yeah so we're i'm giving a talk at the ethereal conference next week uh which actually so this is coming out on monday in may and so this my talk will be on thursday uh all about the protocol sync thesis and settlement assurances and so uh come and come to the ethereal conference and listen to that uh and then me and ryan are 100 going to do a an epic uh episode specifically about the protocol seeing thesis so it's going to be a good one yeah so i'm super i'm super excited about that conference david because not only do you have a talk on the protocol sync we have a panel called eath is money it's got you myself um eric connor anthony sassiano cami is is hosting it as well she's moderating it's going to be super exciting we're going to talk about a lot of the topics we talk about in bankless and apply those maybe there'll even be some debate about how eth is emerging as a money system but it's going to be a fun one you know another thing that we should probably talk about we recorded our episode with caleb on wednesday on that wednesday unit swap had what i might call its first initial uniswap listing like an iul almost like it it almost felt reminiscent of an ico so some of the very concepts that we talked about in our conversation with caleb we saw them play out in real time what was your take on what happened maybe you could just you know describe the listing itself and uh the token and then sort of what happened and then i'd be curious to hear your take david so i'm all for experimentation and this was definitely a very interesting experiment to run uh i think the outcome of this experiment is uh don't do this again uh i think it was not the right way to issue a token for a number of reasons uniswap is not a way to distribute a token uh the so and that's simply because and we saw this in the ico mania way back when uh the bat token sale was famous for uh selling out of the entire supply of the basic attention token in the first like three blocks and so that really rewarded technically adept people who were able to make a bot to make sure that their transaction got in on the first block and we saw that with the uma token listing on uniswap as well where people bought up a bunch of supply on the first block and then sold it on the third or fourth block after the listing and so this this isn't how you generate an aligned community an aligned uh set of people that are your stakeholders this is how you attract arbitragers and traders and people trying to make a a quick buck and so that that didn't look too good for me i think there were there were much better ways to issue a token in ways that are more long-term aligned with your company with your project and the community holding your token if you wanted to get your token into the hands of people the unit swap is not people that are stakeholders and want to see the best for your company i would not issue it through unit swap yeah and there you know there might be a better way that somebody can design a way to issue it in a more fair way in uniswap but to me this was not that so i know the uma token they started listing at basically their the price of their last raise so a market cap of uma tokens of 27 million which is high in and of itself when you consider um there are currently no cash flows that i'm aware of accruing to the token nor is there a product that we can get our hands on and use but but that aside that was raised with accredited investors and vcs and that sort of thing um but the the net outcome after this uniswap listing uh with a very small amount of supply so only about three percent of the total um a tokens were provided as liquidity the net outcome is that uma as a token is the number five defy money protocol token on the market at 121 million right now so i don't know that's a 5x uh or so of their last raise with vcs so it did whether intentional or not um this was definitely an experiment and you know give give the team the benefit of doubt um it's hard to know you know necessarily if this was intentional but it it uh it had the effect of pumping the price uh to a degree that is probably not sustainable long-term uh and is probably not conducive to growing a community um so we'll see how this plays out but you know there's a possibility here david i don't know if you agree or not but it's i was starting to get feelings of oh my god this is like ice like the very beginnings of ico mania again only it'll be conducted on on uniswap uh and um you know we just need to make sure that the community is informed and buys into assets if they're doing this that have long-term value accrual mechanisms and that are are fairly valued uniswap i guess is a easy place to issue a token because everyone knows what uniswapa is and it's really easy to go and buy a token so i guess in that sense it's making it more accessible because everyone knows how to buy and sell on uniswap so that like maybe an accessibility argument is to be made there but the the two to three percent of the total supply of the token made available on day one it's hard to excuse that in my opinion uh i i think we i you said that you know we don't really know if they were doing that intentionally or not i'm i'm gonna go ahead and be a little bit more critical than that i think that if they just decided that two percent was the right number and didn't think about the illiquidity that would uh result in uh just only two percent and then the the price pumping effect that comes from illiquidity would would follow i i i must i think we should assume that they definitely knew what they were doing and again it goes back to the issue of this is not how you generate an aligned community an aligned network of stakeholders but it is how you pump a token really really fast in the first few blocks and that's definitely what happened and so um this doesn't sit really too well with me over the long term i think our best defense as a community against this sort of thing is to make sure we understand very clearly the value accrual mechanisms of all of these assets things went absolutely bonkers in 2017 because people put fundamentals aside and value accrual mechanisms aside and they just chase the pump um on the bankless journey we're not about that you know this is about uh long-term uh fundamentals the growth the long-term growth of an industry and so uh you know pump mentals aren't something that we get really excited about so you know i definitely agree with you there so while we're talking about money verbs and d5 protocols here's one you absolutely have to check out this is a lending and borrowing protocol called ave what does it do you can put dye into it you can put eth into it it will take your diet will take your eat and it will transform that into an interest-bearing asset this is a great way to level up in the bankless money system you can also borrow from it we were talking about you borrowing from various protocols at a variable rate but this allows you to obvi allows you to borrow from it at a fixed rate so you know exactly what you're going to pay from one day to the next in one month to the next developers you've got to check out their flash loan protocols groups like d5 saver have integrated these into their protocols into their applications and created a lot of value go to ave.com and deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing that's aave.com try it out on your bankless journey you might find that your bankless account is storing more value than your bank account but you still need to buy things at the grocery store you still need to go out and on friday nights and if all your money is in the crypto world uh well you're ahead of the times but you still need to live your life and that's where monolith can help you out the monolith defy card is a way to keep your funds in the bankless universe while still being able to buy things in the real world the monolith visa card is accepted wherever visa is which is like the whole world and it lets you use your die as it's supposed to be as money as a way to pay for things so go to monolith.xyz and check out their defy card check out their rates the defy card is a smart contract wallet which is something that we definitely have to get into as to what that is on bankless but it's a really cool way to protect your funds and still be able to use them so go to monolith.xyz and get your divi card today well without further ado david we should get to our episode with caleb on the uniswap protocol this is how to go bankless with uniswap welcome to our episode on uniswap this is going to be fantastic uh david and i are here with caleb sheridan he works at blocklytics which is a data analysis and services company that focuses on protocols like uniswap he knows a lot about it caleb could you just begin by telling us a bit about your journey uh in ethereum in sort of the bankless space and how you stumbled across uniswap sure just as unisop was launching i heard vitalik speaking at east london and he mentioned uniswap as one of these common goods projects that was released that did not use a token model and it was right right as i was founding my company blocklytics and so it seemed kind of obvious to go and explore this project that vitalik mentioned as soon as i saw it and i saw the simplicity of it i just got sucked in and and went and uh did as much research as possible on on the protocol and have been following along ever since so the unit swap without a token is something that that caught your eye what else about unit swap caught your eye and maybe also about ethereum at large uh ethereum is fundamentally useful i mean at this point there are things that you can do on ethereum with cryptocurrency that you know we've we've kind of been dreaming about for years and one of those was swapping tokens really easily and so getting into uh getting into uniswap and seeing this public good that was available that made token swaps easily accessible for individuals was was kind of eye-opening i think before that uh before uniswap even the user interfaces and the user experience of doing token swaps was really difficult it would involve like going on centralized exchanges giving them personal information personal details waiting for 30 40 50 confirmations to make a deposit and only then kind of dealing with uh order book uh layouts and order books um and then at the end of all of that you know the the money that was on the centralized exchanges was a lot of times out of risk and so if you look at kind of when unisol came out how the market was for trading tokens and then this this clean product with you know you you have ether and you want this other token you know just pick the amounts and hit swap it was it was really eye-opening and refreshing and that that kind of got me into the rabbit hole of unisoc it was just the simplicity behind it and the fact that it was this public good really um helping helping users out accomplish this simple thing of swapping tokens this is cool so so caleb let's let's dive into those first two so the first one you mentioned is exchanging and trading right so this is basically a function that in the in the more centralized exchange the crypto bank world a coin base or a binance might do for you with with some sort of an order book right um but and then the second is actually providing liquidity let's dive into the first so so folks you know kind of understand how this works so if let's say i have a position in die so that's a stable coin we talked about in episode nine with marion mariano conte um so let's say i have dye and i want to exchange that for ether uh how does it work what are the the fees for that process am i interacting with an order book of any kind is there like a peer-to-peer transfer going on or how do i tap into that liquidity sure so uniswap is a is a decentralized exchange where users can swap ether and erc20 tokens the exchange itself is funded by its users in many cases it's funded by the same people who are swapping tokens they become liquidity providers who who make the whole thing run and provide liquidity for traders so you know long story short uniswap is this uh decentralized exchange ecosystem where traders and liquidity providers kind of all all work together uh to build to build financial markets between uh different cryptocurrencies and different tokens on ethereum i definitely remember the the days of 2018 when uniswap came out where you know i had my binance account and i'm pretty sure the last time i've logged into binance was the day that unit swap came out um and i became immediately a little bit more bankless as a result so i definitely resonate with that uh so let's start with um some definitions and i think we have a kind of a fun game ahead of us uh can you explain uniswap in 10 sentences and then i'm going to ask you to explain it in one sentence but let's start with 10 sentences or a paragraph if you can so the first option with unit swap then the first thing that many people see on the page is that you can swap ether for tokens and there's an extensive list of tokens uh which we'll get into in a few minutes uh this is kind of the most at its core this is this is the service that uniswap is providing end users you can swap any given token for ether and you can even swap any given token for any other given token the second thing you can do with uniswap is you can provide liquidity and when you provide liquidity you take ownership of a given exchange pair and you you you share a portion of the fees that that exchange pair generates with every with all of the other owners so in this case liquidity providers are are providing liquidity to facilitate trades and collecting fees as as part of the protocol unit swap isn't just one thing there's a bunch of different ways that you can use uniswap so can you go through kind of the the various options that uniswap provides people what can you actually do with the application when you make a trade uh or when when liquidity providers provide liquidity to uniswap in this case the etherdie pair liquidity providers provide ether and die into a smart contract and the smart contract holds those two assets in balance whenever a trader comes through and wants one of the assets from the pair so in this case die for ether they provide the smart contract with dye and then they take back an amount of ether that the smart contract kind of just calculates on their behalf so this is this is called like a a price curve or something like that you might have heard it called a bonding curve which is like a maybe a questionable term terminology for it but the point is that the price is determined by the smart contract and the price is determined by the ratio of assets that are that are inside of that smart contract whenever a trader does whenever a trader makes a trade with a smart contract they essentially give it a surplus of one of the assets like die and they take out some of the eth from the smart contract and here two things happen one is that the user pays a small fee which sits which goes back into the small smart contract so the user pays at the moment point zero three percent of the of a fee uh in in eth in this case and then that addition that each sits in the smart contract and uh and is essentially distributed as a fee to all the liquidity providers of that smart contract balance the second thing that happens is that price changes for future trades so because because you've in this case traded die for eth uh you've you've changed the rate ratio of assets within the smart contract and so the new price for whoever comes after you to trade is going to be based on that new ratio of what what you kind of uh depending on your trade size i think you were just about to tell us so so you're not really trading caleb with an order book right you're almost training trading with a smart contract some kind of a like a you called it a bonding curve yeah that's exactly right you're trading with a smart contract and the idea is that this ratio of assets always needs to be held in a constant uh to a constant product uh in this case so this uh pricing curve it it has a unique property in that as as an asset is removed or added uh a nut the the second asset or the asset pair is increases and the really unique property about kind of the model that uniswap came out with is that this curve you know if if you plot it on x and y you would see that it looks kind of like um like a like a square root um but but essentially this this curve uh goes to infinity on the y and and goes to infinity uh without touching zero on the x and the idea is that you know if you deposit one eighth and 200 die today in the smart contract uh that contract no matter how many trades are made or what like size trades are made the smart contract will never run out of of those assets it's just that what will happen over over a bunch of trades in one direction is that the more popular asset will get more and more expensive and so the idea is that you know this this kind of promotes trades up to a certain point and then the price shifts and then it it supports trades uh back down to like that assets kind of market value or real value uh external to the system so to make this so to make this really tangible caleb right so um if if i am on the dye heath pair and i'm doing a small amount of dye you know say a hundred dollars worth of dye um you know that that kind of curve that you described is not going to be impacted so much so i'll probably get a pretty good price for that uh die so uh or for that eth so the price might be comparable to something i could get on an exchange slippage is a word we might use for that that would be pretty low it would cost me maybe you know point three percent so 30 basis points in unit swap fees but my slippage would probably be comparable to to that of an order book exchange like a coin base but if i really ramp up that volume and say i'm making a major purchase i'm a you know a large market maker and i'm purchasing a million dollars worth of eath with my die what happens in that case what's my slippage like yeah and in this pool right now the east dive pool has about a little bit over six million dollars of liquidity in it uh and so the slippage on a 100 trade would be very negligible and as you said you would essentially just pay the exchange fee the slippage on a much larger trade would increase and it increases at an increasing rate so the bigger your trade is the more slippage you would have and in this case you might have like 50 slippage or something like that and so for for these pools that uh but but that's not to say that you know this is not for for big traders or it's only for tiny uh traders who want to trade 10 or 20 at a time these pools are actually supporting trades of up to 100 grand with very very low slippage and the beauty of these pools is that those trades happen instantly they happen in one transaction there's no making a deposit to an exchange and you know eating up the order book or any of that so if you really look at the slippage on even big trades uniswa in these deep markets are are really it is really really competitive even with popular order based markets uh you know i find that i i'm just in awe that the the system has gotten to that point where liquidity has grown to a point that that unisoc can be your only exchange uh and that's that's one of the amazing things about watching uh this protocol grow in particular and get to this stage of you know being suitable for all kinds of traders and i would say that you know if you're really sensitive to slippage and you want to avoid it at all cost the way to do that is just spread your trades out over time right so take take your one million dollar trade and spread it out over a few days or a few weeks doing like a small fraction of it at once and really watching the amount of slippage that uh is affecting you but i think that you would be surprised at how much uh volume unispot can handle in terms of uh these deep pools how has the liquidity in uniswap changed over time uh can you kind of uh illustrate that graph for our listeners sure uh uniswap being a uniswap liquidity provider it it's not easy to understand what your returns will be so it's it's based off of demand for a token that is hard to anticipate and it's also based off the relative price of two assets so if you're just looking at the unisoc ether dipole you're you're kind of the price of each external to unit swap really matters and really affects you and and essentially what what liquidity providers are doing in order to uh collect this this trading fee is they're depositing their liquidity in such a way and promising to make trades and fulfill trades in such a way that it can actually kind of cost them money in the long term so in other words a unisop liquidity provider does not get the option to not take a trade that you know looks bad compared to the current market rate and so what may happen is that you know uniswap liquidity providers uh take a bunch of bad trades in a row uh and and the price ratio causes this this phenomenon called impermanent loss but it is called a permanent loss because the price ratio can always return and then the liquidity provider is not actually realizing that loss it's just that on paper the liquidity provider may take a few bad trades in a row and take some loss so this is to say that anticipating returns as a liquidity provider is quite difficult but what we've done at blocklytics is is kind of tried to say okay well what have the historical returns been and what does demand look like today um and and so we we do provide that uh kind of historical those historical returns on our website pools.fyi but in general this this is kind of one of the the difficulties of of being a of being a liquidity provider and having people kind of choose whether or not to be a liquidity provider it's a very hard question to answer despite that over time as as people have watched liquidity grow in unit swap and as people have watched the returns on these uniswap pools we have seen liquidity growing over time and so there was a slight uh in east terms especially because our each you know swap liquidity pool is denominated in each in east terms we've we've just seen new more and more highs uh and at one point it was looking at it on a weekly basis it just it just never dropped every single week was was a new high for the amount of liquidity in unison and i and now that there's a long history of looking at previous returns and what happens in different types of markets i think that people are more comfortable with getting involved and accepting that there may be a little bit of impermanent loss but in many many markets the trading fees have historically made up for that and and so right now we're kind of very close to an all-time high in terms of liquidity even after a lot of liquidity was removed following black thursday uh and then obviously in in dollar terms we would be very close to an all-time high at this point as well let's touch on impermanent loss a little bit more and and then also every single uniswap pool has two assets in it right and so each each unit swap pool is its own characteristic what types of uniswap pools would see impermanent loss more than others yeah great question um i'll i'll break this down into maybe three types of pools and you know broadly speaking everything everything more or less falls into one of these three types so the first type is two assets like eath and die which are not necessarily uh inherently linked or inherently related uh and and you may you may have a personal opinion on where the price of eth in terms of dye is going in the future but but there's no kind of reason why it can't go up and then you know come back to this price or whatever the case is so in in this type of pool where where the two assets are kind of uh separate or non-correlated the the impermanent loss is kind of just that like you you may check your account balance one day and see that you've suffered a lot of impermanent loss and come back the next day uh and see that you've you have no one permanent loss anymore and so the idea is that this this loss which which is what you risk as a liquidity provider uh it it it comes in and it kind of goes away in in in pools like unit swap eats die there's another type of pool uh which is what what i would refer to as kind of a stable pool uh where it's an example of this is the uniswap eth and synthetics youth pool and the idea behind this is that you take two assets that you know should have the same value and because they should have you know the same value are very very close to the same value uh you know by definition there can really be no and permanent loss unless there's some catastrophic breaking of the peg so in this case seth is loosely tied to eth but broadly speaking you know trades within within a range that's that's very close to uh within a range that's very close to one uh one to one ratio so in this case you know traders just collect uh trading fees and they don't really have too much risk of a permanent loss uh and in these cases you know we see that the the growth of this pool has kind of spoken for itself so historically you know this has been one of the biggest pools ever uh one of the other biggest pools ever is the uniswap east to raft youth pool which also is is a pegged asset and what we see is that you know traders are collecting uh reasonable returns in those pools and and so far not really feeling much in permanent loss at all uh because the exchange rate has has remained very very steady and very very close to one the third type of pool that i'll just mention quickly is is a pool where the token is designed to be inflationary or designed to be deflationary in this case you know there's a huge risk of impermanent loss and so this would be things like uh interest bearing tokens uh or certain deflationary tokens uh that have that have kind of shown up over over the past year or so uh and these these tokens essentially are designed in their mechanics to you know gain value uh and against eth and so what what that causes is you know these are much more at risk of or the liquidity providers are much more at risk of impermanent loss if the token is designed to uh change in ratio grow or or decrease in ratio against uh eath so for example in like compound tokens uh you know these make very poor pairs against each because ultimately you know the exchange rate of a compound token only increases and therefore you know it doesn't hold that same property of mitigating and permanent loss the way that wrapped ether or synthetic does this it's so super cool i mean i i think we'll talk about this a lot uh the the idea of permissionlessness so anyone can go in and make a trade and just as everything you were talking about about becoming a liquidity pool provider anyone can do that it's permissionless there's no identity required you just have to have the assets um you know 50 of each in a pool and deposit those assets and then you are effectively a liquidity provider and different pools give you various rates of return so if someone wants to increase their eth denominated returns for example maybe an eth type pool might be might be for them maybe an eth dipole um but but you're in the data every day caleb can you tell us where the big opportunities are for being a uniswap liquidity provider so if i want to take my ether and i want to make more eath you know which pool should i deposit into if i want to take my diet and make more die out of it where should i go for people who uh let's say like want to stay so that i guess the the best pools for brand new users to kind of try out and dip their toes in are definitely the ones without them permanent loss uh you you you know or with limited and permanent loss or mitigated and permanent loss so the popular pools like east seth and etheraptis are great examples of this where where it kind of starts to get tricky is let's say that if you care about your returns in terms of eth and you want to stay exposed to eath to join to be a liquidity provider in the east dipole would require that you trade in half of your eath for dye and so you lose out on any upside on on half of your liquidity pool deposit i think that for a lot of people that is uh has been sort of a deal breaker now that said there are ways of you know using maker using some of these other systems to deposit eth in order to generate the dye that you need and then deposit eath and the generated die against you another a different youth deposit into these pools and then stay completely exposed to eat and one of the teams that's doing great work on making that process really straightforward and simple is defy's app that kind of takes all of these different money legos and combines them in such a way to give users at that end that end exposure that they want but i'll just say the the important thing to kind of figure out as a liquidity provider is what do you want to earn money in or what what is your underlying kind of how are you going to count your your victory right and so if that's if you're really concerned about just stacking heath that's one strategy if you're really concerned about tracking wins in terms of die that's that might be a different strategy and so i think kind of internalizing that and figuring that out as a liquidity provider is almost as important as uh picking or even more important than picking out the which pool to join or whatever the case is yeah so so we're definitely all about our stacking of eth in the in the bankless uh program it is you know the reserve currency of of upside for this entire space uh for sure but but uh increasing die denominated returns is also interesting and i want to jump on that point that you mentioned uh with defy's app so that gives you the ability to essentially supply liquidity to these pools in one click in one transaction uh we'll include a tactic about defies app and how that works in the show notes but if you're just getting started that's a really cool way to do it it makes it um incredibly easy but like what are you seeing lately so what kind of returns are we talking about on eth or with dye caleb so are we talking like you know one to two percent returns on eath over say a 90 day period and and you know how about die and how does that compare out there to other d5 critical opportunities yeah um in in terms of high volatility the east dipole just outperforms everything and it's it's not even close and so kind of where um it just outperforms kind of holding eth in many many cases and you can look at the historical returns to see where this kind of breaks down but ultimately if in some cases it is possible that you know if you had held your deposit separately or if you had held your ears separately you would have done better than the pool and like today that that's the case over the past 30 days uh you actually would have done better to just hold eth than than be a east die liquidity provider but if you look back kind of historically and over long periods of time there's no question that unit swap ethize is a much better uh option for certain users so the the returns that we're talking about uh kind of vary and over long periods of time uh we're talking better returns than what's possible on lending protocols for example so over a long period of time what you're essentially doing is you're taking a bet on the transaction volume of uniswap because every time there's a uniswap trade you earn a portion of the fees you earn like 0.3 right so you're betting at some level on uniswap over the long run but over the short run it's sort of a a gamble based on the volatility of eth right that's right and if you if you look at you know the we spoke about impermanent loss and if you kind of look over the race that liquidity providers are are looking at is am i going to earn enough in fees to cover whatever permanent loss happens to me over a certain period and if you look over a long enough period you know in theory you'll have like infinite trading fees that you collect and your permanent loss will be you know reasonable uh and so uh over like an infinite period you know you could say that okay well this is definitely gonna outperform but obviously you know infinite is a really long time but even if you look at over the last 90 days compared to eth so if you provided liquidity 90 days ago and you cashed it out today you would have earned an equivalent apr of 60 on top of or above holding youth so in in east terms you know these are very very good returns um and uh and i think like that's you know that's the underlying theme that's common in all of these pools is that the longer you hold and the longer that you're a liquidity provider the more fees you can collect and kind of even out the short-term variance of the price ratio of the assets so we've been talking about impermanent loss and using uniswap as an investment tool providing liquidity to various uh token pairs in order to you know collect that fee uh and and get a passive return on your income but there are other ways and other reasons to provide liquidity um and at realty for example every time we release a property we put it on unit swap but then we also seed it with our own liquidity and we don't really we don't do that looking because we're looking for a return we're looking to do that simply to provide liquidity and and one of the really powerful things about uniswap is its permissionless ability to list an asset and then also its permissionless ability to provide liquidity can you just comment on that oh absolutely uh uniswap has over 2000 liquidity pools and that number on a daily basis is just growing and the idea is that anybody can come through and listen asset and what you guys have done with realty is really amazing uh and even in your case you know that that's an asset that um has a white list and has has kind of a permission set up uh and it just kind of works with unisop uh and so you know you the you don't have to give up your permission uh uh logic in your token to to make it work with uniswap and that's a really amazing thing and so there are a number of tokens like that that just kind of work with uniswap really well and what what we kind of see is that users are have started to sell goods and services on the on the network and one of the early examples of this was from the uniswap team itself who sold socks in a token called socks in order to kind of raise a little bit of money for their company so what they did is they minted 500 sox tokens added a little bit of eth and then let let this limited edition good go off and and start trading uh of course the token could always be redeemed for physical socks uh but what's happened is is maybe more amazing the the the price here just kind of went up and like at the moment uh socks cost quite a bit and so what started at 12 uh is now in the hundreds of dollars for a pair of socks uh the long as initial liquidity providers you know the team is just earning fees on on each of these trades uh but what's amazing is is more that you know they produced this limited edition good and then immediately went went and found the market for it uh and naturally the the price of a limited edition good just kind of went up and up and up with demand until some of the first buyers who maybe bought it at twelve dollars uh decided to sell it at like forty eighty one hundred twenty dollars uh to other people who wanted to hold these limited edition goods so if you're talking about something like price discovery on limited edition goods uh this is an amazing tool to do it because as there's more demand and as there's more purchases uh the price goes up and so you meet uh you you kind of you kind of find out what the real price of of this limited edition good should be or can be many teams have kind of followed in suit and in fact we've seen people selling their time or even things like retweets or legal advice or whatever the case is and and so there are many of these kind of goods and services uh now available on uniswap and i think that's why we're seeing a lot of new markets created and you know quite a lot of innovation in the space one of my favorites is is a the cafe token which is a limited edition uh batch of coffee that was that was pre-sold on uniswap and then the tokens themselves could be redeemed for four bags of coffee beans and that type of uh you know coming up with a product making a token for it uh adding it on uniswap and instantly getting a market for your goods is really incredible and really amazing uh and one of the key feature about you know this this that makes this protocol work really well for uh maybe the long tail of assets who otherwise maybe you know this this could have been too much work to set up an online store or they didn't want to quite go through the process of uh signing up for like uh uh credit card payments or whatever the case is instead they you know create tokenized assets add them on uniswap and then uh collect uh their sales in eth and then the over the long term you know if that asset is really popular in trades a lot they also just keep on collecting trading fees which is which is incredible so how does this compare to you know bootstrapping liquidity on something like banknotes or a centralized exchange an order book based exchange if the uni-sox team uniswap with their unisox wanted to get liquidity for their their sox token how would they even do that was that even possible before uniswap uh very difficult and i think at the time you know with that uni swap is coming out we were hearing stories of uh token listings costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and compare that to maybe two dollars worth of gas that you pay to create one of these markets maybe uh a handful of each and tokens that you minted to get the market started i mean from that aspect it's it's really amazing uh what's possible here uh i think that you know when it when it does come to kind of bootstrapping networks uh there have been a few teams that have done it really well uh and to be honest maker and the maker token and the die token used uniswap as one of the primary kind of liquidity vehicles so in a time before they were these tokens were listed everywhere you know unesco had some of the deepest liquidity and still have some of the deepest liquidity uh for dying maker do you know i want to sort of test this thesis uh with you caleb and you you do david so i was trying to think i mean uniswap has really taken off like a rocket as a d5 protocol like just growing massively its volume in in march was uh incredible i think beyond what a lot of people expected so like like the question is why why was it so successful why is it you know kind of this 10x improvement from alternatives and one reason i came up with so at first i thought well maybe it's because it's more decentralized more censorship resistant and those things are true but the one thing that sticks out to me and everything that you're just talking about is its permissionlessness so the fact that anybody can list a token on the exchange it's it's almost reminiscent of you know the early internet where you had closed platforms like aol where you have to ask their permission to sort of list websites or you know in the yahoo directory someone kind of you know lis lists a website versus the open internet which lets anyone publish a website uh anywhere at any time and then you know the best websites essentially rise to the top it creates this long tail of of really interesting niche websites but also this constant churn of you know the most successful websites rising at this top this uniform bonus does that with with assets and i think the key part about it is permissionlessness what do you think about that caleb yeah i do agree and i think what what uniswap has done quite well is made it really simple to go through these steps of of creating a permissionless market and permissionless doesn't just mean people i mean it does in a sense but the other aspect of having a permissionless market is that it's extremely easy to integrate uniswap into other products and so what we've seen is like one of the driving factors in uniswap's growth in terms of volume is is definitely its its ability for other projects to integrate it and and facilitate and and send trades to uniswap in order in order to make their own platforms better and improve their own user experiences i think what you're saying caleb is that uniswap almost exists as this infrastructure for other money protocols it's almost like we we've talked in a couple of episodes about some of these money protocols d5 protocols being almost like emergent organisms and uniswap is almost a an emergent organism that eats assets like eath and dye for example and spits out liquidity and then it provides that liquidity as a pool for all of the other d5 protocols so what you're saying is it's you know they can all the other d5 protocols can tap into them and then bootstrap their own liquidity have a a censorship resistant unstoppable um way essentially to to trade assets and that's all been added into the ethereum uh superstructure as david would call it like this this kind of super organism now not only do we have a store value reserve asset like ether we also have a liquidity machine a liquidity robot on top of that that is also um unstoppable in the same way that ethereum is now i want to dig into that though like like censorship resistant and unstoppable because we we talked in an episode about the the d5 trust spectrum and we we talked about uniswap being on sort of the the far end of the the most decentralized and the most autonomous uh side of the d5 trust syste spectrum because it really is kind of just just code uh and it doesn't require human intervention or human governance to run but like i want to ask you caleb is uniswap really autonomous and really unstoppable and like things like the user interface or the team or even the you know the uniswap dot io or dot exchange excuse me a domain name are those vectors of centralization and you know could those be stopped the unit swap smart contracts and the swap factory cannot be stopped there's no there's nothing in it that you know there's no button that somebody can press to turn off those smart contracts you know we did see that the uniswap team restricted access to their website and their exchange system to a certain list of countries but you know what happened in the day's followings was really amazing to see so different community members around published their own versions of uniswap on ipfs and made made those available on ipfs so the underlying smart contracts there's no off button there's no off switch or anything like that it's just that you know the the website in this case uh unisoft.exchange was restricting access to some countries uh but but then of course what happens is that you know these the website is was then made available on ipfs and where it's extremely redundant and essentially available for everybody uh i think you know that that's an amazing property i i probably disagree that you know it there is some choice that users are making uh and so i would have to say that uniswap only runs forever if liquidity providers are there kind of accepting the deal of of providing liquidity in exchange for for uh trading fees and so in some cases there is this human element of like deciding you know should i put my liquidity in this pool in that pool uh should i support this project by adding liquidity or whatever the case is so i wouldn't say that you know it's it's devoid of of human decisions or something like that i think that we see uh we see a lot of human decisions based on what uh what pools are the deepest and uh uh how winning kind of the liquidity race because at the end of the day if every liquidity provider withdrew their liquidity then that would essentially stop a uniswap a unisot pool but that is a decision that you know would be a collective one that everyone makes and not a forced decision like an administrator withdrawing everybody's tokens or something like that uh and it makes it makes an extremely interesting thing to watch as uniswap version two comes out which is that the team themselves cannot force people to upgrade you know they actually have to make if they want people to move to a version two they have to make a more compelling product uh that people actually want to move away from version one to version two uh and so they've actually kind of said themselves you know version one is going to live forever it's always going to be there uh and at the end of the day it's up to users to to decide like uh you know will this thing live on as a public good or will they move their liquidity attention and trading elsewhere so you said that there is some human component to it because you know ultimately it's humans that are choosing to provide liquidity uh but i'm actually going to push back on that and say that the rewards or the returns offered by uniswap turn people it forces people's hand and so while there is a human ultimately hitting the deposit button uniswap actually creates incentives to you know force the hand of people so at the end of the day all blockchain systems are are human systems right like even with bitcoin you have to choose to run your own node uh but with with uniswap i want to get i want to get into both the topic of unit swap as a dao and also uniswap as uh this perpetually growing feedback loop uh and and and so the original uh definition of a dao is something with humans at the periphery and encode at the center and the code at the center has this inherent feedback loop where you know more some some people decide to just come and deposit some liquidity and that makes some people come and decide to trade which gives those liquidity providers returns which those returns incentivize further liquidity uh for further liquidity deposits which then allows for a wider participant pool of people to come and trade on uniswap without you know severe slippage right the more liquidity inside of uniswap the more viable it is for larger and larger people and then when larger and larger people come to uniswap there's more trading fees going to uni swap which incentivizes further liquidity deposits and then that in turn feeds back into itself and allows for further people to make more trades on uniswap and so while i think that of course everything has this human element this internal mechanism i think forces people's hands and almost uh promises the growth of uniswap as an application uh do you agree with that yeah i do so i i really buy into um uniswap being some kind of a dow like structure uh but ultimately what what you're describing is a virtuous circle where as long as traders show up liquidity providers will will be there to accept their trading fees uh and in this case the the parameters that unisa kind of guessed for trading fees and and everything else you know we're suitable enough to actually grow these uh these markets into into really substantial infrastructure and really substantial uh liquidity pools and as a public good so you know i think it's it's just been incredible to watch the growth of uniswap and watch these virtuous circles work themselves out and work themselves up for uh you know the these these the most popular unispot markets it's it's really stunning to watch uh happen in kind of almost real time here one thing we haven't talked about is uh how other experiments like this have been tried in the past so maybe a couple to reflect on caleb so the first was bancor which actually had a similar concept as uniswap um why why was uniswap more successful and why did its growth accelerate while uh bankers sort of stayed uh stagnant do you think yeah at some point very soon after launch um you know this little project with with the unicorn emoji logo uh started getting daily trading volumes like above above this massive ico project uh bancor ultimately the two technologies are quite similar and the two product offerings are quite similar but for me i think that the difference lies in how easy it was to start pools on uniswap how easy it was to start providing liquidity and get to getting to the point of the virtuous circle uh whereas on bancor everything was a little bit more difficult a little bit more restrictive uh the code the code is more difficult to to read and parse and integrate into smart contracts and i think at the end of the day if if you're looking at the developer community who wants to integrate something that that's you know infrastructure should be simple so that it's secure and i think like that that is like one one of the key points of of looking at unit swap you can see it you can read the contract in a few hours and figure out like yeah this thing is is gonna is gonna run for a while uh i think that that's that's kind of ultimately what um what what made unit swap really popular initially and and got its volumes and kick-started its volumes that uh has now allowed for for this long tail of assets to to live on its platform and be traded every day i definitely like the the unit swap approach too it's i think you said it when we were getting started with this that uh you were attracted to uniswap because it was a public good we just come out of the ico craze and bank or you know i don't know what they raised 150 million uh and here's the little uniswap with a you know 100 000 dollar grant from the ethereum foundation creating something that's better was it 10 000 it's just some some some uh tiny amount one developer it's actually hayden adams i believe it was his first actual uh software program that he ever built um and he did this and out competed a 150 million dollar ico i think that just this shows you that uh what you need is a good mechanism uh and you know simple is better um there are some other decentralized exchange approaches that have been tried on ethereum that are still in in in progress and getting some uptake too but how would you contrast uniswap and its success to something like the xerox protocol which is more of a a peer-to-peer type order book protocol what's what's the difference in your mind i think order books have places um i'll just say when when it comes to a product like uniswap where you do trade against a smart contract it it it's frictionless i mean it really feels like magic the first time that you swap tokens on it and when it comes to integrating token swaps into smart contracts and into applications that that same frictionless experience exists for developers and so if you're saying like well you know why why can't we make a you know order book exchange that that makes everything completely smooth for users i just think that it's very difficult to compete with a protocol that's that's built to do one thing in one transaction uh and so at the end of the day the this thing is the scope of unit swap is not huge uh at least you know swap version one you know the scope is just token swaps uh and liquidity provision and it's very good at what it does you know it doesn't it doesn't overreach or extend it makes it really quick simple for users uh and i think that is very very difficult to compete with and makes an extremely compelling infrastructure layer uh you know whereas with order books they're they're they are just more difficult to use uh generally yeah there's this concept i think that we've seen repeated in the most successful money protocols d5 criticals so far and that is their tendency to pull state together and when i say state i mean basically capital pools asset pools together so that you're actually as a user interacting with the contract itself the capital pool itself and drawing on on that liquidity you know synthetics has done this fairly effectively maker has also done this effectively and it's kind of a contrast to the the more the peer-to-peer approach that xerox is taking where you know for every cell you have to find a another peer who's who's going to buy with this the liquidity is always there so you're just trading with the the money robot you're just trading with the uh the pooled capital and it seems like that is a much more scalable way to create these money protocols and maybe why we've why we've seen them be so successful but is there an upper limit to that so i think um maybe maybe some of our our bitcoiner friends might say something like but yeah like unit swap's great it's a nice toy but i mean the volume's happening on bitmex the volume's happening on binance and coinbase and it'll never be able to compete against these centralized exchanges what do you say to that caleb uh yeah i mean we're kind of celebrating that unison pit's 10 million average daily liquidity over over like march but i think i it's just a different system it's it's it's just not comparing the same the same thing across uh both products and so there is a lot more volume on on other products but you know for me personally i don't feel uh i don't feel as as invested in whatever happens to bitmex and their liquidity or whatever the case is i don't feel like bitmex is doing something good for the ethereum ecosystem the same way that i definitely feel that way about the uniswap liquidity pools so caleb an article came out not too long ago talking about the the core mechanism underlying uniswap but not just unit swap some other uh very integral d5 protocols like balancer and curve finance and and this mechanism has been called a constant function market maker now this isn't exactly a simple algorithm at least to explain maybe through a podcast but i hope you can do your best in explaining explaining the role of a constant function market maker at large not just in through uniswap and then kind of maybe explaining the the pros and cons of of that in comparison to the legacy alternatives the constant product market makers are are you know the fancy math behind uh the curves the pricing curves that we were talking about earlier and they they are what set the rules that liquidity providers have to trade for so if you wanted to think about this as you know like the house uh the house in a casino game or something like that imagine that liquidity providers are that house where you know in a game of blackjack they they abide by certain rules hit on certain numbers and so on and so forth in these cases the the constant product market makers uh are the set of rules that um that liquidity providers play by in order to facilitate trades for the traders uh and in exchange of course they get the trading fee which is like the house edge for providing that liquidity so in the case of uniswap the math behind the constant product market maker is quite simple so it's x times y equals k and the idea is that this this constant product of x times y which is asset a times the balance of asset b in the smart contract always equals some constant and so whenever there's a trade that constant needs to remain the same and whenever liquidity is added or removed that constant also needs to be the same and so the the idea is that you know these are the rules that everyone in the system plays by in the case of uniswap it's a very very simple calculation it's designed for two assets and it's not really designed for for more assets and so now what we're seeing is a very high degree of innovation in terms of the the types of pricing curves that are being provided we're seeing things like multiple assets being batched together into liquidity pools and the price being some function of all of those assets different different price ratios uh we're seeing things like the pricing curve being amplified uh at a specific uh at a specific price uh so in the case of kind of stable pools where the two assets are are pegged very closely together at a specific price ratio the curve itself is designed to make better use of the underlying liquidity by by uh kind of flattening itself out around that uh around that price target and so the idea is that you know it you know who knows if uniswap got the fee correctly who knows if they got the exact math right for this pricing curve all that we know right now is that it was very simple and what we're seeing now are alternatives coming along that are more complex and trying to tweak and tune the pricing curve a little bit to meet certain goals so i think we're just getting started in what i would probably consider you know bancor and uniswap have been kind of phase one uh or year one even of uh of liquidity pools and i think we're just on the cusp of uh you know phase two which is which are these more complex pricing curves and more bespoke pricing curves to specific sets of assets as as a kid caleb i used to watch the show uh called battlebots right and it's basically the idea of like you get to like a p people uh design two robots and like one will have a hammer on top that swings and the other will have like a saw of some sort you put them in a ring like the octagon and they fight and you see which one wins right this is kind of what this reminds me of because you're essentially you're taking these math formulas these constant functions or constant products as you call them and you're putting them in the ring that ring is the ethereum economy essentially and you're they're fighting they're all fighting for liquidity right they're also helping each other but uh ultimately it's kind of a battle between these bots between these math functions uh for liquidity and some might do better in some circumstances say stable coins and others might do better in more general purpose circumstances say you know like uniswap's very simple function for for all assets uh it kind of reminds me of that is that am i way off base here is that what's going on i i love that metaphor and and i i think that's a perfect way of looking at it uh you know in some cases you want the robot with the hammer and in other cases you want the robot with the wedge and so i think i think that what we'll see is depending on the asset and the types of assets that are being pulled together uh certain protocols will win and certain robots will play well uh and you know against another type of robot and then in other cases we may see that a different protocol wins for for a different class of assets um you know i this is one of the the more exciting things going on in ethereum from my point of view these money robots i really believe have a chance of changing how we how we create markets uh everywhere for limited edition goods for bootstrapping uh liquid token network liquidity uh even for initial token sales and so we're even seeing uh teams uh offering their tokens for the first time in almost like a uniswap initial coin offering type type of situation and and so for me i i see that there will be a very bright future for these liquidity pools and at the end of the day it benefits traders to have a little bit of competition it benefits the people that are building on top of this infrastructure to have some of this competition uh and ultimately you know the the traders will go where the best they're getting the best prices at the cheapest gas uh and the the the liquidity providers will follow and then ultimately uh the developers may follow them or they might just integrate whatever's easiest so you know i think that it's going to be a really interesting uh next like six months watching these these math functions battle it out in uh in the money robot uh robot wars but you know that that's kind of where we are right now and so this this is like a particularly exciting uh point in the journey uh and many many protocols are kind of announcing their version two including uniswap and we're kind of going um we're getting to see that next iteration of this financial product that i really believe can be mainstream uh which is just incredible incredibly exciting it it is super exciting and i you know i think i just want to emphasize because we should we should zoom out for for a minute so what all of this is doing essentially is it is adding a permissionless liquidity source as a public good to the ethereum network and the the ethereum economy that's the net benefit to the system of uniswap existing and uniswap playing its scarcity game as as we've called it in the past because everyone has a an opportunity to to trade as a protocol so no no bank required essentially anyone has an opportunity to list their asset again no exchange no bank required anyone has an opportunity to bootstrap their asset and this is additive to the ethereum economy in general it creates a bankless way to complete all of those money verbs and it does so as a public good and i think we're just beginning to see the secondary effects of what a public good as a liquidity source can do to the ethereum economy and uh and and for these other money protocols too so we're just at the cusp but there's one last thing i think we should talk about here on the subject of of public goods so we've got we've talked about unit swap so far as being a public good for liquidity but in unit swap v2 it's doing something else um it's it can actually be used as a price oracle and i want to discuss that with you uh caleb so first can you talk about what a price oracle is and and maybe why it's important sure so a price oracle is uh defining a price of the assets using some underlying data and typically you know ethereum knows about ethereum it doesn't really know anything else about ethereum and so typically these price oracles may come from markets external to ethereum with data that's brought on chain by oracle services but what uniswap is proposing is they're saying look we have uh we have we know every trade that goes on on uniswap they're all on chain so why don't we just look at the price and then we'll have this on chain price source where we don't have to worry about if uh you know an exchange misrepresents price of an asset or you know if we miss a transaction bringing that api data on chain or something like that we don't have to worry about any of that it's all sitting right here uh now teams have have previously tried to use unit swap as a price oracle and there's been uh you know some some downsides to doing that or some potential attack factors to doing that so one of these one of these attack vectors is essentially if if you trade if you make a really big trade on your swap you can crash the price of an asset and then use the crash price of an asset to carry out some other transactions elsewhere on the network and so what uniswap is proposing in its next version is actually to add some time waiting uh to its price oracle so in other words it wouldn't just be a matter of making one trade maybe using a flash loan or something like that but it would actually require a sustained uh downward pressure on the price to manipulate its on-chain price circle which is uh time weighted so that that's kind of the idea that they're proposing uh i think it's great that they're branching out into using uh using their trading data for for another public good here uh and i'm very very eager to kind of see what happens with this i almost see this as uh you know they've they created uh obviously this this amazing public good that we're spending so much time on but uh i i think that this is another one that that could ultimately uh uh be quite powerful for the network so recently we discussed the mechanism of constant function market makers and one of the many reasons why those things are cool is because every single constant function market maker produces an oracle and so not only uniswap is an oracle but also curve is also now in oracle and balancers also now in oracle and then we also discussed the perpetual feedback loop of uniswap growth where liquidity begets liquidity you incentivize you put in liquidity you incentivize trading to incentivize more liquidity and all of a sudden you know uniswap can it can grow into this very large uh high liquidity structure and for things like a constant function market maker that has a large amount of liquidity that produces censorship resistance in the oracle and so that same and that same liquidity bootstrap strapping mechanism also applies to things like balancer right and so maybe if both of these applications uh you know grow and grow and grow in liquidity they're also growing and growing and growing in censorship resistance of that oracle uh do you think that that is the long-term solution for the oracle problem inside of the ethereum ecosystem or is there still a in the armor somewhere i that's kind of the question and you know i i'm i'm not sure to be honest i think that you know time waiting adds some guarantees uh in theory uh but we've seen some very clever attack factors and so if we're talking about kind of building uh you know using this as a core piece of infrastructure or something like that you know i think that we're going to see uh you know over the next year two years three years if this is a suitable price feed mechanism in terms of kind of the types of projects that you know might end up end up building on this i think that what we could see are are things like prediction markets and options uh options mark decentralized options protocols and things like that where you know you you really need a strong guarantee on the price of an asset over time uh and this this may provide it uh however i i will say that it's just not it's the security guarantees uh are just not quite clear to me and i know that using uh uniswap as an oracle has kind of backfired in the past um you know whether or not that's it's not really uniswap's fault but but it hasn't it there have been issues with uh relying on kind of decentralized um uh prices pricing from unison uh that kind of make me nervous for the first few applications uh but i do think that as as these initial applications roll out we're going to see some new and and cool uses uh uh from it uh ultimately the the main advantage of having it on chain and having it through uniswap is that it is like unstoppable sure but it's also very cheap and i think that you know between being unstoppable and being very easy to query uh you know that's that's where the advantage will be for up and coming infrastructure projects yeah absolutely the nice thing about oracle's is of course um they they can be additive so if you have a set of oracles and you add an additional oracle uh then you can use that and and take the average you can medianize across all of those um so it can kind of add to the decentralization even if it's not used exclusively so what let's finish with this caleb so what's really the end game for uniswap how big could this thing really get and you know what would it what would the world look like if unit swap you know won just in terms of asset trading on ethereum i think that's that's a huge uh you know goal to to ultimately bring in more volume uh than say centralized exchanges i i think are an easy target uh in order to do that you know that there are definitely some challenges that need to be overcome but i do think just just based on the user experience of uniswap and the permission enlisted nature and really the trustworthiness of integrating into projects uh because of its is permissionless nature it it stands a very good chance at you know growing quite large as far as i understand the you know the end game is that there's obviously a team building this uh and i think that you know there will probably they'll probably need to be raising money out of uniform so far that there's been no money raised uh by the team off of the protocol itself with the exception of selling limited edition goods and so i think you know at some point there needs to be like some kind of uh you know share of of these these trading fees uh that go just a little bit beyond the liquidity providers to ensure that you know uniswap uh developers and and community developers are motivated to continue growing the the ecosystem and innovating in the constant function market maker space so i i i believe that that's built in as like an option uh but in unison version two but set kind of off by default uh but but imagine that you know a lot of the concerns around i guess being able to make more transactions through these unit swap markets or being able to utilize liquidity better or being able to support new asset types for liquidity providers in more profitable ways these are all kind of easy targets for for a well-funded team to kind of take on and i think that that's kind of the the intermediate steps towards taking over the world with liquidity pools so maybe a token in the future to fund the public good itself uh could could happen at some point caleb this has been fantastic thank you for telling us all about uniswap uniswap is one of the three d5 king protocols that we are talking about in this series very exciting stuff uh it could definitely grow quite large into the billions maybe trillions someday uh you know it's not another question it's not it's not crazy caleb can you tell the listeners where to find you on socials where to learn more about the the analytics projects that you're working on yeah you can find me at caleb sheridan on twitter and you can visit the website pools.fyi for more information and statistics about liquidity pools including unison those are definitely the the two best places to find me online thank you very much for having me on it's really been a pleasure i really enjoy being able to have the opportunity to speak about unit swap with you it's it's really really an honor fantastic caleb thank you for joining us so actions for our listeners today we've got some fantastic articles for you to read one of which caleb actually wrote uh that was published on bankless how to make money on uniswap david takes us through uniswap as an emergent organism the underlying infrastructure of it in another article we also have uh some material about the rise of liquidity robots so catch those articles if you're interested in learning more about uniswap also we encourage you to try it out go to the uniswap website actually exchange some eth for die swap some tokens if you're feeling particularly brave research the liquidity returns on pools.fyi that is the site that caleb and his team put together it's fantastic for kind of seeing the range of returns that you might expect in each in each pool um guys risks and disclaimers ethereum is risky crypto is risky uniswap is a risky protocol as well this is not for everybody we told you before of course we are headed on the west this is the frontier you could lose what you put in so be careful out there but we're thankful you're with us on the journey thank you for joining us on bankless episode 10.
