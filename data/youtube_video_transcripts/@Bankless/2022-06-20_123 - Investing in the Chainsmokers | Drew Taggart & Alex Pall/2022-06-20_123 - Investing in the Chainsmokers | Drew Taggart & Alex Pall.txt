of this freaking decade but did you also know these guys are talented investors including crypto investors they actually have an nft out where they released a portion of their album royalties uh to their fans as a as an nft that's pretty awesome we got creators turned investors turned crypto entrepreneurs alex and drew welcome to bankless guys thank you very excited to be here for the show for quite some time that's amazing incredible to me alex it's awesome to have you man and uh of course the uh does the chain and chain smokers does that uh stand for blockchain is that yes you start 10 guys we're going to talk about a few things but um a few of the parts we want to get to is obviously here on your journey on the artist side of things because that's a huge part right it's like artists entrepreneur and then how you've parlayed that transition that into an investment career which is pretty awesome to see and then what your thoughts on crypto are so um why don't we start with like the rise of chain smokers how did you guys how did you guys even meet how did you get started you want to take that one joe yeah i mean for i mean we both have different perspectives on this that end at the same place but i was finishing school i was an aspiring producer i really was obsessed with dance music and this is kind of before dance music had really taken off in in the us especially um and i just fell in love with it in my high school years and then it was my secret my secret passion i was just out every second of free time i was sitting in ableton live the program uh that i we still use today and trying to figure out how to make these sounds that i'd heard in this music and um you know like i never thought i could really make it a career and then really luckily right after i graduated you know i met alex who had started the chainsmokers in in new york city and they were you know djing around they had a you know a good brand that they had built and they were they were playing it was him and another kid named rhett and they were uh they were playing parties all over the place and the other kid decided he wanted to go do his own thing and alex wanted to find a i guess a replacement um he always saw the chainsmokers as a duo and i was coming out of college really passionate about you know it's basically the same vision that alex was going after um we grew up on a lot of the same music and we were introduced by a friend of a friend and i became the new chainsmoker and uh that was probably 2012 and we just started from there woke up every day tried to figure out how to make a song that people would care about find a unique sound that sounded like us and took some time but we got there alex what was the story from from your perspective you alluded to how you had a different version of the story can you uh tell us from the alex side of things and also when did it become obvious that uh you guys were good at making music when did that happen sure uh so from my perspective uh or my side of the of the equation um i was i graduated from nyu and i was working as a receptionist at an art gallery in chelsea new york i thought i was going to be you know work in art the art business for my life i kind of always thought that that would be what i was doing and i think that was probably just a result of like that was the only thing i was exposed to my dad was an art dealer my mom kind of was a stay-at-home mom and like that was like really the only functioning like adult like career path that i kind of had a good perspective on um and i enjoyed you know studying on history and business in school and um on a trip to europe to visit my sister at bristol where she was going to school i like really fell in love with like dance electronic music in a different way like i was definitely you know familiar with it enjoyed some songs but i wasn't real there was like this electro scene that was taking over like boys noise mastercraft justice um uh kind of error of music and i just like loved the kind of uh egalitarianism that like i experienced in england like it was like everyone was equal everyone was having fun on this dance floor there was no like bells or whistles it was just like a ripper of a time and i was like i have to bring this party energy and feeling back to new york city luckily for me i had been like promoted all throughout college as you know any smart college kid who's trying to drink for free does and uh and so i kind of had like an understanding of like how to throw events and successfully and so i threw a party at this place called le royale with like a twister theme where i covered the entire club with twister mats and it was pretty cool and it was like a really fun successful party and that's when i kind of was like wait i kind of want to keep doing this and so you know over the course of the next five years um with this guy right you know we like dj at night basically from like 11 00 p.m to 4 a.m and then i went to work from 10am to 6pm and over the course of like those five years i kind of just began to feel a little more and more disenchanted with the art world there's just like a level of nepotism in it that like became very obvious and you know it just was kind of you know it was kind of like i love art but is this really where my like my soul and passion belongs and uh you know drew kind of talked about when the guy was working with wanted to break off and i was just like you know i gotta i gotta see this through and i gotta see what this comes but i also recognize that you know the wall we were hitting was because we weren't making any music you know and that was like the key you know we could play in new york at clubs forever but in order to grow beyond those borders it was you know about building a brand and you know with your music and identity that way um and so you know i was really fortunate to be drew through a mutual friend and i bought my part ex partner out for like eight thousand dollars which might as well have been like you know 40 million dollars at the time to me uh obviously a great invest return on my investment um and uh yeah we just kind of i quit my job and we just got to work the next day and it was like a really crazy you know thing but i think the main point is that like sometimes you kind of have to just throw yourself all the way in you know you can always like hedge your butts and have interest in things and dabble and you know it's really hard to you know when you put yourself in a situation where it's like if i don't succeed like i no longer live in the city i can no longer afford my apartment i can no longer eat like i have to all these things that bad things happen it kind of really motivates you to go the distance and um yeah and that was crazy and i was like 2012 um and that was a really uh you know wild time to be doing that too i'm hearing a story of uh two two dudes who just put in the blood sweat and tears into a passion that they that they loved uh is this like an underdog story or in your guys's like mind were you guys always eventually gonna figure it out and you guys are always gonna like become famous artists like what was your own opinion of your own trajectory or was it just not clear and you were just like going day by day trying to trying to just make good music what was that what was that trajectory like first of all it's never clear yeah but one thing that we did do in the beginning is put ourselves in kind of a do or die situation which was you know alex like he said he was working at an art gallery as soon as we met he quit his job which i'm sure they were all like what are you doing you know you've been here for a long time you have a clear path to being having a successful career and um you know i had just graduated from syracuse with you know 150 000 in debt um with no real way to pay it back and so you know we saw the opportunity and dance music obviously it was our passion but that you know it was a scene that was getting bigger and bigger by the day and uh we thought it was worth the risk but we definitely put ourselves in an hour never you know we have nothing like what am i supposed to do after uh you know i become a dj and then it doesn't work out like what kind of job do i get after that how do i explain that on my resume so you know we definitely put ourselves in a situation where we really had to make it work and um i think that's uh that's a really valuable lesson that we learned kind of unintentionally that you know you know now that we've become investors uh you know we encourage a lot of our we try to look for kids that have that mentality that are willing to sacrifice everything that have to make it work um to see you know put themselves like they have no fallback plan uh i think that's been a very valuable lesson that worked out for us so you guys were like scrappy from the very beginnings right it's like this the the story wasn't written in the stars you had to kind of earn it you had to kind of work for it but like when was it obvious that uh you'd done something that was going to be huge like was there an inflection point a certain moment after you started this thing and it's funny alex that this is like you're like the original investment was actually the chain smokers right and now you've laid that into investment career but like at what point did you know the investment was going to pay off i mean i don't think you we you know you really ever knew you know like i mean obviously it was just a matter of being like getting eight thousand dollars back was like the first central of being okay that was a good that was a good investment which didn't take you know that long to be honest with you but um but i think for us like we've always measured success in small steps um you know for us progress is can be you know growing your fan base from 10 people to 15 people but you know each week and i think that's something i try to remind you know artists that are younger than us or up and coming um that ask us for advice because you know it's easy to kind of get lost in the bigger macro picture of where you ultimately want to end up and i think it's good to have those big ambitions and believe in yourself that you can achieve that stuff but if you measure your success only by that you're just going to inevitably always be unhappy in moving these goal posts um you know in unhealthy ways and so for us it was kind of like tapping into this indie electronic dance remix scene um where we kind of found our first like i mean to use like investor terms like product market fit um obviously we weren't using language like that back then uh but it was like wait hold on this is like really exciting uh you know i think we've tapped into a sound that's really unique to us that we really enjoy that feels you know really inherently uh natural and we're seeing like a result slowly you know like people are tweeting about our songs and and following our facebook page and interacting with us in different ways and and you know that was kind of the beginning of when we realized we're like all right this there's something here that we need to explore further like we have to understand what about what it is that that that is making this feel like the right direction to go in and then over the course of you know like two years of doing that we kind of began to like really hone in on different things that you know help grow our platform and build more community um and then there's like you know i always say we've had like five or six different careers in in our 10 years or 11 years of doing this because there's been some really highs and some real lows that feel like we're starting over again but this kind of remix error on hype machine was kind of the first genesis of like you know something something's clicking here you know i don't know where this is going but it's we're making small progress and it feels great i actually remember uh stumbling across you guys on hype machine back in in my college days and just seeing in parentheses chainsmokers remix over and over and over again definitely my first exposure um and the way that you guys speak the the words that you use are very very much illustrative of uh a business mindset uh and so it makes no surprise that there is actually a venture capital fund to that we're eventually going to be talking about that that is where this story goes and alex you talked about like your 8 000 investment how it's like you know great return on investment uh drew you talk about like taking risks and i'm wondering was this a mentality that you guys had from day one or is this something that you kind of grew into as you become and became successful like where where did this uh business business mindset come from um i i think just like the willingness to survive and and and make a career for ourselves i mean that happened from day one i mean you know the first thing that we did you know the high machine days is you know okay cool alex and i meet one night and we wanted we decided we wanna you know do this together okay what do we wanna do we wanna make original music okay how do you do that you know i've been producing pretty shitty music for a while but i know how to do it um but like what's going to be the sound that really sets us apart well we look up to guys like calvin harris and uh i guess zed at the time too and people that have more like vocal uh driven dance music um and we decided we wanted to do that and height machine was kind of our first you know we were also at the same time we loved dance music there was all this amazing indie music that was being posted on height machine so for those who are listening that don't know what hype machine it was the first blog aggregator of the internet um and essentially it was like a chart of the hottest 50 songs from that week and the way that you got onto that chart was uh how many times you were blogged and how many times you were liked once you got on the chart and um these are all like artists that like no one in the dance world so you know dance was starting to pop in the u.s this is like 2012 2013. um that was starting to pop off in the u.s and everyone was remixing like pop music it was a bunch of like lady gaga remixes and towel crews whatever was popping at the time and uh you know we grew up on indie music and so we decided you know why don't we just remix this stuff no one is really doing that and this is kind of inherent while we're figuring out our song maybe like start remixing this type of music and so what we would do is we go on height machine we'd find they're like you know the 50 hottest songs of the week there and we would reach out to every single artist and beg them to let us do a free remix and you know one out of 50 would say yes we'd get the stems um and we'd sit in our apartment all week just like trying to make a new dance version of that indie song which in its own was like kind of a novel thing there weren't a lot of people remixing that type of music but you know that type of sound really ended up being what the chainsmoker sounds like but zoom back to to where we were you know alex would get these stems i'd sit there and try to make this remix and then once i did it alex would go into the back end of hype machine and this is like a big realization that we had we realized that so high machine was pulling from all these blogs and all these blogs were run by college kids that just want to get closer to artists and so we realized they were being serviced with a bunch of really generic promo emails from labels being like super impersonal uh talking about a song or whatever alex would send alex would go in the back in a high machine find every blog that they pulled music from find every writer that wrote for that blog he had this a crazy excel sheet he would send every single one of these uh writers a personalized uh message that was [ __ ] hilarious like totally took this out of a promotional email um and within three releases so we had a couple things going for us at that point we had you know we were remixing a song they were already posting about we had a dance remix of it which was like the hottest genre at the time that was just blowing up um and they had this like personal connection to the to the artist and within three releases we had an amazing like stream of contact with all of these bloggers we figured out how you could kind of game the chart because you could time out you know they were happy to post your stuff because they just liked you and the remixes were relevant and good um and we kind of game the chart and we ended up having like 50 number ones on height machine and that was like how we built our first fan base um and all those songs were given out for free and you know in the beginning we were begging to do remixes but as i started to have success on the chart people were like please some people even paid us to do remixes so that was like uh that was probably like the first phase of the chain smokers was you know remixing indie music trying what what was also like the one other benefit was we were also like trying to get better at producing you know and we're producing songs with vocals and we kind of got our chops in that we built our you know a tiny fan base that felt huge to us at the time um we did like to download if everyone remembers that for uh for uh you know to get our songs which like helped us build our socials so it was kind of like a multi-faceted little hustle there dude that's that's crazy and by the way uh alex that's nerdy as hell you had an uh excel spreadsheet i mean that in the best of ways man that's so awesome you guys are they didn't have like mailchimp you know and like all those things that make it so much easier to like blast out you know personal looking emails but weren't you know so it was like a real nightmare it's crazy and i'm struck by like how entrepreneurial artists need to be and how entrepreneur you guys were it was like it's like looking into like a startup basically and starting this thing from inception and like trying to find the product market fit and like you guys have nailed some product market fit just in kind of the the genre in in terms of uh songs i mean it's kind of like we're talking about the the early days the startup days but now like i mean chainsmok's top five artists of the decade easily one of the biggest songs of the decade like you guys completely crushed it what was the back half of this story like um i mean i think a lot of we've made many many mistakes and missteps in our career um you know some and pretty much all unintentionally but like that's kind of the growing pains of becoming artists like it's why i really admire certain artists that just seem to effortlessly get it right every time and you're just like how are they so good at this you know as they become you know more famous than gandhi and you're just like they're just so they're naturally dealing with you know the public the pr the you know everything around it and i'm sure like if you spoke to them they you know i think one thing we've realized everyone you speak to no matter how successful they are have all that all sorts of personal challenges and struggles um but for us i think it you know it was you know i think we always challenge ourselves and push ourselves and and that's kind of what's motivated us to work super hard i think that's kind of been you know there's lots of things that i think make what we've done special from you know our emphasis on hospitality and relationships to just the work ethic in general um which i think have been kind of the two backbone pieces but like you know we've branched out into a tequila business the tv and film com business which is easily the hardest business out there um and and venture now and you know and i think every time we kind of decide to take something on we are super self-aware about how challenging it's going to be to get to the next level and you know just like venture like the music is like a hitch-driven business you know what i mean on some levels people or say you're only as good as your last hit i know we don't feel that way and i feel like that's something we've continued to do is just bet on ourselves you know we've been after we had that song selfie which is its own book in itself you know to discuss uh you know it felt like possibly you know that was the end of us rick rubin who we met with you know uh which was kind enough to meet with us was like you probably should probably just quit and change your names and start over and we were like wait what like that's the advice you're giving us and obviously you know we didn't take it but you know that was like some of the feedback we were hearing and instead of doing we got dropped by republic records um after that why like why were people were people i mean i think they and i don't blame them i think they expected us to be like a lmfao type you know uh group that will release like all these kind of selfie type songs and we were like hell no that was never that song we made in 20 minutes that was just a joke you know and i wouldn't even know how to make another you know another one of those wanted and so they were like all right never mind we're just going to let these guys go which was actually nice of them because they could have just kept us there and let us die on their shelf but um you know we got dropped which is like the end of most artists careers at that point in time and we kind of just said like you know what like i believe in the music we have coming and we're gonna you know figure this out and hustle and that's when we made roses and that was like the next beginning to the chainsmokers and this has kind of continued to happen over and over in our career in different ways and um that's why it always you know it's like we make some bold decisions but it's like always kind of the the bottom line is always like let's just bet on ourselves you know in like like if you're what's the point of living if you're not going to believe in yourself and the things you're doing and you know i don't think we're like super renegades and you know like do really crazy things because uh we're still responsible and thoughtful but you know uh i think having that sort of mentality has allowed us to kind of continue to push ourselves in different directions and hold ourselves to a certain standard even you know i definitely want to get to the part where we get to the actual business side of things the the artist investor part of this conversation but before we do that i want to bring up the the there's a dynamic duo between you two and that's something that uh me and ryan can definitely relate to there's uh the older more business-minded person of the group and then that was also the younger more creative uh business of the of the two uh i'm wondering if you agree with that dichotomy and also just talk about the the dynamic between you two as a duo like how do you guys make it work how do you guys balance each other out who's good at what overall just what's the dynamic like we're looking for relationship tips guys i brought a little graph that i can now get it's all in excel yeah a little zen diagram um i mean i think that like this we talked about this before that you know show started but i think that's like the luckiest thing that ever happened to us was us meeting each other i'm sure you guys you know feel the same way um about about your partnership is you know finding someone that has a complimentary set of skills but also is aligned in just how you want to approach life and work and everything in relationships and everything is is just of the most critical importance and i mean and it's not just because like you know conquer and divide or you can move faster as a pac or anything like that it's like having someone to lean on when things aren't good is just as important to have someone to celebrate when things are good and you know i think over the years like it's become more clear the things that you know i have strengths in like i'm probably i'm hyper organized and responsive um but like i'm not even close to as good as a music creature as drew you know i mean like like not even on the same like planet um i have my strengths when it comes to music like i can approach it like a kindergartener and you know what i mean which i think is helpful also being said alex has the best taste [Laughter] he's like it's like you know i don't get like lost in the sauce and overthink things which i think is perfect because it's drew's job to get super technical and and hardcore about things and then i can kind of pull him out of his the chaos that he creates and then conversely like on the business side you know i'm like kind of like off the cuff loudmouth and drew's like take a second be thoughtful about the response um and you know and i think like it's a lot you know i think my loudness definitely got us in trouble a couple times but like i think you know in general it's it's been a really you know the most important piece about you know the chain smokers because like i wasn't my idea to start a fund you know that was like drew's idea and now it's like one of the things i enjoy most to do and so you kind of like push yourselves in each other into things that you know maybe you wouldn't have ever considered and i think having someone in your life that kind of challenges you and you know forces you out of your comfort zone sometimes is is really important and also to know that you're on a living level level playing field like you know like there's nothing he can convince me to do that like he doesn't also have to suffer through you know in and and sometimes there's people around you that are like oh you should definitely do this and they're like well if you do that it's because i make you know a lot more money but i don't actually have to go do any of those things and and so i think there's just a level of like transparency and you know equality that makes it you know really fun wait what do you think you buy into that um yeah i mean i was just about to say a lot of nice a lot of nice things about alex i mean alex is the most i mean her the hype machine article or uh uh thing that i was talking about earlier uh you know where he would go and literally have a spreadsheet of 500. like what artist has as a spreadsheet period um of every blogger that rates for every single blog and then has like the diligence to just send them all a personalized email and keep up like alex is the most organized most thorough like well like is always in contact with everybody whether you're you know [ __ ] ken griffin to uh the bartender at the dueling piano bars in st louis that we played in 2013. like he was like responsive to everybody he is like doesn't care always takes care of people he's always thoughtful and that's like you're super annoying no but literally like i look at him and i'm like dude you got to stop responding to all these people you're gonna drive yourself crazy but like he's so organized he's so like on top of it he's so down to earth and and approaches every situation with humility and is so good at reading the room and i think like without those skill sets while they're not musical the chain smokers wouldn't be where they are without that that's something that's obviously like started like in the context of music that now we started started all these other businesses it's been really fascinating to watch that skill set change formats um and how it's applicable across different verticals are you guys like when you guys invest are you bullish on like partnerships where you kind of see the same dichotomy as like yeah i definitely think it's like it makes for a more interesting company i mean i don't think necessarily think it can be an advantage for one company over another but like i think it is helpful ultimately because you have two equals you know uh with the same ambition you know hopefully but like it also can become really complicated if you don't have a good partnership like who wants to be cfo who wants to be ceo who wants to you know work on vacation and who might not anymore um and i think you know you see a lot of groups and you know uh businesses break up as a result of that so it's it's definitely a more challenging road to balance but if you can find the right partner like obviously i think it much more powerful and not to go back but actually just made me laugh about the excel spreadsheets but like i would email these blogs forever and it finally got to the point where like i started to feel like they weren't posting us anymore and like finally one guy kind of like hit me back and was just like dude you're like one of the biggest artists on the planet like i'm a small blog like i'm supposed to write about like up and coming in the artist like i can't be like posting like closer on my channel and i was like what i was like i thought we were homies and and it kind of was like funny kind of like i remember that moment where you're like like had to like let go of that strategy because it was just like it was i mean it didn't matter anymore you know what i mean i think like you kind of then when i say didn't matter like the relationships always mattered and like having that support especially like the grassroots level is the most critical thing um as you build community but like also i think over the course of those years we realized like i remember getting like a million plays on soundcloud and being like every [ __ ] in the world heard our song like you know and then you're like wait no they haven't like that's a billion streams you know and like kind of realize over time like how big the world is you know what i mean and and i think that's kind of what i said in the very beginning about just measuring progress and just being like you know i remember playing a show in new york city at some club and we used to just play other people's music for a long time even when we were making music and then finally someone came up to us after the show was like why didn't you play any of your remixes and we were like wait you want to hear those you know what i mean and i was like oh okay i guess we got to start playing some of our music and you know and it's like these little baby steps that happen that kind of change uh you know dramatic things and how you think about you know your success and progress and future that's so cool and there's there's so much that resonates with this story between david and myself like just i am alex david is drew i mean like it's just we got this ying and yang order and chaos and it just like seems to work and i'll tell you guys that i was actually super bearish on partnerships prior to this i was kind of my whole thing was like lone wolf like no one's going to be reliable no one's actually going to be kind of there no one's going to hustle as hard as i hustle and then i started working with david and it was just like like a little bit at first i was like oh hell yeah i want to invest in this guy and when i saw a dude who was like a better than me at a number of different skill sets that i knew we made it that we i knew we needed uh it was just like you know game on yeah and i mean i think that's the best thing i mean i read some article a few months ago um i don't know that was just about like accountability and how that's like the most important quality to have in anyone that you work with or hire and it's so true you know like removing that doubt of being able to rely on someone and like generally like a lot of people aren't reliable and you know i don't blame you for like feeling that way you know sometimes um but like when you know when you ask if someone can get something done or not even have to ask they just know that they're gonna take care of those things um it's like a really beautiful thing i think that's kind of like what you want in a good business is like a business that where everyone is accountable to each other um in a healthy way and it's like you're not like you don't feel inclined to say every three days like hey did you do this you know what i mean like hey how's that going and you just know that person's gonna is thinking about it is gonna take care of it in a in a manner that like you uh you think is you know acceptable and great and i think that's you know awesome that you guys found each other 100 man 100 and uh okay so i want to move to this so that was like part one of kind of the the career and you guys are still obviously doing that hugely successful artist album new album is awesome we're gonna talk a little bit about that nft's you guys released but here's what i'm fascinated with with uh you get you got this duo uh it's pumping out incredible music uh and then you decide to go down the investing path and it was drew's idea drew tell us about that man why did you think this was a good idea um i think uh you know we've always been entrepreneurial obviously the way we've approached our music business you know we've started a number of other businesses like we have a um pretty elaborate real estate business we have um you know our tv and fun production company we have haha tequila um which has been really fun recently i was promoting that last night so i'm a little bit hungover um and uh you know we you know we were very entrepreneurial and like we're really uh becoming we became knowledgeable about like you know some of the you know inner workings of the way business tech businesses were built you know we met guys like brian chesky and drew joo houston um from dropbox and justin khan and uh michael seibel uh and it's kind of that kind of like class of entrepreneurs uh we were meeting them through our shows and hanging out with them and you know we would trade stories about you know what our dj life was like and we'd hear about what building a tech company was like and we realized we had a lot more in common with guys like that than we did with most musicians and so it was kind of a space that you know you know entrepreneurially and just you know friendship-wise we were really just drawn to you know we really liked these types of people that you know had this you know super driven mindset that wanted to you know create things that didn't exist and prove everyone wrong and uh you know so that space just seemed really appealing to us and you know we were doing a lot of angel investing i'd say our intro into investing started the way probably most celebrities get into investing um and i do that with quotation marks because it's typically a lot of like cpg companies or brands that want to slap you know a notable you know fame celebrity on on on you know on their uh cap table to you know get some kind of some kind of press and uh you know that that's kind of where we started and then you know you know in meeting those guys we realized you know they were kind of like why aren't you investing in our companies and we were like wait how why don't we have access to that and they kind of gave us a crash course and what venture capital was and um you know kind of how that that world worked and you know we started to be more outbound in our search we didn't wait for kind of brands or cbg companies to come to us we went out and sought out our own deals and it got to the point where you know we kind of looked at each other where you know we had the concept to just institutionalize a thing and and uh you know go out in and and do it for real and we also realize you know what you know there's something like when you're personally angel investing not everyone knows you invest and people still don't know that we invest but when you uh you know create an official fund and you know raise up you know outside capital and um announce that you're open for business you know your deal flow completely changes um and to be honest with you you know we started mantis two years ago two and a half years ago and you know we we kind of started with everything that i just told you about you know we realized that we had you know access to a lot of really good companies and but what we've learned since then has been monumental and uh we are really in there we do this all day every day um we've met so many amazing people we've met so many people that have seemed amazing that aren't amazing um we've gotten so much good advice we've got so much bad advice um it's been a pretty wild ride and this is something that we want to do for the rest of our lives yeah so let's go into that for the youtube listeners you can see alex's hat scott mantis drew just mentioned the name uh and you know there's no way that mantis doesn't have your guys's dna just absolutely baked into that so could you guys describe the gist the vibe of the mantis portfolio what are the things that you guys like to invest in and how has it changed the trajectory of your guys's uh careers how is it impacted how is like the the bounce back and forth between chainsmokers the performance the performance artists and also mantis the portfolio like how has this whole dynamic uh played out yeah i think at its core you know the most important thing to us is investing in people you know we invest in the seed stage and series a stage and i think when you're investing that early you know fundamentally like you want to invest in amazing people that you know in some ways i don't want to say like resemble our tenacity early on in our career but have certainly like a vision and uh you know and a by any means necessary attitude to get things done um and i think that's kind of what's been fun about it is i think we're curious people and the opportunity to speak to like-minded people like that it's been really exciting um and then and then back them and support them um you know we think of ourselves as founders too so you know we like to think we have something to offer to these businesses about you know finding product market fit innovating building community um you know telling and creating a narrative around things and then of course like obviously we're in entertainment but the hospitality side of what we do is really a huge component of it and so when it comes to relationships and introductions and helping companies uh you know meet the people that are gonna accelerate their growth and and and business um i think we really are helpful with that and that's kind of how we position ourselves is like you know investing's become so institutionalized like we kind of think of ourselves as the sexy plus one that comes in as like a great partner to any founder and you'll want to have a beer with us at the end of the day you know we're going to be like your bloodhounds and we're going to go to any length to make sure that you guys um and girls or whoever have what they need in order to you know make uh hit their objectives and i think for us like when we launched the first fund um like anything you kind of don't know i think back to the chainsmokers it was like making derivative music of like calvin harrison and zed and you know early on i think for us we were like okay we know consumer and there's a you know obviously gigantic vertical that you know walks along that path maybe we'll focus on that in blockchain um and that's what we put on our deck and we went out to our investors and it was so funny because they were like get rid of this blockchain i don't want to see it and we were like all right blockchain's out of here and so we went out raised our fund and very quickly we were kind of you know we had the opportunity to speak to some sas companies and fintech companies and we were like wait why are we pigeonholing ourselves in the consumer you know i think the reason we did that is because it was the only place that we thought we could add value and the reason that's important is because you know like i mentioned earlier we're super self-aware and i think when we launched our fund you know a lot of people congratulated us but also i i could feel the tension in the room where there are a lot of people being like this is the beginning of the end like good lord like you know what i mean wait there's some skepticism about this absolutely yeah absolutely i think people just didn't you know it's like anything it's like you know if a there's certain you know people that become musicians or djs overnight and you're just like come on man don't make you know this is already like a weird business as is like i don't need you coming here and screwing things up and making a mockery of something that you know i take super seriously and not to mention you can like you know hurt these companies we're invested in you can you know lose money for your lps um and and i think you know we were really cognizant of that and for us we understood the road ahead that we had to climb and and the work that needed to be done and for us like we understood fundamentally the way that we were going to be successful is truly by adding value and that alone and through that network of founders that we helped we would begin to see more access more deal flow and you know in the early days we were super lucky and fortunate to speak to a ton of investors founders people that we admire just on the you know just to get advice hear about their experiences what they thought about the space and the way i liken it is to like moving into like a cul-de-sac and like going to your neighbors with like brownies and being like i promise you i'm not gonna be like a frat house you know what i'm in and everyone's like kind of being like oh these guys are thoughtful you know like they might actually take this seriously maybe i maybe i will be open to working with them on opportunities and you know over that first fund it came you know clear more clear to people that just how serious we were taking and just how much we cared about adding value into the business we invest in and you know and it was only through like you know certain opportunities like getting into a fintech certain fintech deals that became clear to you you're like wait i could actually move the needle for a company in any space really just you know we just have to identify what those things are and so we kind of brought in the scope of what mantis was going to be investing in and actually conversely we at the same time we were like i don't want to do consumer at all really actually uh you know and i think that was kind of in order to protect the chainsmoker brand which is like generally consumer related businesses always want the same thing from us social too and like so if we make bets in that space we have to really like be you know certain that that's the company we want to back from you know now to finish and uh and that was really important to us so it you know it's funny like we didn't want to become the qvc adventurer and and kind of like hurt our music brand and so by kind of investing in spaces that really maybe the chainsmokers people thought would have no business involved in like ml and ai and uh you know life sciences and things like that i think that's where we really uh began to really take off and see the path of what mantis would become it's mantis is such an interesting portfolio i just love it and i guess the common denominators is as you guys here i want to ask this question because uh you know people listening maybe maybe that they're probably not creators right and uh um but you guys make this parallel between releasing a hit song and like investing in a hit business it's kind of like a numbers game there's an element where you like don't know which investment is actually going to pay off but you guys are going to be able to make the parallels better better better than i can i don't have a hit song yet bankless is no hit songs so like uh how is how is it how is investing similar to like finding product market fit for a specific song or like genre um i think the deeper we get into it uh it's product market fit yes that's one part of it but it's really like investing in people um and identifying people that are willing to is this a great team like do you have the mentality to persevere through stuff that is inevitably going to go wrong um you know like what are your other intro what are your outside interests like what are you going to get distracted with are you going to you know raise a big round and become you know not to name names but one of those founders that kind of gets lost in the sauce of being a celebrity founder which is a new recent concept that we're we're all like kind of dealing with um and i mean that doesn't happen too often but you know like you know do you have the stamina do you have the willpower to stay focused and not let especially in the environment we raise our first fund in 2020 um and you know fast forward to today we've like i feel like we've lived through like three like you know a decade of what most funds experience um in terms of uh market cycles and you know we've seen yeah you see like you know a lot of you know we joined in a time where a lot of you know founders were letting valuations go to their head and not not building lean strong companies and um we see the same thing in the music business kids that have one hit song and they move to la and they're out every night and they think [ __ ] is sweet um and it's gonna last forever um and then you never hear from him again um so you have you know this is like an all-day you know you gotta find someone with a chip on their shoulder as big as ours that you know can't they have no other option it's live or die making their business work um and so i feel like that i mean i know i just went into people for a long time but that's really a huge part of it i mean you can analyze tam and you can analyze if you think it's a good vertical or if it's a good product or conceptually it's great but um people i think is the most important thing that you know we draw parallels from the music business from alex you alluded to it and i want to pick your brain a little bit more about that was was there like a stigma that the chainsmokers had as venture capitalists as in what are these edm djs doing in the world of venture capital they think they're hotshot investors was that a stigma that you guys had to overcome i don't know we know of anything we thought we were hotshot investors i think people just thought we'd be idiots or something [Applause] like and and i don't think like you know if you don't know us like i don't blame anyone necessarily like if you watch you know if you just follow us on instagram like we're goofy guys like we don't take ourselves too seriously we have a lot of fun you know our lives revolve around basically showing people hopefully having giving people the best nights and times of their lives um but you know what you don't see behind the scenes is all the relationships that we've built the people we've taken care of the team that we manage i mean chainsmokers alone is like 25 or 30 people you know is a business and you know it's always you know you talk to these founders and you're just like wait i we make way more revenue than you you know you do and you're you know the va sas multiples and everything it's wild uh but i think for us like just being self aware of that you know and understanding that like not everyone's gonna get what we're trying to do at first and you know you just have to put keep your head down and work and and and take things really seriously and i think you know for us we are very cognizant of what we don't know and we have no problem leaning into people that we admire and respect that have much more experience and asking for help and advice and partnerships and i think you know if you go in kind of hopefully with like that humble modest attitude like people are more willing to help you work with you and and i think that you know was a really funny exciting experience and i think you know a lot of the conversations that people have when we invest are like okay i'll let them best i like the conversation they got they sold me on what they're gonna help me with and then the next you know conversation is like holy [ __ ] they're [ __ ] great you know i mean like they really surprised me and and that's kind of like you know and then that founders hopefully speak to the next founder we're trying to invest in and they're like yo i know exactly what you're thinking right now and i'm telling you you're going to be surprised and i think i'm comfortable with that and you mentioned like very early on like the underdog mentality and i think that's something that we've always carried with ourselves and kind of pushed you know allows us to push ourselves forward which is like we don't take really anything for granted or any moment or opportunity and you know i always feel like we have something to prove no matter how great things have looked externally and you know and i think that's made this whole experience really fun to invest in the next constantly be investing in like a fountain of youth like the next generation of amazing thinkers and disruptors doing crazy things um it a lot you know as we get you know older it allows us to continually feel close to what's really happening in the world and where change is happening um and i think just having you know the avengers on your cap table is becoming more important like instead of having the same old dudes you know in that of the same capital and you know preach the same things it's like hey how about like just throwing in a little complimentary smoker fund and you know they have a little bit uh different perspective and experience and and approach that really might supercharge things and i think different you know having that differentiation these days is counting for more and more as things become more you know homogeneous yeah can i be honest with you guys for just a minute it's like you're actually blowing me away in this conversation like i was expecting a really good conversation with the chainsmokers but i was not expecting like investor savvy business savvy founder savvy to be coming through like it's it's really cool i'm reading my buzzwords right now no but it's true i mean i'm not even gonna lie to you like i remember doing our first yc pitch or like you know week and i didn't like know what tam was like i kept mentioning tam in these pitches and i was like can someone just explain to me what you know and like on the tons of calls for months and months till to this day you know i'm like googling things and trying to understand you know certain uh you know phrases and you know in your defense there are a ton of acronyms yeah yeah there's so many activities yeah too what the hell we have so many acronyms oh my god i mean crypto's like french yeah rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only syncing provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300

and friction free well something i've definitely learned is that a decent amount of investing is just kind of a vibe more than it is the numbers as well especially in the early stage as well and uh you guys said mantis started in 2020 and ryan and i really got started doing our angel investing uh about a year later sometime in 2021 so we're about like a year behind you guys we don't have a fund or anything but definitely i am uh into the idea of being an activist investor right because when i invest in something it's because i want to see that thing come out into the world i think if that product were to exist it would make the world a better place and so i automatically feel responsible for helping that version of the future come out because i literally think it's a better future of the world so when you guys take an activist investor approach like what is it what are the things that you are doing to actually help guide the future that you guys want to see for the world like what is it what does it mean to be an activist investor what are the things you guys are doing for the uh opportunities that you invest in uh i mean i think it depends on the types of business i mean there's some that are like you know not so exciting they're more like sas businesses that you know externally or internally help other companies achieve goals easier you know streamlining things and and uh you know bringing archaic systems forward into the future but then they're like things like you know we just invested in this company earth which this guy created is like proprietary uh proprietary i guess they're capsules but basically like they decompose but it sounds really dark but they decompose like you know someone who's passed away into like a nutrient-rich soil basically so instead of like cremation as an option now you're getting back this like nutrient-rich soil someone you love that you can go you know plant flowers from or you know lay it you know somewhere and it just it feels better it sounds better it's better for the planet in terms of carbon emissions from uh you know um you know gas is released from cremating someone and you know and it's just like simple things like that like what an interesting concept you know what i mean instead of like burning the person you love into ashes you're like you know they're like more it's more natural process and better for the environment and um ultimately that has a it has a 100 tan yeah and you know and there's you know there are opportunities like that and then there's things like you know web3 opportunities about creating you know uh uh more ownership for you know the creators that exist out there and more opportunity to to take ownership of the things you create i mean that's something we've faced in our you know own music business which is like you know the we're we're like the ones slaving away generating this these products and and pieces of music that you know uh are loved by everybody but we're like the smallest owner in all of these things that we create like what there's something broken with that you know and i think when it comes to three we're a little bit more interested in infrastructure at this point just because of how early it is and i think that's the place you should be investing in but like thinking towards the future of the opportunity of it those things are really exciting us i mean the way we got in the blockchain was we helped found this company yellowheart which is like a blockchain ticketing platform um and that's a whole story into itself but like conceptually it was like what a great technology like we can like solve the ticket scalping problem we can form a deeper relationship with our fans and create a better sense of community you know we can contact people uh based you know like we go play shows in cities and the next day they're like when are you coming to my city and we're like what the what the hell you know i mean like we don't own this information to reach out to those people that bought tickets in the past so it's like you know i think there's all sorts of applications of things that you know get us really excited um and they're all different you know we're fairly opportunistic agnostic investors and it's kind of like you know their calls you get on and you're just like you know this is going to be stupid and you leave feeling like holy [ __ ] you know like this guy like you know i don't know we invested in this company radiant nuclear not out of mantis but just drew and i and you know he's trying to create nuclear fire uh basically in like container size you know uh reactors that like then can power you know small city remote cities or military facilities or you know work set up uh hospitals in in uh areas that you know otherwise have lost electricity and you're just like i don't know what the likelihood of this you know i mean people been talking about nuclear fire infusion for a long time but like the opportunity to invest in this and help someone is it's pretty cool and exciting guys uh that's a good segue to like web 3 and crypto and what you guys think about that but like you know uh so it was it was drew's idea to start the fund right whose idea was it to buy the board ape you guys did that in was it like september of last year you bought a board ape right uh yeah we got two you got two right okay yeah we bought it with like our team actually it's like our manager our agent our business manager me drew um so why did you guys do this and like what was it what was the reaction i think you changed like the chainsmokers twitter handle at least yeah it was actually like i've never i don't think we've ever posted anything that's gotten quite as big a reaction really which was like okay this is crazy and i think that's really cool i think what hugo labs has done so well is create this sense of community um and you know by giving away the ip i thought that was such a power move on their part to like give i give the ownership to the people that bought those things and then they could go off and create their own communities around those pieces of items and you know who knows ultimately what this all becomes i mean i think we're big fans of theirs and everything they've done so far but you know for us it's like that's what's fun is like experimenting and trying different things out and uh that was one of those you know i studied art history and like wow like i don't necessarily know if i compare like our ape to like a lichtenstein or uh you know van gogh or something like you know it's cool and you know people identify their personalities with these things and while you know they're incredibly expensive i don't know what what the floor is right now but they were when we got in um you know it was a fun kind of social experiment and i think that's what you're seeing a lot of in crypto is you know these different kind of case studies and experiments that people are taking to you know try out the possibilities of what web 3 has to offer and i know i know like there's all sorts of rabbit holes people lately have gone down on podcasts that have gotten burned first so i'm not going to make the same mistake but you guys are up i saw i think you bought it at like 55 eat or something at least one of the apes and we're we're at 86 even though ethan's down you know you're up yeah that's hard to do in this market in this economy okay to be up i was talking to someone i wouldn't say yesterday and they were thinking about investing with this person i made an intro to and they were like think about giving all my bitcoin to them i was like how much bitcoin you have they're like 500 bitcoin and i was like oh you're oh you're getting murdered right now aren't you you know i was like i know you didn't buy in early yeah and uh he was like yeah this sucks um but you know the regular initiation process of this for sure i mean you know i think we've always thought of ourselves as long-term investors in pretty much anything you do like it's it's that's what the denture is you know you're betting in a a better future in many years to come um and you know we've been investing for six years now and i don't think anything we've invested in has thought you know we've had some uh uh you know acquisitions and stuff like that but you know certainly not any jackpot yet it takes time you know you got to be patient and what goes up goes down and what goes down goes up and you know i think right now everyone's obviously having a really hard time including ourselves but you know i think that this is just one of those cycles you kind of just got to put keep your head down and refocus and and you know eventually hopefully brighter days ahead so when did you guys get into web three you guys were uh already investors and web three has a ton of surface area for investment and so i'm wondering about when was the uh aha moment for like oh web 3 has some opportunity here but also at the same time i want to hear your guys's like rough dry uncut takes about web 3. like i when you look at web3 do you see potential or do you see skepticism like what what bar parts about web3 do you really like and what parts really really bug you and overall what was like the initiation process for becoming web three investors tell us what you really think about nfts guys yeah yeah do you guys hate our industry no and not at all we love your industry and um i i think for our fund um we've tried to focus on infrastructure um and not you know invest in the things that are gonna power this entire ecosystem as uh you know over a lot of like flashy things that feel like not become sets which that's one of the things that like i got really disillusioned with um in terms of taking a ton of uh you know meetings for for investment for mantis in the space is there a lot of things that were um you know the cart before the horse um and things that yes conceptually like make sense to build at some point but if you look at the popular population that's actively trading in in this environment or is active in this environment forget about trading um it's just not there yet um a lot of and if you're too early you're wrong so there's a lot of things that just felt very premature um and you know i hope a lot of these things exist at some point but there's so much infrastructure there's so much onboarding uh getting people into the space that needs to happen before a lot of these companies can survive um and right now i mean feels like we're going towards a crypto winter uh i don't know if it will be that drastic but you know those are the lot the first things to go so um you know we have a fiduciary responsibility to first of all be optimistic but really be realistic about where things are at and and uh and try to invest in in the nuts and bolts of this industry as a creator i'm really excited to see a um new technology that's based around community um and i think you know every business every web 2 business every um i mean really everything is kind of the world's in a weird place right now just culturally um you know i think i mean i guess let me just draw a parallel to music like no one knows what the [ __ ] is going on in music right now no one knows how to break a song um like you know everyone points to tick tock but like you can't make a song go viral on tik-tok um it's great when it happens um and the artists that i really look up to right now that are winning the most are the ones that are focusing on uh kind of slowly they're not focused on having big hit songs they're not focused on um just like the flex of it all um you know which you know everyone wants but the ones that are really winning that are like just killing it in ticket sales ticket sales is where you really see how much people love an artist you know do they just love you on social media do they just like listen to your songs or will they literally pay a hundred dollars to come see you that's the real test and the people that are winning in that space are the ones that have focused on community the ones that have slowly built um a fan base that's very unique to them they have a sound that no one else can do as well as them they're not chasing trends and you know they've built something that's really stable um around them and these are some some of these artists you guys have probably heard of um you know some of them most people have but most of it most people have not um and i think what web 3 empowers is it's a whole toolbox uh that empowers people like artists like that to uh um bolden their community uh and that's what's like the most exciting thing for me and i know it's kind of vague but that's my roundabout way of getting to why i love it and and just to answer a couple of those other things you touched on like at yellowheart the blockchain technic platform i mentioned was kind of our first foray into into blockchain technology in the crypto world um yeah i think you know for us the idea of like being able to solve ticket scalping through nft watching technology was really exciting and we were kind of five years ahead this was like probably five or six years ago at this point and it was you know we ran into all sorts of different roadblocks that we didn't encounter like first of all not there's no it was no mainstream adoption yet into this idea but it was really funny when i think it was like mid 2020 like in the summer when like web 3 kind of really began to take off uh i remember investors calling and being like hey i remember we told you to take blockchain out of your deck but you guys are still investing in web3 right and we were like yes don't worry um and you know and i think to drew's point like from a practicality standpoint like there's so many exciting things you know we obviously did that royal drop like you the the connection you can create like you said to embolden your community to uh you know have this kind of online ledger in different capacities to tokenize things and reward people for you know take being fans i think back to like the early days maybe of our career when we bought our first microphone and drew and i were like i remember like pulling out of our like six thousand dollar shared account like twenty five hundred dollars to buy a mic at like sam uh was it sam ash probably and we were just like oh god we just aged ourselves yeah yeah and i was like i was like you better we better [ __ ] sing you know what i mean like this thing like you know i think the first song we made with that mic was roses wow or selfie i think yeah unfortunately yeah but but like is like i think back to like an artist that could in that you know in the same scenario but move forward in time they could turn to their community and say hey guys i really want to buy this keyboard but i can't afford it you know everyone who chips together i'm gonna give you guys a token that forever will show that you guys were early supporters and it will give you ownership in the net all the songs that i create off of this microphone or something like that or you know you guys get lifetime access to shows and and i think that's that's a really cool proposition that you really it's really not there's no there's no ability to do that right now i think you know that concept by the way is so [ __ ] dope imagine i want to become a mission uh i need i need you know 800 to buy this microphone to make this thing and have people like buy a token off of that and then like think about where that could go that's so [ __ ] dope and i think like you know not to go into the dark side of like kind of what kind of feels like in some ways like crypto winners maybe the dot com bubble bursting and you know the 2000 or whatever year was you know and i think these things are they're healthy cycles to have happen you know and i think what happened you know unfortunately obviously a lot of people are going to struggle and things are going to go away but i think the resilient important pieces are going to be built and people are going to buckle down and the sentiment i'm hearing in a lot of the groups that i'm in that people that are very whole about the space are like we wish this was never happening but the sentiment is very different from like 2018 and earlier you know whip winters where people feel like there's more of a consolidated positive effort now of things that are going to happen in the future whereas before it felt like maybe this was the end forever people are like this is just about another a sad bump in the road but we're going to consolidate and keep building and um and there's going to be more opportunity in the future and i think you know when it comes to social space there's going to be really interesting opportunities but you know at its core we're going to get rid of the kind of superfluous cell phone.com you know dog.com like those types of businesses that you know just weren't really necessary but then out of that come you know the amazons and the googles and these amazing businesses that um you know create all sorts of different opportunities um so i'm we're very excited yeah i absolutely could not agree more i remember coming out of 2018 the 2018 crypto mania wondering what the hell that whole thing was and why anyone would stick around in this industry yeah and no one feels that way in 2021 or 2022. there's so many more reasons to stick around and i think crypto's gonna retain a lot more of the people that came in in the last few years and it's because of the real utility that we have in this industry now while a lot of people are are who look at this industry from the surface they probably don't see it but if you pull back under the hood and you find out what people like yourselves are doing at a very fundamental level then you can realize that there's actually real utility here and one of the things that you guys do did was your drop with uh the royal platform we've had justin blau on the podcast a number of times before and i'm just super interested in the way that artists can have a reverberating conversation with their fans through the utility of the tokens that they issue so i'm wondering if you guys can walk for our listeners through the your guys's mint with royal your mint and your drop with royal how it uh created a relationship with your fans that you might have not had before and overall just the the thought and ethos behind this whole uh engagement that you guys did with royal totally i i mean i think just you know before we get to royal i mean what you know kind of talking about the enthusiasm that is still in the web through space even in a time like this um yes a lot of value has disappeared in terms of monetary value has disappeared but like what what we really saw happen over the past two years is community all these communities people that felt like they belonged to something that they believed and they were connected other people that were like-minded with but you know you know in in a world that they never felt like you know you know in the real world they really felt like they never fit in they have this something this thing that they're really passionate about and that's where a lot of great things are created so you know mac early that's what i'm most excited about you know just looking at the space in general what we wanted to do with with our drop with royal and you know to give a little bit of context i mean justin is is a pioneer and leader in in the space from the music side um you know he made obviously whatever one he you know he he dropped one of his old albums and totally tokenized one of his old albums and he made a ton of money on it um you know it's probably most people listen to this podcast know and the response from the music industry was they didn't understand that justin was so uh such a like a part of this community and he had built uh he had just built that around himself before this album drop happened and that was that was what was supporting it what people saw was oh cool people will buy my fans will buy digital goods cool i can i can you know and this is a little bit hardcore but rinse my fans for for that i can sell digital essentially merch i can tokenize things and make money which is um in my opinion uh the complete wrong interpretation of the space and how to utilize it and um you know a lot of people did make really meaningful from the music side made really meaningful uh nft projects and that's great and they had a fan base that they really connected with that really i wanted those things but there were a lot of people that just were like okay cool we're selling this now let's let's uh what do i need i need to find an artist and and create something that's like you know digital but tangible and and people will buy and i'll make money great but you know that that's that was a flash in the pan thing that was a bubble that popped really quickly um uh you know we wanted to do with our drop with justin and we had a lot of conversations about you know where the space is going and you know back to community it's like what can we do what can we great this is a whole new tool that we can use to create um the most in-depth fan club that's ever existed we can give them a piece of ownership in our songs um we can give them perks we can we can we have information on where our our most hardcore fans are um you know we have a you know discord has also you know done an incredible has become an incredible utility in the space like you know really connecting with the people that care the most about you um and getting feedback from that community get you know bringing them into the process and it's been like relatively effortless you know like you know you don't want to go on instagram and post about the minutia of what it takes to make a song but there are you know you know we have i probably think we have like you know 10 000 people on our discord now which is you know that was 500 people a few months ago and um they're our most hardcore fans and we get to bring them in like you know the creative process and you know we have the people that these people that hold this nft that feel like they're part of our story and we want them to be um and you know i think we're there's so much experimentation that's happening right now um in this space and and this maybe this is just one iteration of it but we have a deeper connection with our fans than we've ever had before because of this drop um and that's really cool i don't know what this where this space is going or what it's going to become but just trying things like that has been really you know empowering for us i really love what you guys are doing here and i i just like there's an evolved quote we often talk about on bank list there's like play long term games with long term people and like as a creator uh playing a long term game with your community not trying to rinse them not trying to rip them off but like add value to their lives whether it's through music and the art you create or like financial upside that has got to be part of your relationship with the community and that's a long-term game that i'm seeing in your drop actually so i'm wondering about some of the mechanics here for people who haven't seen it but like so you have a i think this is targeted towards some of your super fans as you're saying right so like a certain class of fan was was uh eligible for this and then you have like a percentage of your album royalty actually going to fans so it's not just backed by like promise of future stuff tell us a little bit about things i should have i should have clarified uh we also gave these nfts away for free right we had yeah we had we had data on you know who our top you know dsp listeners were uh we have obviously the people from discord and we we made sure that those were the people that got this it wasn't we didn't sell these there's no you know if they're if they're trying to was that important to you why did you do that because it's fully based around community like i'm trying to give people that care about us the most a piece of what we're doing and i want to have a conversation with them and i don't want and all you know if these trade and you know as they've traded in a secondary market if there's any like i think 10 of it goes to to us but we gave that entire 10 to the writers um but that helped us on this album so you know emily warren kirkpatrick wheaton you know some of our really close friends that were um an inherent part of this project because that's also another part that hasn't been defined about the space is like okay an artist is gonna sell an nft based around their album what about the people that helped you make that album you know and you know some people have you know they're making money off a project and and you know these you know amazingly talented people that aren't being uh compensated for it is just wrong and i you know we just wanted to do something that we felt like was we kind of wanted to be a leader uh ethically um and and embolden our community and and that's kind of where we are sorry alex i know you understand i don't know i mean you could have said it all but like what's interesting to me there in it like obviously i think music publishing rights is something that blockchain can be a really interesting component and piece of in the future i think like when i think about web3 like zooming out like i don't know if the world becomes just web3 like i think it's really a combination of both of those things like i think applying some of this practical incredible new innovation technology to spaces that use it like financial institutions that want to wire money or keep ledgers and track of things um you know to music rights and distributing royalties to artists efficiently and effectively you know in real time um but i don't know you know do we just fully get rid of publishing plate you know how is this like do you like do you as an artist want to pitch your songs to tv shows like no and i think like that's the world i think we're heading towards is this kind of hopefully mixed you know like a mixed reality basically of web 3 and web 2 where you're applying this amazing technology to spaces that really need it and can benefit from it um in different ways whether it's social whether it's finance whether it's music um and you know i think that's where you know you're gonna see really exciting opportunities happen and one thing i just do want to say though is like you know i do i am a believer that like this space does need some regulation ultimately and i and it's not because i'm like it's crazy and there's so many bad actors in it although there are a lot of bad actors in it which has probably led to some of the negative feedback on it but because like you need to define the rules of a game on some levels in order to like create the game effectively like if you just like were playing basketball you know 75 years ago and you could just pick the ball up and run with it like you know that's a very different game you know what i mean and by defining the rules like it became a you know a really fun game that everyone knew understood how to play and there were people that were better at it and people that were worse at it you know but the game of basketball has evolved so much since you know it was inception 70 years ago you know with the three-pointer and dunks and the athletic wear you know that helps you perform better and even you know the athletes and how they train so i think like in general like that's kind of how i hope you know as the web 3 evolves there's certain frameworks put in place that like can kind of define it a little bit more clearly so we don't end up in some of these you know really [ __ ] situations that you know we're reading about every day on twitter yeah especially as prices go down by like 90 percent all the uh the clusterfucks make their way to the into the top of crypto twitter and everyone starts to realize uh that a lot of people were swimming without swim trunks on yeah um plenty of stories like this lately um but it's i mean you guys are long-term people so you're here for the long term and i'm wondering does the story of the chainsmokers in web 3 where where does that go you guys have this uh nft that resembles a share of your guys's streaming fees for the for the uh their most recent album do you guys have any plans behind the scenes like where where's the trajectory of the chainsmokers in web 3 going from here i don't know i mean obviously we're we're putting a lot of emphasis on on on the token holders and and i don't know what other artists that have done royal drops or whatever have done for their fans like i part of me like believes that they have done nothing and it should uh but you know we're pretty actively every week trying to do something whether it's you know a discord session where we play new music or air dropping unreleased songs or you know we have all sorts of ideas um and things that we want to keep pushing you know ultimately we're kind of at the mercy of what where the technology heads and goes but like you know who knows like you know maybe one day we're unsigned and we could use some of these different serve you know whether it's catalog or whatever to try out some different features and functions i think like blockchain ticketing technology again is just going to be such an important powerful space there's kind of a monopoly over it with live nation and aeg so it's like we're kind of at the mercy of them deciding when this is the right time to use some of this but you know i think you're going to see see that stuff happening and you know while i don't know what the big cloud's doing right now and i think they're iterating on a new gso version of it but um you know the idea of like backing an artist early and then participating in their success over years is such a cool idea like think i can think of a hundred artists that i was like i remember discovering duolingo when she was like okay you know like she was just like by figuring out what she was gonna become she's the biggest artist in the world now like if i could have put a couple of dollars behind early do you do alipa i wouldn't have to be doing [ __ ] right now like you know and uh and i love no don't lie alex you'd still be making music i mean at air corps we're always going to be workers i mean i think there's no there's no number i posted something the other day i went engulfed at chelsea piers just was hitting balls and like golf is so fun like i know how great golf is going to be i refuse to play it because i know how good golf is going to be and so i like set a number in my head of like personal net worth where if i reach that i will begin to play golf but until then no golf and you know but i think it's exciting and we'll see what happens and hopefully from the fun side we'll keep investing in you know people uh the right people that we believe are gonna you know push the space forward and do innovative things and you know we're lucky we were lucky enough to invest in alchemy as one of our first web three investments and like they really nikhil and joe really taught us a lot about the things that we should be thinking about when it comes to the space and you know you need to build a foundation before you can build a house and i think you know right now that's kind of what what's happening um so we're always really interested in layer ones and and and you know that those areas and it's gonna be exciting to see you know what transpires and i hope the only part that i think and i you know that is kind of unfortunate is this like there feels like this is like there's this like republican verse democrat battle in web 3 versus web 2 people and you know i don't know why everyone is so angry on both sides of the fence about each other and i understand because web3 people you know get annoyed one of two people you know say that this is a stupid technology and there's no use for bitcoin and ethereum and uh you know and they're just like it's almost like if you have nothing nice to say like just don't say it at all you just don't have to buy it you know you don't have to buy the jpeg or whatever right exactly but but also like to their point like i think you know people feel a sense of responsibility to be like hey don't buy that celebrity [ __ ] coin like you're gonna lose money and i think they're bad actors out there and people try to shine light on that but maybe sometimes they get too much attention you know obviously crashing up luna does doesn't do any favors for the space um but these are things that have happened in web 2 as well you know and there's like every kind of genesis and technology has moments and bad actors and things that you know are terrible you know what i mean and and but it's all part of the process of evolving and you know i just hope that you know it's just funny it's like you know when you go on twitter and you're just like just you know what's going to get people riled up on both sides of the fence yeah there's even you know the bitcoin maximalists have skipped all the way to like uh web 5.0 rather than 3.0 you know it's like just it's crazy man but to make a farce yeah yeah so guys like this has actually been one of my favorite podcasts that we've recorded and i was not expecting this going in what was your favorite josh rosenthal uh crypto what was your statement yo we are both of our favorites are josh rosenthal renaissance have you guys listened to that one no i gotta listen yeah alex if you're into art man this is all history this guy's a phd in history and he goes through it yeah by the way he makes a very concrete argument that the same technologies that uh triggered their actual renaissance of the 1400s are the same technologies that are triggering what is a future renaissance which is the internet is like the original printing process and then blockchain technology is double entry bookkeeping that's an hour and a half long podcast there's a lot more to it than that we also talk about memes like memes go back right our ancient history yeah there's so much i mean yeah i mean memes are very interesting in terms of like how they shift to culture and i i actually like i've always thought about that like if we add another partner i'd love them to have like a history background because i do i'm like a firm believer in that these things repeat themselves you just kind of have to identify those patterns obviously uh ray uh dalio dalio is like a big believer in that and it's true you know what i mean so i think it's like you can kind of find the answers in the past it's uh about what's gonna happen so cool man i was not expecting to nerd out with you guys so hard but that's what we're doing uh so this has been so much fun i guess uh last question for you guys just because i'm super curious i know your main uh holdings like a lot of your main investments are kind of in the fun structure of course you've got a lot of different uh crypto infrastructure companies you guys hold any like crypto assets like personally or like outside of this are you like bullish on anything any any any like ether bitcoin or even like nfts yeah i mean go ahead um i mean i i hold ethan bitcoin obviously and i'm along on both of those and uh everything's on sale right now yeah um but yeah yeah yeah solana avalanche uh and uh you know from an nft perspective like i like i just hold and collect like i never like bought and just sold like i mean i have a clonex i have some doodles i have some invisible friends i have some you know we have some apes um some art blocks i just think it's cool like you know like i think back like i've studied so many textbooks over the course of my life that like you know catalog different areas in history that you know cover you know contemporary art to modern art to renaissance art to whatever and like there's gonna be a section about nfts and that's a really cool idea that in like a hundred years you know people are going to have to study what are what were these first you know uh you know primitive nfts of the world of the world and like you know hopefully my kids will benefit greatly from me and holding on to these things and not selling them you know the way of the art the art world but uh but i think those you know those things are really interesting and i think um again it's like i've never been a day trader you know it's never been a part of who i am so i can't speak to those people that are so brilliant that they can study those types of trends on you know on that on that timeline but you know for me it's like i i think we all see the long-term value of these things and you know again it's like you just got to look at the general you know the stock market chart for some since the 1920s and it's like technology is compounding wealth is compounding and innovation and it's you know everything has these moments you know you kind of have to get knocked down to get back up we've seen it in our own career countless times and uh you know we'll see what happens next certainly and i do have to just thank you guys first for of course coming on the bankless podcast but also the way that this industry progresses is that people that play long-term games come into this industry and then they stick around and start using the tools that this industry has to offer for the betterment of themselves their fans and the industry as a whole and so it takes more people like you drew alex the chain smokers to come in and really leverage the good side of this industry to show people that it's worth sticking around during the bear markets even though the bear markets are just rough times to be in so thank you for seeing the same things that ryan and i see in this space in the future that we share as well so i appreciate that thank you appreciate it you guys are awesome this was a real pleasure and you know we we don't do written press anymore because they just [ __ ] our words up and we look like it's uh it's how we get to do like a podcast be ourselves with like two great great uh you know hosts like yourselves it's awesome and then the other the other things i have to give you guys is uh i saw you guys at the blended festival in san diego last year oh yeah and it very much felt like uh the the official end of kovid for me because i was like okay like yeah like we're doing music festivals now oh sweet the chain smokers are coming to a place that's like literally five minutes away from from where i live and that was a great concert so thank you for coming to san diego you guys got backstage
