crypto is obviously super new and exciting and it's full of people who are united around not accepting right the system that we're currently in and being able to imagine a different better one right and so I think like these modes of not just accepting what we're told is right and trying to imagine like a system outside of that is really where I see the connection although I do see the crypto Community departs a lot from some of those ideological roots of critical theory which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing I actually really like the diversity of thought that I've seen within the space so far
