[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today is another recap episode we are going through the hottest topics of the week which there's so much going on and yet it still feels like really the only topic of the week is yuga labs between their acquisition and the ape coin which launched this morning as we're recording this it's thursday but most importantly i am joined in this episode by a very special guest my friend john rogers he has been on the show before you love him you know him former disney exec who's gonna talk all things web three we'll probably get into some disney news but again the the top of the hour must be spent on apecoin and yuga labs john thank you so much for being here thanks for having me back it's great to be here again and yes the the fallout continues from the the amazing blockbuster announcement from uh yugo labs absolutely so we are going to dive into that and i think you're gonna i'll give kind of an overview you can really break down what we know so far in terms of what they're saying the the money is going to be spent on how the dow structure is going to work like really what comes next what are these aips you know these improvement these ap improvement code protocols what does that all look like also known as apes also apes aips but first we are going to hear a word from some of our

news um but i haven't really broken down the yuga acquisition on this show yet i talked about it a little bit in my interview with jim mcneillis which came out jimmy mcneils which came out earlier this week but we we haven't gone full full tilt on the yuga labs buying me bits and buying crypto punks i was thinking maybe we take this like according to each stakeholder like in this deal ape holders punk holders me bit holders and sort of break down what the reaction is on that side um i know you have some interesting insights you want to share kind of breaking down what dc investor has been saying he's in the punk camp call it um but let's let's do that last let's start with ape holders my feeling is they're pretty happy about this it feels sort of like in the ape punk war this is a sign that they almost won in some ways and yuga you know reigned supreme over larva in in a certain way what has been what have you been seeing when it comes to ape holders reactions to this news yeah my takeaway is that the apollos are very happy about this this is going to open up a lot of opportunities for for a holders um obviously some of the announcements that came out afterwards about the dao and the coin are certainly gonna you know this is obviously a big build and so that's all gonna kind of come into play here uh so yeah the ape holders are happy i think they should be happy about this um i don't really like to characterize it as a war between punks and apes although i know that's sort of played out on twitter that way i you know each brand is unique and indifferent and as long as yuga um manages them as such i i think it should be okay now i have some thoughts on the punk side of things which we'll get to in a second um but i think the main thing is that it's not like trying to bring conformity to multiple brands it's respecting what the unique attributes of each brand and what makes it special like like a disney or any of these you know mega ip holder entities need to do right which is think about i mean hey you know this better than anybody like think about each of their properties as distinct for what it does each of its franchises yeah you know my my theory has been that we will see over time the emergence of what you might think of like the traditional big studios the big six now the big five like a disney or universal that that will occur in the nft space and what i think we've just seen is the first not the only because some people have called this a monopoly and this is nowhere near in monopoly but this is the first of those studios to emerge the first shot across that bow yeah no there will be 10 others perhaps over the next couple of years that also emerge and they will have a brand portfolio uh of properties that they're managing and building communities around and uh so i think that's really exciting that okay the first one's emerged now who's going to be set next yeah i think it's exciting too from as a podcast host i i am excited about talking about these kinds of business machinations that i think are going on behind the scenes um and i tweeted in january like when do we see major nft por like a major nft brands buying up other nft ips so it came faster than i thought but i i enjoyed kind of flexing on on yeah i'll riff on that for a minute because a lot of the conversation online in the community is about there's like a race to first to be biggest and that's not to say the right way to look at it there there will be a biggest for sure right now it is apes clearly but it's healthy to have a million a medium-sized property it's healthy to have smaller niche smaller size properties a portfolio that's the purpose of a portfolio strategy that you're gonna have big ones and small ones and they serve different communities and that is the healthy way to manage it and i think there's tremendous opportunities for teams that want to create other and go other directions and i well also the the having smaller brands having niche brands is actually what's so incredible about this space right which it back in you know 20 years ago you had these gatekeepers that determined what got shown on tv or on film and it was mostly a bunch of white men who had a particular set of preferences and said this is what people quote unquote want to see and it and what we've learned is that's not necessarily true people want to see all sorts of different kinds of things where however many billions of people on the planet like and so i think what it's beautiful to see the emergence of you know this this show for example right like there's a niche audience that likes this show and it's it's not insignificant but would a studio head have like a green lit this and been like yeah people absolutely want to see it it's just 20 years ago and there was like five children you know what i'm saying so i think that's um it's it's actually like the the power of this space and of what's happened sort of in the internet in general is um the ability to have content that appeals to ten thousand people that just like our diehards and love it um i want to ask you oh oh it's like the whole newsletter subscription business that's emerged you know ten thousand people is a healthy business for uh you know one or two creators it's amazing actually the ten thousand true fan theory that can now actually play out in a way that wasn't possible again when you had all these gatekeepers who determined you know what was popular i used the shonda rhimes example always which is like you know you people being like nobody wants to watch like you know stars that aren't white and she was like well here's sandra oh and carrie washington and like amazing rich characters and like the most popular shows of all time um so here was my question i started to raise this with jimmy but i want to ask you as well because i think it's interesting do you think ape holders see their apes as like a stake as like having equity or a piece of yugo labs and do do i'll start there do you think that they see that like in the way that ens token holders see that as sort of ownership over ens there's there's the what's the perception and what's the reality um i wouldn't say a holders as a community as a whole see it that way but there are certainly individuals that think that it that holding ape gives a say in the management of yuga or perhaps the direction of yuga and the reality is that is not the case yuga is its own independent entity the the founders and the investors in yuga um have that control and that's i think a little bit of where dc investor came in was the like this is a corporation i i don't think i like to call you a corporation quite yet that's not the way they're operating and i don't think that's where they want to operate but they are a business they will pursue other opportunities you as an owner of an ape do not have control over what they do and they could eventually sell apes to a universal someday or some other entity and you don't have control of that and that's i think where dc investor was going and i i loved seeing how he worked this through over the last say five or six days where it started off i think quite negative towards the deal and kind of be moved into a slightly more neutral position but just seeing him working through it through twitter was fascinating to follow and you know he he basically posted only cc0 projects going forward he changed his pfp um you know he really talked a lot i think i even put a quote over here i'm done building identities and brands which corporations can buy and sell without paying me i thought that was a great quote now there there's room for lots of kinds of projects cc01 there's room for restricted licensees and you as an investor buyer participant in the community have to pick what's right for you and he's clearly stated what's going to be right for him going forward so take us through the dc investor journey this is now moving us to what do punk holders how do punk holders feel about this acquisition and i think some probably fine with it and then you had some really outspoken uh detractors of the deal dc investor obviously being number one so it was his first his first sort of outrage was around um feeling like this you know it was a betrayal a betrayal and explain explain why well there's this perception that punks were the original og collection now cryptokitties are certainly there as well but punks were one of the first the first one ethereum i believe and the thing here is that they're feeling that what made them special and different was that unique status of they were the first they were art they were um untouchable and now there's been pressure recently to try to open up commercial rights from some of the holders punk 4156 famously sold his collection um in frustration with what would happen which i'm sure that person's probably regretting that move right now because this gave them what they would have wanted but i think for a lot of those og punk holders and you would put me in this camp personally is i'd be frustrated i felt like i had something i had an agreement as to what i purchased and it got it got rug pulled it got pulled out from underneath me and changed what was the agreement the agreement was this like historic property that was owned by larva labs like what's the what's the i think i think this isn't written of course but this is sort of an understood agreement that was violated which was the that this is going to be held as special and held as unique it's not going to be commercialized it's going to be it is what it is this was the creator's intention and that's going to be honored and kept and what happened was this creator sold it and did not honor that intention and so i think there's a lot of original buyers who've been holding these for several years now have some of large collections and can be frustrated and i i feel that frustration for them that i i would be in the same camp if i were a punk owner and i think it also starts to uh i don't know awaken fears of centralization right this idea like oh wow we're seeing this stuff can just be bought and sold by a couple actors sort of in an old world style and what if yuga for example bought up a bunch of other ip properties and turned around and sold that all to meta you know and and ultimately we don't actually have the power to stop that and i'll be curious if if the dow that you guys trying to set up if there's an idea that there would be some say in this with this dow in terms of like later sales and and purchases of of ip but i i think that's was stirred up in folks of like oh my gosh yeah okay i don't i still despite all of what we say in web 3 i still don't really own this thing in a way that i feel i should given the ethos of web 3 and it can just be sold off yeah and i think dc investor basically said if if you don't have a cc0 you don't truly own it that there's always a restriction there's always a limit of some kind yeah well it's that's interesting right because with cco if the project can't be sold within the public domains there is no buying or selling of it everybody owns all of it collectively which to some extent means sort of nobody's making money on it unless you find a way to to to monetize you know unless you create a project with it that you can monetize right right i'm working this through in real time i mean i you know i i guess what it feels like could you have the could is there a way to set it up where a community of holders collectively owns the ip of the whole thing so that when the ip sells they actually get royalties off of that sale right like i think what would have felt better and i guess this is a question and again working through in real time is had the punk collection sold to yugo labs and punk holders received royalties on that sale that might have felt different uh to folks would you agree am i where what is your reaction to that i still think punk holders would have been disappointed i think it's still a change from what they originally got got into um it may have made the bitterness a little bit sweeter but it still i think would have had that for me it would have had that bad taste dc investor what i think one of the areas we make in this space i think too frequently is we think it's all about the money and you know coming from where blockchain originated with cryptocurrency there's a lot of that a lot of the people in the community who came in because of money or cryptocurrency but there's a lot of new people coming in who truly do care about it as an art as a storytelling um platform and i think that's kind of where we're now at that mixing point of there's different different agendas different interests um in the community yeah i agree and i think punks isn't a good example of this in the sense that i i agree i think there was an ethos that felt violated of like punks are above all of this they're above the sort of commercialization they're the cave painting writings on the wall the early early thing that sort of don't have a price so putting a price on them like that is i i get why that violates it but even more abstractly just wondering moving forward when ips sell you know do can token holders get a cut of that would that feel better to folks would that i don't know um dc investor also had what was i saying now you're venturing into the world of where is this a security yeah oh totally you're right that's exactly what you're putting up a huge can of worms that would definitely fail the how we test yeah yep yep well that's why you have projects like deadheads and i doodles has talked about doing versions of this where you actually just stake your particular individual nft in a way that they can claim they're licensing it and paying you royalties on that license as opposed to just paying you for being a holder or you know whatever um okay dc investor also had a comparison to like micro breweries and he was like that's what this feels like is you have all these micro microbreweries uh which are these kind of individual nfts and ultimately many of them end up getting bought up by big anheuser-busch right like i actually was with somebody this past weekend who worked for kona the beer brand kona and and she had left anhyzer push to go work for kona like an independent beer brand and then kona ended up getting bought by anheuser-busch she was like so i'm now back at working at anheuser-busch after having left it for for a smaller brand it's funny uh on that point i worked as a cmo at nankasi brewery in eugene oregon for a while so i spent a couple years in the trenches of the of the craft beer industry and um it was a real problem that they would for instance in eugene which nakasi's the biggest brand one of the biggest brands on the west coast and we had a local competitor called hop valley miller coors came and bought hop valley they still presented themselves as an independent craft brewery and obscured the ownership by miller gore's yet miller coors dumped tons of resources into that brand it made it really hard for us to compete um and it was completely in the consumer was completely being lied to about who what was this ownership what is this relationship um it made a really tough time in the industry and still is a tough time in that industry so i love that comparison that's the and is the issue too it seems like dc investor was making the case that in order to really succeed you know in the in the beer business you know at scale you ultimately needed to be acquired by one of those brands because you really just kind of couldn't compete unless you were acquired by a bigger brand is that and is there i guess there's a fear right that that's that's where we end up in the nft space which is it becomes hard to be an individual creator though back to our earlier point i don't i don't think it'll play out that way yeah i i think it's different in the space and what makes it different is that this is a beer is a physical real world product that has to be shipped on trucks and sold on store shelves or in restaurants and bars nfts digital commerce is global it has very low barriers to transportation to movement um so i think it's going to be a lot different in the space i think there's a lot more opportunity for brands to emerge and to compete and this is such early days the beer industry is really a very mature industry in an old industry this is just such an early young industry that it's changing so quickly i'm not worried about that right now and i won't be for a long time i don't think yeah nor or am i and again i think there's the there's room for the 10 000 true fan project that doesn't have to be the it doesn't have to be board apes to to thrive um okay it goes back to that it goes back to that coindesk article about is this is a monopoly and no yeah it's big is not a monopoly yeah that didn't really resonate vermont for me either the the the idea that this was somehow a monopoly or or um it felt like a weak argument in my opinion um okay front running the acquisition this was something nft ethics the account posted a long threat on this i don't think we have to spend too too much time on it but there were some senior people at twitter senior people place it in in places actually a lot of social media companies who started buying up a lot of mee bits before there was even sort of leaked news of this and seems pretty clear that you know obviously people had advanced knowledge and started buying up me bits and there's no you know insider trading laws in the world of nfts because again these aren't securities but i'm curious how you feel about that and i guess this also dovetails us with um with how media holders are feeling which i think on this deal is is relatively positive yeah you know there were indeed many questionable transactions you you can't deny when all of a sudden a hundred me bits are bought like the day before the announcement that these are very questionable no i want to be cautioned that i don't think that every transaction for me bit in the 48 hours leading up to this announcement was was it was improper um some people just got lucky and got in at the right time so we need to caution that that's well and beyond that it started leaking right so like i was in group chats with people where it had kind of publicly leaked on twitter and people were buying on based on that news i think a lot of people on the right before were just speculating on basically what was a public speculation but but here's what's going to happen now it's not illegal because these aren't securities yet but it is highly unethical and the blockchain is transparent if you know who owns a wallet you know who made a purchase and some of these people like agents at utah who worked on b bits and made purchases in 48 hours before the announcement like they're probably at risk of losing their jobs and they should be this is unethical behavior that you know even at disney when i joined disney they go through an entire training program about ethics around the stock and trading transactions and access to insider information and i mean well that's a security it's unethical and it will violate a lot of companies um policies so the imagine a few people could be at risk of losing their jobs because of this and going forward long term as the industry begins to advance with regulation and the discussion that's go about to happen with the biden administration and the senate banking committee there will be possibly some regulations or policies put in place that could could uh have some effect here long term um one of the things i've noticed in the space in my year or so working in it is that conflicts of interest are everywhere like everywhere i look i'm seeing conflicts of interest things that would never fly in a regulated financial industry and i think a lot of projects and teams need to start thinking about where do we have conflicts of interest in our organization in our team because this might be a problem eventually yep i think you you summed that up well uh so i want to bring us then to the biggest news of of the week i don't know is it bigger than the yugo labs acquisition it's just it's it's just more recent so it's it's become the talk of the town which of course is apecoin uh i'll i'll give sort of a high level here for anybody who's been under a rock for the last 48 hours and then john would love to have you really break down what this looks like at a more detailed level um so uh essentially this is a a pretty simple erc20 token that everybody knew was coming people knew that that eight board apes were going to release a coin at some point we didn't know exactly when it would be uh of course it's now and uh it's got a supply of a billion which i thought was interesting i'm sure somebody will do a long tokenomics breakdown of this in an interesting way and i look forward to that but um for some comparisons i think chain link is a is a coin with like a billion supply and al grant has 10 billion obviously it's it's it's quite bigger than the 21 million supply of of a bitcoin but sort of in the realm of things we've seen before um one thing to note is in the distribution of this to holders so holders were able to start claiming these ape coins holders of of board apes and mute names are claiming these this morning uh this is thursday march 17th board apes got like ten thousand and change uh for every board ape they held mutant apes uh were entitled like two thousand something so it's like a five to one ratio so far more you could claim far more as a board ape holder i saw some people pissed about that they were like the supply there's double the supply right there's 20 000 or whatever it is mute napes 10 000 board apes why shouldn't it be a two to one ratio it was a five to one ratio based on sort of the average price of each of these respective collections over the last whatever their last however many months um so there was that and then the other the other party in this that that i saw a lot of sympathy for were the kennel club holders the boarded kennel club holders who got no ape coins unless they also held mutants or board apes in which case they also held a cattle a dog you know they got a few more tokens that surprised me um and was sort of uh like you're not fully a part of this ecosystem shot it felt like at the kennel club holders um were were you surprised by that did you have a reaction to the the kind of i did i was surprised because when the kennel club was released a couple months ago it was sort of presented as the next way to join the ape community yeah and so i i think i think there is a bit of a fair gripe there like wait a minute this was not what you told us we we aped in to the to the kennel club um so i'm not surprised but the challenge is tokenomics especially when you've got this complexity behind it is never going to make everyone happy um i i might my take is that they've done a fair job a good job not more better than a fair job they've done a good job at trying to balance all of the competing interests and and handle it the right way um but the county it's been really thoughtfully yeah yeah it's been thoughtfully rolled out uh i'll give you the final kind of purpose here and then again did you want to add a thing there i was going to say that the eight percent of the total supply is going to the founders of board apes um so uh the two the two people we know and i guess that they're listing four people i'm not sure who all four are but so eight percent of the total supply of the billion tokens is going to the founders that which seems a little bit rich to me but um we can talk a little bit more of that in a little bit more depth in a second yeah i really want to get into that so let me just give this high level here which is that and really there's sort of four purposes they're stating for apecoin it's governance over this apecoin dow uh you're gonna help us understand a little bit more like what we know about apecoin dao what this is um so governance there access to uh you know this play to earn game that that they're publicly saying they're coming out with merch other things right it gives you access to all sorts of parts of this ecosystem it's really an incentivization mechanism for other game makers other projects etc to uh you know incorporate like they're trying to incentivize a way or you know get away for the board ecosystem to be included in other games and things okay maybe they use apecoin in their game whatever then there's this last thing they mentioned which sort of funny to me um let me find it i just lost it this unification of spend concept was sort of a purpose they they named of apecoin i was like oh you're just trying to find things to listen to this he says this isn't a security what does unification of spend mean now like the whole ecosystem is on one is on one currency whatever they're trying to build out a whole whole ecosystem obviously we know how these things go that's what it states as its purposes i'm gonna i think we end this this part of the conversation with uh our own thoughts on on whether sort of non-ape holders should buy into apecoin and i have some some thoughts on this uh but let's first turn to can you break down for us like what do we know about this dow how have the tokens been distributed what is it what are they being spent on thus far give us that that sort of insight yeah so the dow is first of all i should say i recommend everyone go take a look at the website for apecoin and read the the articles of corporations lack of a better term for the dow um it's it's really fascinating my takeaways it's been very well thought out very considered i'm a little actually surprised at how well it's been put together they appear to be doing this in partnership with animoka brands i hope i said that correctly uh which is a group out of hong kong and kind of yeah well known in the space yep yep so well known in the space it's been very well presented and thought out um and what the dao is doing they're also creating a foundation which will operate the dao so they on the website they say someone has to write the checks so basically this is the team that actually does what the dow tells them to do invest in this or do that the foundation actually makes it happen they've put in place a board of directors which i think is really impressive including uh alexis ohanian um so i think they've got a great team just uh and yeah sui who's the animoka brand's founder and maria badwa who i'm hoping to come on the pod she's she's great adventure studios is gaio siri on the board uh i don't recall he's involved in some capacity guys theory fam you know is the agent who raps world of women and bored apes and yuga and you know like everything in the world seems like at this point so yeah so so if you look at the the the proposals now they've created what's called an aip proposal quote ape improvement proposal or an ape okay guys please enough is enough on the ape stuff i will refer to them as an aip in this discussion because there's just too many apes being thrown around um so aip1 is administrative they're setting up the dow this is the vote that says yes we're going to set this up and create the foundation what's surprising in aip1 is that they're budgeting two million dollars for this which seems astronomically high i'm sure it's justifiable i've set up a couple of dows now and have experience in that and i've never had dao establishment costs to that even remotely close to that before now i will say they're legal the you know they're going to want to go so hard on legal here but two million i agree sounds very high even factoring in for their crazy legal costs yeah if if i was a holder i would like to see more explanation they do give some explanation of where that's going but i'd like to see that in more details like what is that budget for the setup cost of this because it's that's a lot um aip2 is about voting protocols nothing really surprising out of that that's kind of administrative as well aip3 is where it gets really interesting this is their budget so setting up kind of what the budget will go to for the first year so essentially from now march 17th through the end of the calendar year and the really exciting thing i think here is they're setting up a marketplace so this will be a place outside of openc where you can sell and trade your um ape nfts presumably punks and me bits might be in that as well um but i think a it's really exciting because it's a white step outside of open c any kind of royalties that open c would have collected that this marketplace intends to collect will be reinvested in the treasury so they're not really taking a cut for themselves it just goes back to the community and i think that's pretty pretty fabulous and it also is a good example of why i think long term i'm a little bearish on marketplaces because it what for big projects like this if they can set up their own marketplace long term is this really you know the way forward and i think it is like having your own branded marketplace so branded marketplaces where it becomes marketplaces are you know essentially a commodity where each project can sort of have their own and then we just have like aggregators that allow you because you know there is a there is something valuable about having everything in one spot yeah they'll definitely be aggregators like open c but i think that you know if you want to go buy a disney nft you're going to go to the disney marketplace you want to buy an ape nft you're going to go to the ate marketplace and i and they're obviously on ethereum or on other chains that you can transport them move them around but um why why spay why pay the fees to open c if you can go to the ape marketplace and the money goes back to the community so i think that's a really exciting development of course in the budget they list off other things like you know hosting fees and things like that but my favorite was they end the list of expenses to include merch i don't know what it is about web3 and everyone wanting merch but and maybe i'm just kind of worn out about merch from my background at disney but yes everyone wants their swag in their merch and they've budgeted a healthy budget towards buying merch for for the community well that makes sense to me in that i feel like apes the closest sort of comp it has always felt like it is supreme you know like this like very cool streetwear like brand of sorts so merch for board apes in particular makes a lot of sense to me people really want to show off that they're a part of this community so i i get that one [Laughter] all right i'll put you in the camp of merch fan yeah merch fan confused about the two million for initial setup that's uh that's that's the camp you can put me in right now yeah it it took me about five years to give away all my lucasfilm star wars merch but um every kid that ever thought like saw a star wars t-shirt or hat that i had it was cool like okay you can have it take it i don't want it anymore i'm also i'm also very positive on merch because we sold a lot of merch on the yang campaign that was a huge sort of source of revenue for us and a huge source of creativity for us like we did he was caught a longer than long shot by the new york times so we made longer than the long shot shot glasses like extra tall shot glasses and you know we did really fun things with the merch there obviously the math hats were huge and um it is a really good way to show your affinity if you have like a cult following i think it's a merge is a powerful thing so yeah we'll finish up one nurse but i'll say it's also a good brand builder if it's done right if it's cool it's a good brand builder so moving on ape number four ape improvement project number four proposal is a staking mechanism which i don't know too much about what they're doing here this was proposed by animoka brands but this is a mechanism where you can stake your your tokens and i believe earn a return on them uh so it's uh i think really interesting and they've they've allocated a good percentage of total eight coins for state rewards i know staking hasn't actually been approved yet but the presumption is that it will be 17 17.5 which is eight number five the last of the one that's currently up there is to the allocation of tokens for staking and that's been set for 17.5 for three years um which does seem like a healthy healthy percent that's been set up so i think there's a lot to be learned and they haven't communicated too much about the staking proposal yet my guess is that they need to get through aip one two and three and actually set the thing up before they get ahead of themselves but they clearly wanted to get that at the top of the agenda by when they launched this so it's gonna be

go buy apecoin where do you fall i am bullish i do not intend to buy apecoin for myself right now but i am bullish i think i think that you've got a good team here clearly working on it they're working on a lot of interesting things um i'm bullish on it i think there's going to be some interesting interesting work to be done here do we have other insights into so seven and a half percent for staking rewards it's eight percent to the founding team do they have the the other breakdown of what you know what percent is actually being distributed out to holders in this initial air drop so what i know is that um eight percent goes to the founders the for the four founding team members um 14 is going to launch partners which i'm assuming is going to be the board vcs if there's vc's about animoka brands certainly um i'm i'm certain that um i was about to say that the board is getting a healthy allocation of tokens which was a little bit of a surprise it's a very healthy allocation and 62 percent of the total is going to the community in terms of kind of ecosystem development and so if you break that 62 into a 47-15 15 goes to the board ape holders so all the you know the kennel the napes the board apes so what they're all getting is 15 of the overall billion tokens and 47 is going to the treasury so if you say take those two 62 percent that seems like a very generous contribution to community um you know i've seen projects go as high as like 66 or a little bit higher than that i've seen projects do a lot less this seems to be on the upper end of what i've seen so i i would take away okay this is a healthy give to the community even though perhaps the give to yuga and the founders is a little bit high yeah and look i get it they you know they've built any a massive project they want to take a bit of a cut and i don't know you can debate it but uh don't begrudge them too there's no enforce yeah there's no one forcing you to buy these there's no one forcing you to accept them so if you don't like it they're being transparent about it you know like you know yeah exactly don't don't buy it if you take issue with that um any concern on this bringing down the hammer of the sec i know there's lots of people being like oh this is the thing that's going to get us all screwed this is such a security etc not that it would bring down the hammer i do expect that there will be this will be pulled into congress this this will because it's just such a high profile project and such a visual one a visible one when congress starts getting into kind of nfts and staking mechanisms and are these securities there's no doubt that folks from yugo labs are going to put in animoka perhaps are going to be pulled in to have you know give testimony does that mean it's bringing down the hammer not necessarily it's just it's too visible of a project not to want to know more at the congressional level um so i do expect it's going to get discussed and the the uh apecoin foundation right this i'm assuming that's a 501c3 it does not say not that i've seen it might be i just haven't seen it in the documents my assumption here is it's a 501c3 so that you know that's tax advantageous from the standpoint that um they're not going to have to pay out crazy taxes to funds that come in and again thinking this through in real time y'all um you know they set it up sort of essentially as like a non-profit that's like the underlying legal structure for this dow and they will be keeping it you know i was i was sort of alluding earlier like will ape coin holders who have say in this apecoin dao will that also give them say in the ip purchases that hugo labs makes or the the um the the set sales you were allowed to make you're shaking your head that's sort of where i'm landing too they're not going to do that and again you can't tie it too closely or it becomes almost a security for hugo labs exactly yeah there's no indication that this has any say or involvement other than yuga getting their allocation of coins tokens this has no indication that it has any involvement in the management of yuga yuga is its own separate privately held entity that this is purely a a token an erc20 token that will be traded gives you governance over the foundation uh in pursuing their goals which they've stated as being building the game building out the ecosystem uh building up culture so hugo is still free to go and make acquisitions or sell uh sell properties if they wish without any worry about the foundation or the coin yeah okay so you say you're not buying it but you are bullish do you have a quick putting you on the spot like pro con list why somebody who's maybe not an ape holder so would have to buy into eight coin should buy some and and balanced with maybe why you're not you know the pros cons there and then i can give my take on that yeah my my feeling on the pro is that if you are excited by the the culture and the community that's been created around the 8 project and all of its derivatives and you want to participate in that they're clearly going to be using this to invest in new projects and other projects that you will now have a currency that allows you to participate in a way even if you don't own an ape and can't afford an ape this gives you a way some sort of a way in to participation um so i think it's actually very opening and uh good in that regard um the con is just that these are all really on the gray area of securities law and um you know how is the irs going to look at this how is the government going to look at this and just is it going to create more headaches than what it's worth for a lot of people and does it just get stuck in that and i think most people in web 3 right now are kind of risk takers and not afraid of being on in that gray area so i think it's going to be successful and i yeah so it's i think should be exciting for a lot of people it's just not where i personally want to be yeah so i was thinking about this a lot like do i want to buy in et cetera et cetera i think the governance piece doesn't excite me that much i don't i don't care about voting on these proposals or future proposals sorry come at me whoever right this sort of incentivization okay other games are going to potentially use apecoin what that's interesting but that ties into i think my high level thesis for this this like unification of spend i'm listening through like the four purposes that they list the company list that you listed for a coin i don't understand again it's just like ecosystem building right um and then there's this sort of access piece to their play to earn game the merge etc and all this sort of levels up to me to this question of like what is metaverse money going to be and i think we're seeing so many different approaches to the metaverse and of course the metaverse is not one ecosystem it's going to be all these different places there's this won't become a diatribe about like all the different interpretations of what the metaverse is but you have sandbox decentraland cryptovoxels someplace you have these these places that are sort of making a spate like a place first bet right like you come and buy land first and then we're gonna build all sorts of things on top of the land first you then of course have like your roblox places that i don't know what it would take for roblox to become a more open ecosystem but they already have users they already have a game you have facebook already has users already has sort of almost like a user first approach roblox you could maybe argue a game first approach and i think it's really interesting to think about the potential for like board apes to just build their own metaverse they're now building a marketplace like they're they're building out their own ecosystem you know animoka brands is a big investor in the sandbox i'm sure they have sandbox activations but like you know board apes can kind of build out their own um metaverse world and and you know if apecoin becomes like a dominant coin across you know the the board 8 metaverse i think that's sort of what you're making a bet on much it's the play that i feel like magic and and the treasure dow ecosystem is is um sort of making is like if we can become this interconnected massive conglomerate of games that sort of its own metaverse and magic is the token there like that's a win um and and i'm curious too you know it got me kind of going on this this thing of like can the metaverse have unlike in the real world right can we have just like 20 different a thousand different currencies that were sort of quickly exchanging within the sandbox going from apecoin when i'm in the board ape part of the sandbox or their own specific metaverse over to uh cyber kongs where i'm now using banana coin over to cool cats where i'm now using milk uh you know milk gold like if it ca what do you think about that and like this idea of like 10 trillion currencies within a metaverse it's not going to work there's going to be a couple there won't be just one there will be a couple that are become sort of the the leads a good example i was going to buy an nft this morning and then i went to go buy it i found that it was using the rev token not eve not revvv which is actually another anamoca project but no relation to the apes here um but it's a rev token which use is used in video um online met web3 gaming for kind of car racing motorcycle racing i'm a fan of that kind of uh gaming content and it was this was a nft of a race car but i don't have rev token i didn't want to go buy rev token so i decided not to purchase the nfts this morning or bid it was an auction um so i think there will be winners i think that apes are set up clearly to be one of the competitors in the space just the sheer weight of that they're bringing to us um but there will not be ten thousand currencies that uh tokens that win it's gonna be five perhaps okay how about this how about you're moving through the sandbox and everything is accepted in i guess sand i don't know if they accept eath in the sandbox right and then if you're in cyberkong's area and you want to participate in something that costs money it's a discounted rate if you pay in banana so you you ultimately have all these other different currencies that are accepted there's still sort of one central currency but then you can get discounted rates if you're using apecoin in the ape ecosystem it's like reward points or whatever at marriott you can pay in money or if you're like are a marriott diehard you can use your marriott points it's never going to scale it might work for the early adopters and you know the community that we have today but when we talk about that community of a billion users or billion wallets on the horizon it's never gonna work they're never gonna my brother who's i think very web three kind of oriented has been investing in a bitcoin for a long time is never gonna just walk in and all of a sudden up i need to buy rev i need to buy ape i need to buy well that's the point i'm making though is it's not required right you can use uh uh there'll be one sort of maybe it's eth whatever they're sort of one cent mainstream currency but then there are sort of these sub ecosystems for the die hards who have a coin whatever they can get discounted prices within that ecosystem if they're using apecoin to purchase it i'm sure it'll work for the die hards it's not going to scale though it's going to be yeah it'll be it'll be niche so and that that's where i sort of landed with this is like i'm not buying a coin out the gates i think there's so much hype around it right now it's going to be overpriced i know it started at like 39 this morning and it's down to six dollars which i think was really just a supply challenge right like there was only so much supple you know the supply has gone up and so the price has gone down it's not that the the price is just i think crashing um but i'm gonna give it a little time and then i think i'm gonna buy in just a little bit just for exposure to this right like i think it's interesting to kind of be diversified in a coin in magic in milk gold like to just sort of have a diversity of these sort of sub coins because i think there will be some that um you know that come to have some value in their own particular ecosystems and i like having a little skin in the game to track that but i agree i don't think this becomes um like you know the metaverse money for though i think board ape would have the best shot of that of anybody um and so i think it's it's it's sort of limited it's like buy and if you really love board apes and you want to be able to like you know buy their merch or participate in governance yeah like you said you're not interested in participating governance the only reason that the interest that i would do it is would be that i actually want to participate in governance i want to be part of the dow and vote and even though i'd have a small holding and probably just get overrun by the founders um with eight percent of their eight percent holding i'd still want to just participate and be in the discussion and that would be exciting for me cool well anything else we said here i mean lots will be we'll have lots to track as we move forward um i think we move on i think we've got uh we've got plenty of other things to cover yeah there's never a shortage of eight topics to discuss oh my god it's true uh well we're actually moving though to a different set of our lovely fictional characters disney of course there's been like ten there's been a lot about disney uh recently i'm gonna rattle off some of this uh bob iger former ceo of disney joined the genies board i want to get your your take on that of course i think after the the yuga acquiring crypto punks thing happened there were all these rumors about disney acquisitions uh disney acquiring vv which i thought was interesting and actually i was like oh that makes some sense then that seemed to die down and then it was that disney's buying dapper which has been like a big rumor that disney's buying dapper also kind of interesting and could make some sense disney owns espn right mm-hmm yep yes i'm gonna talk about that in a minute yeah cool and then you and i actually haven't talked about they hired mike white to like oversee the metaverse disney made this kind of massive like metaverse higher nft higher um maybe we talked about that and then of course they they did drop more nfts on vv toy story characters they dropped their first woody character on vv um so just you know endless disney news uh where do you want to start john you being cool north disney let's talk about bob iger first love it uh so my take on bob iger joining the genies board is that it's great news for everyone working in web 3 particularly in the nft areas of web 3. um and the reason is that he just brings just a mountain of credibility and pedigree to the space the way i thought about this is that um bob iger is a rising tide that lifts all boats he just brings immediate he brings immediate credibility to every project in the space that this is a place to look if someone with his background and having any option he has the world in front of him he could do anything he wants and that to chose to choose to spend his time here is really i think a key milestone of arrived for people who don't know genies so we've is like an avatar fashion company like it's it's very much a metaverse company that's building out basically these custom avatars and fashion and i think they work a lot with celebrities actually on their like you know metaverse character avatar um yeah i like that rising tide or you know he's had to lift all boats exactly um the timing is a little bit awkward for the announcement because bob iger just did an interview with kara swisher on her podcast and he talked about she asked him about web3 or nfts in particular and he was like said he didn't know anything about them and he didn't know what disney was doing but there might be some licensing happening so it's a little awkward that just like a month later all of a sudden he's an investor and on the board of a web 3 company he did lean into that a little bit by in his statement where he acknowledged he had a lot to learn and was excited to learn um uh what the great thing that he'll bring for genies is that he's going to open up a lot of doors now there's a there's i want to caution there real quick and i'll get to that point but he'll open doors for them he'll he knows how to open up introductions to people in the industry across many industries in fact um so he can get them kind of meetings with the right people now a lot of people were assuming all of a sudden that dizzy's gonna buy genies and that's not the way it works just because bob iger's involved doesn't mean that all of a sudden disney will do a big deal with genies or that they're going to be acquired by disney the any deals will have to have the merits um and this i saw this actually happen in real time when michael eisner left the company and iger came in and eisner had projects that he was working on privately that would have disney applications and it was always nope the projects have to have their merits and so iger's very well aware that that same rule will have to apply to him but i do think he will open up doors for the for the genies team and it's it's good for everyone yeah okay disney speaking of disney buying things like genies disney buying vv disney buying dapper what's your take okay uh my take on vv is no and for a couple of reasons it's it's too early um a because this mike white just started we'll talk about mike in a second and so he hasn't put together the the company strategy the go to market plan just it would be a really awkward time to make an acquisition uh in the space before mike has really done in his team set up his team and done their work and it's not disney's kind of way to they don't operate to run into acquisitions they take them in a very thoughtful kind of long process now long by disney standards versus web3 standards is something they're going to have to reconcile but they don't rush into acquisition so i think it's too early for vivi and the other thing with vv is the value of vivi is their partnerships with all the studios like particularly like dc comics and so if disney were to come in and buy vivi the first thing that will happen is dc comics and their other kind of studio partners will pull their brands and now you've just destroyed value in the vv acquisition which leads it to just being a tech and team acquisition so i don't i don't see vivi being a buy in the near term and i don't see it being a buy in the long term unless disney just wants to buy their tech or their team and that's still too early for that as to dapper i mean i would say that is too early for the same reasons but i'll hesitate on that one just a little bit because this wouldn't be really be a disney acquisition as i would see it as an espn acquisition and dapper does seem like it would be a good fit for espn disney does partnerships already or espn has partnerships with their their leagues the nba nfl the liga ufc so there's there's not a risk of losing the value in the marketplace by an acquisition and with esp the rumors of espn opening up a sports book in vegas it feels like the way they're taking the espn brand if that's true might fit to have an nft marketplace along with it so i i would hesitate that that would actually it's a deal that would make sense but i don't see it in the short term it just seems a bit weird to be that that soon that's super helpful and very interesting uh we talked about mike white you said he's just joined it's too early for him to have really put together a strategy yet this was something that happened probably a month ago i don't know how long it was ago now it's not uh not an immediate piece of news but again you and i hadn't talked about it and uh it's relevant sort of throughout all of this so they've hired mike white tell us about that and and give us your thoughts yeah yeah so there's a couple key takeaways here so mike white is uh he was an existing employee at the company he joined a couple of years ago when jimmy pataro came in uh so i called him as one of jimmy's guys so jimmy pataro's now the head of espn and when jimmy joined the company to be head of disney interactive all the digital businesses he brought a bunch of his team with him from yahoo and mike was was one of them i believe um so this is a couple things to take away here though that this was announced by bob chapic in an all company memo which is very unusual uh the only time you ever get all company met yep the only time you ever get all company memos from the ceo are usually around earnings announcements when they have the uh the quarterly statements and then of course the happy holidays messages i've never in my 10 years at disney ever once saw an all company memo from the ceo saying we've hired a person to do this job and the takeaway and this was clearly intentionally done was to communicate to every employee in the company that a metaverse is on the ceo agenda b this guy mike is the person in charge there should be no questioning who's in charge here and c we're expecting everyone to participate and cooperate and come on board with this initiative um so i think that's a really important thing that bob chapic did uh in making the announcement the second thing that was important to me in this is that mike white is in coming in as an svp level position and i felt i had a list of things that disney would need to do when they made this announcement one of them was it had to be an svp or higher level role and the reason for that is it needs to be someone with enough authority and seniority to command attention in meetings to be taken seriously by all the c-level execs all the president-level execs to know that this is a person with seniority and is going to have a voice in the meetings and a more junior person just couldn't couldn't carry that the third thing that was really important to me and was something i was concerned about was would disney look at the metaverse from the perspective of licensing like their deal of evie which basically says okay we're going to let you use our characters and you give us let's say 10 percent of the revenue that comes from them or were they going to look at this from a from a perspective of storytelling and publishing and what they've done is they've positioned this role reporting to kareem daniel who's in charge of all content distribution for disney and so mike is reporting directly to kareem and the way to take what you should take away from this is that this is clearly placed as a content publishing storytelling distribution role uh and that definitely tells me that disney will be moving into self-publishing here in the in in the future um which i think is really the right way for them to go my dream is that they have the disney magic chain which is the the theme park on the blockchain let's say and this is basically what i took from this is confirming that that's the direction that they're going to go in now how long will it take to get there i don't know but um that seems to be what that they're communicating out to the company and the community finally the positions in burbank sitting on the studio lot with all of the you know all this the ceo all of the c-level execs are all sitting on the studio lot at the headquarters in burbank and that's where this position is located and i felt that this person had to be there just to be in the conversation in the mix with the chairman of all the different divisions and the the top content executives are there too like um sean bailey who oversees all film production um kevin feige who ever sees marvel they're all on the disney lot and so mike is sitting there right with them talking and thinking about how nfts in the metaverse are going to play it's all you know i've talked about this a little bit and i think that you break it down so well i'm curious what kind of ripple effects you think this will have throughout the industry it feels like disney was sort of the first to make a move this big and i think you and i had spoken about i think universal was hiring like an intern level metaphors position like seemingly you know way behind how does all of the moves disney seem to be making uh how does it impact the other companies in this space yeah it has a lot of impact so back in 2005 the year eiger became ceo um he i'd like to think of that as a transition point for the whole industry where franchises became the key central point of of strategy and i think of this as being that's another transition point a milestone where mike white's mandate as they put the press release is identical to how my franchise team was set up bring a go to market strategy develop cross-company unified go to market approach and develop the plan on behalf of the entire global walt disney company no one else has done that yet now i am aware and this is a confidential so i can't say who it is i am aware of one of the other big five studios that has an svp level position um working on metaverse they're just not ready to announce it yet so there is another studio that is doing the same thing but yeah you look at like the job at the job postings and universal was an intern in their consumer products licensing group um and which was very curious help them develop their nft strategy it's like you're doing that with the intern yeah i mean and i'm sure there might be more senior people working on the challenge there but just it's just they're the way they're communicating it they're not seeing the optics of it um the sky dance you know now this isn't a big studio but sky dance just posted for an internship and they do like mission impossible and they're they're doing that skydance they have a yeah yeah they're franchises they're more a production company um but they are kind of becoming a little mini major studio themselves if they're setting up a considerable products team so i think skydance is the the risk here is that you're thinking about this as licensing um and you need to think about this from publishing content distribution so disney got that right the other studios have not gotten that right and are are behind and we have a whole episode i think it was our mini episode where we you kind of really break down publishing versus licensing versus promotional deals and how all that plays out we don't need to revisit we don't need to revisit that please don't come at us on twitter the way you did it after that episode lordy lordy lordy um five five two i have two last thoughts and we can move on um the first takeaway is that uh disney's moving into publishing but they'll continue with licensing for the short term let's say the next year so you mentioned um they have an existing licensing deal vivi and they just announced a new toy story uh collection of nfts as part of that licensing deal so what that means is disney's giving them use of their of their characters they'll sell the nfts disney gets a percent let's just say ten percent back as a return traditional licensing and i think that will continue for the next let's say 18 months at least until mike white gets his project set up and moving i one take away that disappointing from my enough this part of the announcement is that my feeling has been that disney's best strategy is the theme park on the blockchain and what they announced was that this was really supporting disney plus and but chapic has said that once before at an investor conference last year i think that's wrong but i also think that that's a little bit of either misdirection or just intentional trying to support the disney plus service um so a little bit of a sexier kind of tech when you're talking about this so the vv deal all along has been like a disney plus sort of deal in the sense that you could buy these nfts and get a subscription to disney plus that was the promotional side of the deal right like it's always been are you saying broadly speaking he seems to be pushing this it's like a disney plus idea not a theme park on the metaverse or are you talking specifically around the interactions it's a little it's a little bit different so the licensing is vivi and they'll do more licensing so vivi will have more characters and properties that they'll they'll sell and they'll just disneyland the royalties what i mean by the disappointment of disney plus is just that the communication and these announcements twice now has been that we see a bright future and nfts to support disney plus it could be the promotion like we saw the golden moments promotion or it could be we prioritize the characters and worlds that we're releasing on disney plus and i think they need to think broader than that they need to think about um existing franchises like pirates of the caribbean they need to think about original one-of-one arts with mickey mouse which have this huge tradition by the way of one of one original pieces of art um of paintings in other creations around mickey and other characters so i just would like to the fact that you've got mike white sort of sitting where he does as broadly as he does seems like it probably has more weight than a couple announcements saying you know disney plus is the metaverse or or whatever is that that's exactly your favorite exactly yeah yeah my feeling is like they're just reinforcing disney plus for right now to try to pump or keep the excitement around the stock and that mike white will do his work and he'll clearly see the the disney theme park on the blockchain is so blaring there with neon lights and sirens like this is the way to go i'm sure he'll get there awesome uh so the the next topic i want to dive into and i know we're running close to time here but i think it's important that we also cover doodles i was actually at the south by southwest activation for doodles for on friday night um it was incredibly well done and it actually made me think of disney like i was there being like this feels disney world-ish um you were not at south by southwest right because we would have hung out if you had gone it was not i was not right it's it's tough it's tough with a daughter in first grade to get to get out of town yeah to pack up and head to texas i get it so yeah i was there for folks have probably been hearing something about it i actually still have some doodle doodle nail polish on uh they had somebody like painting nails there it was um i think it was really well well executed they had i had hot chocolate they were you know they were making coffee drinks for folks where you could scan your doodle and they would put like a doodle design with like the foam and the milk on top that looks like your doodle for example like details like that that i thought were were very well done and thought through i don't have a doodle so i got like just like a normal milk on top thing with my uh kahlua hot chocolate but it was delicious um and then they had this whole uh really like merch arm they unrolled this like shopify integration through these activations they had all this special merch they had things you could uh claim only if you had a doodle where you would scan your doodle nft and you could claim certain i think merch whatever again i didn't have a doodle so i just like looked away sad um but i did get a doodle pin uh that for like a dollar you know that came out of this kind of crazy looking machine it just it felt like ironically kind of something for children and of course it's like a bunch of adults hanging out there but um it really made me feel like that's the direction doodles is kind of moving in this very like child wonder like theme park you know kind of direction i don't know if you have thoughts on doodle's recent pump or what you're seeing out of it yeah um yeah i have a lot to say about doodles um i was blown away i wish i'd gone to south by southwest just just to see the doodles activation because if i had known they were doing that i would have made the trip just for that because from the pictures i saw the videos i saw i'm blown away by what they did now their partner in this was vayner nft which does i was at first i was wondering like well who pulled this off and i'll get to that in a second so who pulled this off how they do this and then when i saw vayner nft was their partner in it then it all kind of clicked okay they had taught people really helping them execute i saw avery on friday night when i was there avery president of vayner nft shout out avery and so one of the things about these brand activations that's how i'll turn this they're a lot harder to pull off than say a concert or like when you saw what apes did at nft nyc last year that's hard to pull off as well as they did but it's a lot easier than a brand activation like this because you have a build you have a the planning you have to reserve space it's it's just it's requires a level of thinking and forethought in planning and design that is a lot harder to do and quite frankly you see like nike and disney do that very well that's what my team one of my team creations was all the tron alice in wonderland activations at comicon and we would plan those out nine months in advance huge budgets and they did it at that level that was a disney nike level execution so cutest of them for doing that and i thought that this would be year a year more before we'd see anything like that in the space and i expect we are going to see a lot more of it it's clearly for bigger projects the way to go um and now the question is what are the what are the events where this is going to happen is it going to be i've been thinking a lot about what is our event calendar as an industry i didn't think south by southwest was on that calendar but now it clearly is nft nyc is on that calendar comic con might someday become on that calendar but where you'll see these kinds of activations i think what they did with shopify was really cool it was a great partnership i even put a quote here the first of its kind token gated nft retail drop so you basically you had exclusive retail opportunities with if you had your token you had your nft now this was part of a promotion to introduce shopify's new nft retail capabilities so it seems like a great integration that way um and so i think there's a tremendous opportunity with tokid gated commerce um you know think of nike and artifact like what happens when you go to a nike store and if you show your nft there's a whole artifact shop that opens up that you can then purchase an artifact nft so awesome awesome execution awesome opportunities here and i definitely think it's the way forward for the future awesome and doodles of course the price has been pumping but they're these derivative projects that i know folks have been talking about noodles i think is the first that the doodles team sort of sanctioned this noodle derivative project and um interesting to see how all of that plays out uh quick just some quick hits here uh instagram mark zuckerberg also at south by southwest announcing that instagram will have nft integrations no more details than that to be honest sort of feels like okay because of course that was gonna happen in my opinion so all right it's coming who knows exactly what it'll look like uh kind of a no-brainer i um there was also something and i don't actually know that this is this is recent news but there was um recently the largest nft backed loan um that basically somebody was able to get an 8 million dollar loan uh collateralized by like 101 crypto punks that they held um and i saw a really interesting thread jeff kaufman um had a thread that i that i thought was interesting just saying how this is further changing the dynamic between like cmos and cfos um i remember back when visa bought a crypto punk that was an aha moment for some folks and and for me i remember people being like wow for the first time like a marketing budget because that was a marketing play by visa to buy that crypto punk was suddenly an asset as well it wasn't just like a spend it was something that may appreciate in value and actually be like an asset on their on their books or is quite literally an asset on their books um and this is a furthering of that right now you have a seat like cmos who are uh you know buying nfts whether it's visa buying a crypto punk or um whatever as part of a marketing strategy that now not only is an asset on the book but is arguably something the cfo can now make determinations about borrowing against and collateralizing it and just the way that the again the machinations on the business side of all these different brands are going to be changed by nfts and this technology i think is it's just fascinating to me for for whatever reason so jeff kaufman had a thread sort of sort of talking about this a bit and um and it really got my mind my wheels spinning yeah i saw that thread i thought it was a great thread um i think he makes a great point about that relationship between the cmo and cfo now one thing i thought about a long time ago was you know if you think of like a disney like a campaign for um star wars and well the amount of marketing assets that are created to support that campaign that never get released that just get put into a hard drive and stored somewhere you'd be blown away how many assets are created and never seen or from the production themselves and i think is a tremendous opportunity here is like think about using these assets is part of a camp marketing campaign where you're using them as nfts where you can help monetize a marketing campaign i think there's a just awesome opportunities there this might be more in the content heavy sort of industries like like entertainment but there's definitely that conversation that needs to happen that all of a sudden assets that may have been a cost center before can become a profit center absolutely uh okay i do have a couple i know where we're basically at time here i had one final thing that i wanted to flag which was the sandbox has opened up certain experiences to mac os i'm so excited i'm a mac user i couldn't participate in any of the sandbox sort of games really properly previously um and snoop dogg's like uh world just launched something so i was actually playing around with that this morning uh in snoop land my boyfriend was sitting near me and he's like are you like in a like sex what are you listening to like sex music and it did kind of sound like sex music it was um that's that's that's the score to snoop boxes the sandbox game um but it was fun i didn't really get to to get far along in it but um but that was fun and exciting for me that was sort of my last piece of news you want to cover anything the only thing i'll point out anyway to list here other things to cover but the one thing i thought was really interesting is um hypersense humans is an nft project coming out of a joint team in um taiwan and japan and they publish what they believe or what they're claiming are the first interactive nfts so what i'd say is um you can interact with them on on openc so go to openc open up a hypersense human nft and you can interact with it um and just what how can i'm trying to pull it up now my my internet is being slow it appears how can i interact with it like if i click it it changes colors or something it doesn't change color so essentially your your character is sitting on a field like if you're using like a star background or space background and if you put your cursor over the background the background starts to move and if you click they have a little logo in the corner and if you click on the logo the character who's in a full body view will zoom in into being a face view so it's it's interesting i think it's the first application of this um so it's they've what they've published are like their their internal team has published um uh their own kind of genesis or founder nfts and i think they'll probably be launching the project in a month or two it looks like but uh i'm trying to share my i'm trying to share my screen right now oh i think it's working now so folks can maybe see this like i click it it moves that is very interesting and i'm trying to prove them wrong i'm trying to be like no there's another one that's done this but that's fascinating because i can't come up with another project um do you know the team behind this are they uh tell a little bit about the like i know a little bit about them the artist the anime artist who is behind it is named maki or makai um who i believe is a very highly regarded um animator in um i believe he's in taiwan but i do know a few pokes behind it and um you know it seems interesting the interactivity and maybe there's it reminds me almost of like the old lenticular trading cards where you could have a couple of seconds of motion like a baseball uh swing player swinging and hitting the bell with their bat it might be some future applications for storytelling uh with nfts oh absolutely this stuff excites me in the way that space doodles excites me which is that i'm like the ability to click on a thing and have it change is not in and of itself frankly that interesting much like with space doodles like okay now i have this like you know you know a wrapped nft whatever but it's the uh where i think this ends up going and not that i have specific hypotheses but it's that sign that there's so much more innovation yet to come that these very simple these simple things seemingly simple from like a user experience perspective i think we'll will bear fruit down the line that'll be really really interesting so i really appreciate you this you've you kind of calling this out um awesome there's like a ton of other stuff we can talk about but i think we are we are running up against time i don't want to take up too much more of yours i know i have some meetings to hop on to but uh we will have you back of course at some point to to give other updates next time disney does something wild and just in general you're obviously a a wealth of insights that i so appreciate getting on this show so thank you john you're welcome happy to come back any time [Music] hey we hope
