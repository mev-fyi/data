are you a traitor why not just buy and hold so that's just my mentality I think Buy and Hold works for a certain mentality especially crypto I'd have to say you probably have to be a little insane imagine you bought Bitcoin and it was worth a penny and it was worth a dollar you're 100 x you're like I killed this trade and then you know 10 years later it was 60 000 right how much conviction does it take for somebody to hold NASA I don't care what it is you have a hundred times yeah you believe it's going to go higher that's not me I'm an Arbitrage guy I sit at work and I try to make a few basis points selling features contracts and buying stocks you know it'd be a knockout trade if I made even a percent and yet I come into crypto my p l is 200 annualized and obviously now you know I have much more Capital to play with I can become a long-term investor it doesn't really matter to me the price goes down 50 or whatnot because I've segmented that particular part of my portfolio I know what it should be doing I'm perfectly happy with the volatility and I don't want to sit at the computer screen all day doing trades I'd rather write and read a book do other things so you know to be a you know Trader in a short time frame is extremely difficult it takes a lot of dedication and it takes a lot of time
