all right bankless nation i am here with brandon isles of ample forth brandon you want to give a quick hello and explain what you do at ample forth um yeah so thanks for inviting me happy to be here um nice quick background uh see one of the original creators of the project along with my partner um fellow co-founder evan quill um quick history of where i came from you know i come from a very hard science computer science background so you see us at school worked at um you know nlp research lab after that uh google search and super machine intelligence for a few years um really interested in crypto from the beginning you know around 2009-ish um co-wrote one of the first android uh bitcoin wallet applications got released into the google play store back in 2011. um so i've been interested in space for a long time but sort of sat on the sidelines for a long time because there's so much interesting stuff going on in machine learning um and then eventually just through conversations with um evan you know got really interested back in crypto we started thinking about okay what can we do in this area that's actually interesting where we could potentially learn something that we didn't know before um so that eventually led to you know ample fourth which um i think we're gonna be talking a vlog about today yeah so what was kind of the original uh motivation for building out ample force like why of all of all the massive array of potential options that you could you could start to work on in the space how did you guys land on ample fourth um sure so it was sort of a meandering path i think for both of us which had our own kind of routes to end up where where we were you know one of my first um takeaways when i saw bitcoin was that um you know the sort of fix applied nature of it or always seemed like not the best quality it seems at least from an outsider um like maybe a step backwards sort of regressive to go back to the gold standard that we explicitly moved away from but given that you know i've only had like 100 level classes in economics in college i didn't go much deeper than that um and then sort of forgot about bitcoin for a while but then when ethereum came along ethereum kind of promised to be a sort of decentralized computer right and i saw a lot of the activity get um really a lot of excitement around the 2017 era you know when so many projects were launching um uh you know me and evan we were both looking at this from the outside i'm trying to figure out okay what's going on there's there's a lot of excitement what's happening and we were just trying to figure out okay why does any of this make sense yeah why should any of these utility tokens you know type things existing um and so it just led to a very long series of questions and conversations with you know the people we knew in space and outside of space to try and figure out okay so there's there's a new sort of tool set here that we can sort of build something potentially new right what are the biggest problems need to be solved and we came to the conclusion that you know most problems that people were trying to solve with blockchains probably didn't need a blockchain to begin with and we thought like the most scaling application of blockchain technology was to create monetary assets and so we thought okay how can we solve for the biggest problems of monetary assets what would be something new that could sort of add to you know what's already out there and you know trying to create a monetary asset with you know some sort of marginal value means you need to create something that's different so like what problem we're going to solve right and we've found that the the most fundamental problem is really just the problem of fix supply assets you know what's trying to create you know the better bitcoin sort of like trying to solve the problems with gold right the problems with these sort of fixed supply assets is that it's not able to respond to the needs of the marketplace around it and so that was sort of the the central idea that we were trying to pursue when we created the project okay so let's get into what ample fourth actually is and so the way that me and ryan have been pitching it um in our ad reads uh because uh disclaimer ample forth is a sponsor of the bankless podcast uh you guys can see the logo probably right here um so what actually is it we've been uh describing it as like a monetary experiment like an m0 monetary experiment where like you know it's it's not bitcoin it's not just this hard fixed number of tokens it does something else but it fulfills that same niche where it's supposed to be a monetary it's supposed to be a monetary good right um how would you describe ample forth in your words um yeah so i'd say that um you know ample is a base money digital currency with an elastic supply um that responds to the needs of the marketplace right it's also completely rules-based um you know encoded in a set of rules on smart contracts on ethereum today and the level view of how it works is um when the price of the ample token is above the target price for the reference price then it means it needs to increase the number of ample and circulation and when the the target when the price of the ample is below the target price in the marketplace it needs to reduce the supply example in circulation and the way it does that is fairly unique um in the sense that everyone on the platform has equal standing right so when new ample tokens get created it goes out to everyone on the network proportional to where they hold and then also when tokens come out of circulation it comes from everyone on the network proportional to where they hold so this does is it so it sort of incorporates price into supply which we've never really seen before right it also creates a different set of underlying incentives for people in the marketplace that we think will also lead to you know through emerging behavior a different movement pattern in the marketplace which itself is its own you know form of value right so if you look at you know bitcoin today um if you buy bitcoin today you're probably it's like you're buying an option on digital gold right it might become gold at some point in the future it might not but in the meantime it's also very useful just as an asset because it moves differently in the marketplace compared to equities commodities bonds that sort of thing right so um it's sort of outside the typical cycle of production and consumption so so ample is sort of aiming to be a sort of new unique monetary asset it has monetary qualities separate from bitcoin it may turn into you know in the very long term some sort of alternative to central bank money but at least in the median term like before we get there um we expect it it will move differently which you know ad does add value as a sort of unique building block not just in d5 but just you know the surrounding financial infrastructure okay so there in my mind there's a lot of overlap between like kind of what is rooted at the core of bitcoin and what is at the core of ample fourth the biggest one is being a non-dilutive monetary asset right so when you buy one percent of the ample fourth uh tokens you are guaranteed to have the same percentage of the total supply of ample fourth tokens but you are offered no guarantees as to what number of tokens that ample forth network will be because where bitcoin has done a hard cap on supply you guys have totally removed that hard cap but made that that and put that elasticity or in elasticity into the price and so any demand for bitcoin because there is no elasticity in supply immediately is reflected in the price and the price ampliforth is the opposite where it makes price inelastic it makes price very hard to meaningfully move away from a dollar and it instead puts that volatility into the supply of the tokens however at the base core at the core of it there's it's a non the values of amplifier that are similar in the sense that it's non-dilutive that's all correct right exactly yeah so with with ample you see a combination of two different qualities that we've never really seen before together so one is it's non-dilutive the same way that bitcoin is but two is it also has a long-run equilibrium unit of account that unlocks um certain use cases like denomination right so so for just like you said a change in demand for bitcoin changes the value of bitcoin and also changes the prices of things denominated with bitcoin right so with with ample increase in demand or decrease in demand results in a change in supply right but it still allows you to denominate like goods services and contracts through time and debt you know most notably right so for example say you and i got into a contract saying that i'll borrow one btc from you for you um a year goes by the value btc maybe a double right so suddenly i'm on the hook for way more than i thought i'd be so that would lead to the defaults or liquidation that itself could lead to cascading defaults or liquidations right so um you know ample still has a unit you can denominate debt with so if i were to borrow say 100 ample it borrows a lot like a stable coin right so if i borrow 100 ample to pay back you know a year from now i know that i'm going to be paying back 100 you know 2019 us dollars worth of purchasing power right so that leads to you know a much more robust um financial system that we can build on top of the space asset that wouldn't be possible with something like you know just gold or vtc okay so that's what meaningfully separates it from just being an erc20 token that is just minted with a with a cap supply right it's the the actual function and the what should be the evaluation of ample at large really is what is uh what you can extract out of the rebasing mechanism right that is the main differentiator between ample and just a normal erc20 token that has a fixed supply in my mind the way to evaluate the ample currency is is to what degree that the ecosystem around the ample token can actually leverage the rebasing mechanism the repricing mechanism is that right um i'd say there are two aspects there so one is there are there is different behavior of ample which unlocks different use cases around d5 that we can we can get into details later because i know your listenership is very you know deep and well versed in the d5 ecosystem but even before we get there if you read our white paper you know we do formulate it in terms of an experiment right so just reading the abstract there is a testable hypothesis where bitcoin will pattern sorry ample will pass its test if it succeeds in moving differently than bitcoin right if we if all we do is create something that moves identically to bitcoin if all we do is create a litecoin then that's a negative outcome right so so what we did is we made the smallest you know economically interesting change it allows us to learn something new about economics and monetary theory that we didn't know before right very cool so you're looking to be uncorrelated from bitcoin which is itself generally uncorrelated also from the rest of the world is that right um yeah because if we end up being perfectly correlated then it means that we created no extra value yeah what did we do right right cool okay so uh a couple components of what makes ampliforth tick there must be an oracle right can you talk about that sure yeah there's three main components to the system there's the the oracle the monetary policy that reads data from the oracle and then makes decisions about how to adjust the supply then there's the token contract itself so the token contract is fairly simple it's an erc20 on ethereum monetary policy encodes the rule sets about how to read in the oracle values about market data and cpi information and then modify the the token itself and then the oracle we have is also a very important part and also sort of very much related to the degree of centralization that we're able to achieve just from its base infrastructure right now we're integrated with chain link and then we also run input ourselves and this is something that is right now in practice fairly similar to you know the highest level where everything comes together very similar to maker's whitelisted indianizer type approach um which which we think is very safe you know form oracle today um and that might evolve over time as you know more oracle and infrastructures are sort of built and proven up those are the three main components right now we're deployed on top of ethereum but we view ourselves as being blockchain agnostic right so from the very very early stages of the project we made the decision to not build our own blockchain which was fairly controversial at the time because back then it's maybe still the case now it's a lot of people perceive it to be the case that you're not a real project unless you're building your own blockchain right but we would rather be you know where everyone else is already is right we don't want to like create our own silo and then make everyone come to us we would rather be where everyone is already storing value or making transactions right and so we're seeing a lot of the the benefits of the emerging behavior of how all these applications fit together you know in the d5 world right now and so i think that was definitely the right move and then you know in the future we can also have ample fourth exist on multiple blockchains simultaneously so even though um you know the monetary policy and the oracle uh get deployed and exist in one location you know if if the policy from ethereum can also modify the the token contract on say polkadot the same way that it modifies to contract on ethereum and then as long as you can also transact from an ethereum wallet to a book. wallet then it's essentially the same currency because it shares the same liquidity pool right so so we view ample as being you know long-term um sort of independent of any blockchain platform and sort of cross-flashing asset but you would always need ethereum because that's where the oracle and rebasing infrastructure lies right so like ethereum couldn't die and have ample force live on on a different chain is that correct um yeah so if ethereum were to have some sort of catastrophic incident then apple would need to have the same rule set deployed in some other locations okay right yeah right cool okay so the when you when the ample fourth token is above a dollar which it's been a lot lately and so then the rebase happens and so people will find that they are magically own more ample tokens at a lesser valuation how does the rebasing mechanism actually decide how much to reprice the ample token because it doesn't re re uh re base it all the way back down to a dollar it does it does something in the middle right so how does it decide to uh to what the target is for the 24 hour rebase um sure yeah so the first thing i want everyone i want to make sure everyone understands that the system is completely symmetric right so it's easy given the situation right now that we've seen a large influx of new people in our community a lot of new interests that we didn't have before and it came very quickly maybe faster than we were you know really ready to handle um but you know the system can both expand and contract depending on whether the market price is above or below the the reference price um right so the the rules of the system are actually very simple you write it down on the back of the napkin we think that that's one of the great qualities of the system right so it's very transparent it's very easy to understand it's very easy to predict so the equation is actually very simple so if the 24 hour volume weighted average price of ample is within you know five percent of the reference price then it's considered to be in equilibrium and then no changes happen right if it's more than five percent over the reference price then it goes into an extra expansionary state more tokens get created and distributed to wells voters and when it's below five percent from the reference price then it contracts um and then yeah so there's two hybrid parameters the system one is that equilibrium threshold the five percent band the other one is a smoothing factor right so basically a dampening impact right that keeps it from um over responding right so um some sometimes people ask us okay you do a rebase every day wouldn't it be more efficient if you did every hour or minute or every second right and why do you only go ten percent of the way why don't you just go all the way right so in some sort of hypothetical world of perfectly efficient markets that might be the right move but given that the world doesn't have efficient markets and there's different players with different um pcs and takes a while for market to reach some sort of consensus we didn't want to overreact so as long as we have the incentives pointing the right direction right if it's directionally consistent then it will eventually lead back to the equilibrium zone right so the purpose of the five percent band is to absorb the normal sort of market randomness right so um ideally um the supply only changes in response to a structural change of underlying demand so when it gets you know more than five percent away then we're probably at that point and so when you're in a dynamic state the market is essentially everyone's competing to figure out what the next supportable supply level is right so so most assets go through a process of price discovery ample will go through a process of what we call like supply discovery so everyone is sort of trying to compete about who can guess what the next equilibrium supply or market cap is and then if you're correct there is a sort of arbitrage opportunity where you know as an agent in the marketplace you can get some some value that also helps the system go back into the equilibrium zone okay so it uses a bunch of different people's opinions as to what they think the aggregate market cap of ample forth should be and then people will execute on those decisions and the correct ones get rewarded and the less correct ones get rewarded less um yeah so the product the protocol can control supply but it can't control price right if we could just will the price to be a dollar yeah right you know there's nothing else to be done so so the protocol can impact the price it can impact supply but it's the market that incorporates the change in supply back into the change in price so do you see the biggest use cases for the ample token to be collateral inside of defy applications because like when it comes to transacting or like paying my buddy back for beer ample doesn't really seem to be the right choice because no um it's it's like you in the same way you don't use bitcoin to pay people back for beer you also wouldn't use ample but but when it comes to paying back debts that makes seems to make a lot more sense because for like how we discussed earlier you know i'm much more willing to pay back you a hundred amples in one year's time because i know it's generally going to be a dollar plus or minus you know some some mean like not too wide margin what other defy use cases could you uh see ample fulfilling in the future um right yeah so maybe there's one day in the future where people use crypto device stuff um we think that's going to be the final use case that's only going to happen after everything else is built out and sort of proves itself right so so until we get there you know as you said a collateral asset that moves differently or uniquely i think is very important right so if you look at the space of digital assets today everything is very highly correlated right especially when you're looking at pure monetary assets everything pretty much follows bitcoin right if bitcoin goes up and some other monetary asset hasn't gone up then that's i would probably bet on that going up you know the same way that's how most traders operate because historically that's been the case and because they all move to the same rules it's probably gonna stay that way for a long time right so it makes the process of trying to build a portfolio of collateral assets difficult because if you're trying to build um a basket of goods that reduces your volatility then you want you know a small set of goods that are as different from each other as possible you know the less correlation the better right so there's there's two ways of dealing with risk one is through hedging which is very complicated difficult to price the textbooks about how to price options for example then there's diversification so a lot of the utility from ample in early days we think this as long as able to fulfill you know our hopes for it will be um as a way of providing diversification into baskets of collateral they could use on central decentralized banks or lending platforms you know there's lots of lots of use cases there um yeah so i think that's that's the most likely near term use case you know long term we can use it during medium term we can use it to denominate debt contracts we can build up sort of centralized infrastructure on top of um more robust underpinnings they can allow things like denominating debt in a safe way right with a purely um decentralized asset as much as possible it's also simple and rules-based and easy to understand right so um i think there's there's because so many builders in the space come from a computer science builder mentality um you know i include myself in that group um we love building things we love building things that are sort of complex structures and towers it's very built off of everything around it but you know in a financial ecosystem that's not necessarily a good thing right so the higher your stack the risk you get grows not non-linearly right so so simplicity is like a huge feature that i think is undervalued right so i think that's also important to have especially the lower level the lower you go in the stack the simpler the mechanism should be um and then yeah much much later on maybe it could become an alternative central bank money where you buy your morning coffee but you know that's who knows when it's going to be like if you look at the activity of people in nephi right now like spending crypto is the last thing on their mind if people want to people want to hold crypto it's not only they want to lend it out to get interest if you're not letting it out then they're borrowing to go to around and buy more crypto right so people aren't necessarily looking to to buy yet but maybe some point we will succeed if we can get there but it will be well um and then yeah there's there's um some interesting interactions between apple and its mechanics and other platforms in the d5 space right so i think two really interesting examples to look at is a landing platform and then an amm like i made in market maker decks right so we start with the landing platform so one is if it is the case the ample does succeed in moving differently in the marketplace then it makes it a very attractive collateral asset so even as an individual user on say compound or ave right if you could use only if or a combination of both youth and some other asset that's uncorrelated not necessarily a counter correlation but just moves differently the different signal and that means you have a safer required to borrow against right so so as a lender or a borrower you know it's nice to use that escalator and if you look at the borrow activity online platforms almost all of the borrow activity is for stable coins for very good reason right that we talked about earlier all right so i mean this is sort of different now because the the the incentives in play have sort of distorted the activity on on you know landing around like people are farming comp and bell and that sort of thing so they're changing around their portfolios and true ways but before all that happened um people were pretty much only borrowing stable coins because they knew exactly how much they were going to have to repay in the future right so so ample is a decentralized asset like btc or ether or something like that but it borrows like a stable point right so if i borrow 10 ample i know i'm going to pay back 10 ample plus interest i know that every contract that comes down the line from that is not going to be exposed to the volatility risks because no matter what happens to the supply of ample the amount of ample i borrow it's going to remain the same right so i think that's really interesting uh specific use case in device um there there's a second really interesting use around dexes right so um i'm sure your your audience is very familiar with for example unit swap right which is a very simple model of an automated market maker where the price is quoted based off of the growth of the size of tuples um amms were created to solve the liquidity problem on the long tail of tokens right um but as a liquidity provider you are exposed to what's called impermanent loss so as the relative prices of the two assets and pools diverge um the process of arbitrage can extract value from those pools and u.s liquidity provider can actually see losses even though you're getting fees from trades right and this is especially the case with the longer the longer down the tail you get the more exposure you might get to increase low volume pairs really get hammered by impermanent loss right um exactly yeah so this is this is a fundamental problem in d5 that you know we do we would like to have a solution too right so so ample actually has a very interesting potential use case in this realm because of it all stems from the way we move volatility from price to supply and and also because that change happens in a pre-defined point in time right so there's there's a really great project other called balancer for example they're doing sort of hybrid it's like a generalized um swap where you can have up to eight assets in a pool and you can add different weights um according to each asset um so if you imagine you know a balancer pool right so even though um apple is a floating price token floating value token right they could go up by 10 times or down by 10 times right we wouldn't want to trade against a stable coin because the stable coin remains fixed but the value of the angle can go up and down which disposes lps and perimeter loss right but when we when we move the volatility from price to supply at the same time we can adjust the waste in the balancer pool by the same factor so what we end up with is we end up with a pool where you can trade a floating price token apple against a stable coin but it's an lp you're exposed to no impermanent loss zero improvement loss right so this also makes sample a really compelling base trading period token on amps because you can simultaneously provide liquidity to a stable coin with no improvement loss and some other floating price asset like eth or wptc or you can choose your favorite one it has the same behavior you expect in a period of two floating price assets so there's been a conversation going around in the ethereum space about stable coins and how difficult they are to make them pure right so single collateral dye was our like our one pure form of you know totally bankless totally trustless stability except even that had like trust baked into the oracle and i guess ample force hasn't necessarily solved the oracle problem either it's just has an oracle but it also does solve the problem of you know a lot what a lot of people are concerned about with like usdc backing die and and like my company realty we're trying to get real tokens into uh into maker dows who didn't die but then that's based off of real estate which is inside the united states of america which also is trusted and so actually the first meet the nation that we had we had rye on which also provided pure stability it was stable-ish in the same way ample forth is and so what i'm fascinated by is ample force ability to offer stability not necessarily to the holders but to the debtors uh offer stability to them in a very pure and trustless and bankless way because everything is built directly into ethereum into the base layer and i think that's just fascinating exactly and yeah we do have an oracle that takes data from outside blockchain but we do have a potential path where we could end up with kind of side stepping the oracle problem if all the data we need exists on blockchain right so if we have enough training activity and enough liquidity that happens on the blockchain itself then we no longer have to go outside the balance of the chain to get information so there is a potential future where we can be completely you know and decentralized right right and uh ampliforth has the most liquid unit swap market there is is that correct um yeah so we were the number one pool on uswap v2 plus i checked we had around 27 million dollars of assets um yeah so so i think that's um a result of you know our latest um application that we launched about three weeks ago called the geyser yeah tell us about that sure definitely so the geyser is in short just a liquidity incentive program and distribution mechanism right so um there's sort of two two pieces here that we were hoping for so one is we wanted a a fair you know sensible way for some definition of the sensible way of distributing tokens from the ecosystem fund out into the world that's you know rules based and open participation right so in the early years of bitcoin anyone could run a miner on their desktop and sort of get coinbase rewards so now nowadays it's sort of consolidated it's a little bit different picture that was the ideal that the pick one is going for so ample since we're not tied to an underlying layer one so the best way you can perform work that increases the health of the ecosystem is by providing liquidity right so our version of mining is providing liquidity fake liquidity exactly yeah so um so like monetary assets are defined by their scarcity and their use value and their efficiency is measured in their liquidity right so so the primary thing we were going for was to you know one distribute tokens fairly and two in a way that increased the quality of the platform so that's where the geyser is so you know very simply if you provide liquidity onto your swap and then take those tokens and deposit it into the geyser the more liquidy you provide and for longer the greater share of the you know ample drip you receive right so um yeah it's been very successful um you know beyond any of our expectations and i think the reason why is because it created a defined point in time where everyone could come look at the project at the same time and also see other people in the project at the same time right it gave people the confidence to sort of participate right so like money is a shared understanding of value so if enough people can reach a critical mass at the same time i think that's what started a lot of these sort of the sort of kindling that you know create created the behavior we saw over the last few weeks so i think people initially came by by seeing the geyser especially since everyone's sort of in the mindset of you know yellow farming that sort of thing but i think people um saw the project and then stayed for the project so so i think that's that's why i'm so excited about you know what's happened in the past few weeks is that a lot of people aren't even necessarily participating in the geyser but they are participating in an amplified project right so um i think that's exactly the sort of outcome we're looking for yeah i mean i can definitely say that that i've been captured by by the amp fourth project based off of our very initial conversation where we were we were talking to you guys about becoming a bank of sponsor so very much thank you for being a bank with sponsor and and the the final question i have for you guys is um so with any money it needs to be distributed equitably right and that's that's the target of the the geyser program so i kind of want to just go through the the other big supplies of ample fourth tokens and and who who owns them and what they're going to be used for so on ether scan you can see that the ample force treasury has 20 percent uh the ample fourth employee and advisor pool has 18 percent uh and then the ecosystem fund has eight point five percent is all of that going to the liquidity geyser all that so yeah so so first of all a great question so it's something that we do care a lot about being transparent about so before we launched we we published a transparency port that um published all the numbers that you just said right so we want to be completely open about that all the wallet addresses are also you know labeled on your scan so they're easily doable um i think the the real way to approach this issue is one of um funding right and how can we create a sort of framework that will allow the the project to reach what it's capable of right so this includes being able to support ongoing development uh support you know people like you who sort of you know do deep dives ask the hard questions and sort of educate the broader broader group of people and so because um ample is non-dilutive we can't just like mint a bunch of tokens and then sell them to find ourselves right and it's also the case the protocol itself is non-extractive right so we don't extract any senior raj we don't add any drag or adding transaction fees right so there's no like ongoing revenue model so we did have to think about the long-term health of like how can we actually support the team that builds the project that provides what apple is right so um so we did go with that sort of initial breakdown because there you know there weren't so many options we could do right so um because we had to do that so early in the project also going to be very conservative about the breakdown and how we define those buckets so if we block those out that's a way of saying that hey this this chunk of the network we can use up to this amount but we can't go over right it might be the case that we're able to reach orbit with a small team of like 110 people and we don't need those funds anymore at that point you know we can revisit that add them into the geyser find some way of distributing them but at least we have the ability to capitalize ourselves to build a project if we need to and ampliforth has been a project for many many years correct how long and when did ample fourth actually come about um so i'd say the earliest conversations between me and evan was late summer 2017 right um this you know this is actually the second iteration of the project so before it's called ample fourth is called fragments and so some people might know us by that name it was a very large complex system um much closer to a bank whereas now we're much closer to the natural resource so it had like a reserve and had bonds and so they had like balance sheets and assets and liabilities that sort of thing we became very um we lost a lot of confidence the more we worked with it we just kind of felt that okay this may or may not work it might just break right so if we have a system that relies on bonds and we're selling these bonds and you know profit motivated actors aren't going to buy them to bail us out then that's where the end of the platform right so we said okay what happens we take out bonds what happens if we just strip this down to the most um most primal essence right and that's sort of how we ended up with ample force so we officially launched you know february of 2018 um that's when we started development and started hiring on on the team we launched last year so we launched um on the biffx launch platform um june june last year so we've been around you know live operating according to the rules and technology in place for just over a year now um but it's really the last few weeks that we've seen so much you know excitement and attention so that biggest wallet the 20 of the total supplier labeled the ample fourth treasury is that for company development um exactly yeah so we have a description of what those buckets are for like in that report and we also have listed the unlocked schedules so those are still like we can't even access those because they're still not even reached as you know unlock this first unlock right so um when we get to that point then we'll be able to use those to capitalize you know finding the team and that's worthy right okay um and and that ultimately just goes is supposed to like you're supposed to sell those amplifor tokens into the market so you can raise money so you can pay for things to just promote the ample fourth system right because it ultimately goes towards the team and the team is dedicated towards building out the ampliforth system if that's wrong let me know if that's right what is in the roadmap over the next one to three to five years for ample fourth like if when you guys um what are you guys working on to to promote ample force right yeah so um our first goal is right now so there's two ways to look at it so one is we want to you know help build out this decentralized financial ecosystem as much as possible which means you know hopefully integration with as many different projects as we can right um so those are sort of difficult to sort of um predict because it involves outside parties they're sort of have their own development timeline and that sort of thing so you know we hope to sort of help build up the ecosystem as much as we can as we're able to um you know separate to that we just from a technology perspective we want to continue to decentralize the oracle right and then we also want to um kind of realize this vision of a multi blockchain asset too so launching on top of different ecosystems for example pocono or maybe cosmos or something something like that to sort of show that we can have a
