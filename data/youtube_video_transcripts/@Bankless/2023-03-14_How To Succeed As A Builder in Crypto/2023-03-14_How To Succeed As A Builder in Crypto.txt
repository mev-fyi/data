what advice do you have for the people that are putting on a builder's hat in 2023 don't be in it for the glamor like build something if you like building stuff in this industry if I stopped getting invited to fancy conferences or New York Times wrote something mean about me or whatever I tried not to let it bother me because that's not really the reason I got into it I don't really care what other people think I just want to work on stuff that I think matters and helps the world basically anytime you're doing something that is innovative you have to be willing to be ridiculed for it a little bit that's kind of the nature of disruptive innovation if you're working on something that everyone thinks is a good idea that's actually probably a bad sign it means you're about to have a correction back
