they are on our hands we've got a yield farmer with a chip in his brain he can calculate apy in his head but he can't understand the opposite gender which is ironic because he's got more farms than you've had girlfriends ladies and gentlemen dj and spartan's apprentice steven cesaro thank you that's beautiful yeah you like that one welcome buddy coming up next a man who's confused as to whether he's an investor or a painter he can't really sell his art because he only accepts eid the man whose cash flow is up only but his portfolio just bores me he's built a lot of companies but none of them count because they don't have tokens i think he's got a crypto punk and but at least there's one on his hat he's the reason why we're all here today and why we'll all be hungover tomorrow nicker bonnie hello hello please buy my art i have a habit to support in hot the chinese dutchman he's got cfa in his twitter handle so you can't really trust him the only person here who's got an actual job but at least is funneling boomer bills into our bags ladies and gentlemen the crypto financial analyst eric johansen i got you guys yeah dollar bills are coming in and last but not least the latest and greatest holding down the fort when he talks to his insta stories it feels like he's talking to me if he were an author he'd write romance novels with himself as the main character the man that identifies as a beard our man asadi i've never felt more flat that's good that was perfect it's a beautiful beard that was perfect i think we got one more i think we have one more you're right the only thing he's rug pulling is the city of san diego crypto girls swoon but he is in a committed relationship with his plants he feeds us more smoked salmon than alpha it's the slayer of moloch our fearless friend leading us into the frontier david hoffman everyone trust us that's so good i'm so glad i didn't read those beforehand stephen hasn't read it a single message on our text thread never read about it two years oh and you can tell because he tunes in about three hours late and he's like guys what have you been talking about um okay so bankrupt nation this is the alpha alpha podcast these are four d5s that i've met in my time here in san diego and i'm very sad to leave them but they are hard committed to their podcasts and so their podcast is going to be the main topic of conversation today so to get started on that whose idea was alfalfa podcast how did this get started yeah that's a good question take them to the team i don't know if i would say it was my idea but i have i have my flow with arm on a saudi power that was definitely your idea okay i pulled them into this and i pulled them individually onto my podcast and then eventually i said what if we all got together and did one together we called it tipsy talk and they were a hit and mostly just because i had a blast and i had fun and i'm sitting with my three best friends in the world getting to shoot the [ __ ] talk life alpha politics investing crypto and then we did a second one and a third one and then i just started incessantly pushing the idea of a podcast it's like why are we doing this on my show this should be its own thing how many months did it take to like fully get you guys moving though armand's got another nickname it's the wolf because the wolf will pressure you peer pressure you into doing things we have a lot of people all cap text messages yeah none of us like the idea of being like a persona online actually except armond really love it steven stephen kind of likes it too but like i think like nick and i have been like kind of avoiding sort of putting our head out of this hole and now like we're being coaxed and you're so good at it you guys are [ __ ] natural it feels it feels good now this is destiny so it's happening that's the inception and uh yeah we're like 24 25 episodes in i think it's the best thing we've ever done i've been watching it through and through and it's getting better and better and better and more and more dj and you guys are coming out of your personalities as this goes along um but why does the world need alfalfa what what is the alpha that alfalfa has to bring to the table i mean i think you know bankless has its its values right and and those come through and through the content and how you guys conduct yourself and your guys perspectives on the industry and i think we definitely have our values as well like our core values are that you know it's critical for people to have a group of friends that they respect and they think are thoughtful to kind of dissect the world around them and figure out what is our perspective and how do we go forward so whether you have a crew you know in person with your friends or not like come come join us we think that um you know it's success it's critical to be successful in life and to get fulfillment to have people to bounce ideas off of so we go into crypto and investing is number one we talk a little politics you know and and i think most people don't want to get into politics or be active but the next best thing is to be informed you know over time create a perspective for yourself so you could talk about it with your friends and and maybe create change that way and then yeah of course a little life alfalfa because we're all good friends we've been friends for a long time we help each other out through the opportunities life presents itself in the in the the troubles so naturally we gotta help each other out and make sure we miss the you know philosophical pitfalls of being a crypto dj investor i think yeah i think at bank list we definitely try and promote everyone to just basically take the crypto pill and stop taking every other pill and only think about crypto for the rest of your life like only by eath only by bitcoin only think about the merge only think about eat staking uh because we got to promote crypto to the rest of the world and i think you guys are the much more healthy and balanced side of that is like okay here's how crypto fits into the world here's how you can integrate this and have a part of your life but then when you talk about life alfalfa you also talk about work-life balance and just like how to do other things uh in relation to all your investments you guys are all crypto people but uh crypto is part of my identity and i don't think you guys have that you haven't gone that far down into the crypto you know it was eric that actually said this one time he's like i don't i don't give a [ __ ] if it's called crypto or it's called smorgasbord or whatever the hell it is it's the thing that's interesting right now that's giving me the most alpha it's the thing in life right now that we are paying the most attention to it doesn't matter what it is but that's where we're currently putting our attention but you know you come from like trad five background and that's what became most exciting to you and we all started pivoting toward that but it could be anything it's just the common denominator i think right now oh i'm a devout listener to the bankless podcast and i i give you guys a lot of credit in in my adoption into this industry and like um one thing i noticed was when you were talking with sbf he said he he he chased the money into into crypto and then he like got sort of pilled by the values and that's exactly where i'm at like i i wanted the returns but then after like getting deeper and deeper into it and like especially uh listening to what you guys are talking about i'm like wait a second this is like actually better for humanity crypto should by its own merits like work their way into everyone's portfolios but i think you guys like i will never say that like cryptos is not the right time to get into crypto because because of like it's more for like you know you can get in here as a long-term investment not just for you and your financial assets no matter what part of the cycle that you're in uh because crypto's good for good for the world uh but you guys are like well kind of feels like a top right now guys like man let's start talking about real estate and like some other some other assets um yeah we do owe it to steven though for dragging us along like big time i think yeah maybe i pushed the podcast but steven's the one that dragged us along with crypto hello lord but this is a good entrance for the d5 nihilists speaking of uh toppy tops and what we're going to do from here what do you want to talk about oh everything's dead we're all going to die is everything dead we're all going to die almost everything yeah yeah yeah all right so you have time out there right now you're a fan of this is gonna be as bad as blatant as bloody as all the previous cycles uh yeah i'm i'm kind of open to the idea that it could be worse oh in a lot of ways all right let's change subjects tasting like i don't know how uh how sunny do you want to keep this thing uh i think actually we'll return to the d finalist uh last because we'll go into that after after after we do all this and so uh we talked a little bit about what alf alpha is it's a bunch of different things a little bit of crypto a little bit of real estate a little bit of normal finance a little bit of life alfalfa i'm sure you guys talk about uh even like health stuff sometimes every now and then too uh so let's go into each one of you guys just to explore who you guys are for the audience for the bankless audience we'll end with steven so he can just bring us all down again uh but we'll start with nick because nick and i have an interesting story about how how i met him should we talk about our origin story yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you want to do that oh man well uh i was showcasing some art at a local neighborhood art festival and this guy comes up and says can i take a picture of your art and i'm like your art's amazing by the way oh thank you thank you it's uh only purchased neath so um he says can i take a picture art and i'm like sure go ahead and do a double take and i'm like oh god this is gonna be really weird i'm like hey man are you the guy on the bankless podcast and he's like oh yeah sure well what a crazy weird fan again and uh you know are you into crypto and i pull off my my hat which has my crypto punk on it and show it as like my verified street cred that i am in fact in the crypto point to the qr code that says only purchase an eth and uh then he just leaves me just go see me see you later our our story could have just ended that could have been it in the whole thing ended very quickly could have been like one of those like missed connections on craigslist well how are you feeling in that moment when he's just like cool well see ya he was like well yeah like ghosted at a bar i wanted a post on uh craigslist miss connections guy with black crypto punk hat sorry i didn't get your number [Laughter] but uh luckily david came back a few hours later and um you know i told him i said hey we got this group of guys that get together typically every wednesday we like to dive deeper into crypto and life and be a little thoughtful i think it'd be cool if uh you know you come by and i think from there a little hundred of uh friendship seeds were planted yeah i know that's about right from from my perspective on things i was on my way to the gym uh and so i had gym on my mind but there was the art walk going on so it's like i'll take the long way to the gym and i'll check out our all the art and that's when i saw i saw your painting of all the the fists the power fists with all the the skin tones on it um and then i and then i uh yield out of that that conversation very quickly and i'm in the gym and i'm like this is like uh not even two months from my time in san diego and uh i'm like just doing the foam roller just like reflecting on oh i just met a guy about my age uh excited he lives like a couple blocks down from me he owns a crypto punk uh so clearly he's into it and i just was like all right bye and just like my social awkwardness was like oh yeah this is where you make friends david this is like how friends happen uh and so like i'm at the gym like oh i gotta go go find that guy and thank god i did because that's how i found the rest of you guys well yeah that's good because i told my girlfriend i was sad and then i was happy when you came back so yeah it all worked it all worked out but a little bit more about nick like uh you're what you're a painter but you also have a fighter yeah hello fighter yeah and so like what what alfa do you have to bring to the table well let's see uh started in tradify uh managing uh money and 401k plans and and quickly saw digital media and digital marketing like growing figured a trend i need to get on and not be left behind so started uh helped build a digital marketing consulting firm that turned out pretty well and then uh got hired by one of our clients to be ceo of the company it was a growing software company and there learned how to manage large groups of software engineers and at some point i was like well i'm going to take this skill and and go off on my own and so had like a few companies that did did pretty well and and kind of find myself uh managing two e-commerce companies right now operating them and gotten to crypto in 2017 uh i think between companies and like many people was asking myself you know how do i like intelligently manage my money in my investments and do a good job and then proceed to do the exact opposite and trade [ __ ] coins on coinbase all day long like like it was my job and luckily you know made it out alive and got back in like 2019 early 2020 talking with stephen about bitcoin about uh you know potential store value and then on wednesday steven starts showing up telling he's getting 50 100 plus yields on these uh food tokens sushi unit swap pancake swap and i think for yam he lost he lost millions of dollars selling his talked to you earlier and i was like wait a second should i should i get involved in this i think the the rabbit hole just got really big all of a sudden and just sucked me in and uh you know we started a little uh crypto gaming guild as a sandbox to kind of learn the area learn the players learn the economics and uh try not to scratch ditch to build just yet i'm just enjoying the conversations with the boys in the alfalfa podcast for now and that is a nicker bonnie ladies and gentlemen let's turn to uh the man who identifies as a beard oh my god armon what's your story oh my story so lately i've been calling myself a thinker builder and creator because it's almost impossible to very romantic and absolutely thank you romance such it's impossible to encapsulate yourself and uh you know the great alan watts the hero of mine always said like it's irrelevant to describe the past it's just whoever you are today so i'm a thinker i'm very philosophical i love modern psychology as well i spend a lot of my time reading random [ __ ] that most people aren't interested in but every once in a while i get to sprinkle it into alfalfa every once in a while i get to go really deep down the rabbit hole with these guys especially this guy he likes to follow me down into these crazy ass places and uh that's that's where i get the most enjoyment out of life um builder building a company called collective shift right now crypto analysis education platform we're doing some huge things and uh creator you know podcaster uh actually am an author working on the first book it's not a romance uh not a romance model it's very philosophical um it's uh tentative title is unleashed and uh yeah man i'm i'm just creating i'm building i have this incessant burning desire to put everything i have inside of me out on the court like i have the constant awareness that i am a mortal being and one day i will no longer be here and i also realize that most of the great people that we remember from the past we barely remember they are forgotten and the the best case scenario for them is that they get a statue then sometimes even the statue gets torn down because society says [ __ ] that person now so what am i here for what am i trying to do i'm constantly thinking about that i think it's a driving force for my whole life and if it wasn't for these guys and my friends and the amazing people in san diego i'm really sad to lose you uh it you'd be lost it's the most important thing in life i mean we tweeted about this the other day so that's the thing i'm most grateful for in life is is people and experiences yeah and armon is uh the in the intro i had the guy who's back is broken from carrying this podcast he is the me he is the the the guy with all these actually like very healing and like cathartic feels so validated valuable thank you so much somebody finally recognizes our thank you david for the conflict resolution you guys are gonna have to go to group therapy after this one or maybe that's what this is he's the one with all the microphones and all the cabling and also does all the content editing and so he's the reason why alfalfa looks like bankless if you follow it on instagram we're trying and actually i think you guys kind of edited your clips even hotter than we do sometimes to be clear i don't actually edit them but yes i would make it well do you i don't i don't know either brother luke's got to step his game all right coming third third but not least eric who are you man okay so my story begins at san diego state university i was not a cfa at this point i was um filming mtv dating shows working uh trying to work in the nfl i was working for the san diego chargers as an intern and like i was also like making straight a's and being on the dean's list and stuff thank goodness i met these boys because they like sort of redirected my energies towards like uh what i would call like my career pursuits and um you know i think after after graduating college i went into like corporate finance investment finance or whatever but um you know in 2019 nick and armond brought steven around steven introduced me to this thing called defy and uh from there i was like wait a second i had previously thought of crypto like in the in the warren buffett and charlie munger sort of like way i was like this [ __ ] is so scammy and disgusting and then when i was i saw that these were not just speculative uh coins they could be like used as capital assets or or you know like collateral i was like wait a second there might be legs here and then i dug deeper in and like got into lping and everything like i really was unleashed in uh that like early coveted time when we were still meeting up on wednesdays everyone else was kind of locked in but we were we were like doing our little pod and um it was awesome who uh who owns the rights to eric's baptism who set up his crypto baptism of setting up his metamask while it was it you or first of all nobody i leaned on stephen at some point i was like okay so i i put two assets into lp and steven's like i'm drunk i'm like well i'm down like 400 on gas like help me and you're like i'm too drunk and i was like what i didn't understand and like gas was so high like during d by summer like i was just like lost i didn't know what i was doing i had this lp token and like i didn't know you to stake that i was just like i figured out on my own uh but these these were like educational expenses and you know and now you've got you know trad fi like wealth management clients coming to you saying hey so i think yeah scope management is is a trad five firm and we're we're like we've been moving more and more towards crypto ever since and i i like attribute all that to like our early conversations particularly steven sort of like ushering us all down this path wait the guy that that lost a million dollars on pancake swap is the reason why you're coming in and made a lot of money top tickets all right stephen the man that made a million dollars on pancake swap who the hell are you i i wish i made a million dollars i think i bought it at a penny and sold it at eight cents and thought i was a genius and then it went up to like thirty eight dollars i was very early on that kind of uh people want a farm and finance chain is cheap so people are gonna go there right and a lot of people were kind of doing the big brain oh no ethereum's decentralized people don't want that and i was like no people want to gamble i'm going to start farming on pancake swap but i didn't i didn't really have an exit strategy i just i threw like five grand in there and it went up like a hundred grand i was like i should probably sell and then like i checked like a couple months later and it would have been like three million you know i have a lot of stories like that from the last give us give us some bridgewater or maybe poker professional poker players oh my my let's go back to the chip and the brain reference yeah um yeah so out of college my first job was working as a emerging market bonds trader for bridgewater which is ray dalio's hedge fund uh that was during the the great financial crisis so that was that was like a baptism by fire for me fortunately i went in i realized we were short the world and immediately sold all of my stocks because i figured they're probably smarter than me so i did well on that trade i did badly on some other trades i remember one time i i accidentally bought 100 million dollars of brazilian bonds instead of selling them fat finger which is a pretty big fat finger that's my biggest fat finger of all time uh they didn't fire me which is really nice we accidentally made money on the trade in spite of all the slippage we incurred getting out of it which is a lot but um during the time at bridgewater i was i was playing online poker as like a hobby and it kind of got to the point where i was like hating my life and i i figured out how to like exploit this online poker game by by buying in short you know with the the minimum and kind of using this like strategy where i didn't have to think and i could play 20 tables and uh we we we called it rat holding back in the day and everybody on the internet hated me i had like a target on my back in the online community but but i didn't care so i i ended up just i quit that job one day i became a professional poker player stopped kind of exploiting and then ended up playing a lot of like high stakes heads up and weren't you playing heads up against phil ivey like for two weeks straight yeah when i moved to san diego i was just trying to meet people for the first time and i met some other poker players and i just told them like hey i want to play phil ivey in this this game i can beat him i'm better than him at this game he's not good and for some reason nobody was like that's a stupid idea everybody was like yeah here's like a hundred grand here's like two so um so yeah like my third or fourth night in san diego sitting in my little beach house that i rented i was playing phil ivey like 500 a thousand no limit or whatever the biggest game on phil tilt was at the time and i was like i had to use two hands on the mouse because i was i remember the very first hand look this is this is a honest to god true story i i got pocket kings and i was like oh you're so [ __ ] phil so he raised i re-raised he went all in i called he had aces oh my god immediately lost thirty thousand dollars i was 24 at the time too so it's like oh my god uh but that ended up being the most i was ever down in that match i came back i think i won like a million million and a half or something off of him and then he quit me and then i got a lot of free drinks for a while started no that started at a far earlier age to be fair i actually don't think you're a nihilist i just like calling you i i do sometimes yeah um but yeah i played poker for a while ultimately the government you know kind of ban hammered us came down one day opened up my computer there was like an fbi logo on the screen and i was living with four friends in a house at the time that that we kind of bought together we were playing poker and we just looked at each other like that's that's bad right it's just like you look we had this like kind of a room it looked like a nasa kind of control station there's monitors all around the whole room we converted this whole room into like a poker um den and like you looked around the whole room and there's just like fbi oh disgusting room yeah so so i was like i need to find a new career kind of got into to internet marketing for a bit and and did well there along the whole way i i was always into crypto you know i found it because of poker a lot of guys found poker uh found crypto because it was it was posted on the uh the two plus two forums was where we all hung out back in the day and like there's tons of people in crypto from the poker world because it kind of translates over um yeah i was looking back at some old messages like a couple years ago from 2010 i think where i was i was messaging a guy trying to buy five thousand dollars worth of bitcoin and swap them for poker stars money and i like the price was like it was it's like a dollar or something and i didn't end up doing the deal because i i couldn't figure out how to make the wallet work back then and that was a that was a mistake and in 2013 i finally bought some i had like a half million dollars or something worth of it when it was like three or four hundred bucks and sold it all 2017 rolled around and i was like you know what the lesson to learn here is never sell so i put like you know 80 grand into it i think i i ran it up to 4 million in like six or seven months trading all coins and stuff and then like immediately lost like all of it i think i think i left with like a hundred grand basically so so learn the op the you know adjust it again okay so that the answer is not to never sell anything um and then you know i've been planning for this that last last bull market to come around again and when i when i felt like it was time you know i i was working in online marketing and i knew this guy i didn't really know him i just knew his screen name there were a lot of people who were like anons in like the online marketing world because people were doing shady stuff um so i just knew him as this kind of guy on telegram and he was just like yo bro synthetics ave ethereum chain link i was like what he's like was it fan spencer that sounds like vance those are the those are the those are the he just like just kept saying that over and over again i was like what are you talking about because i was like a hardcore bitcoiner at the time because i just been annihilated and i hated [ __ ] coins and i kind of hated crypto but i mostly hated chick coins and i thought ethereum was a [ __ ] coin everything was a [ __ ] coin but he was like yo you got a farm you had a farm bro i was like what are you talking about it's like you you stake money and you get free money like that sounds like a scam and it was kind of it was kind of a scam now you know for a living well i used to now it's all gone to zero but we had a good run for a while so yeah i tried the d5 thing out like way early i was farming all like the food stuff like the the yams and the grapes and like that i don't know it was like the stupidest thing back in the day but like i was obviously making tons of money so i i quit my company and i just went full-time crypto got really really into it i brought all these guys along with me um shield them crypto punks which i sold way too early and you know a whole bunch of other stuff uh so yeah it's been a it's been a fun ride i mean i think the the d5 farming thing is it's definitely done right now so i've been uh trying to think like what's the what's the next thing i think of everyone here you are definitely the resident kobe in a sense that somehow you're like good at making money also good at losing money also super nihilist uh i think it i think it all fits i've just gotten rugged so many times at this point many of them just like self-induced drugs you know so i'm i'm a little bit we did one listener remark and maybe because of you that either i'm gonna get really rich or really poor really really quickly listen to this but otherwise gonna be fun and i think it's mostly because of your djen farming for sure i think that's my favorite review all right guys so now that you've established the characters what's the through line what's the through line behind all of you guys these guys are all not just podcast co-hosts you guys are just also friends um but the best podcasts have the best banter because the best banter comes from the best friend so what is the through line behind all of you i mean this this pod i think is we during covid we started doing this thing called like men's night we found like the one place in town that was open still another thing i had to drag them to do yeah it was all that was because of youtube you did not have to drag me to do that also you were like you're like do you want to do a podcast and i said yes i reject this storyline um but yeah we found this cigar lounge in in old town which was thriving during covid because some city ordinances basically allowed them to take over the entire like plaza patio it was outdoors yeah and they like quintupled their capacity and then they were the only place open so they became the spot and we just started going there every wednesday night and smoking cigars churchill's san diego yes um and we were just like let's just do this every night well we'll call it like men's night which is not the most creative term but you know we went with it uh and and while we were out smoking cigars and drinking wine everything you know we were always just talking about everything obviously we talked about crypto a lot that's where everybody kind of got like defy pilled uh for the first time and punk pilled for the first time but we we talk about other stuff too like we love to talk about politics and culture and just business and life stuff right so i think this pod was an attempt by us to kind of like bring these wednesday night discussions with friends where we're sort of trying to just sort through the world right and kind of make sense of everything and to just bring that to like a larger audience and try to replicate that yeah we joke that we're four radical moderates and who are truth seekers and i think we we joke about the radical moderate part because the truth often lies in the middle it lies in the gray and it lies in the purple in terms of political spectrums and so what we're trying to do is just you know hash out as good friends and as hosts of the podcasts you know dish out and debate the investing the policy and the life alpha that we can come across so i think that's that's primarily the through line which is so enjoyable it's such an amazing thing to like swim in the messy gray ocean of i don't quite know the answer and most people are like so quick to want to latch onto some sort of identity some sort of um you know group obviously we talk about group thing all the time but some sort of identity where they can say who's going to do the thinking for me who's going to make this decision for me who's going to tell me what's right or wrong but most people do not have the capacity and do not want to take on the like the responsibility to make those decisions in the first place and i think that's like perhaps one of the three lines as well is like we're trying to promote this idea of like perhaps just who we are but the idea of like the responsibility could fall on the individual and maybe you do have the tools to come up with the right answers and maybe society could look very interesting if we all sat down and we trusted each other to say yeah i can i can sort through the mess i can figure out what's fake from what's real and it's going to get more difficult it's going to get more crazy but that really seems to be the only way that we can retain any sense of individual power and that's what radical moderate means dave as you you got like indoctrinated into our crew by nick right as you guys uh explained but like uh when you came in to our circle we were talking about all this stuff you know like not just crypto but like also other life stuff and you fit right in like you you were able to sort of like hold your own and all these conversations you don't talk about this stuff on bankless right like bankless has its own clear niche and it's very successful doing what it does but you're so good at talking about other aspects of life too and i feel like uh you you fit perfectly in our little circle of talking about all aspects of life yeah when i listened to your the first outfit podcast i can't remember which one it was uh it was it was um you guys were contending with so much different uh sources of information it's like well here's what this source thinks here's what this source thinks and you guys are all bringing your own like thoughts about different sources to the table and so i remember hearing i can't remember what it was but like you guys said oh well bankless said this but then somebody else said that and i'm like well we're right guys but we're the right ones but the point is it's just like you guys are are not a uh bankless is like we try and do primary research we try and do our do our own thought but we project it out into the world and it's ultimately up to the listeners to come up with their version of the truth and a sad thing about the crypto industry is that so many people just want to be told what is true right and so many projects lean on that and just to say like well there's so many people asking just hey please deliver me the truth so i can just get the alpha from it where you guys are coming in you're integrating bank list and you're integrating other experts in the field regardless of whether it's about crypto or it's about like political matters or it's about whatever and so where alfalfa or excuse me where bankless is like here's the information about ethereum and eth and the merge you guys are like well here's what this authority said here's what that authority said uh and then let's throw all these topics and slam them together and see see what we get out of them as individuals who are multifaceted and multidisciplinary yeah yeah and we can get into the differences between the two podcasts for sure but just to add on to that i think most people are aware that the extremes are often the loudest voice the extremes the left the right the men the max are often the ones that get the most attention and i think we all also know inherently that the truth is not does not lie on those extremes and so it's a muddy middle and we have to you know find groups of people that we respect that we think are thoughtful to hash through those and we're not always going to get it right but at least the the process of questioning those things leads us to a little more truth and uh yeah hopefully make a little more money in the process and understand how we you know perceive the world along the way i mean i've often asked that right we've talked about this on the pod it's like how do you find any level of objective truth at all when you have all of this absolute chaos and madness and everyone has these terrible incentive structures to feed you lies and i think this was one of your points it's like it comes down to the people you surround yourself with because they're doing the filtering for you so one of the benefits of like i don't know listening to a podcast or having a great group of friends or listening to the podcast because they're like your auxiliary group of friends is that they're doing that filtering for you and you're determining the truth together but in the same way as bankless you leave it up to listener at the end of the day to determine for themselves what's the truth here the angle that we try to promote at bank list is that we don't teach you what to think we teach you how to think uh and so like we do have like heavy emphasis on ethereum decentralization uh and and all and all those things but we also promote how we got there in the first place and i think that is there the commonality between alfalfa and bankless is this not just uh we don't skip to the conclusions we we process it and as together as a group and then go through that journey together absolutely i mean i think you know bankless is is the best at teaching uh teaching a specific topic or an opportunity i mean you guys are impeccable about grabbing an expert and then using this socratic method to kind of linearly bring the listener um on to a new topic or a new opportunity and i kind of think of like every sin every time i sit down i'm going to sit down for class because i'm going to learn something and you guys fulfill that promise every single time and then i think like where alfalfa comes in is like well when you leave class you want to go to the bar and drink with your buddies and be like what do we think about this topic so they taught us a little bit how to think about this they taught us this new topic so let's sit around the bar and figure out what do we think about this how is can we make money off this and how do we position ourselves if we think it is an opportunity to take advantage of it so i don't know that's how i kind of find um you know like where they they too kind of parlay off each other and and i appreciate it in other words please never take us too seriously basically waste it no i actually like that i i like what you just said there because what alfalfa does really well is that we we are trying to make money too like it is about alpha as well as truth like uh you know you can get it you can get it right but if you don't make money getting it right then you know like how do you make money getting it you know how do you make money armand doesn't care about money though he's like he's he's above okay he's it's a by-product of he's almost like hovering like the whole podcast well we did a whole episode on like the idea of wealth and money too like you know the mexican parable episode where it's like it isn't about money necessarily you know you can you can like get to the end circumventing the money just by like living this rich life that that is doing what you love and i think like that's very cool too but the first thing we do in the podcast is talk about the money oh yeah oh yeah i feel like i want to give a little intro to the agenda that's okay because i think it does give a little you know uh it signals some of the differences so first of all there's drinking involved i think there's a always as we are now this is unless we have coven this is a very good mezcal by the way that we're all enjoying um so i think there's a two-drink minimum typically before we hit record and uh we can only do it once a week we only do that to our bodies once a week so it's a weekly podcast comes out on friday mornings and right at the top we hit the alfalfa round which is basically round robin you know what trades what actual trades and moves do we make in the market and you know we know the bags the bankless crew is holding and they ain't wrong but we try to dive a little deeper um into like what am i doing with my own money you know whether that's long short or sometimes it gets a little more i mean this round has gotten very sad yeah that's true it's a lot more exciting in the in the bull market for sure but sometimes what did you do this week sold there's been like an epic epic uh money making opportunity on the short side in the last like six months actually like which i think a lot of us are taking advantage of for sure so we do a little more uh you know spicy stuff like little derivatives options but more than btc and ease some alts and nfts of course is part of it and then we hit into like crypto like and making money as the number one priority so you know it's usually driven by by weekly events and so we do do our typical bull case for eath for sure and talk about yuga land sales and stable coin yields and stable coin death spirals uh we talked about some of our biggest investing mistakes and and you know are we going to recession how to play it and then like i said that the policy stuff is is good to for people to be informed and for all of us to kind of make uh make a you know we don't show that perspective no we don't shy away i mean we did talk a little roe v wade overturning we've talked about taxes on billionaires you know retrospectives on pandemic policy and then of course you know a little life alfalfa the boys have dived into experience taking some mushrooms maybe exploring our behavioral biases when it comes to investing you know most life-changing purchases and goal-setting frameworks and solid editions yeah so so by the end of the life alpha there's some definitely some slurring going on but hopefully you know there's some but we have that perspective the enjoyable thing about listening to it is that it very much uh comes off as a squad it's very big squad wealth vibes uh and it's like well what's the point of making money together if i have no friends to take with me along the way right and that's definitely something i've enjoyed just getting to know all of you guys is that like uh while money making money making money comes first in the podcast uh it's because you've got to end on on the high note and you got to end on the life alpha alpha the end on on the the friend alfalfa i don't know if i'm just keep on butchering the word off alpha and over and again but if that's how you guys use it just keep just keep repeating it into existence but i mean to your point we often talk about this this harvard study called the grant study and and it's it is to your point it was a longitudinal study it was an 80-year study where they took these harvard graduates and they followed through them throughout their life all the way until a lot of them were on their deathbed and even even passed and they interviewed them along the way and and funny enough a lot of them show you know dispersion on where they ended up in life but consistently they found the most important thing you know throughout life and at the end of your life was that your relationships your community that you build and for crypto people and listeners it's online and and in person as well is what makes you happier and in fact having that close community and that group of respectable thoughtful people to bounce off of actually influences a lot of health outcomes so so it helped create more wealth for those people it helped create better health outcomes and it helped people that was the surprise that was the surprise they were studying happiness they wanted to know what fulfillment looks like and then all of a sudden these people lived longer and they were healthier it was a huge surprise for them yeah and so i think that's like common you know a common thread common to the values that like you need these groups of people so you know we want people to come come join us and and partake and and you know ask questions as well you know about help us dive deeper into what should our perspective be about the world and obviously crypto and into to making money yeah what does uh squad wealth mean to you guys let's see you guys good question i think the most important thing is to be able to share in the experiences right so as you get older maybe you have kids maybe you don't maybe you move maybe you don't you want to start to partake in experiences that are more luxurious that are more interesting i think there's a very important factor of like watching out for hedonic adaptation another major theme that i think actually unifies us um yes we all make money and we love what we do but we're all very like aware of the fact that you know too much luxury can actually really hurt uh your level of enjoyment so it's like yeah sure i i think like one of one of you will probably be on steven's private jet but the point the point isn't that it's it's deeply rooted in gratitude it's deeply rooted in what we already have and having that and being appreciative of what you have creates more and so i think the ability to then share in those extra bonus luxury cherry on top experiences becomes even sweeter as a result of it that's what it means for me because if i was you know at a level where i wasn't able to either take care of my friends in the process and treat them to the entire experience or they weren't able to participate with me it would be completely meaningless but yeah when you find that alpha it's it's not fun if you just keep it for yourself but if you and the whole crew can can make money off it how much more fun is it and i think bulgy has this phrase like win and help win and that's like a little mantra that i try to like you know repeat in my head is like win but also let's make sure that everyone comes along for the ride because like it's just a whole lot more thing part of it too go ahead but part of it is like it's a positive sum game it's an abundant game we are all helping one another i think that's a huge part of it like we've all at some point done some sort of like beneficial transaction with each other but never in like a very formal official way it's just like i'm gonna help you i'm gonna invest in you i'm gonna give you my capital like there's so many ways in which you grow together and that squad wealth happens that way all right all right go ahead eric i think like my my answer is more of a question and it's a question to all you guys like uh i'm sure we all have other friends outside of this table of five right and like um for me i have friends that we talk about sports and girls okay like that's just like so great topics yeah great dogs but like this is like uh stephen wants to kill himself but these are like very uh you know they're like basil you know like this is like uh what you grew up talking about right and i i i still have that i have that with other guys but with this crew that's unique is that like we still have this like camaraderie and this friendship but like the the conversation's elevated you know like we talk about uh how to improve our lifestyles and and things like like these are like way cooler conversations and like i i don't find that very often and when when i found that with you guys like i saw the value here and i was like holy [ __ ] we need to share this like we want other people to get involved dude i remember when i won't name him but this guy came to our wednesday and he's cons he's come back consistently but i'm victory he he was so uh over the moon about what he was exposed to he was just like this is the most enlightening conversation in group of people i've ever met and i i know that because i'm grateful for these guys so i say that not in a way like oh i'm so proud but like no no i'm so grateful like wow i know these guys and you've said that too david you're like this crew is different it's special and i remember this guy showed up and he edified that and he acknowledged that and validated it and i was like yep i'm in the right [ __ ] place i think this is why we connected very quickly with you david is like i think you even mentioned it like you you want to think about how you think you want to think about the way in which you think about the world and that's why we mesh really you know quickly together and eric mentioned it i'm kind of like sad that you don't have you know show more of that on the bankless podcast but there's a time in place um you know maybe in person at the crypto conferences as our as our sherpa people get a taste for that i think we do uh but i don't well i guess you're the listener so so maybe you you would have better information better alfalfa about that than i do um i do think that like uh the bankless content style has like latched on to communities that otherwise wouldn't ha have because of the authenticity and so maybe it's the authenticity word as to where that alignment does happen as in like bankless one of the reasons why banks was so successful coming out of the 2019 2020 bear market is because we were the first major media organization that wasn't here to show you their token right like we were yeah and and so like that authenticity came out uh and one thing i was talking to you arm on when we were here in um uh joshua tree was that this was the first group of of men that it was the relationship amongst men was a little bit inverted in the sense that you know in high school like dude clicks if you like expose your vulnerabilities it's like here's what is like emotionally troubling me you would get a slap on the wrist don't talk about that like that's not what we talk about uh and and this group it was inverted it was like you guys will discover who who is not sharing all of their their thoughts to crack yeah but but it's inverted so when it's discovered that there isn't somebody who's being totally forthcoming about what is tumbling around in their brain then that's when you get the slap on the wrist well said and i think the reason for that is that's because you said it because i liked your version better i honestly was lost if i heard that for the first time but well said and i think the reason for that is because it's rooted in authenticity right so if somebody was not being forthcoming it would just be like what the [ __ ] bro like why are you here yeah what's going on so yeah [Laughter] you're so smart and good-looking stephen why are you tough not to crack man that's a good question we just want to how much time we have just i just don't like being vulnerable man you know it's okay like being on my own island but you're vulnerable by your portfolio sometimes yeah alpha rounds yeah i have an outlet through my financial nihilism you know it's like where that's where i express my inner turmoil it's through my my uh my financial degenning and i think it becomes a meme in and of itself like uh here's steven not sharing again just let me know on the podcast you're sharing more in real life is this a two glass conversation not a one glass conversation necessary i feel like i lose bunnies so you don't you don't have to kind of like jesus christ in that way you know and it's out [Laughter] oh my god you guys should open that as a tagline steven loses money so you don't have to i hope my mom doesn't hear that ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5

ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto all right guys um let's talk about some markets yeah um pull around the table bearish for polish and then we'll kind of unpack those things later on starting with uh number one armand bearish bullish well what time horizon um whatever your current bags uh reflect right now bullish bullish all right oh you good luck to you oh god do we have the the bulls and the bears with the white and the black is that what's going on here now you're ready obviously i'm gonna watch my portfolio go down another 50 percent 80 according to stephen oh god we'll see but i'm happy where i'm sitting yeah i like what i'm holding i got rid of what i need to get rid of i trim the fat yeah yeah i think i played the games i wanted to play within all coins within nfts i got into some communities i learned how they function i now understand the infrastructure that so many of these projects are built on um i've barely scratched the surface in many ways and where i'm at right now i'm just very happy with it um but like will i be able to withstand the volatility of like watching my portfolio go down 80 percent personally yeah because i'm in this for like i mean life i don't know like i mean this is modern finance i'm gonna go and interpret that as actually bearish i think that's embarrassing bullish but i'm ready to go down he's just obviously he's optimistic obviously he's prepared to be kicked in the balls i'm gonna get kicked in the balls and i think like sure let's see does this last uh 12 18 24 months but long term what i'm holding overall bullish but yeah we're obviously very bearish in the short term eric barrish bush so this is nuanced conversation uh yeah like this side of the only two answers here well okay so this side of the table in particular has been very good about about moderating bullishness steven in particular like on one of our first episodes like we labeled this clip like steven predicts doom in 2022 and he did that in 2021 so like uh you know we are not long only on alfalfa we we like play markets as we see markets and i think that is a benefit you know like um you know i was around for many bear market i was around in 2000 2001 stephen as well like i've seen [ __ ] go down yeah i forgot to mention that you guys are old i forgot about it yeah you're older than some okay so like when i when i was trading in 2000 like i was 14 years old like uh i wasn't that i wasn't that old but like uh where can the dirt come bro shaking with my cane we've seen this before and like crypto traders have certainly seen this before uh i think obviously we're bullish on the industry at large otherwise we wouldn't be here but i i i don't want to fall into this like into this trap of saying like just because we believe the industry at large is going up and to the right means that we have to trade it that way it doesn't it doesn't have to be that right and like if you trade it that way sure and you know like i remember the moment at stephen's house all five of us are there and i told david hoffman that like i sold almost all my eighth at 3 500 3400 whatever and dave's like are you what that was a 2k and like i think it's going lower and like i haven't even bought back it like there's a long bag that i will never sell but like you know you don't have to just raw dog it like i said on alfalfa where you just like go unprotected forever like you don't have to do that you don't have to do that and like your boy did not sell his youth at 3 500. they would never sell you that's good for you like i i want like i'm wearing this shirt i'm wearing an ethereum shirt i love eve it's just like at what point do you want to like play this thing sort of correctly versus just like raw dog it and you know you can do that if you want um but i i really believe that like this crew here we're we're very pragmatic and and that like supersedes our our our long bias and whatever so give me the answer bear bull yeah he wants to bathe in the gray yeah uh no i i'm like i'm obviously bullish but like in the near term you know this is not the time to i i don't believe this is the time to be buying right now you haven't bought back in anyways you haven't bought back in uh yet but you know what here's another thing i will say max payne like a lot of people talk about max payne on crypto twitter max payne is watching this industry that you believe in thoroughly run right past you as you like try to bottom tick this thing and like i refuse personally to be that guy so i will buy back in and i won't bottom ticket but like i don't believe that now like right now is the time uh stephen we're not going with you next you're going last nick uh bearish for bullish yeah i mean i'm bullish on the number of like active eat developers i'm bullish on the number of active addresses like we are on this network building path that will we're laying the infrastructure for the future of what may be like the internet or our you know digital economy in the future so bullish on that um i'm kind of like a little bit of between armon and eric and that like i have bags that i i'm not a trader so like i have my bags and i'm going to hold them forever but i also want to hedge so you know i was calling these guys you know intro week saying you know i'm not really an active trader i don't set up options i don't set up shorts but you know i have definitely been uh you know buying puts on the uh qqq and the general stock market to hedge hedge my uh part of the portfolio that's very boring to you david so i'm i'm hedging those those public equities um and certainly uh playing around in dydx uh you know multiple shorting [ __ ] coins and all ones you live in switzerland huh oh yeah i take i take steven's jet to spain to make my trades and then i come back and watch them from my school so i mean i think what we're looking for is like you know i think historically we've seen uh bitcoin when it hits this 200 week moving average i'm not a technical guy by any means but follow some when bitcoin hits that 200-week moving average um so looking for like bitcoin around 22k maybe eth around 1200 ish um and you know it's gonna wick below that probably most likely but that's where i'm personally looking and we'll kind of dca in and then on a macro like bullish or bearish you know i think we still need to see a fed pivot um you know whether inflation slows down or does does the credit market pop and and steve and i debate that all the time and i think we're starting to see signs of a credit market you know these collateralized loan obligations and corporate debt start to show some weakness and and will that turn the fed around so macro level looking for a fed pivot and on the micro crypto level looking for kind of those those bottom averages to hit although i do think your your bags are boring and they do provide alpha and so when the when the markets ultimately do change it's good because your boring bags told me so i mean it's it's kind of embarrassing to admit that like you know the the real estate portfolio is is larger than than the crypto portfolio and i kind of want to keep it that way is this a place where i can be vulnerable yes you can trust treatment love baths yeah yeah we like those cash flows from real estate all right stephen parish bush what like uranium i didn't get that joke i'm very bullish on uranium well oh because there's we're talking polish commodities they're for bearish everything else no yeah both bullish bears crypto uh bullish bearish on your bags well i guess i guess you would only be got a lot of usdc because i'm actually i'm i'm bearish uranium we're going to go ahead and fusion not fission i still do have a lot of these i actually sold all of my bitcoin um i still have a little bit of eath i basically have net short exposure because i've just hedged with a bunch of [ __ ] coin shorts have you been net short before in your life because i've never gone net short and like i i i've you guys know like i i shorted youth at like 3 400 they're my brother's bachelor party and i got stopped out on the on the jet and whoops the [ __ ] check blame the gym it's always the jet it wasn't my jet um not yet so that was that was a painful mess i mean i did i did sell a lot of spot around 34 35 i had i had friends who were telling me to sell like 42 43 and i didn't listen to them but like i was i was quick to realize that the the tides had shift had shifted into to go the other way and and since then i've progressively realized just like how much we're we're [ __ ] [Laughter] which is a lot i think it's kind of rough right now because everybody's bearish right which either means that we're just gonna pump and that was the bottom or nobody's really just comprehending like how bad it's going to get uh which which which is what i'm i'm i'm concerned with i i think everybody lives in the crypto world and we've gotten used to we we've it's like a such a short little bubble right even bitcoin like people post these like bitcoin rainbow charts and all these things there's a bitcoin goes up it's just a logarithmic regression it just goes up and to the right like this it's network growth right and if you look at something like as basic as commodities cycles right if you pick one commodities cycle you would have like in some instances like a 15 16 year period where said commodity just goes up and to the right and you just buy every dip and even though there's tons of volatility you make tons of money but then there's another commodity cycle where it's just down only right so like the entirety of bitcoin for example is is what now like 14 years it's like one commodity cycle so all the data people use to model bitcoin like you like the 200 week meme right it's the thing everybody's just going to buy the 200 week and then that that'll be it it'll just go up from there you just buy the 200 week i'll buy it like there's no sample size on that outside of this one very specific like paradigm right and if you look like very dispassionately at bitcoin right like just anybody go go home and just overlay bitcoin with like the russell 2000 chart right like bitcoin's just like a it's just like a leveraged play on the russell 2000 basically like every time the russell 2000 goes up bitcoin goes up a lot every time the russell 2000 goes sideways or down bitcoin goes down or sideways a lot and the russell 2000 is like it's kind of like a micro cap it's like like the smallest of stocks right the things you would um presume would kind of benefit the most from like excess liquidity in the system right so it's very unclear to me fed monetary policy yeah it's very unclear to me that bitcoin is like actually like an inflation hedge versus just like the beneficiary of like the it's just like the largest sort of like liquidity battery right that might now sort of be discharged like i don't know like i i i think about these things right but bitcoin is like a is like a it's like a good case right you've got things like avalanche and salon or like like harmony one like that thing is going to zero i'm sure i'm sure all the [ __ ] going but i want to ask you this like um so russell 2000 on trading view you can model this against like money supply uh and i i've seen you do this before like what's your thought on that like um like it's sort of just like uh kind of i don't want to say canary in the coal mine that's not the right term but it's sort of something that's like quarterly but i don't know if that's the thing right i think it's more complicated than oh we we print money because even the money printing is is nuance right did we there's a difference between giving the banks all the money via qe basically versus like helicopter moneying people via ppe and mailing them checks right one is like reserves versus one yeah different kinds of increases in the money supply right everybody wants this like simple explanation of why this thing went up and why this thing's going down but it's it's always like more complicated than that and i'm always wary of these like simple narratives these simple explanations oh this is this so it's gonna this is gonna happen it's it's very rarely that simple like the whole system is very complicated like we've talked about this a lot the idea that there's this like narrative in bitcoin that oh the dollar is just gonna get printed into oblivion and go to zero and then everybody's gonna buy bitcoin because it's gonna be like a haven from the dollar printing right that's like a very common thing that everybody throws around which might be true but like i tend to believe is probably kind of nonsense until so do you believe that crypto at large will continue to exist yeah crypto at large will continue to exist like you're you're seeing yeah yeah what david's like okay okay [Laughter] look at the nasdaq right now there are some stocks that are down like 90 plus percent like their stocks in the nasdaq they're getting wrecked worse than like all l ones which is insane because those things are dead like a lot obviously they're just dead they're obviously dead they don't have cash flows or anything at least some of these companies like had some semblance of cash flow or there might be a cash flow in the future well they're still debt right that's what i love about like sort of my client base or my peers who are saying like oh well you're invested in crypto you [ __ ] and it's like oh yeah well my alternative was i could be invested in these like [ __ ] cos and tech that were they're only down seventy percent instead of eighty rtk yeah and even your [ __ ] break right i mean arc is like a good i think the arc like bitcoin chart is really interesting they're both kind of these bets on like opium and liquidity and zero interest like bitcoin i think like does really good when you have like negative real rates because you're like why why i don't want to buy this long duration but it's kind of similar to like gold right we're like what why do i want to buy this long duration bond with a negative yield maybe i'll just buy gold right it looks worse when you can actually get like three four five percent in in like a bond it like kind of kills that narrative a little bit and something like arc is like a huge beneficiary of like artificially low rates because you're just trading on this infinite future cash flow that you can just discount to infinity and it basically allows you to just sell whatever narrative you want because like the more the real rates go to zero and negative like the more like math doesn't matter and you're just kind of selling some weird vision of the world right and in some ways i'm like worrying that bitcoin is sort of like arc because it is just like bitcoin is kind of just selling opium to twitter like there's no cash flows in bitcoin right and like like fees are just like a dead like heart patient where they look at the crypto fees crypto fees dot info or whatever you can see like fees are completely out like that's that's like yeah like that's scary to me because i i think that we are moving to this like totally different paradigm that like nobody's lived in before like we everybody has this very narrow kind of frame of reference through which they view the entire world right but like you can look back at like 100 year financial cycles and everybody's modeling everything on this 10 15 year cycle but there's no guarantee that that's going to be the same thing moving forward right it's like what ray dolly talks about he talks about the long-term debt cycle not just the uh not just the eight-year-old yeah yeah he's like two cycles within cycles you a little 10-year cycle but then you get 10 10-year cycles and then you get like the long cycle and then like all the things you were trading in your 10-year cycles just explode and if you weren't ready for that kind of game within the game then you just you just blow up right and most people don't think about that they have like this huge recency bias am i rambling now no no you talked about um monetary policy you also talked about like a lot of these assets being dependent on liquidity uh you're talking about how bitcoin is just related to the to the russell not to say that bitcoin just tracks russell but also the russell might be tracking bitcoin but it's more likely that they're actually tracking some uh more basal levels they're both sort of like liquidity batteries like they're there's like this like liquidity is sort of like energy in the system and this isn't entirely my idea i saw this on twitter once i forgot who sounds like your inner michael sailor i don't want him batteries it's like it's like the opposite of the michael sailor thing is it is it a liquidity battery or are we just really talking about the value of the denominator here it's like like when you have a circuit right where like the fed is sort of like the battery and you think of money as like the current in the system right mm-hmm are you familiar with the concept of like a capacitor and a circuit right like the capacitor stores all this charge and it discharges it very quickly within the system right so in in a situation where like the fed battery is pushing like all this excess money i.e energy into the system it tends to flow to like the the the capacitors in the system like that's where the bubbles form where these things rapidly soak up and store that monetary energy but capacitors once they have like a discharge gradient right they also very rapidly like zap out all of that energy and like the system kind of like kind of returns to like a different state right so i worry that bitcoin is just like a very elaborate kind of like liquidity capacitor or just soaked up a lot of monetary energy like like in my mind like eth for example fits a lot better into the new sort of like investment paradigm we're moving into right we were in this area where era where rates were zero where like cash flows what the what the hell are cash flows like i don't know cash flows like it's that stop it man you're just thinking too small with your cash flows what about what about three decades from now and how this is going to like we're all gonna it now now it's very different now like it's a new era where like we care about like real things like like commodities and energy and like how much money you're gonna make next year right so in that sort of like paradigm like to me as far as i can tell like the only asset in all of crypto that actually fits into that framework is is ethereum because like does have like a pseudo case for for being like a commodity and it does have like a pseudo case for being like kind of like arthur hayes you know infinite duration bond type thing right but it has something that it's anchored to it's like an asset that's actually demanded that's being used that has like a uh like a cash flow that can be attached to it like a multiple right so i kind of feel like it might come out of this whole mess a lot better than bitcoin right i'm like like i'm i'm trying to write a write a whole piece on this right now but i'm trying to i'm struggling to find a scenario where bitcoin goes to the moon in like the near term and eth doesn't right because all the scenarios i see where bitcoin goes to the moon first they first involve like worldwide political chaos which i think will send everything to close to zero if even though they might moon after like it's it's you're making me grab the mezcal first of all this is david aubin's like favorite scenario of all time yeah oh no i mean i mean no those are the bitcoiners that bitcoiners are the memes that that i've been the biggest pointer in this group for a while right i know there's been like a gripe of david's for some time but i feel like i've been reevaluating my position on this because i i think your time horizon is important important i think a lot of bitcoiners they talk in this kind of like uh elaborate sort of very aspirational multi-decade or even century-long time horizons but like i i want to i want to buy a house and maybe have kids someday and buy stuff and like in the real world so i care about what happens in the next day i'm trying i'm sure okay so here's how i'm hearing all of this and like i agree almost 100 and it sounds all about right uh and i do believe like it's all about capturing cash flows and bitcoin had this premium in the last like two years where it was the inflation narrative it finally caught wind out of coming out of the bear market of 2018 to 2020 because the fed started printing off money and to their credit bitcoiners have nailed the fed they they called the fed monetary policy for like the last decade before before bitcoin was any even on anyone's radar they said this is what's gonna happen uh there's gonna be some minor hiccup and for all intensive purposes uh covid was a minor hiccup as far as a pandemic goes like it wasn't real it was a worse common cold more than it was like a black plague and all of a sudden that worst common cold causes trillions of dollars of money printing and bitcoin sucks up all of that but then as soon as money as soon as the flows disappear bitcoin discharges that it sends it back into the economy right so it captured the money during the bull market but then because it has no value capture mechanism other than a meme it puts it right back into the economy when the time comes to it and so uh asking myself david are you [ __ ] bearish i didn't say i'll ask myself the question thank you for asking that yeah um we don't know what you're going to say on what time horizon yeah i think it's important right now uh so i i think that there is a short to medium term grit your teeth uh because there is going to be a calling of the herd as we know uh and i'm actually not i'm i'll i'm bearish on alt layer ones as a category but i'm waiting for the one of those few alt layer ones to make it through the bear market because there's enough of them where some of them will yeah and as soon as one of them is like the clear like survivor of the of the uh 2022 to 2024 bear market then i'm bullish and it's going to be the altair ones that figured out how to adapt and how to adapt to the new monetary policy the new standard of the economy and all of a sudden one of those things is going to make it through and all of a sudden it's going to be the next the ethereum that was of 27 2017. so i have a follow-up question for you david and i don't know if that was only one third of my rant by the way oh you want to continue first oh i want to continue oh let it rip oh i want to keep on going yeah and so uh we got all these alt layer ones which for the first time are layer ones with like investor unlocks so they have that to contend with it's great to see by the way that uh bankless is acknowledging all their ones we got spanked for not doing that last like six months or so decentralization go and so uh they have the the investor unlocks to contend with so that's going to flood the market they also are scaled in block size which floods the market in inflation and so uh ether ethereum has like four percent inflation pre-emerge uh in a proof of work form and solana avalanche phantom they are all higher issuance than ethereum is in well ethereum is in its proof of work form so they're already proof of stake and they still have higher issuance so they have all this issuance to come to the market one of these trains is going to figure out how to deal with all these things and one of these trains is going to figure it be able to go into into the next uh bear market deal with it and come out with it on the shiny colors on the other side chris bruniski called this um uh the hazing cycle of ethereum to to these alt-layer ones where uh like bitcoiners hazed us going through 20 uh 2018 to 2020 uh and now we are hazing the alt-layer ones and like we're hazing them into our principles like stop issuing all of your tokens like start having a decentralized block production uh and then maybe you'll make it through the other side and maybe we'll accept you then uh and a lot of bitcoiners started accepting ethereum when ethereum came back and started going up versus bitcoin starting in 2020 right and so that that's my bold case for alt layer ones bold case for all layer ones doesn't start until like late 2023 however uh so they got a while ago i agree uh and what one at least one of these things that's gonna figure it out maybe just one um if i put money on any of that maybe avalanche put money on really yes yeah i think salon is the obvious but if you want to be a chinese solana is building so towards something entirely different avalanche allowed for fees to go up avalanche have like two times the transaction capacity as ethel one isn't like every it's like this giant i'm not saying i'm bullish first either i you know a bunch of billionaires who are trying to get rich behind it you can kind of ride that wave you can kind of make that i don't think this is not like a tech based thing i need to get lost in the i want to get lost in it i want to avalanche we don't need to i want to hear it but what's much more bullish than that and much sooner than that is the merge it's submerged i'll press this button which you guys can't hear um skyrim has a bunch of applause uh and so talking about flows right uh as soon as the merge happens coming in late august maybe early september probably late august ethereum goes from the first time ever a negative 15 million dollar a day flows where it had it put leaks 15 million dollars worth of monetary power if we're talking about the battery battery metaphor 15 million dollars a day is going outbound out of ethereum and it's been that way ever since genesis because of proof of work as a function of market cap so divided by market cap it stays the same uh and so there's always these outflows to secure ethereum every single day and so the flows are outbound the the batteries being discharged into the market in order to sustain the blockchain and once proof of stake happens that 50 million dollars of day leakage turns into 15 million a day these are rough numbers but these numbers are generally accurate turns into 15 million dollars a day of absorption and so if steven's theory about how bitcoin is just like this monetary battery that sucks up all the liquidity at least ethereum has this mechanism that actually collects the energy and then retains it that's the main differentiator is it retains the energy we're on the same team here i'm wearing the shirt man i'm i'm talking about why i'm bullish i'm not okay so i'm gonna do it can i go to the bathroom do i have to ask permission for that no no no no not until i'm i just really have to go not until i'm done chilling okay when i'm done i need to dump on david's theory a little bit all right here we go just for the spice of it all yeah i think like bring the microphone to the bathroom let me i'm wearing the shirt i'm the same like i'm on your team like it is going to improve and like i think the price will follow right but i think you're talking about the fundamentals right and price and fundamentals don't always lie okay and i think the price we're only two-thirds through my ramp by the way okay yes i want you to i want you to follow me okay so when when price and and fundamentals deviate it's typically because some exogenous factor right and right now it's it's macro at large is causing that deviation and i don't think that deviation is is set to change any any time soon right okay and i think you would probably agree with that yeah okay but i i think i think it will change in like within six to nine months okay maybe maybe six nine months but maybe maybe a little longer but like i agree with you but like there will be an accumulation phase where you can like you can buy back into eve it's not just going to be v-shaped that's not just being like okay merge and then right goodbye oh i think that will happen okay well it might and like squish chaos would agree with you et cetera i i'm i'm not really necessarily thinking that what i'm thinking is that like uh you know i think it was kobe who said that like the merge is not an engine upgrade to eve he called it like if if you were like uh making the analogy that that ether is a race car we're not changing out the engine where now this this car just goes like 10 times faster than the other other car it's like a he said kobe said that it's like we made this car more aerodynamic like over a long period of time it will improve against its competition but it's not just going to like just take off and and that's i i completely believe in that uh no i i i i'll take the other side of that back because yeah the idea is that like you can feed the same amount of gas into two engines and receive two different outputs from those two different engines based on their design right and so one is leaking uh leaking gas as it goes and other the other one is like very very efficient you're right but we're like you're talking about fundamentals i'm talking about markets right okay so the the argument that i'm making is that the merge overpowers macro because which is a big statement to make it's a big statement to make and i'm not saying it it overpowers it like on a dime it's not like we hit the merge and we just we just reverse the only the only reason where that would be true is that we hit the merge and then we start reversing because that would happen because of narrative not because of fundamentals but the argument that i will make is that fundamentals start accruing faster than people are expecting there's a reason why there's terms like buy the rumor sell the news like it's because investor behavior also matters like for price not not for value but for price but all those people selling the selling the news are going to have to eventually they will get overcome by the 15 million dollars a day net cell pressure by pressure the uh 30 nets excuse me i listened to your uh podcast with the help yes exactly north rock digital and he was talking about how there's 12 million dollars a day of cell pressure from from miners and at post merge if that doesn't continue it's going to be hard to stop the price from going up but i do disagree with you know eth and the merge escaping macro fundamentals but i do have a question for you in regards to eth price going up post merge you know i think how press mentioned that he thinks that the price is going to front run the merge and i disagree with that and i think you've said that you think the price will go post-merge but on on what time horizon because i i do think these narratives have to develop there the market does price in some technical risk and so the market just may need to see this thing work for a little bit and then they're going to need to see the yields and appreciate the yields and those will show up on cnbc and bloomberg and what kind of yields you can get and then the market will will capture of like how much electricity was decreased through this update and those narratives will take time but they will develop and so i'm more of like eric's on terms of like a a longer time horizon it will definitely uh benefit ethan the price but but are you more of a v-shape like post-merge immediate pump no i'm more of um more of a a curve more of a curve rather rather than a v and i and i think the crypto industry will figure it out first because they're the what we'll see a very big breakaway is the eth btc ratio because that will happen first because if macro hits once again the crypto markets and we all take a big a a big leg down then we're all going down but we're going to notice eth do very very well in that post in a post merge ethereum we're going to notice east doing very well because it's not it has 30 million dollars a day of less cell pressure than it previously did and so the bitcoin the bitcoin ethe ratio is going to look much more violent than the bitcoin dollar ratio steven's shaking his head but then the the bitcoin the eth dollar ratio will over 90 days post merge will have started to accumulate 90 times 30 million dollars worth of net buy pressure in comparison to its previous equilibrium and then savvy us dollar investors us all our investors law [Laughter] we'll start to notice like wait why isn't ether completely obliterated it's doing okay and that will start to so the first the narrative will spin in the crypto world and then it will start to bleed out into the macro world and you think that the crypto world will use the eth btc met uh metric as a signal and do you think we're in this channel or the eth btc ratio do you think we'll we'll break down of that channel in the short term no okay so because like in in your episode with ben cowan he go he literally said himself he's like okay you're probably right on this but it will take longer than than people are thinking right and how long well that was like six months ago 24 he was predicting or whatever and i'm i'm kind of on that time right horizon but was he was he privy to the merge though does ben god know about the merge the fundamentals of the merch because like a lot of people do you think he doesn't like literally this is his entire life he drives the lines on a chart yeah he's just a shark guy come on he doesn't know about this stuff well okay it's one thing to know about the merge but it's it's different to know the the magnitude of the merge and so uh i'm and i'll i'll say i'm not 100 confident on that the merge overpowers macro but i'm more than 50 and of those cohorts of people if i'm in the right camp the cohort of people that think that the merge is more powerful than macro is like less than 100 people let's get okay first of all let's get steven's take on this because i i i want stevens but like i'll just bend over now [Laughter] all right so uh i have a couple of thoughts on this i find it really peculiar right that everybody seems to think like the merge is this like revolutionary event that everybody at this table knows about is and is talking about and there's billions of dollars on the line but for some reason like nobody else understands it right like we're the only ones who've understand it's not priced right yeah less than 100 people i'm i'm very skeptical about that point and then there's this other narrative right that's like there's going to be so many fewer outflows of ethereum being dumped on the market post-marriage right but what i never hear people hear people talking about is the idea that leading up to the merge there's also probably way more buy pressure on ethereum than is going to exist post-merge because a lot of the market is probably buying more ethereum than they would be post-merged because they're betting on this narrative happening right so i'm not buying this like idea that like the buy pressure is going to remain constant pre-merge and then post-merge and then because the buy pressure is constant the cell pressure drops off and then the price moons right i think by pressure is way higher now than it will be post-merge i think obviously post-merge by pressure way drops off because people trading into that narrative goes away so i'm like super skeptical about that i am definitely not of the camp that like the merge like erases macro right like i think macro is king i think anybody who thinks that crypto is going to in the short run like out trade macro i think that's like that's like a crazy uh pipe dream the other thing i would say is like we're all very familiar i assume with like the ethereum foundation selling the top of every freaking thing that exists right so if i were like an ethereum whale and i had billions of eth right now what would i be doing i would be like engineering this like very gigantic hype going into the merge so that i could dump all my stuff in august like please right before everything really fully goes to hell and then like that that's what i would be doing like so i worry that it's like a bit of like spoken like liquidity event right and like is there going to be like adoption on eth in august like is there going to be like like d5 just got like took like a bullet to the head right nfts are like it's getting to the point where it's like embarrassing if you have an ape as your profile picture on twitter like gasps like it's been that way for a while it was like 12 to do stuff right so like i don't i don't see that demand just suddenly returning because the merge happens in august i'm very mid long term bullish on this but i'm not really trading around it and i find it to be like very hopium and it's exactly the stuff i would be wanting all of you guys to think if i was just about to dump on your heads that's exactly what i would be saying like ethereum foundation they're pretty good at it they're pretty good at it well they sold 4200 they didn't they're not gonna sell i'm skeptical of every narrative that comes across crypto twitter as though it's like you're the first person to hear this narrative and nobody else knows it except you or maybe other people knew it but you're like the next in the chain and then retail is gonna get this after you say like who else is buying into the merge narrative after us that's like what i want to know like like who's going to come after us in august and like support the price of eve i just don't see it in in in the short run the same people who think there's technical risks the same people who think there's like a climate issue with with proof of work i mean all those people that need to be brought along they need to be shown evidence and i agree with you that like obviously this is priced why do you need to see evidence that proof of stake doesn't hurt the climate that does not the execution risk i see we don't but i do think that the general financial markets need to see that it's true and they need to see someone publish some data and the and the the narrative to take hold like that is true i'll latch onto that narrative it's like it's the next 100 million users and like to be fair there are not that many users in crypto right now like on a global scale there there aren't that many so like it's not gonna take much to like increase buying demand really like globally globally globally from where where's the money coming from where's the money coming from everybody's wealth is being destroyed it's being [ __ ] annihilated like eviscerated right like everybody's valuing stocks is going down everybody's valuing homes is going down the fed is doing qt which is pulling money out of the system okay people have to pay more money to heat their homes to buy food but we agree like we've been we've been bearish enough like we agreed but but there there does come a point at which you want to be a buyer and holder of of good assets of which we believe that eth is sure maybe like a year or two from now plus the whole point of the merge fundamentals is that it doesn't no one needs to buy because the ethereum ecosystem has established itself around an equilibrium of a certain amount of daily cell pressure that all of a sudden inverts from negative 15 to positive 15 million dollars a day and so the whole idea is that no we don't need anyone it's baked in it's literally baked because you refute my point that like i believe that the market has put additional buy pressure in in the lead up to the merge that would not otherwise be there i think orgo negating the whole existence of the emergency i thought everyone has been selling for the last like six months because the price is going down so almost still like astoundingly high because of the merge correct so once the merch narrative doesn't exist anymore what's to keep the price up all of the people who knew about the merge haven't sold and all the people who don't know how the merchants did sell let me play a little bit of a mediator because steven on alfalfa on our episodes has has said himself that he's setting his own buy limiters like right then you've set your own buy limit orders at 1800 50 100 1200 whatever right like so 500 sounds okay there is a level at which you want to buy and like i agree with you like and we would all agree that like we want to own eth long term and i think that is irrefutable like we do want to own this asset it's just at what price do we want to own it you guys saw snapchat right like it retraced its entire run up the entire thing so the idea that like eth is here like 2k when it was 200 dollars during covet and we're all like can only go up from here did you compare ethereum to a dick pic app yes i did because at least the dick pic app has a lot of utility in people sending their pictures to people right a lot of people getting late it's much more utility than me creating some weird financial derivative and then barring against it 17 times and having it blow up right like they like i i would argue that sending dicks is like a very such an island putting ethereum and snapchat until they say humans literally said sending dicks has more youtube the fact that ethereum right now as a market cap is is trading lower than like individual companies is laughable long term like long term maybe i agree with you but in the short term i don't think any of that matters i think in the short term everything is just liquidity flows it's just like everything is risk off that we agree it's just like at what price do you get back in your your bids are going to be there to support us at 1200 yeah i will buy it please please sir i feel comfortable like i think i think i would be stunned if we don't like run those 1700 lows like that at a minimum and like the bitcoin chart by the way which you got like that to me that chart looks terrible to me like i look at that chart and i'm like this is this is losing like biggest trade percent like it's just like i'm in trouble the eptc chart just it it looks like it just it's just wants to roll over and die for reasons like i don't understand because like i think eve is better than bitcoin for the next five years i do and i don't own any bitcoin but i own eth but also like as an objective person i look at that chart and i go that chart looks really bad that it's not a bullish it's not a bullish chart do you do you accept that if it's all based on flows that the eth merge with the inversion of 15 million negative to 50 million positive is bullish under that same reasoning i my my point is that there have been excess inflows on the basis of the merged trade and when the merged trade doesn't exist anymore those inflows will go away possibly at an exact equilibrium point of the reduced outflows right so i don't i mean like i listened to this this episode with the whatever his face the hedge fund guy and like to me like that point didn't like and and i was skeptical of this with like the bitcoiners and the hat oh that the having it can't be priced in right it can't be and then people make these like tortured analogies of why like oh you can't pause it's so stupid like like you just buy like why can't i buy more bitcoin in advance of the habiting knowing that there's going to be like this reduced cell pressure at the end it never made any sense right so right now you are nick carter and i'm the bitcoiners we're like nick carter writes this like massive essay about how the merge is completely priced in because of just like uh efficient markets and all the bitcoiners are like it's not my match uh price in but what they're saying is what i'm saying is where as soon as the flows the outbound flows gets kneecapped all of a sudden it slowly manifests a bull market and we could with the whole triple point excuse me the triple happening like it happens three times as fast in ethereum land i think you are right on a different time frame i think like one two three years from now you're definitely right but i don't think you're right i'm not september or like november or december and that's kind of what i care about right i can see it down only for the rest of the year but like it's gonna be it's gonna be if that is true then it's gonna be a green 2023. i think it's gonna be a green 20 23 for east regardless all layer one still have another year ahead i i agree with you like i do think there is going to be this pivot right but i think the pivot is going to it it's going to be like a different investment environment right like i don't think the pivot is just gonna be like risk is back on let's buy all the dumbest [ __ ] possible i think it's gonna be like okay it's back on but like interest rates are probably gonna stay high i think persistently now i think like we're probably going to enter a paradigm where we have like really high rates but also like a lot of money printing and we try to like pull money from all the rich people and like helicopter it to the poor people and there's going to be like persistently high commodity prices and all this stuff we haven't had to contend with before and i think there is going to be like a premium to invest in things that have actual utility that like you can actually derive some sort of valuation or price from which is why i think in the medium term like i like over over bitcoin because i i look at bitcoin and like to me bitcoin is like it's pure speculation it's it's just like it's like a call option on beta liquidity right like on like it's basically just some call option on or like some massive put i guess on like worldwide fiat but like i don't think the dollar is going anywhere anytime soon and like i said i think if the dollar does go somewhere there's still going to be like an extended period where everything gets wrecked while the dollar goes to the moon including probably bitcoin so okay why not just wait until that point to buy it then right like i don't i don't see like the scenario where bitcoin thrives but ethereum dies in like the next like three or four years that's like the thing i'm trying to like convince myself of and and like this piece i'm writing and i haven't been able to to do it yet so if anybody has like a good argument for it like please i think that's better the better question like david asked if we're bearish or bullish i think like the better question is like where do you see price in 2027 like where do you see the price way down the road and i think we would all around this table say valhalla valhalla say valhalla steven say it we want you on record i i really don't want to lose everything before valhalla i'm like hopeful it goes there and i i think it probably will but i mean i don't wanna i don't wanna i don't wanna but the farm david i mean part of this is on your shoulders i mean like these narratives will be seated with the crypto native media and post-merge someone's gonna have to prove that electricity and power consumption is down and you know these yields exist like do you ever feel like a little weight on your shoulders that you're gonna have to bear the inception of these narratives and how they grow i haven't been wrong yet brother yeah that's right man well our money's on you my man money's on you yeah all right guys well since the uh camera on youtube keeps on cutting out uh i think we'll have to have our our last final words and so i'll ask the the group one one question you guys will each get to ask is why should the listeners listen to alfalfa i'm on number one number one oh god i like the compilation of their answers synthesizing why you should listen to us um you shouldn't if you didn't enjoy this and if you did you should we'll be your homies and um we're taking this very seriously i think that's something that i want to um really put out there we're really enjoying this we're really taking this seriously and we're really having a [ __ ] grand old time and uh yeah come join the journey with us eric number two the mezcal just hit me like a freaking ton of bricks i just slumped way down in my chair because like i don't know it's i'm feeling the weight of the mezcal uh dude you're sweating bro i'm sweating is it is it arena are we in a sauna uh okay um bottom line is this like this is the type of conversation that we have on our on our way enjoyed this and our podcast and like i think it's valuable like for me it's valuable i've gotten like immense value just from talking to you guys over the years this is an example of that and like that's why we did the podcast that's why we started it's like to share this type of talk yes well said stephen stephen yeah i mean if anybody just heard me rant for a while and they were like that was but it was actually phenomenal well i really enjoyed it well if you enjoyed that then i guess you should i was totally stephen that's why we're close yeah and and i like to you you know that the episode you know the lord of the rings or the orc kind of runs in with a dynamite just dives in and blows everything up that's like what i try to do with everything you know so if you don't if you don't like that if you just want to like be like comfortable and like yeah this is my thing and i just want to reinforce my thing then you should probably not yeah you should like you know supposedly yeah i but i like to i don't know i just like to [ __ ] on everybody's ideas once in a while it's good he challenges me a lot a lot it's been beneficial though nick can someone please tell the listeners why they should listen to your guys's podcast circumstances man well i'll give you the facts and it's straight is that i've become richer uh talking to these people and listening to these three other guys and debating topics and it's made it's made me money and yeah yeah maybe a little happier yeah and i i think like like we mentioned like the grand study has proven that when you have a core group of people that you respect and that you you dissect the world around you get a little wealthier a little healthier and i think that's what we're trying to kind of you know develop on the podcast and so come join us that's why you're the marketer in this group well come join us you know let's try to make some money together and uh at the very least hop in the discord and make fun of our logo so i can convince these other guys we need to change it yeah we like that yeah for sure all right guys well bankless nation you know what to do all the links per usual are in the show notes if you want to listen to alfalfa if you want to listen to these degens and if you want to listen to them yell at each other for various topics of which you will not see coming but the alfalfa is with the alfalfa boys uh guys any last words bro you're the man we love you we appreciate you that was phenomenal it's an honor like i i'm actually really sad you're leaving san diego but to be continued in many ways certainly and uh this has been an honor for us i am sad too on a personal level that you're leaving because you are the only time in my life i've like walked into a group and there's been like a person there who's like liked crypto more than me it was so refreshing to be able to like even just take a step back and go like ah because i've just always been
