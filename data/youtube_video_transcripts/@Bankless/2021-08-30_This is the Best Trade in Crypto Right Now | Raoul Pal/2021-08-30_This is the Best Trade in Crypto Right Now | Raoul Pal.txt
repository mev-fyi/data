[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david ralph paul on the podcast again really interesting concepts and ideas we had them on nine months ago this was a different raul paul to me like similar in many respects but some definitely some different theses coming out of this uh episode versus the last one and a totally different portfolio what was your take here yeah it's really interesting to follow raul paul down the crypto rabbit hole i think that's what why so many people enjoy the content that he makes in addition to being just extremely articulate and extremely just informed about the way that markets work uh we are all collectively watching ralph paul like discover crypto and formulate his own opinions um people kind of identify with crypto by the era in which they go down the crypto rabbit hole and so we all get to watch ralph paul go down the rabbit hole late 2020 early 2021 and formulate his own opinions as what it's like to be in crypto in this specific part of uh crypto's history um raul is of course a big macro focused investor which to me is a very like sobering perspective to take right it's like you know ignore let's ignore the regulatory fund let's ignore the market movements of you know 24 hours or seven day charts or months big trends big trends only big trends only and it's a such a nice way to get clean signal from a very noisy industry um so that's always why i like to talk to ralpal yeah i totally agree and i think backless listeners if you have time go check out the last episode we did with him in november it's just a fantastic episode in and of itself but it really shows kind of the the things that have changed in his thinking but also the things that have remained the same i think one thing that's remained the same is he is data driven right metcalfe's law is how he makes his decision network effects he has to see the data on chain he doesn't think about it too much but he looks at the trends uh and we got into that discussion he also said this time ethan's money that's a big departure because we asked him his bankless platform has been saying that for a while we asked him last time if you thought ethan's money he didn't but what changed is he started seeing nfts purchased in ethan i think that's changed a little bit he also gave us some 2021 price predictions um he talked about how a billion people would be in crypto by 2024 if the current trajectory holds he also gave us a peek into his portfolio and last time it was 85 percent bitcoin we're not gonna let's not reveal it though david right something else now though fifteen percent eat and it is something else now i will say he got rid of all of his gold so you'll have to tune in to hear what his portfolio looks like this time around um all in all man i i think rowell gets it he's not blinded by tribalism he looks at this from a very analytical perspective and he has a gift for simplifying things uh and uh distilling them to kind of base concepts that are very understandable and memeable so huge respect you guys are gonna absolutely love this conversation yeah and let's just go ahead and get right into it but before we do we have to talk for a moment about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your dapps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use d5 if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrarium can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrary arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord bankless nation we are super excited to present our next guest to you this is raul paul he's been on the podcast before he's the founder of real vision he's one of our favorite voices in the space talking crypto talking macro talking investing in general it's been about nine months since we last had him on the bankless podcast that was november 2020 and oh my god so much has happened since then it feels like about nine years so we want an update we want to unpack his brain particularly on the events over the last nine months and how he's thinking about markets today raul welcome back to bankless it's great to have you it's great to be here two tropical storms and a power cut couldn't stop us doing this that's right no one can stop us from doing this uh we had to for bankless listeners we had to reschedule this uh twice we actually thought we were going to have to reschedule this time because as soon as browal jumped on the on the on our call power went off electricity and the caymans went off how are you guys doing is this typical for the cayman's rallies no it's not it's actually a pretty stable place where everything works for some reason when i've been here seven years and we've had i've had three storms in seven years two of them within the last week so either global warming is going exponential or it's just unlucky maybe just unlucky but we feel lucky to have you back here and we're glad we could uh actually have this conversation you know we thought we could do uh sort of a rundown of topics raul and just pick your brain on them um so we want to talk eath we want to talk d5 we want to talk nfts in the metaverse and everything that's going uh on we want to contrast that with our conversation nine months ago but i thought what we could do is go from sort of top to bottom big to small if you will and let's let's start with sort of the macro uh and take us back nine months ago what's changed in the macro world over the last nine months give us the update there so what basically happened so nine months ago let's say we were talking about june may june last year that my macro thesis at the time was that we were going to see um we were going to see some sort of insolvency phase the overhang from this whole situation that didn't happen because of the unprecedented amount of monetary printing that went on and the ongoing fiscal stimuluses so then we look back and we realized that the worst recession in all recorded history only lasted two months and that was all about again this stimulus so if you are janet yellen and jay powell you sit in a room together and go that was pretty good eh it kind of worked it worked for the financial crisis and now it worked for the entire world closing down maybe we don't have to have a business cycle maybe we don't have to have risk anymore so the marginal propensity for them to use to fire that gun again is extremely high well the market sells off well let's just add some stimulus you know we're still not sure that equality is quite right we'll add some stimulus every answer becomes we can add stimulus so the market currently has been looking for strong growth and jay powell was out today talking about potentially tapering because the growth numbers have been strong but my work suggests that the economy is actually weakening so china has a weak credit cycle and its gdp growth is falling sharply um japan has got itself in a huge mess now with the covid delta variant that's the third largest economy in the world and you know europe's still stop start the us still not fully recovered and it's normal normally it takes maybe two years to fully recover from a recession and this was a big one so after we call the end of a recession generally the central bank cuts twice again after it because growth isn't fully stabilized so in this phase where growth i think is starting to weaken we see it in things like uh well the most dramatic being the university of michigan sentiment surveys for buying climates of houses and cars and big ticket items people have just gone this is the worst buying climate we've ever seen it's the worst numbers we've ever seen in these surveys because of the price rises that came from from the supply shocks beforehand we see rollover in ism and these other business cycle surveys so we're going into a period where the fed are talking about tapering the market really thinks inflation is the big enemy and probably we're about to see a slowdown now knowing that every single recession since 1962 the fed cut rate twice after it and we saw this little spike in bond yields first and then bond yields went back to the all-time low almost every time since 1990 for sure so the probability is for me that the economy is weakening the fed cut again twice there's probably more fiscal stimulus to come and the markets haven't prices him at all now in the context of what does that do for asset prices well i've talked to a lot about the significance of this printing it doesn't come up in cpi the inflation that everybody talks about it comes in the fall of the valley of fiat currency the denominator and we see that because basically you can you can divide any asset by the fed balance sheet and everything's about flat and you can do the same with german property and the ecb balance sheet or uk property and the bank of england balance sheet or swedish prop it works pretty much consistently we're lowering the value of a fiat currency overall so if the fed are going to do that we should see a rise in the value of equities the value of real estate most assets and especially cryptocurrency so your take is we're going to continue to see asset price inflation but what about cpi inflation i mean there's definitely been murmurs of that uh of course we hear from the you know from the fed and economist that it's just transient it's not you know permanent others say no this is going to be more pernicious it may go down and up in cycles but the trajectory over the next you know five to ten years is going to be up from the cpi perspective what's your take on cpi inflation my big picture take on cpi inflation is it's almost impossible to to make it go up we have the baby boom generation who are now 70 and they're all retiring so their consumption pattern falls significantly and we've just seen over the last year the largest wave of retirees in all recorded history and those people once they retire spend less money because actually their pot of final savings is not that big but the ones that are still in the labor force are competing with their kids the millennials so you've got the two largest cohorts in all recorded history competing for jobs then we've got globalization so if it's not bad enough competing against your parents you're competing against chinese and indians and if that's not good enough you're all competing against the robots and ai so that backdrop is and in a massive credit bubble so that backdrop is wildly wildly disinflationary you know the relentless rise of technology is hugely disinflationary so can you generate cpi inflation i don't think you can you can't generate in food because technology just destroys it because crop yields keep going up price of food keeps falling you can't do it in basic stuff like clothing and furniture none of that stuff because technology keeps changing your 3d print tables and chairs now it requires no humans you can do it just in time technology need no inventory and this is relentless the only two real things that three things that went up over periods of time one was housing which we're aware of another asset of course yeah but rents have gone up as well so that's that's not been easy healthcare well no [ __ ] sherlock if you've got 76 million baby boomers at 70 years old they're competing for healthcare so the costs go up and that will continue the other one was education but that's collapsed the rate of inflation because the entire millennial cohort has now left university pretty much i think they're all out now so i think it's gen z and university so the cost the the marginal um consumption of of education has gone down so i i find it very hard to see this now are you going to be able to keep the price of copper and industrial materials higher copper maybe because of the electricity boom that's coming but overall technology lowers the price of copper you can extract more copper we saw that with fracking and oil that's technology that's how technology stops price rises that's probably the best example in the world is you know you cannot keep the price of oil higher because technology keeps dropping it lower so no i don't believe in cpi that is a good example um so this is kind of a mental model buster i guess for me so my um model of things or my best guess going into this was like hey over the last 10 years we sort of saw the asset price uh story that's at price inflation story right ever since uh 2008 kind of you know fed printing um money supply increasing eventually it's going to asset prices you're kind of saying and then i in my mind i sort of thought well the next 10 years might play out uh and some of that asset price inflation might sort of seep into cpi and become you know more pernicious but you're saying like that the this the next 10 years might actually turn out to be similar to the previous 10 years we just get some increasing asset price inflation even the truth is wages in real terms in the united states have not gone on gone up since in any meaningful way so they've underperformed almost everything so what that means is your wages your income has remained static while the cost of assets has gone up so you're actually poorer what is that why what is an asset asset is delayed consumption you put your money into the asset and in 20 years time you sell the asset and you spend the money but that's the point of owning assets they're delayed consumption what it means is your future self has now got a lot poorer because this stuff keeps going up faster than your wages this is the real dramatic problem that equation of can you get wages up to create demand push inflation no can certain cohorts wages go up sure but overall you can't because everybody in silicon valley's job is to drive costs lower and it's it's a it's a really dramatic situation this creates a huge amount of anxiety social anxiety people don't know why they're getting screwed but they're getting screwed and it's not just the fed raising asset prices it's actually the fault is of the silent generation who had too many kids after world war ii that's act if you want to blame somebody and you know world war ii was a feature of world war one because they didn't pay the because the um they refused to allow the germans um to forgive their debts so it's a long story of how we got here but it's not going to change we're all paying for the sins of our fathers i guess probably while committing new sins without knowing it that future that's right you don't know the law of unintended consequences i mean nobody thought that this is what would happen is after the euphoria of world war ii 70 years later you'd create a massive collapsing growth which has happened in europe japan everywhere else that had post-world war ii economies they all did the same the others are slightly older because they had a lower rate of immigration the united states did and what happened was they all started their economy started slowing down faster than the us but it's baked in the cake it's difficult to avoid almost impossible so that's the the macro story now let's maybe um burrow another layer deeper here but still relate it i know you've had a thesis role that that's basically like macro and crypto those two things will converge that's going to become one in the same thing it's just a it's a fast convergence but people might not see it coming what have we seen over the last nine months in the macro story of crypto has there been more of that convergence are they now close to one and the same or what's changed so i think they're the same so if i go to my peer group and the people i really respect from macro hedge fund space right so that's the pointy end of macro those are the guys almost all of them have transitioned across in one way shape or form either entirely or partially really like yeah i mean very like the last nine months or how long it's been happening slowly but it's increasing you know it's going exponential as all these trends do so you know people like alan howard who's one of the world's most famous macro investors based out of the uk he personally is entirely crypto now you know dan tapiero you know good friend of mine he's entirely crypto now i'm pretty much entirely crypto certainly my investments are i still look at them whole macro world but one after the other they're all seeing the superior returns and a solution for the set of problems macro problems so macro guys generally tend to be pretty pragmatic we've got a set of problems solutions what's going to make money allocate capital accordingly but everybody's going well this is the biggest opportunity we've ever seen because you start everybody starts on the bitcoin journey and ends up going having the holy [ __ ] moment that everything is about to change and i'm sure we'll talk about a lot of that later so i think macro and crypto have merged what you're seeing now is you're seeing a lot of noise from the late comers to macro people who only know either the late comes from macro or the ones that have been around very long and are anchored to gold and certain kind of mean reverting ideas what you're seeing is a fear of change so the noise that you're getting at the periphery the peter ships of this world for example it's not that peter schiff doesn't understand that crypto is the future it's that he doesn't want it to be because it's technology we call that we call that bag bias is that what you're saying it's actually worse than bag bias it's a fear of change right we're going through the fastest change in all history so for people to understand what i'm talking about the internet grew at 63 a year from 1990 to 2000. the internet was 140 million users at 1997ish crypto is about the same now but the crypto digital asset space is growing at 113 a year this is the fastest adoption of any technology in all recorded history people don't want to believe it how can my very system of money change in front of my eyes what what does the central bank mean any longer what does it mean for my savings what does it mean for you know the thing that i've railed the gap about all the time is gold that'll save you from all of this and now there's something else everyone has to drop so much of their kind of outward-facing belief system and it's hard so that is the that will slowly change over time but generally the macro people who are broad-minded have entirely changed well i want to get more and more granular as this conversation goes on into some of the nitty-gritty details about you know what's going on in the world of crypto but but before we do that i i want to just emphasize the role of the macro perspective when using that perspective to actually understand what's going on when we get to those nitty gritty details like nfts and metaverse and whatever and so let's just keep going on this why is what is so powerful about the macro perspective and what are the what properties about you know bitcoin ethereum and crypto uh make this obviously a macro conversation right yeah you talk about internet adoption you talk about like network effects and metcalf laws like why does why does the properties of crypto so neatly fit into a macro perspective the easiest way of explaining is by my journey how did i get here and my journey was i was macro macro for 30 years it was 1997 where the world changed 97 and 98 was the asian crisis the asian crisis was a sovereign debt crisis and a corporate debt crisis that wiped off the value of asian stock markets by 90 currencies collapsed 80 it was a total wipeout of wealth in asia and it was driven by debt the answer to 1997 and 98 was to cut interest rates long-term capital management the giant hedge fund blew up at that time as well the answer to that because it could have taken down the financial system was to cut rates that led to firstly a massive rally in equities and pouring of money into the internet boom so that was a vc led rally plus all the stocks that obviously ends up morphing into where we are today the inter you know crypto could not have happened without the internet but what happened over that period is a massive debt bubbling property so the debt bubble continued it in fact accelerated then it blocked the entire world's banking system in 2008 nobody know who who'd owned what so when lehman went under everyone's like well i don't know how do i get my stuff back and they're like well it's not your stuff it's been rehypothecated 37 times so you can fight it out in courts and oh by the way it's held in the cayman islands london new york and hong kong figure it out yourselves right that was the mess we got into and people got wiped out then we cut interest rates to zero and invented constant of easing which the japanese have been kind of trialling beforehand so now we're pushing money into the banking system and we have rates at zero and so humans being humans go well great we'll just borrow more money and they just keep borrowing money so all of us in macro have been watching this and talking about it for a long time 20 years long time and we knew you know business cycles only come along once every five to eight years and it all comes to a head in a recession so 2008 you kind of knew was coming because of what had happened in 2000 and what had happened in 97 and the piper was going to get paid and the central bank figured a way out of it then suddenly this event happens last year there was going to be a recession but the accelerant was the pandemic so it blows up everything and the world could have blown up again right all everybody should have gotten insolvent because the world's shut down for a year but the government just said no here take free money and the central bank will just print it so we now know what it's doing to the value of our savings because these assets are going up we're actually getting poorer in our future selves and so the macro guys start thinking well how the hell are we going to get out of this cycle it's either going to blow up spectacularly but the odds are getting less or we're just going to get poorer slowly over time so it's a matter of how fast you figure out what's going on so once you figure out what's going on you look at crypto and it solves a lot of this so when bitcoin first comes along it's clear it's developed solely for this job i mean it's very clear in the white paper and it's very clear when they're looking at the banks being bailed out again that somebody figures out why don't we try a scarce digital asset and see if that works and then about a year or two after that people start figuring out oh blockchain oh that kind of is interesting but other stuff because we've got now a trusted ownership structure which the world didn't have then europe blows up in 2012 as well we almost lost the whole of the european union and all of the banks so we kind of know it's a big problem and then ethereum comes along with smart contracts and then the kind of light bulb moment for everybody goes off is like actually we can rebuild the entire system from scratch so as a macro guy when you know you've got something fundamentally broken and there's only one set of outcomes which is printing more money we've got this low growth from this and technology and all of these things have been changing the world so we've got we've got low growth massive debt makes it harder to service the debt increases the amount of printing so therefore these assets go up but the real macro opportunity is to invest in the new world we've just discovered the americas from scratch why would you not buy that because it actually answers all of the problems it's got the scarcity it's got the ownership the transference it's a new system it doesn't have the fragilities of the old system you know and then the macro story gets better because it's like you know if you remember go back nine months go back maybe 18 months i was like we need a yield curve four months later d5 explodes and it's kind of there's different yield curves everywhere and different wrist curves and god knows what and then eth and staking comes along and we've got now got a risk-free yield i mean we've got everything we need so this becomes a macro bet now so how do you analyze a macro bet because for me i can't understand all of the protocols or you know look at every single token think about everything so you need a framework a macro framework we need to simplify it and so i spent a lot of time uh around kind of november last year october last year looking at the pushback people would give you in social media when you talked about ethereum and would hate you right yeah so i remember when you came on in november and one of the big i could tell one of the big um areas of interest for you at the time rao was like tribalism because i think you were you were seeing all the tribalism in crypto and being like why can't everyone just get along but that tribalism forced me to understand when i get these kind of pushbacks right so we talked about it before the kind of gold crowd why do they push back i don't get pissed off with them for pushing back i try to understand why what is the motivator and then once you understand what it is it's a much easier thing to deal with and also to reason with people and this bitcoin pushback about ethereum i was like what is going on here and you know we know all the stories of why but they all had reasons why ethereum was not the same as bitcoin and it's it's obviously clearly not as an asset right it's very different thing but why would you not look at it the same way you know all equities you kind of look at the same way and all fixed income you do and so why would you not so then i just dusted off metcalfe's law and realized that it fitted perfectly it was absolutely perfect and in fact it matched exactly where bitcoin was when it had the same number of wallet addresses and it was like oh my god it's the same price as well and then i realized the whole damn space was this so then it was just a matter of adoption i didn't have to be the guy in the weeds understanding everything i just need to understand how fast the adoption was and when we're talking about adoption there's two ways we need to think about it one is investors in it so we can see doge for example classic example of a one side network effect so price goes up because bunch of investors but if they go it would all disappear but ethereum clearly had more developers working on it than any other ecosystem and that was growing the rates of change of that and the number of applications so now you've got this kind of perfect storm of network effects and that helps me understand stuff like doge as well i mean people are like this is a scam blah blah blah no it's not if you've got 40 billion dollars of value in it from investors alone then all somebody needs to do is figure out the other side and you've got a massive network and the first person to do that was actually mark cuban mark said fine you can use doge at dallas maps and then elon had seen it as well and clearly he's working on something to do with it whether it's streaming car payments or whatever it's going to be it's very clear that it's going to be used and that's fine because you become less cynical about what these things are and you can judge everything about is it a real network effect or not and that that's made the space much more investable much more macro much more understandable and much less tribal absolutely and there's this uh division in the crypto industry where people like to either perceive these things as monetary units or financial assets or technology and we on bank list we like to think these things as both whereas bitcoiners like to perceive these things as more these are it's a means to an ends to produce a financial unit uh and there's other like platforms that are really all about the technology um but over the last nine months and since we last talked about uh uh talked to uh synced with you about what you're thinking about it was largely all about the macro the the whole money printing the trustlessness of the assets um but recently i've i've been noticing you talk more and more about like the network effects of the adoption of ethereum so when you see the rate of adoption of ethereum do you perceive that as like a technological adoption or an adoption of the the nature of the assets on ethereum or is it really just one and the same well what's so interesting about theorem it's everything you know i actually bought my first nft today um and look everything's priced in congrats was it a cryptocurrency you got to tell us more about that right yeah it's nothing exciting i just thought i'd have to do it we'll come on to that when we talk about nfts in a bit but it was priced at 0.758 so ether's money and i'd seen that because we can commission for real vision of uh kind of headquarters in uh crypto voxels which were just you know we're going to release soon just for the fun of it and the architects we paid beneath and the land we paid beneath so it's like okay well eth is clearly money beneath this technology we know that too um eth is also a platform of which people are building a lot of different applications so whether we talk about community tokens nfts defy a whole bunch of stuff um dows they're all going to be on eath now will eth be the only chain but no clearly people use solana for staff people use and there'll be a multi-chain world of which there'll be a few giants and a long tail of stuff and that's pretty normal um but eth has got really interesting because of this and then you know i came out with a piecing global macro investor last month called the greatest trade and you know here's my macro head-on again is okay we've got this adoption that is kind of exponential right it's growing at least twice twice the rate of of bitcoin and it's by far dwarfing the rest of the space then the eip1559 comes along and that reduces the supply so that's clearly bullish for the price and then you look at the on-chain analytics and everyone is bloody staking it because now it's a pretty clear run between now and eat 2.0 so why would you not if you're a long-term holder so everybody's taking it so that's taken a ton of stuff off the exchange there's tons that have gone into just holding tons that are locked up in d5 tons that are locked up in nfts and you're left with i don't know as of today 11 of the entire supply of ethereum available and it's going down every day and the demand is going exponential the only outcome is an exponential rise in price there's no other outcome raoul paul you are an eth bull my friend this is this is um you know something that i i think uh we've been talking about on bank list for a while right but i think a lot of people haven't seen it until it like because there's execution risk right i mean i've been talking about eip 1559 for three years but it's like everyone's like yeah well is it there when's it coming what's the timeline for this now things are happening and people are starting to see it i want to talk more about eth as the greatest trade in a second because i want to hear kind of your full case but before we do just doubling back to i think a a key um point of interest for bankless listeners because every investor in this space has a bias a mental model for how to evaluate um crypto and these assets i would say the bankless mental model is technology uh you know monetary phenomenon from the bottom up we're building a new monetary system it's going to be bankless essentially if i if i just sum it up it's a parallel financial system so that's our mental model for how to evaluate the space um and i think it's useful but you know no investor has everything right and where i see some value in bankless listeners looking at your mental model is you're not neces you're not a monetary maximalist you're not necessarily technology maximalist you don't say this layer one versus that layer one what i would paint you as raul is you're a metcalfe's law maximalist right it's all about the network effect and what you're actually seeing in this on-chain data what's really cool about this macro asset in crypto is you could see it all on chain so i just want to talk briefly about um what sort of network effects you look at i know i've i've seen some of your twi twitter threads and it's been great like but like is it is it address adoption is it number of holders what is it it doesn't really matter there's a lot of macro guys that will be annoyingly kind of hand wavy like if it's being adopted at speed it's going to work and everyone's like well what exactly can i model that in a spreadsheet no forget about it it's irrelevant if you look at the rate of adoption that's going on of the entire crypto space and this is my this is my true north this is all i need to know there's one single thing i need to know and nothing else so we know that it's growing at 113 a year in terms of number of users and we will assume that over time that trend rate of growth falls a bit so if it falls from this year and goes down to 83 so that's a significant fall in the growth rate and we saw the internet do similar but it was at peak growth with 63 we're 113. it gets by the end of 20 to 24 to a billion people and that gets us to about three or four billion people by 2027-28 okay so a blind chimp can choose a cryptocurrency and get rich if you look at the size of the assets the entire crypto space as of today hit 2 trillion again i think global equities are about 200 trillion global bonds are like 200 trillion global real estate's about 100 trillion 2 trillion 200 trillion i figure that's probably a 100x and we all know almost all of us realize that all bonds all securities all assets are going on chain anyway so it's probably even bigger than that but the point being is that you'll never ever in your entire life ever again and ever beforehand we're given 100x in an asset that's already up 2 million when you look at bitcoin you've never been given this and you can basically choose anything and it will go up so once you do that you don't you're not scared of making the wrong bet and it stops you being tribal because within that you know some of them are going to be amazing you take the pressure off you own a you take some basic bets you know bitcoin ethereum a couple of others here and there and then you can just have a basket of stuff and over time decide okay i quite like that or that's getting faster adoption so then you start to look at like solana is clearly getting adoption it's clearly happening and it's clearly happening in the price okay so do you want to own a bit more of that maybe you know is polka dot getting to where it should be don't know yet but it's worth keeping an eye on you know there's a there's a lot of stuff and then so that's how i tend to deal with it is forget trying to model it and look for fair values and this it's like as i said you can be a three year old kid and be given a box of names of crypto currencies and take 10 out and you will literally make 30 times your money over the next 20 years in the next 10 years so raul what if that's the case which i definitely is there's a lot of stuff that uh appreciates in crypto for no apparent reason um but why have you singled out ether in ethereum as the world's greatest trades so what about the adoption this is the typical way i'll approach macro a lot of macro guys do you've got this big thesis now which is 100x the space in the shortest period of time so then our job is okay how do i add alpha where do i find the better bets now there will be probably 50 tokens or assets that will outperform ethereum but they're riskier i don't know what they are i have no no i have no ability to choose them when you look at ethereum it has all of the elements of the lowest risk highest quality trade and it's you know it's a rewarding ecosystem with rewarding people in it because you know there's a social element to this there's a cultural element to this movement as well and it's rewarding so it's a good space to hang out where you feel comfortable with the asset you understand how many smart people are working on it so when you say to me oh there's a risk in 1559 getting done my answer was the risk is like minuscule and so i didn't care about it like 2.0 it's minuscule why because there's a lot of very smart people smarter than i'll ever be working on it so the probability is extremely high and that's what that makes what makes it so rewarding so let's talk about um some of the catalysts coming up for ethan right so we talked about eip 1559 we talked about staking is the merge as well part of the calculus right because we're going to see this triple point this this um three part happening we're going to see like a massive reduction in supply is this the bull case is it mainly yes the supply side or is there a demand knowing how markets work this is going to catch a lot of people by surprise it is all in the run-up where the money will be made my guess is the moment each 2.0 happens half of these gets unlocked and it all comes onto the market and the price will collapse it's typical yeah and that's a short-term thing it might be an overhang for a year i mean who the hell knows right but that's pretty obvious that this is the best single time that's why i call it the greatest trade between now and and eth 2.0 everybody wants it to happen they're going to lock up as much heat as possible and get the yield it's as simple as that but when it comes out chance he collapses if you remember when coinbase went public everyone's like this is so good for the space everyone's going to know about it what did it do marked the exact high in bitcoin and i i've mentioned that on twitter beforehand i'm like this is what it's going to do and it will and this will probably mark the high in eth well i have a counter argument for that uh if you are interested in hearing it yeah absolutely the the people that are staking eth right now they're committing to that insolvency period right that's the whole point as soon as the merge happens that insolvency period is up and they can withdraw that's what you're talking about uh the nature of proof of stake is that it actually rewards people who are the most bullish right and so the people that are committing towards that lock-up period are the people that are inherently long on the ethereum economy and so while there will and ether definitely appreciated significantly since some of these uh you know amounts of ether got locked up and so by definition there will be people who want to you know realize those gains but they are also going to be the population of people that are most inherently tied to the health of ethereum itself and they're most interested in the long-term success of ethereum so if there's any population of people that's not going to dump right after the unlock period happens it's the people who are ready to take a year of insolvency and that doesn't matter it's the marginal change that matters right now the marginal change is more and more people locking up each right the rate of change of people locking up is still extremely high what will happen is the rate of change of people staking will fall it's as simple as that you know the bull case is that of course there's a load of people who are just going to stake and just leave it there and that's good because that's the long-term health of the system you know nobody's in this for the quick buck but there's a [ __ ] ton of people yourselves included who will end up selling to me because they want to buy a house or get married or do all the stuff that costs fiat money buy some nfcs though you know maybe that move just that maybe but at some time you're going to spend some fiat money on something yeah it could be nfcs what's your preferred narrative for ethereum so and then do you have a different narrative for eth the asset right there's all of these different narratives no no i think it's all being everyone's it's people trying to overthink everything you know eth currently is a platform you know that that's how i think about it you know it's a platform from which to utilize their blockchain to transfer value to store value and to create applications on top so you know is elements of it money as we talked about yes are elements of store store of value yes are elements pure technology yes i mean it's everything so you know it kind of is still the vision that vitalik had of the kind of internet computer i mean it is that but that sounds a bit restrictive it's kind of the i call it the internet of value and you could call it the platform of value and it doesn't it's not exclusive because others can do similar things but nothing has the scale the scope that the ethereum currently has one thing that we've been seeing more and more recently uh and especially in the last quarter or so is ethereum has become so large that it's started to be subdivided into different communities we have like the d5 focus community we have the nft community but then we also have this like dow phenomenon which is actually instantiating actual borders around communities like do you own the dow token or not are you in the dow discord or not uh how do you see the relationship between communities and ethereum uh inside of an industry that is so incredibly tribal right there's a lot of energy behind these communities uh and does this conversation of communities on ethereum like fit into a broader macro conversation yeah i mean i've noticed it myself because it's impossible now to keep up so you have to specialize and you know i decided that i'm not interested in defy really because i came from the financial system and i don't care about yield it's kind of boring to me d5 is very cool right i love it love the whole concept but for me i'm a financial markets guys less exciting than complete disruption of business models that nfts and social tokens are or even you know if the asset is so i just kind of drifted away from that you know i still own a bunch of d5 tokens but i don't get involved in it um and i think so that i think it's normal and it's good and it's healthy that people will coalesce around what they think is where they can move the dial or the biggest opportunity lies we're basically all just taking bets asset allocation bets of our time and our energy and our money coalescing around that building communities and getting stuff done perfect to see the ethereum community fragment like this actually makes it stronger because you're creating pools of excellence and large pools of excellence around um and i think that's great they're not fighting with each other they're just saying hey listen you guys do that we'll do this maybe we can meet up somewhere in the middle i mean that's brilliant that's how to create you know a massive ecosystem i mean that i think again just plays into the hand of the kind of metcalfe's law network effects if if if you're now seeing all these nodes grouped together and create these super nodes around core elements of this i think it's great so nine months ago when we last talked i think ether wasn't necessarily in a bear market but but bitcoin definitely had kind of center stage right um and one one of the criticisms at the time of the theorem or the bear case for ethereum was hey it hasn't figured out it's you know it's monetary policy we haven't seen eip1559 the time we last spoke um eth2 didn't have staking contracts live now it has all of these things nice i feel like people are getting the picture but now the bear case for ethereum has moved um probably to something else i want to get your opinion on this on the on the bear case for ether and ethereum long term and that's that a a smaller more nimble more technologically advanced let's say eath killer will take center stage and that ethereum doesn't necessarily have a competitive moat against say um a solana uh you know a terra some other layer one blockchain a lot of these are vaporware but some of them as you point out actually have some good tech and are interesting they make trade-offs with respect to centralization versus decentralization but again the bear case for ethereum argument would be like well do users really care about those trade-offs what's your take on alternate layer ones um competing against ethereum and stealing its market do you think there's going to be a power law winner in this space or do you think this is going to be all shared what's your take my take is the space is going up 100x and let's say ethereum is 90 of that space right now and it ends up being 60 of that space 60 of a 200 trillion dollar market is a lot more than this so of course it will not have its dominance over time like bitcoin doesn't keep its dominance over time it'll get splintered in different use cases other people come in there'll be great developments and all of these spaces will be you know a hundred times the size they are now so i think people still think of this as a zero-sum game and it comes from the early days of adoption because that's what networks are these kind of behavioral incentive adoption models that the cryptocurrencies are which is why they're so powerful at first it's like if you don't get adoption you can see it being fought out in like the hex community or some of these kind of more kind of risky not real projects they're fighting to keep them alive right so they fight against other people to get adoption ethereum doesn't need to do that any longer and actually not as bitcoin and one of the reasons that you're alluding to why so many people have started moving across to ethereum as an investment was actually the bitcoin community they kind of screwed it up um go into that more because they were too toxic there are some really smart people in that space and some people i really respect some people who say listen my view is i think over time the monetary element is what i'm interested in and i think bitcoin best reflects that and i think there's an opportunity for it to be a larger part of the global financial system so i'm going to focus on that i totally get it is there a probability that that bitcoin is money in the end there is a probability so i get that path and that's their macro bet but there's another group that was like how dare you look at anything else it's a [ __ ] coincidence we hate you all of this stuff right which is the same stuff we were just talking about with these others is they took they spent too long on a fight that was the past and they should have said fine you guys do that we're doing this we'll probably develop some smart contracts in due course we got the lightning layer this is all great look at the space is all going up 100x we're all going to get rich and we can change the world while we're doing it and probably sold a lot of inequality but they did the opposite and that was that i think was a huge tactical error because people in the institutional space don't like to see that and whether people like it or not institutional adoption is part of the story so on bankless rel we we try and emphasize the role of what we call the layer zero which you know bitcoin ethereum these are layer one blockchains but ultimately it's the communities that compose these layer ones that really kind of define the the asset right like they kind of define what the thing actually is um so and ryan and i have felt similar resistance from like the the deep bitcoin maximalists who like as soon as we talk about anything that's not bitcoin we we you know feel their teeth right how do you how do you do you have a perception as to what the ethereum community is like and how the ethereum community uh defines the ether the asset and the role of of people's portfolios do you have an opinion on this or is it just that you were tainted by the bitcoin maximalist i don't see it as much in ethereum yeah there's a few people who throw out a few comments on twitter you know some sort of eighth maximalist view uh you know and they don't mind baiting a few people with laser eyes and stuff like that so you can see that but generally speaking i found that people in the ethereum ecosystem are too busy building businesses to fight with each other or to fight with anybody else you don't even see kind of eth versus solana so oh that's interesting project over there they seem to be growing quite fast i better get on with what i'm doing here it's a very very very very different mentality and it's because my guess is the ethereum ecosystem is not a finished thing well bitcoin is finished really and that for it also becomes a bit boring and i know this is terrible to say but i understand the boomer coin thing because it's a bit like gold right gold's perfect gold doesn't have to do anything else it's perfect it's gold and bitcoin's perfect it's bitcoin i mean it's absolutely phenomenal now so it's a bit boring to talk about so then there's sovereign adoption that that is interesting um you know there's the institutional adoption i think is very interesting uh the lightning layer is a payments layer that's interesting you know there is some interesting stuff it's just not as intuitively interesting as the amount of innovation that's coming out of this space yeah i agree with that rel and like dave and i have joked before like um love we love bitcoin we talk about it often but we would not actually want to have a bitcoin podcast because i'm afraid we'd run out of things to say whereas with uh ethereum d5 nfts we just can't keep up quite honestly it's impossible to keep up with the inflow of content here we have six shows a week and we still can't do it we still can't do it but so i i have a question for you though on this um our thesis has been uh bitcoin's great it's really cool um hold it in your portfolio right ether is even cooler and it's going to appreciate faster um hold that in your portfolio as well um what's your take on that do you think like what's what's the landscape that bitcoin will inhabit do you think ether will grow faster do you think ether will uh flipping bitcoin at some point in time i think there's a serious probability that they will because a platform versus an asset 10 you know it tends just by the nature of what the ethereum ecosystem is it it it tends to attract more capital and have a higher market cap so yeah it's definitely possible um and you know the adoption rates continue at the rate that it's going it'll happen pretty quick so people should own a bit of bitcoin there is an argument that you should never earn bitcoin because if you play it through and look at bitcoin dominance or bitcoin versus everything else bitcoin outperforms in bear markets and ethereum and then going out the wrist curve outperforms even more so yeah we're seeing the risk curve here now which is some of the other the newer faster adoptions let's say salon and stuff like that growing faster than ethereum because they're at lower point in the cycle you know that less number of users price goes up exponentially faster nft stuff like that when you're going further at the risk curve so then let's say so that's the bull market you shouldn't own bitcoin because it's going to underperform and in a bear market you should own stable coins so in which case why should you ever own bitcoin this is what david tells me all the time and i've been thinking through this and i think again i am not saying this because i'm anti-bitcoin in any way shape or form i'm thinking through asset allocation and how you think about it properly when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matra also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless well it's so let me ask you this so last time we talked i was going to save this question maybe for for the end but let's uh let's talk about it now as we're talking about portfolio allocation so last time i think we got to the lightning round we asked you what's your allocation and if i recall correctly said um at the time this was november last year uh 25 gold and then uh three-quarters crypto and of that three-quarter allocation was like 80 to 85 bitcoin and then 15 ether at the time um has that changed and how has that changed in your personality ridiculously soon after that um my ether allocation started going up i sold my goals almost immediately around then maybe just before then um so it's 100 crypto and i have been for a long time now um my i'm now depending where we are today 55 a 25 bitcoin and then a tale of an equally weighted basket of a mix of d5 protocols layer ones um interoperability stuff um and then some specific bets in kind of social tokens metaverse and other longer term macro bets that i want that i want to express that view in and you know i'm probably i'm just following the chart very closely of the bitcoin eth cross and i think it's about to explode higher again so i may end up selling all of my bitcoin which is a weird thing and again i'm not empty bitcoin but i'll sell that fight you may set up you may end up selling all your bitcoin yeah i've been fighting on theirself for two months why why not i 100 crypto portfolio with the potential of having zero percent of bitcoin that is uh that sounds like you're in the etherium now you're telling me yeah yeah you get right into it i think you fit right in here that's for sure it sounds similar to some portfolios i know right david absolutely yeah no it feels like mine well so what's uh you said some things made like you're debating with yourself on whether to do that or not what's um why wouldn't you do that i don't know that's the that's the it's the part of the backlash from doing it and also i spend a lot of my time speaking to for no reason than to help the community is i speak to a lot of institutions sovereign wealth funds everything about adoption and bitcoin is the thing you know i get my sister and law into it and you know i get as many people as i can so it feels disingenuous if i don't own it you know i passionately believe in it so it's a weird thing that as an asset allocation it's sub-optimal but for the greater good it's probably the right thing to do so somewhere between not selling all of it and keeping some of it so i can still say obviously i've still got bitcoin but it'll only be five percent so something like that i think we just had ryan selkis from the sorry on and he made it did it in the time frame made a similar uh transformation to like more uh more eth um and part of the reason i think he mentioned he didn't sell more bitcoin is for tax reasons right just large you know capital gains tax i can't even use that i live in a tax-free caribbean island my god how nice is that wow everything is better than caymans we would be remiss to not talk about the just nft mania going on on ethereum lately especially in the last week it's it's uh heated up really really uh just quite a lot but it's really been going on for a number of months now and one of the narratives that's emerging out of the ethereum community is that ether is culture money is this something that you consider when when you you know allocate your portfolio the the relationship between culture crypto culture that's going on inside of the crypto world and kind of how it's largely kind of centered around the nft phenomenon which is largely based on ethereum yeah i'm not thinking it was an ethereum thing i'm thinking of tokenization allows for the tokenization of culture which is the the release of value from culture and i spend a lot of time in this space on a lot of things i've got a project that i'm setting up within this space uh and it's not to do with nfts per se i think nfts are the first manifestation of culture um you know i think the dow movement is culturally interesting um i think the social tokens is going to be culturally enormous um i i noticed that you know there is currently coalescing around culture as do you and a punk or do you own an april whatever it is some of that will last some of it won't last i mean a ton of the tail of that stuff will not it's just vaporware but that's fine everyone kind of knows they're having fun and doing it but culture as an investment is the big thing that's coming i can't express how big that is but don't forget for everybody music is the soundtrack to your life or sports or all of these things if you even think back what was i doing in in 2011 you kind of think back to what music it was on or what big events what spot they're all cultural culture is what is one of the things that drives humans or gives them it's one of the great reward systems humans have is culture and we've never been able to profit from it in fact just the brands did themselves that sold into culture but this way we get to participate in culture in a more meaningful way i think it's it's a revolution i know you just said that you don't think that there is a inherently an ethereum phenomenon but when you have a 100 crypto portfolio do you think by having a 100 crypto portfolio you are having exposure to the next evolution of of culture do you think the next evolution of culture is specifically a crypto phenomenon yes without question and obviously that ties into the metaverse because it's going all there as well and we'll be able to kind of live in our subcultures you know we we've gone from nation states and we we're splintering into sovereign states you know facebook is going to end up being a sovereign state essentially in all by by all yardsticks right it's got a leader kind of a mission a um a set of rules and and it's going to have a system of money and it's going to have to find borders because they're building their own metaverse right that's a sovereign state um you know arguably some of these dows are like sovereign states i mean what's the difference in a corporation a sovereign state not a lot the difference between a corporation or sovereign state is they don't have their own money but these do so it's it's i mean it's kind of mind-blowing right people aren't ready for the change that's coming people can't really figure out what this all means but the way we've understood the world over the last three or four hundred years is about to change because of the internet and then because of what tokens do to coalesce people around a particular cause or culture or belief or whatever well this this phrase culture as an investment is super interesting and i i don't know as i've heard anyone articulate it just kind of in that phrase and that simply but i'm curious what uh institutions think about this so you know your friends that run large macro hedge funds or big investors in the space how do you explain why a jpeg is worth five million dollars to them so i've i've written a lot about this and i've you know if i if i've spent time at the front of a forefront of anything in this space it's all of this stuff that i've tried to be a thought leader in it it's very simply if i go out of my office here i've got a bunch of famous musician prints on the wall and they're all signed by the photographer now the jpeg argument would suggest they're worthless but they're not because there are a limited number of prints signed by the author now if i'd bought the one that had the negatives as well it'd be worth even more so people don't understand properly anybody makes the arguments just jpeg doesn't understand authenticity and the human valuation of how we value authenticity proven authenticity and scarcity the same is true when people see digital art like people um which i think is phenomenal in a different medium and they go well this is nonsense well they said the same thing about darley jackson pollock they said the same thing about banksy you know when banksy came started graffiti art i was like this is worthless well guess what it's not um same with damian hurst same with andy warhol printing from the factory um limited replica it's the same thing so so i've explained to people people get that pretty quick don't forget a lot of people in the macro hedge fund space they've been around a while they've made a bit of money most of them collect something whether it's cars watches houses artwork and the richer they are the more art that they collect because there's nowhere else yeah there's a limit to the number of cars you can have do you know what i sometimes wonder what it is riley it's like people understand why culture is valuable inherently and they understand collectibles and they understand authenticity everybody understands this already if you're human growing up like uh you know whatever age you understand these things what they don't understand is how that translates into the digital like they just they can't seem to cross that part of the chasm but when they do start to get it and sometimes it just can happen with like maybe sending a a bitcoin transaction or maybe seeing the first nft that you actually want to buy well then once you do that once you cross that bridge you don't come back because then you start to fundamentally understand digital scarcity and then you just extrapolate that into oh now bitcoin makes sense now ether makes sense now all of these nfts make sense now d5 then it all starts to make sense once they understand that transition of scarcity into the digital what's your take on that i think that's dead right and look people will get it very quick again like you know i'm a big music fanatic and on my wall in my bathroom is framed program from live aid because i was at live aid right that has value and it'll have more value in time because it's scarce and it's a cultural moment in time that all of humanity came together everybody does [ __ ] like that you know and the younger you are the more you understand how this works whether it's from being on tick-tock or being on instagram so i think it's intuitive to most people i think what is not intuitive what is holding people back is the wallet experience experience is so bad i mean i you know bought my first nft today i've not been involved in nft not that i didn't like nfts or weren't interested i'm super interested i just it's not something i'm particularly fussed about collecting i'm not focused on other stuff right now so you know that having a punk doesn't doesn't feel like the statement i want to make whatever it is but you know just messing around between open sea and my metamask wallet and getting it it's like i mean there's gas fees associated with that so like yeah now gas fees are easy to understand right it's a transfer fee we've all got that you buy a ticket for an event but to have to set up a special wallet with a stupid phraseology that you have to remember to buy something it's like [ __ ] i'm used to a credit card yeah this has to change for this space to get to where we all think it's going because again one of the things i argue is if i'm going to send you a hundred bucks we will not know and should not know or care over what block change it travels it may start in xrp go across the lightning layer and then finish in something else it's irrelevant you know it's not going to be one or the other you're not going to choose anything i'm going to do it this way it'll be whatever the cheapest routing is same as we do with mobile phones right we call each other send each other messages easily but people need to be able to have the experience where it all comes on this that's where it's all going it's not there yet you know fascinating conversation with ian rogers who's the chief experience officer of ledger um ian's a super smart guy he built beats by dre um he built some of the first music apps he was then the head of digital at um lvmh the french kind of fashion and giant who understand culture you know people like him they have to design our future because we won't get there without them yeah absolutely it does feel like you're stepping back from a ux experience because there's this trade-off of course we're dealing with bearer assets i think i remember your last our last episode with you said bear assets are just a pain in the ass for institutions for everybody um but i gotta ask at this point because i know the audience is wondering so what did you buy what nft did you buy and are you going to like replace your profile picture is this going to be like your new identity tell us bizarrely enough and this is not driven of ego i bought the one of myself that you see behind in my office in grand cayman um in the real vision office which was done by the two quants um they've got this thing called the real vision bots you might have seen around on twitter and they created this this piece of artwork and i've got the print on my wall um and there's only five of them ever made and i don't think it's going up in value but i thought you know what i own the i've got the prints because they sent me the print i thought you know i should just own the nft only because i wanted to buy the nft see how it worked with my metal mask do all of that stuff so it wasn't it wasn't a future value punch and i didn't buy it because it had me in it i just bought it because i just want to figure out how it works sir it's nice yeah it's one of one a one of one there's only one of it i think there's five actually okay they've all been sold i think now okay yeah not going up in value until uh this podcast maybe maybe that's the case we'll see that's right it's called irresponsibly long which i you know i'm always happy with that coining that term that's a fan yeah no it's burned that one's burned into my brain for sure [Laughter] yeah i can't believe how many of these things i've burnt into people's brains pristine collateral that was me irresponsibly long there's a whole bunch of these i i don't know somewhere down the line culture is an investment that'll be the new one trademark ralph pal just that's a good one that's a good one all right i told gary vee this in an interview and it stopped him in his tracks like [ __ ] i've never heard that before that's exactly right yeah it's time maybe we can get another one out of you because this one usually gives people a ton of trouble um we all talk about the metaverse as if we know what it is but whenever when when anyone defines the metaverse everyone gives a different definition so rel in your mind what the hell is the metaverse the metaverse is where we live a larger percentage of our life in the digital world than we do in the physical world that includes augmented reality virtual reality 3d and 2d we are in the metaverse now essentially right we're chatting as if we're sitting in the same room having a coffee right we're so used to it now that it doesn't feel like a barrier at all that's the metaverse the meta versus when i can instant instantaneously pay you money and we don't care what rails it goes across that's the metaverse the metaverse is the fact that apple have now put things in your phone that ping five million times a second i believe it is that map out your everywhere you are and will create an augmented reality map of the world in granular detail that map of the world will help you navigate everything that is the metaverse the metaverse is not just the ready player one gaming world it's it's the digitization of everything where we spend most of our lives being digital and right now we wouldn't say oh we're we're living our lives digitally but we are right because the majority of what we're doing right now even though we're living in physical spaces we're actually concentrating and putting the focus of our attention in the digital world and that's how i think about it it's that entire nexus where everything comes together and becomes digitally fluid so um would you say what's the relationship between crypto and the metaverse would you say that crypto is perhaps like the epicenter of the metaverse because we can actually instantiate our digital assets or is that just the perspective of a crypto maxi like myself well we've got to be honest with ourselves that gaming existed without crypto but what crypto changed was proven ownership in a digital world so that was a fundamental building block that i think was necessary much like we could we had the internet but we didn't have this transfer of value mechanism so i think that they're one in the same you know we also use the term web 3.0 it's all basically the same thing it's that seamless digital integration where we don't need to use the physical realm um and i think that's and i think crypto is the only way that we can have ownership within that world we can transfer other ways but we can't have that trusted ownership which i think is the most important part of it all right because in which case it's it's nothing right it's not a world well i was going to ask like do you think that's um there's like a a socio-political sort of aspect of this right so you know so much sci-fi is dystopian you look at something like ready player one and it's a large corporation that owns everything they can bend the rules in their favor uh and as we're talking about the going into the metaverse everything's becoming digital whether we want it to or not we can try to resist change but it's inevitable humanity is on this trajectory and so we see facebook entering in saying they're going to become a metaverse company you talked about apple well these are big tech companies and what's striking is in the digital world apart from blockchain apart from crypto you can't really own anything an individual has no self-sovereignty over property without crypto or without blockchain so like maybe sci-fi is dystopian because like they don't really talk about crypto or blockchain and large companies or large nation states own all of these things do you think there's some social like social political undertone of making sure um that the the future of the metaverse that individuals have property rights and some of these basic guarantees is that important to your thesis at all i think we've all been too led by sci-fi and think that there is one metaverse i think the metaverse is a much more subtle total existence that's not based around one thing that's like saying we only use facebook as our platform we will choose which parts of the metaverse to interact with much as we choose which parts to be online but i do think it's extremely powerful that you can be a kid in ethiopia you can have an avatar and you could go to online harvard and compete and you can't have racism sexism or the fact that you're not in the same country and don't have the same advantages these things are game-changing for society globally but it also means globally we have to compete with a lot of people and there's you're gonna you're gonna onboard a lot of people into the global workforce but i think it's all good i think it's it's going to create gdp in its own right that is above the kind of gdp of the world of the physical world as we know it and i talk about you know like social tokens being a layer of value above equity i think the metaverse is a layer of gdp that exists outside of physical gdp and i've talked a bit akin to discovering the americas you discover a new part of the world that you didn't think existed and suddenly your entire view of the world has to change because now you can create more and you know people have this very high view of the world and you take a piece of pie out and it doesn't work that way the pie can grow and i think this is the pie about to explode does that change this issue that we've got with below trend gdp growth driven by demographics and a lowering of population right because it because gdp growth used to be um used to be population growth plus productivity productivity is going up population growth going down in almost every country but maybe gdp per capita is about to explode because of the opportunities of discovering this new world the other way i get people to get their heads around it is when i grew up russians were poor and then something magic happened around 19 about really really happened about 2002 is russians became rich phenomenally ridiculously repulsively rich in the f it was the fastest accumulation of wealth in all recorded human history because basically they just handed over all of the mines and the oil fields and the chemical plants to a bunch of russians and it went from state ownership to private hands um and that was new gdp it's brand new just came out of nowhere because you dug oil out of the ground and we're going to create a whole new metaverse and it's infinite in science absolutely this is uh infinite white space was the name of the podcast we did with a guest not too long ago i think that's a great way to describe it raul as we um as we start to think about closing we're wondering if you have time for a lightning round where we just asked some rapid fire questions you got something for that i usually do bad at this but let's do it oh no you do awesome at this which is why we we had to include it um let's talk about this there's been some regulatory fud recently maybe that's how some would describe it others would describe it as look there's some real regulatory threats uh and headwinds that are facing this industry what's your take on some of the regulatory stuff that's going on in the u.s is this flood is it real uh does crypto come out stronger or is this going to be bad for crypto my one word answer is noise it's just noise we know there's going to be regulation and we know that they have to adapt to this new thing into the system and they know that they have to get their fair share of taxes and there's no chance that they can get rid of it because of the scale of which it's growing it's almost impossible so regulation is going to be part of our lives for the next 30 years in crypto it will keep changing some will be bad regulation some will be good regulation but over time it's not going away and it's fine it'll in fact drive adoption are there any now i don't know if i can set up a business with a with a certain type of token and end up going to prison because this is security and it's ridiculous it is well do you have any opinions as to how crypto is going to touch people first like what is going to be the thing that really onboards a billion people on social tokens without question because we're all members of these communities some of these communities are massive global pop stars global sports franchises some of these have absolutely enormous communities of which people want to participate in um once you solve the wallet thing people will just very very naturally become community owners so does this mean everyone with the community launches some sort of social token and or nfd yes without question because even small groups of people can coalesce around that and you will have a number of these things and therefore you're participating in a community of which if you add value to the community the value of that token goes up it becomes a great behavioral incentive and it becomes part of your asset base it's really clever it drives really vibrant communities um and it's very powerful i think i know you spent a lot of time in the macro but do you have any other projects on your radar you know crypto related or maybe even otherwise yes i'm doing something i can't talk about yet in the in this community's uh token space um i'm working on that i'm also working on something else to drive the abilities people to ask allocate over extended periods of time because there's still not enough vehicles is kind of the etf we're waiting for there's a bunch of vc funds there's a bunch of things missing from the space that are people are used to from the traditional financial space so i'm actually working some stuff with that and there's a whole lot of yeah there's a lot of things i can't talk about that i'm working on um that the space just doesn't have yet and that's great and there's so much opportunity to do stuff whether it's with real vision with what we're doing or other stuff that i'm doing on the side and you know i think if i speak to any of you guys everyone's going to say god i've got so much going on why because it's exciting there's a lot of opportunity and you know one of you could be in d5 and somebody else is in nfts and somebody else is doing payment systems it's fantastic right that's what's so exciting well historically this industry has moved in cycles um every four years there seems to be a boom bust cycle bitcoiners believe that this is aligned with the happening do you think that that pattern of cycles the cyclical nature of boom and bust nature of crypto is that going to continue or is this going to change now that we've kind of elevated ourselves into the mainstream i think cycles morph and change over time um but humans by definition tend to be cyclical in what we do gdp cyclical credit cyclical uh equities are cyclical commodities are cyclical so there's something inherent within how humans get excessively pessimistic and obsessively optimistic than cyclical is it driven by the harven probably will that continue in due course maybe not but there'll still be a cyclicality and it'll keep it'll keep moving around you know if you look at the gdp cycle it used to be kind of every three years in a peak trough peak 12 pete trough then we got to modern central banking and it started being like a four year cycle and then we've seen us you know the last one was was you know a significant period of time 2009 until until 2020 11 years how about uh end of 2021 take us there so do you have any price predictions let's do uh well my bitcoin my price prediction has been eighth north of twenty thousand wow and that's pretty simple all i did is just map over the ethe chart to the bitcoin 2017 chart they work perfectly and it gives you 20 000 so you know there's no great science to that but it feels about right um i've also mapped the bitcoin price versus bitcoin 2013 they look pretty similar and there's a bunch of other ways of i'd do it with bitcoin with log charts and regression analysis stuff like that generally speaking i think it's somewhere between 250 to 400 000 with an outside chance of a million if we get an extended cycle we're talking the end of 2021 or are we talking longer term than that so 21 march 2022 something like that wow don't forget that they usually go up ten five to ten x in the last three months of the year you know so you know we haven't even got to the all-time high but let's say bitcoin goes up you know 5x from the 60 000 high plus 350. that'd be very normal rally for year end considering we're about to have an etf and if i'm right we might see the central bank pivoting to more printing they may not print more money this year but they'll start talking about it those two things alone are enough to drive bitcoin to 350. 5x from here you do think we're about to have a bitcoin etf then gary yes we're just getting involved with that question without question it's probably coming in october fantastic raul i wanna i wanna end with this question it's always a pleasure to have you on bank list we gotta do this more so many um bankless uh listeners said hey i love bankless i love rowell now you guys are doing a podcast together it's like blowing my mind so i think we have um some kindred spirits in both of our communities and you guys have grown a fantastic community um but i'm i'm i was impressed with something really it stuck with me at the end of our last uh episode when we asked you about hey the next 10 years and you were talking about how you think um like you know there's global inequality there's all sorts of political macro forces wage increases haven't increased it's going to be a rocky decade is what you said um i want to ask you maybe something hopeful about that um tell me like what is the most hopeful way we can come out on the other side of this rocky deck my view has become somewhat different those factors are not going away but we've got something else that i call the exponential age that's coming to the middle of this over the next 10 years we're already all of us dealing with this crypto exponentiality right we're starting to get a hedge around what exponentiality means when i say crypto goes up five x in the last three months of the year you kind of laugh but but you think yeah that's possible right that's understandable i definitely do that's what exponential means right we're starting to get a hedge around this but we've got all at the same time the largest confluence of technologies that are all into maturity ie the exponential stage that's ai robotics genetic sciences evs green energy um we have distributed computing power internet of things wearable technology there's a autonomous vehicles there's a whole bunch of these things that are game-changing literally we can't get our heads around what this all means and it's all going to happen at the same time now there is a decent probability that that changes the trend rate of growth finally and then there is another probability that if you stick any money into any of these things you can make some real returns some really gigantic returns um and yeah we talked about it in the crypto space so a lot of people i used to argue that the average millennial at 32 years old was pretty screwed because their parents got an opportunity of all-time cheap valuations of equities all-time cheap valuation of property all-time cheap valuation of bonds and credit they couldn't help but make money by just saving some money they screwed it up by borrowing money but that's what they did and they borrowed money because their wages didn't go up and i can i've proven that out over time it's it's amazing if you adjust households debt for wages and look at the total savings the total amount it's basically consistent they've just topped up their loss of purchasing power over time um but the millennials were faced with all-time record property prices all-time record equity prices all-time record credit prices fixed income prices so what was their marginal expected return was so low that they didn't bother saving then 2020 came along and it changed everything because you financialized a whole lot of them in one go and crypto is a lot of this opportunity and a lot of them are investing in stuff like arc which is these long shot future things um and i think that's dead right i think there's a huge opportunity for people both in building businesses investing in stuff and just the chance for society to adapt at a rapid pace but it's going to leave a lot of people behind because people fear change and if you're not used to it you're going to get terrified i mean look at the narratives that are going on right now vaccine anti-vaccine what is that about technology elon musk self-driving cars tesla the hatred and the love what is that about technology kathy wood i mean why people are creating an anti-kathy wood etf that's beyond me why technology what is going on with global warming why do people fear that technology why do people fear bitcoin technology why do bitcoin people fear ethereum technology it's this unprecedented rise in technology that is making us all feel like christ i can't keep up um and i don't want things to change as fast and that's driving societal problems on a scale and that's not going away unless society participates in change and benefits and but we're still fighting about a vaccine saying you know there's a benefit basically free for everybody and half the people don't want it because it's technology oh my god you're messing with my dna i mean but that will change over time people get accepting of stuff that they weren't accepting of before so what a fantastic way to end this podcast uh raul it's been an absolute pleasure thank you so much for coming on not at all and you know over at real vision we've got a bunch of stuff worth looking on a lot of these themes so you know if you go to uh realvisioncrypto.com it's free it's all there you know i've built a whole free channel to try and get across a lot of the stuff that i'm talking about in crypto to make it broad to make it understandable where there is no infighting of one thing versus another it's like if you want to find out about this well here's the guy who founded it and he's a really smart guy interviewing him you know the more that we all do this you guys are good at it too is the better it is so you know i think it's important that people go to the quality source of information so relevant crypt's a good place to go uh you know and i know the rebels and guys love what you're doing as well yeah plus one on that guys i i think the message at the end of this is as bankless we often say you have to position yourself for change position yourself for the crypto renaissance we're just entering into the crypto renaissance i think the message from rowell is similar position yourself for this exponential age that means positioning yourself for exponential change so some action items for you here today go listen to our previous episode with raul paul we will include include a note in the uh show notes where you can go click on that that's the first one the second is i'm gonna do a plus one on everything raul just said real vision crypto is phenomenal they've got a community now with a hundred k plus members you find out about cryptocurrency digital assets really great at video in particular and it's also completely free you can get a membership so go check that out at realvision.com revolution we will include a note in the show notes there too guys as always none of this
