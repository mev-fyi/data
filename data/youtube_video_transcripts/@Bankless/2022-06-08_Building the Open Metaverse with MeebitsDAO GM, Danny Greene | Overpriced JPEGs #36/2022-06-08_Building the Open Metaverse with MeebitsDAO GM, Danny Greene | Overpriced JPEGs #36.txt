[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm your host carly riley and i am here with a very special guest very special because he is my friend in addition to my guest today the one and only danny green he is the general manager of me bitstaux danny thank you so much for joining me today i am uh such a fan of your podcast carly the fact that i actually get to be here with you talking about me but stout this is a pleasure well i am a fan of your podcast as well i was just complimenting you on how talented you are as both a podcast guest and a podcast host so very excited to have you here why don't you plug your podcast real quick let's get that let's get that uh out here up front yeah um when i got into web 3 i was really curious about how um nft projects in particular and and general people in crypto were doing social good um in this space because there was so much of a backlash that oh crypto is being used for nefarious purposes and other things like what's the other story so i started a podcast called crypto change makers we've only done a few episodes uh we're not putting them out every week or twice a week like you are um but i'd love to tell stories about uh projects that are doing something interesting so for example we just looked at freedom squares which is raising money for humanitarian relief for ukrainian refugees um and a really cool nft project around that so check it out so i think we might close just talking a little bit about nfts in social good but the main reason we're here of course is me bitstau and and and really meat it's the ecosystem i think you're doing some really interesting things you commented earlier like i haven't had too many dow projects on the podcast before so i think we'll this will be an opportunity to get into a lot in terms of how you're structuring a dao that's not like an investment dao and what's working what's not what you've learned um and how to do what you're doing because i think meebit style is doing a really awesome job okay before we get into all of that though we do have to pause to hear a word from our wonderful sponsors it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces needs robust financial reporting performance analysis and the peace of mind that they are compliance ready gilded's nft ops is a one stop financial reporting solution for growing nft platforms gilded has developed marketplace specific modules to track the financial performance of nft creators including revenue tracking collection metrics royalty payments and revenue share customers of nfc ops gain full access to accounting tools and powerful apis for custom integrations that simplify operations streamline reporting and produce tax-ready data so no wonder why so many top brands like coin market cap gatecoin nifties and poap trust gilded to automate complex reporting workflows visit gilded dot finance bank list to learn more if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect po-aps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web 3. okay we're back danny you joined as general manager of me bits dao when and it's funny i have to ask that because i i was like somewhat involved in hiring you because i've been involved with me with stout in the past i'm not particularly involved now so there's no conflict of interest here as far as i'm concerned but when did you when did you join the general manager um i started um at the beginning of january and then was officially voted in by the dow to become the general manager in the middle of february okay and we had started talking with you about joining and coming on board last year even in like kind of late 2021. so all of that predates the the yuga labs acquisition this was on larva labs was still the owner of the me bits ip in march big announcement yuga labs bought out both crypto punks and then of course me bits let's just start there what has changed how have you seen the ecosystem around me bits and then how has the dow itself changed since the yugo labs acquisition well that week was so exciting uh it first of all was totally unexpected and the the price of me but started to move um where there was still rumors and i was like oh this is bs like i didn't believe it at all i was like this is too good to be true like you know coke doesn't buy pepsi like it just doesn't work that way right um uh but you know i think you had predicted that they're gonna be some acquisitions coming in the space and so yeah when it happened it was super exciting and it just brought so much attention to me bits um and necessary attention right this is a collection that is um absolutely incredible it's been about for just over a year it launched actually the same week as board api club which is just crazy a lot of people you know looking at uh mee bits coming out uh from larva labs from the crypto punks like uh as a second generation from crypto punks thought oh it's a 3d voxel character this is going to be the collection that really takes off and so i've talked to so many people are like oh yeah i went all in on me bits and missed out on board yacht club because they were the same week um you know so there's this history that already kind of goes together between these two collections all the way from the beginning and when the news finally came out that yes this is true that uglabs is buying crypto punks and me bits i mean it was so exciting um for me but holders and then they took the extra step by saying and we're giving commercial rights to all meebit holders and and that really changed a lot um it changed um what was possible and specifically at the dao um we were looking to build all these extra kind of derivative type projects and never knew if it was totally gonna be kosher based on the rules for the way that larva labs had set out um and so we felt like you know now the the floodgates are open the doors are open for us to be able to really move and create some really cool stuff hopefully some stuff they'll be talking about later in the podcast it seems like crypto punk holders had a very mixed reaction to yoga buying them out and me but holders were like hell yeah attention on our project long last like is is that how you would describe it as well yeah and ironically um you know in my conversations with you labs they've kind of echoed a little bit of the same sentiment of like you know we're going to be kind of hot hands off on crypto punks like the crypto punk holders they know what they want but you know we're interested in building utility for me bits because we know anything that we do me bit holders are going to get excited about and so yeah i would say that everybody in the meebitz community was excited about this acquisition do you think there's been a shift at all in who holds me bits like it feels like and again would love for you to correct this if you think something differently but like but before the acquisition and maybe this is still the case it was a lot of these ogs as you're describing people who were in the space early enough to maybe have crypto punks they got those mee bits they were in the space and tracking it early enough to even have a position on a board ape versus amoeba and um but that they're a little bit quieter like you know the punk's holders aren't as crazy as the board ape holders and that that was really true you know for for them but holders as well was that the case has that changed at all how would you describe the tenor or the tone of the community yeah um so i guess a little bit of history right crypto punks is essentially the first pfp nft right and and so the owners of crypto punks they either you know have been here from 2017 the very beginning they've seen kind of the ups and downs they've uh seen this space develop or they came in with a lot of crypto later on and and bought in right um so there's this already this kind of history and then the me bits there are 20 000 mee bits the first 10 000 went directly to crypto punk holders so you know a lot of crypto punk holders are mee bit holders as well but they maybe are more passionate about their crypto punk than they are about the moebit that they hold and so the thing that i've been most excited about um is the number is the increase in the number of of holders of me bits and that's what we've seen go up dramatically since the acquisition by you collabs uh so we now have over 6 500 me bit holders and to me that's a much more important number to follow than even the floor price right now because that means that there are over 6 500 people who are out there who are excited about me bits who own me bits um and and the increase of that number is something i get really excited about yeah that that's awesome and i think it speaks to that there was a bit of a shift right that you suddenly had it wasn't just and again i i may be oversimplifying it but just those sort of ogs who were a little bit maybe hands off themselves because they're the crypto punk holders who sort of have the like this is a collectible mindset to some extent okay let's talk about uh meebitz dao and it's so to speak reason to be i think people maybe not in the space though i think maybe some people who are in this space have a harder time wrapping their heads around daos that are like non-investment taos the non-investment dallas team or the investment dallas seems very clear-cut okay you want to go by the constitution you're pooling your money you want to go buy a crypto punk you're pulling your money whatever right you're flamingo dow this is a little bit funkier so tell me like what is the what was the galvanizing force behind creating me bitstau yeah uh we call this one we gotta call kai turner of course of course we gotta call out kai um i was gonna bring up kai the um so you know we call this more of a social dow or a community dow um as opposed to investment dao or protocol dao um and um the purpose of the dow actually you know goes back to the uh the launch of the collection so larval labs put out this 3d voxel character with the promise and the idea that this could be your avatar for the immersive metaverse okay and again this is in may of 2021 before facebook changed their name to meta like before really like the metaverse became the talk of the town and um and that was like a big vision but the question is like well how do you get there right how do you actually make this the avatar of the metaverse um and so a group of me beholders came together led by kai turner um uh to say let's form a dao of meebit holders to help solve this problem to actually help make these avatars metaverse ready and um and really to create the open metaverse right so the mission of the me bits dao is not about just creating utility for me bits it's about building and fostering the open metaverse and using me bits as a tool for doing so right and so there's this kind of you know other one him i want to benefit me but holders because you know more attention to the actual collection it benefits us all but there's a much bigger vision that we're that we're fighting for here and that is about decentralization it's about the open metaverse it's about interoperability and that's what i go to sleep and wake up thinking about every single day i want to get deep into the tactics there and and and what it'll really take for this this future to come to fruition but i want to just pause on i think a point you made sort of in passing which is about these were these were 3d voxel characters vauxhall that's the right term for the style voxel is like a cube as compo as compared to a pixel which is like not a 2d space got it voxel being being 3d basically is exactly the important piece and so these came out in may of last year may 3rd 2021 a year we just celebrated our birthday i know look at this space is so strange it's so quick it's only been around for a year nftnyc happened six months ago like we're doing it again in a few weeks like it's just mind blowing it should actually happen twice a year because this a year in nft space is actually like you know two years no i know it's it's 100 it's wild um okay so so they launched these voxels in these like these 3d characters in may of last year we haven't really seen too many others that have like come out like this what is the process of retrofitting non-voxel characters into voxel characters and then talk a little bit about what i don't know if you know the answer to that but then talk about how me bitstau is uh has been pushing forward on this this voxel model because i think that's a big piece of what you guys are doing with the api and other things yeah i think that the um uh like the most popular voxel nft pfp collection to come out in recent memory at least for me and someone's going to tell me that i'm wrong but is the uh snoop dogg you know vauxhall pfp right and that was designed specifically for sandbox so it was designed like with one specific metaverse in mind versus the me bits which was here's a 3d voxel character that can be your avatar for the open metaverse meaning every single metaverse experience we want to be exploring and be excited about and so i feel like cyber kongs they have a voxel character right yeah there's another big one yeah yeah of course and they've been doing some amazing stuff um and there's a bunch of other interesting 3d projects as well um that have kind of explored and we you know fluff i want to mention as well right um they created 3d characters um that could be used in in metaverse and you know we talk about like the meta gang like what are those nft pfp collections that are really thinking uh about creating metaverse utility um and you know in some ways we're trying to you know lead the pack in creating all different ways in which you can use amiib yeah i think this is an important piece to realize because i think we have this broad conception of like nfts and they're the characters for the metaverse and like these lines can get very blurred and it can just become this kind of mishigosh of like nfts and the metaverse and pictures and whatever but it's actually not that simple you know like your picture that you're putting as your twitter profile picture can't just become your dude running around the any metaverse and there are a number of steps there that are that need to be put in place and and sort of considered and i know me bit style has worked a bit with at the time it was larva labs to try and further that vision can you talk a little bit about what some of those steps are so people really do understand how much work goes into something like this yeah and it's going to get slightly technical but i think it's really important as we understand kind of what does it mean to kind of become metaverse ready which is you know we started with a vauxhall character and that's how these were designed but the first thing that the me bits dow did was to create different file formats for that character so we created a vrm file which can be used in webaverse for example um a glb file an fbx file even obj files like different files that can be used in different ways because when we think about the metaverse it actually means a lot of different things right i i break up the metaverse actually into um into like three simple categories right um there's the uh there's virtual reality right put on a headset and be fully immersed that's kind of the farthest off metaverse uh right now there's um virtual worlds which we're all very familiar with right uh fortnite is an example of a virtual world world of warcraft is an example of a virtual world these are obviously centralized virtual worlds but then you have sandbox or decentral land which are decentralized virtual worlds and and then the third category is augmented reality right augmented reality is you know the pokemon go right where you kind of are looking at your phone and you're exit and you're interacting with the physical world and the virtual digital world simultaneously um and the met when we think of the metaverse we're actually thinking about all three of these different concepts and how they actually interact together either distinctly or or altogether and the idea is like okay how can we make me bits actually a part of all aspects of the metaverse and and how complicated is this for an nft avatar character to exist in all these different platforms at the same time so it started with just file formats right let's take these 20 000 characters and create various different file formats and then the second step was to create an api that we actually could use that developers could use to um give access to meebit owners so that they could then play their like use their avatar in that virtual world or in that game and so we now have a bunch of different examples of other metaverse experiences that are using our api and then me bits owners can you know use their metamask wallet sign in and then uh use their meebit in that virtual world their game so right now what are what are me bits compatible with from what we would think of as like you know meta the typical metaverse you know sandbox yeah decentraland somni like whatever all all these different ones what what are the where with my meebit yeah you want me to give the the list of 30 different metaverse experiences that we're participating in well yeah just just that rattle it off the rest of the podcast i can go it's great even that's helpful so there's there's 30 metaverses right now where media bits are compatible are there any yeah and i'll tell you where they're not or it's like you've accomplished this it's metaverse right so there's two different things right so there's okay sometimes there's also a another step that's not just a file format but it's about rigging the the skeleton of the um avatar character specifically for that metaverse right and and this is part of the challenge right now we're so early in this space that there's not clear standards for how to build an uh an avatar right like every single metaverse experience is kind of doing it slightly differently so the skeleton structure and rigging of sandbox is actually totally different than webaverse or decentraland or anything like that so what we're trying to do is not only so an individual meebit owner who has the technical skills can for example rig their me bit for sandbox um but what we want to do is work with sandbox and with uh hugo labs to actually rig them so that any me bit owner can immediately just enter and use their uh me bit in sandbox for example um but there's a bunch of others that are are currently you can participate in so we just did like a a mini land sale with a a metaverse called blocks um and it's like a community-based maniverse where we have just 64 plots of land and this is kind of meebitz town right like this is all me bits and you can walk around with your amoeba in this town you can jump and you can play and it's also kind of a way to communicate with each other and so that's one example of uh of where we're playing i feel like there's a little bit of a debate going on right now about whether or not meta versus in the sense of like hey we are launching a metaverse or where this ultimately plays out or if it's more games that people actually want to play that evolve into meta versus where people are hanging out are you targeting games as well to have meebic characters in games how are you thinking about that balance between games versus hey we're a metaverse yeah so the me the meebit's dao's mission right is to foster the open metaverse and to be ubiquitous right meebit's everywhere right and so on some level i want to partner with everybody who is building a a game or some other sort of experience and say hey how can be bits be a part of it and then allow me bit owners and the community at large to kind of have to decide what kind of rises to the top right and is the mo so i i don't personally like take a perspective oh it's got to be a game it's got to be that right i want it to be a little bit of everything because there's space in the open metaverse there's space for all of it right so other side right coming out of what of you labs right this incredible um role-playing mmo uh that's gonna be coming out mee bits are gonna be rigged for that from the beginning right and so we are very excited to be part of that and we know that that's going to be kind of more game oriented um has hugo labs officially announced that now i feel like they popped on the speculation that mee bits was but no that's always been about oh no that's that's definitely so okay it's definite i mean what they said from the very beginning is that uh that apes mutants and crypto punks are all being kind of designed for other for other side and since me bits are kind of already a voxel character they have to specifically rig it right so it's it's a little different than they're not creating something from scratch like they are with the other collections they're rigging kind of the existing models okay that was there was there was people were sad that cool cats there was something about i guess cool cats not being kind of mentioned in the first slew of like characters that were going to be rigged for other side even though it was in the teaser video and poor cool cats i feel like it's just it's just keep on coming for them um do you feel like you're gaining a perspective at this point or is it still way too early on which model of metaverse let's say is best like you're talking about all these different kinds of rigging sandboxes different from decentraland are you like this one's clearly better let's go with this one y'all or it's too early to really know there isn't a best i don't believe in the idea of best like i believe in the idea of the open metaverse right where it's all about fostering creativity and that um there's going to be so many different directions right so i've already talked about um augmented reality versus virtual worlds versus virtual reality versus virtual worlds right um let's go even like deeper into this right one of my favorite metaverse experiences is a world wide web 3 or web game right which is both kind of a metaverse land and they're also creating games out of it um this is a 2d metaverse right it's it's a pixel based now this is interesting because me bits is a 3d voxel character how does that mean that we are going to be excluded from the 2d kind of retro metaverse no what move it's dow has done is we passed a proposal to recreate the entire collection as 2d pixel characters so that we can then play in the 2d pixel metaverse right um and that's going to be a super fun game we're also partner we've partnered with um jadoo which uh is another one of my favorite projects in the space um and should absolutely be on the overpriced jpeg podcast at some point i've talked to the jotto team they're great why don't you tell yeah tell folks what drado is yeah so jado um they're build building the mirror verse they call it um which is all about augmented reality right so um it they launched initially with jetpacks um and then they launched hoverboards and from the beginning you've been uh you were able to ride your like use the jetpack um with your meet it and like you know take off right uh with your meebit with your jetpack or ride your hoverboard with your meebit and where were you doing this like in augmented reality so you could literally like take a picture um or take a video of the street and have your meebit on a hoverboard just like going across the street right that's another example right and so this is the metaverse as well right this this it is the digital it's the digital world in which we're being created which can interact with our physical world or be entirely immersive itself and my vision is that meebitz is a part of all of it and there is no best it's just about different experiences that are going to be created and how can we be a part of it i love all the videos of me bits like dancing like there's so many good me bit dancing videos if folks haven't seen it where people have like put their me bits on their kitchen counter and they'll like do these wild dances and um let me tell you about another dance one that it you know another partnership that we have around dancing which is so much fun which is uh a group called metamoves um and they've created a whole different type of nft which is movement based nfts meaning that you actually own a set of movements as opposed to kind of a character and so then we were able to use the fbx files which is one of the files that we created for all the me bits and map it to these motion capture movements that they uh recorded in their studios and and that makes these me bits look like they're dancing you know you could do like the thriller dance you can do like all these different crazy dances um and have your your avatars characters actually map to those movements it's it's so cool and again that's wild yeah well what struck me about that is like almost this modular way like how modular is this future gonna be and i think there's downsides to this too but you're describing like you can buy a movement you have to pay money to buy one of these movements to get your me bit to do it i've heard of nfts that are uh sound nfts or voice nfts right so you could buy an nft and there's lots of weird complications with that of like if you're a grown man and you're using the voice of a young girl like you know there's really dark implications but let's put those kinds of dark implications aside and and think about like these the modular creation of a 3d avatar where you're buying the skin or the the look of the character in one place and then you're buying the movements it can do in another place and you're buying the voice and the sounds it makes and like that's just fascinating to think about a whole unlock that i hadn't really put together yeah yeah there's so i mean again we're set to such the early days of what's going to be created here so mee bits dao is about promoting the open red verse creating the open metaverse we're going to talk about governance structure because i think it's got a very unique governance structure and good for people to learn from anybody who's thinking about taos in a little bit but i want to stay on this open metaverse topic and ask what do you think are the biggest threats to the open metaverse is it meta what will keep this from going the way y'all hope it goes yeah you know um punk6529 is kind of one of the thought leaders in this space that i follow um and is uh somebody that everybody should read his twitter feed or her twitter feed their twitter feed um because uh i think he really makes he really like crystallized this for me that we're at a moment in time right now in which um it's a fight for decentralization right that there are um big tech big data big government that um wants to exert some level of control um and that is if this is institutional powers that want to retain some level of institutional powers and that what blockchain provides for us what it represents is an opportunity for individualized power um that you can actually own your digital currency you can own your digital assets you can own your nfts and that this is a fight for decentralization so you know what is the biggest threat to this is is siloed power that is not not interoperable um and that um doesn't allow us to kind of uh move beyond move around in this open metaverse right and so that's why i always talk about the open metaverse because i do think that it is something that we are that we are fighting for and it represents some fight for freedom i'm optimistic and i would say i vacillate between optimism and pessimism depending on the week of the month but i'm optimistic because the the economics are there for the open metaverse in the sense that like what consumers will want i believe is are assets that they can sell on marketplaces regardless of where they are or what platform they're on and that once people see that and understand that that's obviously what people will be drawn to and they will shirk platforms that don't allow them that kind of mobility and that kind of freedom and that it'll be just a case where the consumer will is too strong because the economic case for the consumer is too strong do you agree or is that naive and we're we're fighting an uphill battle um i think that people want convenience right uh it's you know it's why you know i'll pay for a streaming service right rather than like buy individual songs or you know um or you know netflix is popular right people will there might be easier ways you know even if you just think about like you know downloading like pirating music or something like that like oh it's just much easier to pay 10 a month and get spotify and i can don't have to actually go through the process right and so i i think that um it requires us to build right really good products in a decentralized manner because the institutions have tons of money and tons of talent and tons of reach and um they're going to be building stuff that is siloed in nature right and so the people who are builders in in web 3 um who really do believe in this idea of interoperability and decentralization i think it's just so important that you you continue to retain that um that idea in in in your building philosophy nfts i are a lot about social signaling and and you know identity everything's about social signaling the clothes we wear all the things we do and obviously there's a lot that gets made about digital identity and what do you think i'm trying to figure out how to phrase this like do you think about what it should say about someone if they own a meebit or use their meebit as their avatar in the metaverse does the community express opinions about this like how deep in terms of what am i signaling when i own a metaverse have y'all gotten yeah i love it i love that question um because it really gets to the heart of what i think is um the meaning and purpose of the me bit right um punk 6529 talks about uh the the power of memes right um and that the meme is the message he talks about the american flag um and and nike symbol for example as memes so not just memes in the sense of like you know cat videos on the internet but memes in terms of like what are those cultural iconic symbols that carry meaning um and that can motivate action and that actually have a belief system tied to them right that that's the idea of what actually a meme is and why jpegs on the on the blockchain nfts are so powerful because there's actually an emotional connection that can come from this digital asset that you can now own right not only because you're a part of a community if you're part of an nft collection but because of the message itself that is conveyed from that piece of artwork or from that uh from that collection so so so what is the message of the me bit to me it's it's everything that we're talking about it's the idea of the open metaverse it's the idea of decentralization it's the idea that there isn't one winner right um and also the collection itself is so representative of this it's a diverse it's a collection that celebrates diversity it's gender diverse it's racially diverse right like most nft collections aren't thinking in that way so when i'm thinking about building the open metaverse i'm not just thinking about what are the techno technological challenges that we're trying to solve it's also a value-based question like what what do we want the elbow metaverse to be who do we want to be included within it how do we want to be represented and i know people who own i know males who own me bits who use a female me bit as their avatar right like because in the metaverse you can choose what identity you want to represent and this as a collection me bits as a collection actually allows you to to to make that choice in a very meaningful way and to say something very powerful about believing in the creation of an open metaverse you say all this about me bits you get me pumped about me bits they were a very early collection they were the earliest as far as i know in terms of thinking about metaverse compatibility and and and being 3d army bits undervalued i mean of course yes uh if i'm allowed to say this is not financial advice but of course i think i think that mee bits are undervalued because i think that there's um there's so much to this collection there's so much to this collection i mean uh in in terms of metavis utility that we're building every single day and there's even more to talk about on that front um but let's take all of that aside which to me is actually the most important thing right like you can actually use this avatar you can use this nft in the metaverse right so many nfts i buy it not to use it i buy it just to be part of a community or something no no this is actually a usable asset right that you can actually play with and have fun with right but taking all of that aside i think that meebits are one of the most incredible artistic achievements um and again i i'm so glad that we are now part of the yuga family but i have so much respect to john and matt from larva labs who are just mad geniuses uh who created this collection i mean it is it is so detailed and i've been going through the collection for the last five months you know with a fine tooth comb and i find these small little details that are just so thoughtful i mean for example one what we're doing right now actually um is launching a derivative collection for me bit holders um called me kicks and it's just the shoes that the me bits wear and we're gonna launch that as an entirely separate collection um because i think the shoes in and of themselves are worthy of of of focused attention um there's over 80 different pairs of shoes in the collection every single meebit owner is going to be able to free claim their me kicks um put out by the me bits dow um and there's a way for to for us just to celebrate the collection and the artistic achievement of john and matt from larval abs so you have me pulling up meet it's now because i'm embarrassed to say i have a me bit and i can't picture what i know i could describe the pants miami bit wears but like i don't know do me bits have you're saying they have shoes right now and these me kicks oh yeah okay so it has a pair of shoes wow it is cute shoes what what kind of shoes let's let's do it i wish i could share y'all we recorded riverside and i think it's a pain if i like share randomly in the middle of a conversation so i apologize uh if you're on youtube but you go check these out um they are blue like kind of a light blue with like a gray base and then a white um like a white stripe down the middle i love the blue cool so okay so wait but break this down for us because these are actually this podcast will be launching january june 8th and i believe june 9th is when me kicks drop do i have this right so tomorrow what if you're listening to this on the day it drops it will be tomorrow that me kicks are dropping this is so cool so no matter when you listen to this even if it's like three months from now or six months from now or 25 years from now right like there's no end date to the uh the clean kicks collection right it is a it is a free claim for forever and ever and ever once the me kick gets claimed for them ebit it's going to be claimed right so it'll already sound clean secondary but yeah exactly will are these ethereum ethereum-based will these be like on openc yeah they have to be i guess because media so so tell me so can you like i mean can are we at a place at this point where i could like put this put my me kicks on my me bit in in a metaverse land yes exactly wow um and so there's so we're gonna give so there's gonna be obviously a video file that you'll see the your the representation of the shoes from your meebit right but then we're also going to be able to provide you with a vox file an fbx file and a glb file for each for your shoes and you'll be able then to go to webaverse for example which is a really incredible kind of totally under appreciated uh open source metaverse that's being created right now it's worth noting that they they're they're worldwide web which i think i heard you say in another interview was like okay a little bit of hubris there to name it to name your project that but the founders are are webb so it's like the web of right like two different projects don't don't no this is going great this is going really well yeah i love that i love that for me okay that was like either take the word like meta uh or take the word verse and you just like switch it out and that's what you'll call your metaphor yeah it's like it's like what's your stripper name you know it's like take that you know you can like okay well tell us about webinverse man there's so many follow-up questions that i i you know i have here the world wide web or web game web 3 that is the 2d uh pixel game pixel based yeah that we're talking about this is called webaverse which is an open source metaverse um totally building in public open source it is it you can they're building it in a way that whatever game that you choose to build upon it can be basically anything could be 2d it could be 3d it can be a first person shooter it can be kind of a from a 3d perspective right it's giving you all of these various different tools um we i really love this project not because it's the prettiest but because it is based on this idea of of open source open metaverse let's create standards so we can all build together right and so for example in webaverse you'll be able to take your me kicks and put it on your meet it right you can actually buy a different pair of me bits right so you can have a you can wear different shoes on your meet it in that matter so this is my question so the the me kicks the the shoes that you're dropping so for me i'm not getting the same pair of sneakers that my character currently wears or am i you will yes okay well it's a free claim for all me bit holders to claim the shoes that their meebit wears right so you have already that is so it's like you have a specific so that i can put them on in in various metaverses or so i could sell it and you don't need to and buy i could buy another pair okay so i could go out and buy a different pair of sneakers for my you know my character and now my sneakers could be available to other me bit characters okay i'm i'm tracking yeah in stage one that's what stage one is is stage one the stage we're about to enter stage one is or are we about to enter stage zero you can put no we're this is the stage one is releasing the me kicks stage two is releasing me pets and you'll be able to put the shoes on your me pet and then your me bit and your me pet can have the same shoes oh my gosh adorable so like mommy daughter outfit day or whatever what uh what is the timeline here so me kicks is go launching on june 9th and it's gonna be available tomorrow um yeah exactly um me pets is uh our next big development project um that i'm going to be suggesting to the dao to fund and then we'll work on it for the next four to six months and release it hopefully before the end of the year wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into the multi-chain universe ahead of us available on flo tasos polygon and of course ethereum wearable is the perfect place for nft newcomers profile picture collectors and experienced nft

have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto deciding which question i want to ask you next if i want to go down one rabbit hole or another let's let's talk about governance structure you know you say you're going to propose this to the dow and and hopefully get the fine financing for it maybe break down for folks how governance in me bit style works and it's unique and a little bit complicated would you say yeah well first of all the idea that we have a dow that's building utility for an nft collection that we don't actually control is innovative and interesting unto itself right um right so i i foresee like goblin town i guess goblin town a cco so it's it's a it's even more permissive but i'm like anybody can build on top like that better they better get themselves a good dow to drive that project forward i don't know how it's going to sustain this like six eth price that it's rocking right now anyhow side note continue i don't think it will but that's my own personal opinion um yeah right like i'm much more interested in what are those nfts that are gonna have true utility for the future right that those are the ones that i i'm interested in investing in um but memes are fun too right um [Music] so the dow structure um we have a two-tiered membership structure we have dao founders that each contributed one each to uh the treasury um there's a cap on 200 founders currently we have 180 and so there's still space for a few new founders to come in then we have general members who each minted a membership token for 0.05 eth um we have 3 500 members in the dow um and the possibility for 10 000. so if you want to join the dow we would love to have you be a part of it and you can still mint a membership token um that creates our treasury um and so that's what funds my salary and any of the projects that we invest in uh that benefit all me bit holders um for the most part so the way that the the the proposals work is um founders can suggest uh or propose a a proposal um i often do so with the steering committee which is a group of 10 people made up of both founders and general members we decide on what projects we want to pursue put it up for a vote and all of the founders have the ability to vote general members don't actually vote what they do is they choose a founder as their delegate um and every single month this gets a little complicated but every single month the general members can claim an mvox governance token um and then delegate it to a founder to increase that founder's voting power so uh basically you know we have this representative system the founders which is no more than 200 people are the ones who get to vote and all general members get to choose a founder to as their representative so my understanding of the initial ethos of this structure which again was our good friend kai turner who's who's brilliant and so thoughtful when he pursues things was okay we need to garner an initial treasury and we want folks who will pay an eth to to build up this treasury and to be our founders and we need them to have incentive for that and a certain amount of power and prestige for for putting up that initial capital but we also don't want this to be something where like they have too much power or or all of the power and that's where then you have okay if you come in as a general member you get to really tilt the scales in terms of um the more active founders then in theory should be rewarded and gain more power the ones who are actually really involved actually really participating it's not just about the capital they put up initially because they'll have more tokens you know mbox staked to them and they'll accrue more power in the system do i have that right yeah um you know i think that this is all an experiment right like all dows are um and um there's also a balance of like how much time do we focus on our governance or how much time do we focus on like building products and utility for me bits right doing right um i i actually don't think that we have the the formula perfect i think that it's it's a work in progress right and when i say the formula um again i'll get into a little bit more of the weeds here right so we have a formula that says that you know the number of me bits i own times the number of mvox that have been delegated to me represents my voting power right and so that means that kai turner for example who is one of the founders of amiibos dao he has 20 me bits right and so that is the maximum number that we've allowed and a ton of people have delegated mvox to him because he pretty much got the thing started so he's got like a thousand votes right um which can kind of like just totally sway tilt the scale yeah till it's the scales and so you know i believe in some level of parody right i don't want to disincentivize people who haven't been delegated mvox because they're a little bit more quiet i still want them to vote and participate and so i'm looking for what is the right formula of the delegation from the general members versus the number of meebits you have versus the value of owning and purchasing a membership token sorry a founder's token right for one east which is obviously you know a substantial amount of money um you know i think that we're still looking to figure out what is that exact right formula ultimately i think what everybody's trying to do is like make this thing run and like build cool stuff and like you know let's not get too focused on the government side and miss the bigger picture totally no and i asked that i was gonna you you sort of uh you you answered the next question which was gonna be how is it working because i think we're all just trying to figure this out and so i want to highlight this and i want to highlight the way maybe john has done it because again i know kai is very thoughtful and he didn't try and rig this system so that he would have some out sort of outside photos he approached this really trying to think okay what's a way to balance all of the interests that that that we're bringing together um and he actually identified there being an issue after he saw what was happening he's the one who was like oh wait i haven't used so much power yeah that's not the way i intended it and i think it's great you know for folks who do want to get more into this or who are looking to launch a dao or who want to be thoughtful about these things i know kai and probably you now as well danny have written a a quite a bit of documentation as to why you approached the way you did and they're all in medium posts if you go to the meebitstau medium channel you you can see all that writing it but i did think it's worth breaking that down because like i said i haven't had too many dowels on the show at this point and one of the reasons i wanted to have you all on is because there has been a lot of thought put into how to do this and we don't have the perfect answer yet and i you know in the same way that i'm i vacillate between optimism and pessimism around an open metaverse and whether or not we'll get there i sort of vacillate around optimism and pessimism when it comes to taos and and how they'll really play out yeah and i think dao is a catch-all term um that again is not necessarily well-defined um for example so a dao is an acronym d-a-o for decentralized autonomous organization we're not autonomous there's actually nothing about the me that's dao that is autonomous right it's deeply manual i'm doing it yeah everything we everything we do is because someone actually does it actually there was a period of time before i came on as general general manager where it was you know there wasn't any kind of hired staff and it was all volunteer and truthfully not a lot was going on it kind of like got really guilty as charged you're looking at one of the guilty parties here you know i was sort of thrusting in you know things love this because other things going on this is yeah yeah right and so you know it takes leadership we've ported this term if i'm not mistaken from d5 which i i called that out in the beginning like i think people have a harder time wrapping their heads around non-investment-style dowels because you've got these d5 dials that really can be run on smart contracts more so and are a little bit more self-governing and in the sense that it's like a smart contract that has a set of rules and and does its thing and if you're just investing or whatever like that's much easier to pull off than like we're trying to coordinate a bunch of people to like do the engineering necessary to create an api to rig a thing like of course you need human involvement in that and of course that can't be uh dictated by a smart contract so we've we've ported a term over from d5 that i think um doesn't always fit perfectly in in the nft metaverse space yeah so so it begs the question like what what makes it a dow at all right or is it what is decentralized about it um and i think that what is interesting or distinct is that um i have no financial control of the over this organization right like i make proposals um i'm not a founder even right i'm a general member i don't get to vote right uh i help the steering committee to put out proposals and then the founders the ones who choose how we spend our money right um they choose what my salary is they choose what the you know whether we invest in project or not we've had things voted up we've had things voted down and um that to me is what makes this interesting and different um as an or as an organization type right is that it is decentralized in that way and then the other thing this kind of goes back to the idea of the values that we were talking about earlier what are the values that open metaverse that we're building right um another thing that i think is really interesting and different about what we can do with daos is we're a global community right the crypto community the nft community this is a global community and so if you look at my steering committee at the meebitz dao which is made up of 10 people there are seven countries represented in that 10 people i have united states canada the uk uh switzerland estonia china and india represented among the 10 people right that where does that exist anywhere else in the world where you can actually have a a steering committee of an organization that no one's in the same time zone and people speak multiple different languages and yet we're all coming together with the same shared interest and passion to build the open metaverse really cool another place where i think it's dial has been innovative to to success and failure i think to the point and that's i think that's great you can learn as much by what's not working as you can by by what does work is the mbbt token and there's a lot that could be said about it i've actually talked about it on this show before because i i was still i was a bit more involved in me bits style and at the time when mbbt token launched so i was somewhat involved in that but what i love so much about it is it's fundamentally trying to get at this question of how can we allow more people to participate in ownership of me bits in a real way so fractionalizing ownership but not in the sense that people are used to which is like i own a piece of a crypto punk and if that crypto punk sold in its entirety i would get a bit of a return if necessary this is more like i own a fraction of a pool of me bits and i can actually be then use one of those me bits in the metaverse if i wanted to i i may have front run the punch line there a little bit but can you explain the mbbt token the goal and how that fractionalized ownership piece works yeah sure so um mbbt is an erc20 token there's a hundred thousand in supply um and the underlying assets uh owned by the supply of a hundred thousand mbbt tokens is 92 me bits um not all floor many of them are floor me bits but then we also have two pigs and two elephants which are uh more rare in our collection um and so first of all there's kind of that arbitrage opportunity people are looking for like what are the price of me bits what's the price of the erc20 token mbbt and maybe there's a way for me to kind of make an arbitrage here um we're looking to continue to build um value and utility around this collection with our partners at seasons who put out this collection and um one of those s-z-n-s yes c-z-s-z-s you got it uh s z and s um there's four letters um and so one one idea that we're proposing right now is that uh you can kind of trade it you can trade in some amount of mbbt for one of the floor me bits right and that would create additional interesting arbitrage opportunity um and then the other kind of longer term goal is how do we use these mbbt tokens to allow people who can't necessarily afford amee bit but find everything that i'm saying about the openmetaverse and metavirus utility and all of this stuff really really cool how can they still get access to amoeba and be able to use amoeba so we're working with our friends at rentable to actually create a mechanism for people to be able to rent the me bits that are in the pool um and when you rent it that would then put money back into the pool that could then potentially be used to buy additional mee bits or be distributed out to the mbbt holders um and it allows the people who actually are invested in this project as a holder of mbbd to rent them ebits and and be able to use them right and so that is really interesting and complicated it has to do with wrapped nfts um and being able to can you actually use a wrapped nft uh in these metaverse experiences like there's all these things that we're trying to work through to make that to make that happen but that's the ultimate vision is about kind of expanding the access to me bits for even people who can't necessarily afford you know a four or five or six eth nft and mbbt trades on these decentralized exchanges where you know there's liquidity pools and you can trade mbbt there you know if you want to track that arbitrage opportunity or whatever it is i know in the early days of it it was actually trading quite over value at one point and then it of course probably over corrected and then was trading under the value of the total pool of me bits and so it's there's some wild swings there uh it's the the wild world here um okay i wanna we'll kind of close here on a on a couple pieces sort of broader market questions and and a little bit of what i teased at the top which is some of the social good projects you've been following and in your background there what have you noticed as being the difference now that we're in this bear market is there a difference to building a dow or to building projects in in a bear in bear times is it better is it worse what have you found i just want to say thank you to everybody who's listening to this podcast right now and still interested in nfts despite the bear market i mean actually that's not the biggest thing oh yeah i think so why i don't know because the the building feels more substantive a lot of the just like hype just the chronically getting on twitter and being like oh okay apparently i missed out on something that was going to make me a millionaire like dope i mean and you have that with goblin town and things like that but the the pace of it feels different and maybe it's just like selfishly the relief of me as like a podcaster who's interested in both nfts but also like deeper substance stuff like i just couldn't keep track of the number of new projects minting and and i found that annoying [Laughter] um it just feels like there's more substance now the signal to noise ratio feels better i get it i get it yeah um i guess on my end it feels like it just feels a little quiet it just feels like um that some of the the energy got sucked out of the room right like that um that and i think that you know that there was i i love when people are like just excited about what's going on and when you know when the crypto markets kind of crashed i think everybody just realized you know that the party's not going to last forever like yeah that these are there are cycles to this um and um and i think that that uh we lost a little enthusiasm there i think kind of among the general public like in the in the like you know in the war room where we're building me kicks and meat bits and all these other things and a merch plan like there's a ton that's going on and it's like great now i can just focus and i don't have to like you know uh you know worry and keep up with every single thing um so i think that there's actually some really great building that's going on behind the scenes at least on our end i know that's going on with a lot of other projects and i think we're going to see some really cool stuff coming out um i also think that we're in this period of time right now where everyone uh is kind of gearing up for nft nyc and that that's going to be this huge hype moment for nfts and that a lot of the major projects are going to be uh showcasing really interesting things there um and so i think it's a all these things kind of at the same time right i think that there's some real building that's going on i think that people are being a little quiet about what's going to happen at nft nyc and um i appreciate everybody who's still here and paying attention and excited we should shout out what y'all are doing for nftnyc do you want to tell folks yes yes um you know we're not doing we're not gonna be doing like a giant eight-fest party well we'll leave that to yuca labs but what we did is we built a meebit mascot which is the meebot this is the the meebitz dao the meebits dao um avatar nft is uh one of this really cool robot and we've actually like contacted the company that like creates mascots for like universal studios and disney and i was like can you build me a meebit mascot and they're like what is a meebit and i'm like it's an nft they're like what is an nft i'm like it's a thing on the blockchain they're like what is the blockchain i was like can you build me the mascot they're like yes okay so we're gonna have the mascot in times square uh i hired a performer who's gonna be running around i hope everybody like gets a photo with amoeba mascot in in new york i think it's gonna be awesome love it so look out if you're here in new york look out for the amoeba mascot okay and then just closing with your your journey here really i think you have lived so many lives it's so funny we know each other you know reasonably well personally at this point so i i know you've lived a a ton of lives and i love how you've found nfts and if there's any anything you've learned from the social good podcast you're doing and talking to these social good projects about um what's going on in that intersection of social good and the blockchain yeah um i appreciate you said i live many lives like i i think it's part of my um i'm just interested in a lot of things right and so i had like a really hard time picking a major when i was in college um and therefore picking a career uh afterward um and so when i found web3 which kind of combines technology and entertainment and media and finance all in the same space i was like oh like this was designed for me like this is where i'm supposed to be being friends with danny is having to be like well when i was like you know when i in my five years in real estate you're like you spend five years in real estate and then like you know like the next day's like well you know when i directed documentary films for a decade and you're like how old are you one thing after another of like you also did this what it's been a fun ride and it continues to be a fun ride and i don't think of work as work i think of work as play um and i'm always looking for you know what's what's going to be fun to do and and and um and at the same time kind of going back to your original question like what's going to be meaningful and have a meaningful impact on the world right um and so one of the first things that i did when i went out on my own web 3 was to curate an art collection on known origin to raise money for refugees and this was actually before the refugee crisis that's been created by the war in ukraine where we now have over 10 million refugees um from that crisis alone um which is just absolutely like mind-boggling it's hard to wrap your head around um so even before that crisis we we put out this this really cool collection with 25 artists from representing every single continent because refugees is a global issue um and i was like let's you know let's sell some art and raise money for a good cause and we raise money for choose love which is a global nonprofit organization that helps to fund uh humanitarian relief for refugees and um that was really kind of how i chose to use my energy before jumping into the amoebas dao and hope to continue to tell these stories about amazing organizations platforms nft projects um you know just creative executions for how nfts and crypto can help do good in the world i think that there's just a myriad of examples i'm covering just only a few in my podcast um and i i also just love how so many projects um choose to give some portion of the proceeds that they raised back to a charity even if that's not the mission or the focus of the project overall they're like yeah but we're making money and we want to do good and so to me that's an amazing ethos of this space absolutely and hey just you know selfishly for the space it's great to have more of those stories out there to change the perception of crypto as like singularly bad or browy or killing the environment so thank you for that the podcast is crypto change makers and why don't you tell folks if they want to join the me bits now or like go check out more or follow you like give us the give us the plug yeah uh so i'm at danny green with an e at the end of green uh on twitter and please connect with me there uh join the meep it's dao you can pick up a membership token on openc or looks rare or anything or specifically just mint one uh from our website um which is meebitsdow.world and um i really hope to meet you at some point um and that mascot and and nyc you know in that costume i will not be wearing it okay i'm not going to be farmed that job out well danny uh a pleasure as always you're the best keep doing what you're doing i'm sure we'll have you back on in the years to come to talk about where we are in this open metaverse world and where meebitz is and as a me bit holder and a friend i will be rooting for all of it thank you carly thank you so much [Music] [Applause] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if
