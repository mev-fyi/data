[Music] welcome to thankless where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Shawn Adams I am here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more Bank less hey David how's things things have been absolutely crazy ethereal conference just wrapped up which was a great conference and this is actually going to be the subject matter of this podcast the the talk I gave at the ethereal conference called the product settlement assurances and the protocol sync thesis I really want to dive deeper with that with you Ryan and so we're gonna we're gonna focus on that this podcast so it's gonna be a good one yeah I can't wait I watched that live by the way David and somebody I think of the YouTube comments said get this man another Red Bull because you were talking so fast and you compressed so much awesome information in 18 minutes it was fantastic we'll include that in the show notes right that's out now isn't it that is out that's out on YouTube yeah and that's definitely the benefit of being a podcaster and also really prepping and practicing your talk I could just burn through I talked it Mariano Conte said that David talks at 1.5 X and got no time for ohms man I've got no time for ohms it's great yeah absolutely people probably don't have to speed up our podcast maybe maybe the portions where I speak they speed it up and but then you drop it back for you alright cool well hey before we get there we should talk about our fantastic sponsors today so want to take a minute to tell you about rocket dollar this is for our us listeners if you've got an IRA or a 401k its jailed inside of your brokerage that means you don't have good access to crypto the crypto you can buy in brokerages is going to rip you off it cost 5x spot price to buy if don't do that what you should first do is break your crypto out of brokerage jail set up what's called a safe self-directed I or self-directed 401k you could do that with a rocket dollar they take care of the pain for you I've done this a ton of folks in the bank list community have done this they've broken their crypto out of jail go to rocket dollar comm to get started with your tax advantaged crypto account that's rocket dollar comm use the code Bank list and get $50 off dy/dx is the leading and most performant decentralized exchange in the crypto space today dy/dx is a place where you can go and and make spot trades just you know buying and selling ether for die which is and it's also an extremely liquid platform so it's a really great place to do that but you can also margin trade and you can also borrow and lend I borrow and lend ether and something that the brand new is their perpetual contract swaps which have just released for Bitcoin and I'm a huge fan of this every time I see some new feature that uses Bitcoin on aetherium I get really excited so the dy/dx has really pushed forward the financialization of Bitcoin on aetherium with their perpetual contract markets think of this like bit Mex but using a defy app on aetherium a noncustodial app that doesn't have a centralized exchange operator and can get you all the things that you want to do on bit mix but instead on dy/dx so they just launched this very recently you can get up to 10x leverage with price exposure to Bitcoin with the underlying US DC asset so a little after you're done leveraging long you'll you'll get paid out in USD see really exciting new feature coming out of dy/dx and really enjoy what they're doing if you want to go and trade on dy/dx you can get a special offer for Bank list listeners you get 10% off trading fees if you sign up with the bank list referral link which is trade dot dy DX dot exchange / r / bank lists it's a long one so it's in the show notes so you can go there click that link go to dy/dx and get 10% off of all trades David let's talk about some big-picture stuff today so the first is this this has been prophesied in the etherium community for a long time it fine happened eath now has a CFTC regulated futures market in the US through an exchange called Eris X that's super exciting what are your thoughts on this yes so this is a really important area of progress that if you're ium needs to go through in order for it to grow into it what we want it to in the future which is this global financial system I view these two worlds as you know if yeoreum has its own world and it's becoming financialized inside of it and that's just defy apps that we all know and love but then there's the old world the legacy world where you buy Bitcoin either crypto assets inside of your brokerage account like you inside of your Charles Schwab inside of your your TD Ameritrade account which you can't do yet but at least two worlds each take steps towards each other and and this is a really big step for the legacy financial world taking a big step towards towards etherium having physically settled futures where like when the contract closes you are actually delivered ether the asset not just some synthetic asset that gives you price exposure is really important and so this is the old legacy world taking a big step towards aetherium and just the financialization of either the asset in general yeah I totally agree I mean we've talked in episode three about economic bandwidth and economic bandwidth being basically the the rate limiter the capacity limiter for the open financial system and of course economic bandwidth is basically price of eath market cap of eath the liquidity of eath so this ads is sort of a third engine to an economic bandwidth accelerator so the first is of course eath gets liquidity and value through crypto banks like exchanges like coinbase the second is all of the defy protocols that we talked about so much in the bank list program and now this third engine of traditional finance means means folks like Paul Tudor Jones the hedge fund manager who just announced he bought Bitcoin options can now buy eath options they're regulated by the CFTC and that's a that's a pretty big deal for that third engine the traditional finance engine there are only two crypto assets that's the CFTC has deemed as commodities and the first is Bitcoin they did that a couple of years ago and the second is ether and now we see us regulated futures of ether I think it'll be a long time before we see any other crypto assets get over the hurdle and be approved by the CFTC as commodities so it seems to me bitcoin and ether have a fairly significant lead in that respect what's your take yeah a hundred percent and an even more so on that on that same note it took Bitcoin eight years nine years to get futures it got futures at the in like January of 2018 if I if I recall correctly which means that Bitcoin you know got got futures at eight years old and if theory MC me be following Bitcoin same path but like sped up I doubled the speed because it's following in bitcoins wake where Bitcoin is really the thing that people think of when they think of crypto at least from the outside world but it's really just carving a path and making it really easy for aetherium to do all the same things that are necessary for financialization but at a faster rate and so aetherium got its futures in in five years where it took Bitcoin eight years and so you know think thanks Bitcoin for making this easy on us wait didn't you did you say something about that earlier this this week David about ether being like Bitcoin in 2015 yeah yeah I wrote a tweet that said ether if your iam is where Bitcoin was in 2015 except if Bitcoin had an abusive older brother that kept telling it that is worthless but it was pretty is it up the relationship between these two communities pretty well yeah there's definitely a contingent in the Bitcoin maximalist community that likes to tell ether it's it's worthless all of the time and they mean that literally by the way I mean that it's going to zero that's what they think let's talk about something else to you that happened this week I tweeted this out day because it is so cool like every week it feels like something magical happen in the bank l'espace in the d5 space in the crypto space for me last week that was RAC reppin the bank listt shirt on a livestream yeah that was really cool to see Ric I listened to him a ton in college and then it's since college for my music taste has gotten really old like Beatles type stuff but having him circle around he's coming on to the eat into the ether podcast so I'm excited to listen to that but he was on yeah he was on a live stream just being a DJ repping the bank listy and then people were in the live stream like talking about are you asking him questions about like what what are you into in the defy world and and what do you up to what like what about what you like about crypto and so he was talking about the tape token that he issued which are a hundred there 100 tokens and they're redeemable for a cassette tape a unique cassette tape and it's kind of just a way for fans to show their their their appreciation the it's a way for fans to signal that hey I'm a big fan of Ric I really like your music and so until on a live stream Ric was talking about his tape token right and he said like yeah so I issued these tape tokens and and now I put them all into the open market with this thing called you swap and it's all about price discovery right this this is what really resonated with me he says it's all about price discovery right like you let the market decide how much it's worth right and so and so I don't I'll just issue the tokens and and my fans will decide to buy or sell those things according to how much they value it and and the guy I listen to that and it was music to my ears man I was like this guy gets it this guy gets it and I think it's just a really great way for artists to connect directly with their fans and this is the entire revolution of peer-to-peer finance right like no intermediary finance the the world of music and artists has been so insanely captured by legacy companies that act as just the most rent-seeking middlemen that stuff like this I really think has great product market fit on aetherium where where artists can just go directly to their fans in order to in order to reward them for their fan hood and then also benefit financially so they don't need some record label or issuer or anything I'm a big fan yeah so here's a Grammy award-winning artist who sang stuff like I've been super into aetherium for a while he is a liquidity provider on unis WAP which we talked about in episode 10 he's also into compound in maker which you know that completes the book ends in our defy series like this guy's one of us he's he's legit going bank lists and he issued his own artist token on aetherium so there are only a hundred tape tokens in existence and the price on this went crazy I was watching while he was live-streaming it started at at 20 earlier that morning and they got all the way up to nine hundred and $29 per cassette tape so these are scarce digital assets redeemable for a cassette tape they're all issued on aetherium it totally feels like like we might see you know Kanye West issuing Yeezy tokens on on aetherium at some point down the road i just got like chills of like what the future could bring in terms of bringing mainstream to aetherium and bringing to to bank less so I totally agree with you is super exciting there was one criticism I saw of it though and that was the criticism that basically speculators not true fans are the ones snapping up these deals so you know addresses that purchase more than one tape token in order to sell them back to you to the fanbase what's your take on that yeah yeah I could see how that would be an issue and and we are at the bleeding edge of this right and so I don't expect you know when when if this if and when this gets adopted by hundreds of different artists across the world that we're using the same infrastructure that we are today like RAC is a backless pioneer just like the rest of us so he's experimenting too but I do think the fact that these tape tokens just skyrocketed in value what that means and and the fact that people are gonna make money off of this to me it's an indication that there is untapped value to for artists to get into write like that that just means there's more room for artists to do more of this stuff I don't think that we can really say that the price run from from where ever it started at was below $100 all the way up to $900 was perhaps logical there definitely might have been traders in there for sure but it's doing the thing that it was supposed to do which is to reward the artists for their for their work right for their product for for connecting to their fans and so I think that that is just a signal that there's plenty of room for more artists to do more stuff like this and the thing is like this really works out for both parties really well both parties being the artists and then also aetherium right so the artists want to they want to shill etherium because that's a new financial platform for them that we're a record label doesn't take 60 or 70 or 80 percent of the profits right the artist is to retain a hundred percent of the profits - whatever the costs of the cassette tape are and then the fans you know get to connect right into their into their into their favorite artists but also aetherium can chill these people - right and so you know you Ryan you and me are shilling our a/c right now like we're shilling we're shilling him and maybe some people are gonna go listen to his music and so it's really a symbiotic relationship between like the artists that's trying to shill a theorem and then a theory and people trying to shield the artists because they're using aetherium and so I think that this because of this mechanism this is just going to kind of turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy of success yeah I totally it reminds me a little bit of like early YouTube right I'm the idea behind YouTube is we don't need big media conglomerates to produce and distribute our media right individuals can do that well with the theorem you could do the same thing with assets and it reminds me of what we've talked about so many times in Bank less particularly episode 7 where we talked about all of the thorium scarcity game games this is just another scarcity game right so the entire crypto revolution basically the big discovery in you know 2009 when Santoshi satoshi released his white paper was digital scarcity right and Bitcoin is just one manifestation of a digital scarcity game and on aetherium you have all of these digital scarcity mini games that can be played this is just one of them but I think it's going to be an absolutely massive use case excited about it and we'll see which which artist goes next Hey if you had if you had a vote David who would what artist what celebrity would you like to see or like sports figure would you like to see start issuing stuff on etherion oh man I think Jack White would be a great candidate Jack right right is a great blues rock artist who is also spinning up the other like bootstrapping the world of vinyl records again after it's kind of died and so he's made some limited edition vinyl records and so he's kind of already one foot into the world of quote unquote NF T's just not through aetherium and and Jack White has been one of my favorite artists for a while so I think he could come next nice well if we're doing Jack's then vote for Jack Black gets me tenacious d release some interesting stuff alright man well we should dig into the episode David I'm super excited to talk to you about this about settlement guarantees and about this this thesis that you and I have been batting around for a while the protocol sync thesis as recalling it maybe we should start where you started in your presentation at ethereal and define what exactly we're talking about with with settlement guarantees and like why they're important can you help with that yeah absolutely and this concept is something I'm still chewing on to this day and so the really cool thing about food producing podcasts and writing and just sharing thoughts on Twitter is that ideas always morph and change and get updated the more you talk about them so I actually don't expect this to be the final form of whatever the hell this idea is it's just what what you and I are thinking about today and so each ideas go through an evolutionary process just like everything else so this is where we are today and hopefully we update you in the future with where we are going I totally agree this is a you know we call it a thesis because at some level it's a it's a it's a narrative it's a guess based on current information at how this whole thing will take take shape and play out but it is a thesis right and so along the way we can actually test that thesis against events that may actually occur so I think well we'll get into that in today's episode David it's like how folks can look for signs look for events that occur that actually start to validate this thesis because I think we're starting to see some already and I expect to see some more soon but it's it's completely something that can be validated and proved true or proved you know no hypothesis if that's how it turns out being talked to us about settlement insurance as David what are these like in the real world and then in the crypto world it refers to how strongly you can believe that a settlement is going to be settled permanently and in a way that you agree with in the legacy world we have these different payment rails right we have the ACH system in America we have this Epis in Europe and each one of these has a specific time to finality there's a time that once you cross that time window that transaction isn't going to get reversed ever now in the legacy world these times are really really long like the ACH system gives you a 90-day window to dispute a transaction the SEPA system in Europe gives you a 13 month window which is insanely long and then there's also like this eight-week no questions asked to return policy where you can just say hey reverse this transaction and give me my money back and then they'll do it no questions asked the reason why you can do that however is because these settlement assurances the promises that you have that a transaction isn't going to get rolled back unless it should be correctly rolled back comes from the legal system of each respective payment rail not the actual payment rail itself right so the pain relax as infrastructure but it's the court system it's the it's the the police force it's the court the the rule of law that's what keeps these things from how from breaking down and still having decent settlement assurances so the important thing is to know like the ACH system your debit card your credit card the SEPA system Swift payments they operate on legal system finality finality based off of a court court of law not protocol finality and that's where Bitcoin comes in back in 2009 2010 and Bitcoin invents protocol finality which is a huge game changer protocol finality is is great because it means that you don't have to use a legal system to get your settlement guarantees it means that you can just look at the Bitcoin blockchain and know that your transaction has been settled with a decent amount of assurances and you don't have to if they and you don't have to dispute that anywhere or you don't have to there's no central authority for you to go and say hey I disagree with this with this transaction the central authority is Bitcoin and that is really like the very genesis of what it means to be Bank list right settlement assurances is at the heart of this whole crypto system because it just removes the the need to have a court system or a sword a government or an authority some sort of centralized third party authority to say yes this transaction is settled and that is final and now you can you can depend on that Bitcoin offers you protocol settlement guarantees protocol finality and that's just a huge game changer okay this so this is super cool like let's dig into this a little more so what you're saying is basically when you say settlement assurances this is just like the guarantee or the assurance that you have when something but when someone gives you the money it's yours right like it's permanently yours and it seems to me in the early days right you know cavemen era before before civilization before community money that sort of thing possession really was the law right so if I had a hunk of gold and I wanted to set a transaction with you well you know nature provided me a way to do that because I could take my gold and I could give it to you and once it's you know transitioned from me to you then it's settled you have it right you know possession is the law in that case now if we got into a dispute and you said well Ryan you didn't give me enough gold for the item that you purchased we have a problem we could we could settle that transaction with violence of course right you could you know punch me in the face and get the rest of your money or we could get an arbitrator involved and you could sort of see why this legal system was invented the legal settlement system was invented it was to set the protocol set the rules for how settlements should occur in in meatspace in the non digital world and over time of course the legal system has morphed into you the the massive institution that it is today and we've somewhat digitized the legal system in what you're saying with sort of the ACH transfer systems and SEPA and Swift and all of these like protocols that essentially transact and settle money transfers via the legal system but what what bitcoin did is what you're saying David it was super profound it kind of brought us back almost to that the bearer asset days where without legal system and in the digital realm and without any kind of central authority involved I could send you Bitcoin I could take some of my Bitcoin if I had my private key I could transact it to you in a peer-to-peer way and you could receive that and once you do you have assurance that it's fully settled no legal system involved no centralized party involved that that's what you're saying right that this is kind of the the protocol settlement era where we've transitioned that this basic digital scarcity peer-to-peer asset transfer into you into the digital realm and that's new exactly that's exactly right and and not only that but we can also start to compare blockchains with each other they're given amounts of settlement assurances that they can provide I don't know if you remember those charts back in 2017 Ryan but it would put like three or four or five different like crypto currencies up against each other and compare them on different like metrics and it was it was just about like the the mania of 2017 and and trying to find the next coin that was going to to moon but it would always compare like this speed of the Bitcoin blockchain with this speed of these other block chains right and so that's right why light coin was invented right like light coin is like Bitcoin but faster so it's better and so like you they just took the Bitcoin code they tweaked the block times from 10 minutes to 2.5 minutes and then they marketed it as a faster Bitcoin but this going back to how this whole entire industry rides on settlement assurances just because you have faster block times doesn't mean that you have faster settlement assurances and settlement assurances in the crypto world comes from the rewards paid to the validators of each specific chain and so the Bitcoin miners which are receiving all at the time just before this episode they were receiving 12 and a half bitcoins and now they're the weight of a single Bitcoin block was 12 and a half bitcoins plus the fees being paid in every single block and that amount you know is is tens of thousands of dollars depending on the price of Bitcoin it's between like seventy thousand and one hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a single block so that's over ten minutes of time now light coin comes in and each block every 2.5 minutes is just two thousand dollars and so you know you get four of those and then you get $8,000 worth of rewards paid to the miners of that blockchain and that is really the strength of your settlement assurances when we compare these two crypto systems and so like Bitcoin already sweeps the floor with you know comparing it to the legacy system right like the ACH SEPA whatever payment rails like the settlement of assurances that offers my Bitcoin is just it it's a difference between existing and not existing almost between those two systems but then you can also compare Bitcoin to litecoin and you can compare like the the $90,000 worth over pay two miners over ten minutes compared to the 2000 dollars worth of rewards paid to litecoin miners over ten minutes and you still get really strong settlement assurances and the reason why this is important is because the amount of value that is paid to the miners of the Bitcoin blockchain is a measure of the settlement assurances for Bitcoin and so if you were to send a 1 million dollar transaction on Bitcoin which happens every single day you need to know how long do I need to wait in order to consider that transaction settled and really the answer to this is you should wait for the ledger the costliness of or the rewards paid to minors or the costliness of the ledger to match the value of the transaction because if if one block is rewarded with $90,000 worth of rewards to a miner but then you transact 1 million dollars like you need to wait for those that proof of work to accumulate it's its rewards incentives to the miners so that the the value of the transaction is less than the cost of mining all the blocks of that transaction and that's what you get your final settlement assurances that's where you get the game theory soundness that it doesn't make any sense for a rational miner to attempt to rollback a transaction because it's gonna cost more than the transactions itself did that make sense yeah I think it totally does right so so what you're saying is basically if I want to send that $90,000 with with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is so valuable and every block it produces is so valuable to miners you know it's not worth it to them to actually roll back the chain and steal your ninety thousand dollars right and so the net effect is Bitcoin can settle a ninety thousand dollar transaction in minutes whereas on litecoin that might take longer and we can scale that up right scale that up from ninety thousand to you know nine hundred not you know nine hundred thousand or nine million or some higher number and the reality is the more economic security that the network has so basically the more bitcoin is worth the more and the faster it can settle its transactions in a secure way and so other networks don't have that kind of throughput they might produce blocks faster but they're not producing settlement assurances faster is that right that's totally right that's a hundred percent right and and you you tapped on something they're like the value of Bitcoin the value of the native asset is where Bitcoin gets its settlement assurances because when the value of Bitcoin doubles well then the rewards paid to miners for a particular block also doubles and so if Bitcoin to X's will then the speed of settlement assurances also to X's like the it just layers on more security faster and faster and faster Nick Carter who coined the term settlement insurances in his paper always talks about Bitcoin mining or proof of work casting something in amber and so you know one block in its you're not really that embedded into the blockchain you know different exchanges usually require six blocks of confirmations before they allow you to use your asset on their on their exchange and that's that's just them saying look we want six blocks of settlement assurances like that's that's how long we've decided to wait it's in order to consider a transaction settled you know six blocks and so he calls this being cast in amber like the deeper you are in the blockchain the more the stronger your settlement assurances are and it's just a fact that bitcoin casts Amber faster than every other blockchain ever and and that's why you know that and that's where it gets as settlement assurances from and that speed of course scales up with the value of Bitcoin just like the amount and the speed of settlement assurances scales up with the value of ether on the etherium network now today aetherium is proof of work so it operates in a similar fashion as as Bitcoin essentially its settlement assurances are less than Bitcoin right now because it's market cap is smaller I mean I don't know I don't know right now but roughly ten percent or something with proof of stake settlement assurances change in some ways but our state are the same in other way with aetherium can you talk about that yes a proof of stake among other reasons why we are trance transitioning from proof of work to proof of stake one of them is the speed of settlement assurances that you are able to get with proof of stake and so with proof of stake after your transaction has been included in one a POC which I believe is six minutes you get the full weight of all settlement assurances that you are ever going to get upfront and so that's really the big change between proof of work and proof of stake proof of work layers it on overtime and so you get probabilistic settlement and so you know the longer your transaction is in the chain the more the more secured that the more assurances that you can have with proof of stake it takes the full weight of settlement assurances and front loads it once your transaction is in the etherium blockchain for six minutes you can be assured that it's not going to get rolled back unless somebody is interested in burning the value of one third of all staked ether that's how the etherium proof of stake system works and its really higher than that the the there's different levels of how much you can really mess with the etherion blockchain the lowest threshold is one third of state ether once you get to that threshold you can start to do some funny stuff at 51 percent that's where you can really mess with stuff so is it's it's much more like a 51% attack so once your transaction is in the blockchain you can be assured that it's going to be in there unless somebody burns 51% of all staked ether and so the etherium protocols looking between to have somewhere between 10 and 30% of all ether staking and then once that's once ether is taking say we have 30% you get the assurances that your transaction isn't going to get rolled back unless somebody burns 50% of the 30% of all staked ether so somebody would want to burn 15% of the outstanding supply of ether in order to roll back your transaction and that you get those assurances in six minutes which is really really fast this is why it probably seems like in the bank lists like program on the spot gets we are obsessed with the value of these assets like the value of Bitcoin the value of ether absolutely matters for the economic security of these systems the more valuable these assets are the more economic bandwidth you have the more settlement assurances you have it's you can you can settle more cash more value faster so it's the difference between being able to settle you know ten million dollars and ten billion dollars it's it's incredibly important and these systems operate in the same way they're all based on economic finality so whether it's proof of work with aetherium in Bitcoin today or whether it's is proof of stake as aetherium is moving to in the future the amount of security in the amount of settlement assurances you have all scales up with the value of the underlying asset eath I think a lot of people don't understand this I think they get once you see it it becomes obvious that you can't be obsessed with transactions per second in isolation you have to also understand that the weight of those transactions per second and the value of the underlying reserve assets that's why I think that the open financial system will be based on a reserve store of asset a reserve store of value asset like ether or and even like like Bitcoin because those assets will accrue so much more economic security versus other networks that don't have a reserve asset that is a store of value in our unit swap episode we talked about how you swap gets more useful as people use it right so liquidity providers provide liquidity then that enables people to come and trade and then those those trades generate trading fees for the liquidity providers which you know they that's profit for them and that profit incentivizes more liquidity to get deposited which makes that market more liquid which means that more traders are viable to come and trade inside of unit swap with less slippage and then that attracts more traders which attracts more fees which attracts more liquidity which attracts more traders this same feedback loop is in the settlement assurances of proof of stake if ether is 50 dollars then you get these settlement assurances of 51% of all staked eath and so if there's 30 percent of state eath then you fifty percent of that 15 is 15 percent of all ether ever and so if either is 50 dollars you have that amount of settlement assurances and you can't really send because proof of stake front loans it's economic security just throwing out numbers here say say that 15 15 percent of ether that market cap is like 4 billion dollars well if if ether 10x is in price well then that market cap is 40 billion dollars and so there's a lot more room for more people to come and transact on aetherium and access the settlement assurances that they need to not roll back their transaction and so the higher the eath price the more room there is for larger and larger transactions to come to etherium which just makes etherium itself a more vibrant and valuable economy which contributes to the value of ether which means the ether price is going to go up which means that can offer even greater settlement assurances and so the same feedback mechanism is also built into the settlement assurances consensus mechanism of aetherium people don't realize how big this is for civilization for Humanity because previously in our traditional system the only way we can get settlement assurances is by maintaining the infrastructure and overhead of a nation-state people with guns people who walk other people in engages basically all of that that tax system that that government system all of that infrastructure is required fundamentally to maintain legal settlement assurances what we're doing with crypto is we're able to get settlement assurances in a digital way in a peer-to-peer way without all of that nation-state infrastructure I mean we talked about this in our very first episode of Bank lists this provides settlement assurances without a nation-state it's a separation of money and nation-state it really goes to the heart of why I'm here on this Bank list journey settlement assurance allows us to go bank lists a lot of the settlement assurances of the traditional system of the the centralized body system of the United States government or the world comes from the fact that the United States has a massive military it has a massive military and an internal police force and just they get to control what force is the United States has control over what violence is and that is really the ultimate version of settlement assurances the United States government in the country and anyone with any sort of military that military is the instantiation of of settlement assurances for a government for a nation of state saying like things are gonna settle the way we want them to and that's why like so many countries so many third-world countries really do not like being under the thumb of the United States is because they have control over what things settle as not just with payments this isn't just for payments but also for laws and and basically anything in the world and so and bitcoin has its own military it's the energy wall of all the miners that prop up the system and aetherium and proof of stake also has its own millets own military it's a value wall and these are inherently peaceful revolutions aetherium is not going to knock on your door and seize your assets because they don't like the way that it's settled which is what argentina is doing with their military in their government it's the most peaceful revolution possible and it's one that i can really get behind yeah absolutely and i mean to be clear i don't think either of us think that these systems are going to completely replace the nation-state right there's a lot of need for I mean there's always going to be need for roads and school systems and healthcare and these sorts of things that the nation-state could do but what can humanity achieve when it doesn't need to base its settlement assurances on the massive infrastructure of nation-states which can corrupt them which can control them what if it had an independent money system settlement assurances property rights system that was independent of all of these things and maybe becomes part the base layer of these things I mean that's really what we're exploring here with Bank less and with crypto and I think it's profound you know before we get to the protocol sink thesis piece of it we should talk about two more of our sponsors David so the first I want to talk about is Ave Ave is a d5 protocol that you absolutely have to check out it's a lending and borrowing protocol on aetherium that means you can lend to it so assets like ether assets like dye you can put those assets into it it will magically transform those assets into interest-bearing assets recently they've just released the ability to actually take tokenize liquidity pools in eunice WAP and add those start receiving interest earning and borrowing on those assets as well so they're doing some really interesting things really innovative stuff developers you've got to check out their flash loan protocol go to ebay calm to find out more deposit your crypto and start earning or borrowing that's aave calm speaking of settlement assurances and payment rails the visa network is hard to argue with this size and reach and magnitude of those payment rails but most people don't realize that visa is just payment rails it's not a currency any currency can really run on visa payment rails so that's why if you are interested in expanding the Bank list world you should go to monolith and sign up and get your defy visa card because that is a statement that you think that maybe perhaps die should run on those payment rails instead of US dollar or government fiat the monolith defy card is a visa enabled debit card except instead of you know connecting to your bank account it connects to your smart contract while on aetherium and your die balance in that smart contract wallet so when you go to your store that your preferred coffee shop your groceries or whatever and you swipe your monolith Visa card a fiat transfer is executed but it ultimately goes into your die balance on your smart contract wallet and so if you are interested in perhaps visa offering their payment rails for crypto assets like die I think that monolith in getting a defy card is a great way to voice that opinion and so if you are interested in getting some of the economic activity of the world on to aetherium to go to monolith XYZ and get your bank list visa card and use different settlement assurances use these settlement assurances of the etherium blockchain okay so we've talked about settlement assurances I think listeners probably have a baseline understanding of what we mean when we say that what is the protocol sink thesis and how does that fit in here the protocol sink thesis we've talked about we've hinted at this before and you you describe it as the experiment that at least most of us have run at some point in our lives where you put different densities of liquids in a glass and then those different densities of liquids stratify and separate and the less dense liquids rise to the top and the more dense liquids rise to the bottom and that's we're using that as a metaphor for defy right and not just defy but crypto or systems at large things that have high density will sink to the bottom and we can measure the density of these crypto systems by their settlement assurances things that have strong settlement assurances that are also credibly neutral platforms will sink to the bottom of the protocols sink and the idea is that if you can depend on it then you are going to build on it and then you are going to make that thing heavy and you are going to force it to sink so things that are credibly neutral that have strong settlement assurances that are permissionless that allow anyone to build on top of will sink to the bottom and so like bitcoin is a great example of this you don't need a political system to back up transactions on Bitcoin and so bitcoin offers really strong settlement assurances which means that lots of businesses can come build on Bitcoin and make it really really dense and push it to the bottom of the stack so it when it comes time to it bitcoin is going to be under the ACH system is going to be under the visa system and the same is true for aetherium aetherium is a credibly neutral system with very strong settlement assurances all the applique all the defy protocols all the companies that are building on aetherium are building on this thing that offers very strong settlement assurances and that makes that thing very dense and falls to the bottom just like how the internet everything's built on the Internet and the Internet is the ultimate credibly neutral platform the Internet is very dense it's at the bottom of the protocol sink thesis and so are these very credibly neutral strong settlement assurance block chains like like Bitcoin and aetherium so David I'm looking at a picture of a glass of liquid from your slide deck and what listeners to kind of visualize this so this has all of these different liquids there's like a lamp oil there's a rubbing alcohol of vegetable oil water corn syrup honey and then it also has these these you know more physical more solid items like a ping-pong ball and a soda cap and dice and a popcorn kernel and what it's showing is all of the layers of you know what happens when you mix all of this stuff together the honey sinks to the very bottom that's the most dense liquid in the glass along with a bolt that sinks to the very bottom I would I was surprised with looking at this like dice is less dense than maple syrup so dice isn't actually floating like above maple syrup so go maple syrup go Canada well done I mean great settlement assurances in your liquid but what we're saying basically is that defy and crypto protocols operate in the same way so bitcoin is kind of like that bolt it will eventually settle it'll like pierce its way through all of the different layers it'll pierce its way through the the water and the dish soap and the milk and the corn syrup and make its way to the very bottom of this system and we think that effectively that's that's what's happening right now as Bitcoin is being financialized and monetize aetherium is the same way ether is sinking down towards the bottom and you can build things on top of aetherium that you can't build on some of the other layers because you have greater settlement assurances I tweeted this out a couple weeks ago it was basically like there are two people who can steal us DT that's tether on Tron it's the issuer's of tether themselves and it's also Justin son and in the Tron network Tron is not as credibly neutral as aetherium it's much more centralized there are block producers who can effectively reverse transactions reverse settlement assurances but aetherium has much stronger settlement guarantees that visualization of both the physical objects and the liquids inside of a glass that are stratifying I think that's really interesting because I think you can also say that there is two different types of things that will sink to the bottom of a protocol sink which are defy applications which I would call the liquids the substrate and then also the actual assets which are the physical objects and so like these different defy protocols offer these different substrates for these assets to run through and so assets both defy protocols like maker and neuter swap and compound have their varying amounts of settlement assurances their their different protocol densities but in so do the assets that run inside them and that also goes back to why we focus on ether so much because ether of all the assets on aetherium will always have the strongest settlement assurances on aetherium and the reason for that is because ether has this privileged position in aetherium as the native asset either in order to send ether to to anyone else or to any contract or to any other protocol to any money robot doesn't need to run through a contract it is and and Nick Carter actually talked about this in his most recent article on Bank list where ether in order to send ether you only need 21,000 gas but in order to send an e rc 20 token that you need like 54,000 gas or some larger number and the reason for that is because when you send a token to someone it runs through the ERC 20 contract now the ERC 22 contract is really robust and really secure and if that got hacked that would be or if there's an exploit found that would be a huge deal and so we generally assume that the ERC 20 token contract has very very strong settlement assurances but it will never have as strong settlement assurances as ether because either doesn't need to run through a contract in order to get settled and so that the the that's why I think ether as collateral inside of maker Dow or ether as collateral anywhere will always be the best collateral with the strongest settlement assurances and it will always benefit from that truth because it's a bit of its privileged nature in aetherium as the asset with the strongest settlement assurances yeah like I like the way you framed that as you've got the solids which are like the assets and you've got the the liquids which are like kind of the the defy protocols that you know the crypto banks that sort of thing so I guess I may be a follow-up question here is you hinted about at this a little bit but what what sorts of things makes and gives an asset better higher settlement guarantees and what sorts of things give a protocol like a defy protocol higher settlement guarantees I mean for that on the asset side credibly neutral issuance has got to be one right you know is that is that correct and are there others 100 percent yeah and this is a really important subject matter that we're going to go into before we go into that I want to talk about on the other side of things there are assets that have much less settlement assurances and these are tokens like W BTC or or you know real tokens from my company which we are any any tokenized security we have the ability to burn and mint tokens from your wallet by the way and so even though that there you have a real token in your wallet technically we could burn it from your wallet meaning that these settlement assurances of proof of stake of the etherium blockchain don't actually relate to things that are like security tokens on aetherium and that's just because of the way a token is brought up and so when you receive a real token from us you are actually depending on the central issuer for that final settlement not on aetherium and so that would make real tokens much more like that ping-pong ball very high up where you are still trusting like a traditional a legal system settlement for for your settlement assurances I think that's a great point David because what you're saying is with with Realty you have to be above the legal settlement layer you have to your assets have to float above that can't sink below that because the only thing or the the big thing preventing you guys from you know destroying tokens obviously ethics aside is the legal system you get in trouble if you did that yes right and and we also provide all of our investors all of our real token purchasers with the documents to proof so right like and put their documents right they're not they're not transactions on aetherium they are they are legal system documents with signatures on them and so you would take those documents to the legal system and that actually kind of speaks to the flexibility of the etherium protocol right like you can't have both the full spectrum of settlement assurances is possible on a theorem you can have the fully robotic fully trust list end of the spectrum but then you can also do you know the traditional stuff which is what Realty is doing on aetherium as well you get to have both okay so let's get back to some of the other things that those are things that that make an asset or a protocol less dense in terms of its ability to sink to the bottom but what sorts of things make an asset or a protocol more dense well incredibly neutral is certainly a very important part of it things that are applications or assets that are perhaps part of a for-profit business are likely to not be as dense as things that are built to be credibly neutral and just an agnostic protocol and when we had Robert leshner on our podcast talking about compound he said he was talking about how they have designed compounds specifically to act as a protocol act as a infrastructure rather than a for-profit company Robert isn't an aetherium isn't in defy - to build a application that is his own business that puts money in his pocket he's here to build a credibly neutral protocol that allows others to build on top of and that was really the motivation behind the C tokens right just using C tokens is a really valuable and easy way to build on compound without actually having to directly integrate with the actual application you can just build on the C tokens if you are using C tokens inside of your protocol or in your business you are by proxy using compound and the more applications that build on other applications like a lot of things are built on compound a ton of things are built on makers out a ton of things are built on top of unit swap and that's really why we took we picked those three protocols those three applications in our Keene protocol series that we've recently wrapped up that's because those are really dense protocols they have sunk down to the bottom of the protocol sink because a ton of other applications are building on top of them and the through line between all those applications is there credible neutrality to varying degrees like you could argue that maker isn't totally credibly neutral but it is still a it's both decently incredible incredibly neutral and a ton of applications build on top of it which make it very very dense and push it down to the broad and bottom of the protocol sink I think this is gets to the heart of what we think of an encrypted sure hand way of expressing all of this sometimes we say credibly initial other times we say decentralization or decentralized right and I think the word decentralized captures a lot of what you just said a lot of what we're getting at right because more dense protocols would would seem to have characteristics of being decentralized so issuance is decentralized it's incredibly neutral there's transparency so you see exactly what's going on you can anyone in the world can audit it there's some immutability it's very difficult to change you know it's not the governance is not captured maybe there's even an aspect of governance minimization so it's not sort of a you know shareholder governance plutocracy we're a bunch of coin voters can kind of get together and vote on something so those seem to be some of the characteristics of highly dense protocols and I think shorthand a lot of times in the crypto space we just call that decentralization we bucket it all together that word yeah and so this is a really parsing art that word and defining it a little bit better because the word decentralized has definitely gotten bastardized and has turned into something meaningless and so this is this is our attempt to put some meaning back into that word and now you can now you can know that when people are talking about its decentralized you can really say it's got strong settlement assurances it's down deep in the protocol sync that's really what we're talking about so I guess back to the protocol sync being a hypothesis right a thesis that can be tested what sorts of things might we see happen what's evidence that this thesis is proving correct do you have any examples of things that are happening now or we might expect in the future well I think we can say that any company that is built on top of a protocol that we would hypothesize as being AI proto dense starts to prove that thesis and and one really good example is the existence of Dharma Dharma is this company that is using two very dense dphi protocols maker Dow and compound to build on and to offer services to customers and so Dharma is Dharma is really a ui/ux company they make using maker Dow and compound and receiving interest from those applications really really easy in a really elegant way it's an iOS app it looks like it's a designer from Apple designed it so it's really gorgeous and getting money into it is really easy and then all of a sudden you're earning interest on in compound using die and so these protocols are hidden from the users but they're still there they're still being built on from by companies in the dphi space and the reason why why they're choosing Dynes inside of compound instead of USD C inside of some other lending protocol like Celsius Network is because of the credible neutrality like the USC C is issued by a central issuer and Celsius network is the centralized company but but Dharma used die inside of inside of compound those those credibly neutral platforms yeah I think that's a great example so you know aggregators UI interfaces monolith is another example argent is another example they're building on these defy protocols rather than kind of you know creating their own because these defy protocols are more credibly neutral you know one of my favorite examples of protocol sinc actually is something we often overlook and that's the existence of of crypto banks exchanges exchanges like coinbase exchanges like by Nance they effectively built entire businesses on top of money protocols like Bitcoin like ether by incorporating these store of value reserve assets inside of their trading pairs they built entire multi-billion dollar businesses right that's an example of protocol sync that the financialization of assets like Bitcoin and ether you know in getting them incorporated into into futures and approved by the CFTC that's all protocol synch wouldn't you say absolutely that's exactly right and so here here's one that is a perhaps a more bold prediction that if this comes true we can really start to lock in the validity of the protocol sync I think that maker Dow will have a will be able to scale better and faster than tether into the distant future now tether is antenna at makers I actually have a lot of similarities tether has assets and it's balance sheet it has real estate and bonds and then also a lot of dollars on its balance sheet and and maker Dow has ether dollars and Bitcoin on its balance sheet and so and there's these things are competing for scale these things are competing for how much total stable coins can they put out into the world because that's really the direct measure of success of these two protocols now my thesis is that maker Dow in the long term will be able to scale more than tether even though tethers already at like nine billion dollars worth of outstanding tether that are out as stable coins in the world and maker Dow is only at 120 million died so maker Dow has a lot of ground to make up but over the long term people won't be able to build on tether like there is huge political risk their tether has real-world bank accounts real world tangible vaults where their assets can be seized they there's tons of political risks and if tether gets too big those political risks might be very very large and and on top of that there's no way for other companies to build on top of untether you can use the tether token to transact but you can't build on tether in the same way that you can build on maker dowel and so may I can totally see companies like traditional finance companies like JP Morgan or any company or anything with it with an asset you can build on top of maker Dow get your assets into the maker dab protocol use the DSR the thing is like maker Dow is a credibly neutral platform and if that allows for companies to build on top of maker Dow without having some sort of political risk which I totally think is the whole point of the decentralization of mkr that makes mkr up maker Dow really really dense the more companies that build on maker Dow will make it more scalable the more assets in maker doubt it's just a pipe otha size that the assets in the balance sheets of maker Dow are over the long term far more scalable than the asses inside of tether and so I think that's really the ultimate long-term test of the protocol sink his maker Dow first tether yeah absolutely guys so you heard it heard at first a way to verify that as predicted by David verify the protocol sink by looking at tether versus die over time or other incredibly neutral stable coins like dye into the future you know another one that might be more near-term on the same theme which is is kind of a prediction is I think a major crypto Bank a coin base or jammin iris or something like it will actually add the dye savings rate to their platform sometime in the next year or so you know like a button where if you if you're holding dye in coinbase you just click a button and it's deposit your dye in the dye savings rate to receive X percent interest right super simple to to integrate but that would be evidence that the maker protocol is actually sinking a layer below the crypto banks themselves and you know collect pooling liquidity from those crypto banks and all of them could incorporate the dye savings rights as you said some of this is reflexive and it's a self-fulfilling feedback loop once a coin base incorporates the dye savings rate and offers better interest rates on your die then all of the other exchanges are going to need to do the same thing so look for things like that in terms of of proving the the thesis out when you see signs like that it might be evidence that the protocol sink is coming true we're actually doing that at realty people that use the 4matic wallet to store their real tokens inside the Realty website they're gonna collect their rent in the website and we're gonna offer them a button to submit it into the DSR and so that's what we're doing we're not a crypto bank like coinbase but we are doing that which definitely helps to add to the density of maker Dow and I also ask you do you think that if teather offered interest on your deposits that companies like coinbase or gemini would would latch into tethered we would integrate with tethers interest rate vehicle and instead of using the DSR would use tethers like equivalent I don't think that I think that's totally unreasonable I don't think they would ever do that and that's an example of the protocol sink yeah I agree I think they're a lot less likely to do that why because tether is effectively a product from a competitor it is not credibly neutral you know the rules for it can be changed by the BitFenix folks whoever kind of controls the the keys behind tether and it has essentially the the bank account backing tether lots can change with it so it's not going to be a stable coin that you know the coin base is the world of other crypto exchanges are going to going to want to build on top of and I even think that the the fact that tether and other stable coins are issued on aetherium speaks to the the interest incredible the credible neutrality of an asset system itself so why didn't BitFenix create their own private blockchain and issue you tether on top of that why didn't coin base create its own Lock chain and issue us DC on top of that while they issued on aetherium because it is the most credibly neutral asset registration system that exists even JPMorgan they have a you know JPMorgan coin on a private instance of aetherium you know evidence of the protocol sink would be basically JPMorgan starts to settle there JPMorgan stable coin on aetherium so their their private instance of a blockchain their private aetherium network starts to settle on the public network I think that would be further evidence of the protocol sink so you can see it in all sorts of ways these assets and these protocols starting to sink to the bottom if you know where to look alright so moving into a new subject we need to find a way to measure density of these different defy protocols right so with proof-of-work measuring the settlement assurances measuring the economic weight of every single block is is really easy you can just measure the rewards of every single block and that the rewards paid by a block are your settlement assurances defy is different applications are different there isn't a proof of work or or proof of stake or any consensus make it mechanism that allows us to measure the settlement assurances of every defy protocol and as we know in defy each different defy application will offer you different settlement assurances because sometimes they get hacked and so we need a way to measure these settlement assurances of every single application and so this is what I proposed in my talk and then we'll talk about it here is is the way that we measure these settlement assurances of every defy application is this unit called time value or time value locked and so I think we are all familiar with going to defy pulse and looking at the east locked in you know defy or total value locked and maker total value locked in compound now the time value locked measurement is basically the area under the curve of the total value locked across all of time it's the how much it really it's distilled in how much total value has been locked for how long inside of an application and so this offers you some levels of assurances of you know well this amount of money has not been hacked or not been drained or people have been trusting this application for this amount of time with this amount of value and so it's a way to poke at and proxy measure the settlement assurances of every single defy protocol and so it's it's really just a it's a trust equation and and the whole or the whole crypto system world is based in trust and so if there is an application that has a lot of value that has been deposited in it over a long amount of time you can have reasonably strong settlement assurances about that defy application you know Ryan what would have had a terrible time value lock score was the lend F me application which hurt which had three days worth of an a few million dollars worth of assets deposited into it if you were using the time value locked measurement of that application you would have known that that application is not at all very dense and doesn't offer a settlement assurances at all yeah Linda Emmy appropriately James I think yeah I I like how you put that because I think it is the time value locked is a measure of trust and the two variables that are most important is the amount of value locked that's a measure of how much you trust whatever you're putting your money into your value into and the time value how long that protocol has been in existence I think those are the exact right variables and even to just zoom out a second I mean that that's even true for something like like Bitcoin I was reading the Paul Tudor Jones letter is you know a hedge fund investor we talked about a little bit in the opening who recently bought Bitcoin futures and one of the his main points in the letter that's why he did this was look it's it's ten years old now right like it's it's time the liquidity is there it's time so the value of Bitcoin was large enough for him to take an interest in it and the time it's been around it's been around a decade now just cross the threshold for someone like that to start considering investing upwards of one percent of his wealth inside of it like there's no replacement for those things it time and the value locked inside of it are absolutely the measures of progress for settlement assurances and for trust in this entire space yeah I actually really like that I haven't applied that to the idea of time value into Bitcoin yet but I really like the that concept because when people like Paul Tudor Jones or legacy finance people with legacy money when they look at Bitcoin they don't look at the price to guide their decisions they look at the time value right they look at how long how much has this thing been worth for how long because that's really the assurances that you have that bitcoin isn't going to go to zero I remember back in 2017 everyone would say like you know crypto is risky it can go to zero we stopped saying that we stopped saying that all together no one says that anymore and that's probably because of the time value of these systems is turning into really a really high number there's really strong assurances that these things aren't going to go to zero because of their time value Dave there's one other thing that you mentioned your talk which i think is important then that's this idea that settlement insurances protocol sync it promotes long-term thinking what did you mean by that yeah yeah this is really important really important and I'm gonna take a step back and we're gonna go and compare the lead the traditional United States legal system the United States government and as a metaphor here and so there's it for those that don't know there's three wings of the United States government there's the executive branch which is you the president then there's the legislative branch which is Congress and then there's the Supreme Court which is the judicial branch and really these things correlate to different times to final settlement the executive branch the president has this executive order that he can just write and sign and then whatever he's dying is immediately law it's a law from the moment he signed it and but that doesn't have very strong settlement assurances in the sense that it then goes to Congress for the next two weeks in Congress is like let's think about this and vote on it so like they ponder the evidence they debate and then they vote and then that vote is then the next instantiation of is that thing law or not so either that vote will uphold it as law or it will remove it as law and then if then it goes to the Supreme Court if there is ever a problem with people vote the the vote of Congress the Supreme Court will again ponder that law think about that law and then they will rule with absolute finality this is true this is this is what it is now no one is going to make a business off of somebody's executive order if somebody's law is something is law for one day no one's going to start clamoring and start speeding up a business because they're putting a lot of capital at risk while they're spinning up that business when the executive order might be overturned in two weeks from the from Congress and then it also might be overturned in two years from the Supreme Court and so the idea of final settlement of laws but then also a value really promotes long term thinking and this is something that with the human civilization at large we haven't able to access this level of settlement assurances with our value and value is really the substrate that businesses and and people's personal finances run on and so I do what makes me really optimistic about the future of humans at large is that we are now able to tap into these crypto protocols like Bitcoin and aetherium and receive these settlement assurances that they are going to operate and these defy ProTools going to operate for a very long time longer than we could have ever had assurances before this and this long-term thinking is healthy long-term thinking allows us to to plan out for our future and design our future in the way that we want it to and so what I'm really optimistic for is that these these settlement assurances allows the human species to just move faster in a healthier way because of these settlement assurances because it promotes long-term thinking yeah that's a really great way to kind of close this close this out and I think you're right I mean this is why we're so optimistic on crypto it's it's not clear to me honestly that a lot of the technology that's being developed today is is good for the future of humanity I have worries about artificial intelligence and the centralization that that can bring with the public governments and large tech companies I have worried worries about biology and genetic engineering and what that could do to our species but the beautiful thing about crypto and the reason why I think both of us are here David is that these tools and these systems inherently preserve sovereignty they give us all another option a way to opt-out they're empowering technologies fundamentally by their nature and we need some of that it honestly gives me hope for the future to think about our species being empowered with this sort of technology and to engage in this kind of long term thinking that a decentralized digital property right system that's what crypto is that that gives us really cool really exciting I think really empowering and this is why I really think that the bank list movement is something similar to a nation-state I've always assumed aetherium or in Bitcoin as these cyber nation-states because they really allow you to opt out of your traditional subjective rule of law system and then move your value onto these things these protocols that allow you to have the stronger settlement assurances like the defy applications and the the etherium protocol is its own nation state that allows you to opt into it and use it as financial and financial and business infrastructure and so when Ryan and I talk about you know going bank lists and joining the bank list movement we're really asking you to put on your Patriot hat and where the bank lists bat and be a patriot for d-5 movement that's what really Bank listens to me absolutely it's it's aligning around a set of ideologies and a a purpose for where we want to bring the future of humanity all right so we've talked about a lot we've talked about this move from legal settlement settlement assurances by the legal system the nation-state to protocol settlement and protocol finality all the ways that that is a game changer and the stronger assurances that we get as a result we've also talked about the great protocol saying so this is the tendency for more credibly neutral more decentralized protocols to sort of sink to the bottom maybe below the the base layer legal system maybe below even the nation-state in some respects we can observe that in what's going on with defy protocols today as crypto banks and other applications interfaces are built on top of that we can observe that with the financialization of assets like Bitcoin assets like ether they're even being financialized in the traditional world of Wall Street with futures we talked about that in the opening a lot going on today this has been super exciting let's talk for a minute about actions so one thing that we want you to do is take a look at David's talk from ethereal it's probably a you know 15 to 18 minute condensed version of everything we talked about today it's got some excellent graphics and images we will include that in the in the show notes check that out as an action item the other thing I think you can do is watch for evidence of the protocol sink so it's a thesis you know we're putting this forward and like any good thesis or any good hypothesis hypothesis you can sort of see evidence that either proves it or disproves it we think there are some evidence that is is proving it now but watch for evidence either way in either direction David last thing how we doing on the five star reviews we're getting there but we still need more help those five star reviews really allows us to push the bank let's movement forward and so if you have not yet please go to wherever to you listen to this podcast and give us those five star reviews write us a review so that we can get the bank list gospel into more people's ears it's it's really a very easy way to help support us and me and Ryan and doing what we do with with preaching about how beneficial that these systems can be for the world at large you heard of here folks you play your role as a bank let's patriot and give us those five star reviews let's talk about risks and disclaimers of course eath is risky crypto is risky the tools and technologies we talked about today are risky but we are headed west this is the great journey this is the frontier we're going bank lists it isn't for everyone but we are glad that you are with us this has been episode 12 fantastic good dude that's great it is ability to control violence and have a monopoly monolith monopolist is not a lipstick monopoly the end having the monoliths Jesus Ilana little model it's a good with a mana mana list mono lips yes mama yeah the monolith thick
