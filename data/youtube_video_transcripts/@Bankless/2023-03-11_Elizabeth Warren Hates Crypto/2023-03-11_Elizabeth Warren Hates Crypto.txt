Elizabeth Warren says as the bank of choice for crypto silvergates bank's failure is disappointing but predictable I warned of silvergate's risky if not legal activity and identified severe due diligence failures now customers must be made whole and Regulators should step up against crypto risk I'm just saying Regulators putting undue burdens upon the crypto banking sector and then as a result of those burdens the big crypto banking sector fails and then she's like I told you so those holding Equity the shareholders of silvergate lost in this right that's how it should be that's how this works it's a risk asset no one that deposited funds in silvergate has lost anything so like a bank wound down in a correct and orderly fashion and Elizabeth Warren is like grave dancing on it
