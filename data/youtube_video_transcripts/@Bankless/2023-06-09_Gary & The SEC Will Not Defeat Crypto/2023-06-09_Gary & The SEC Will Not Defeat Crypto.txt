I mean it kind of feels like that because it's it's so bad that I mean maybe the only way up is up from here so yeah maybe it really it's like 80 eighth right it literally cannot be worse paintless Nation it is Friday which means it is time for the bank List Friday weekly roll up so grab your coffee because we're going to cover all of the weekly news in crypto with a little extra help today coming in from Australia we got Anthony cesano substitute teaching for Ryan Sean Adams today Anthony thank you for tapping in once again I appreciate you how are you doing sir I'm doing well and always happy to tap in when Ryan's getting a well-needed service and recharge yeah so some some software updates some some tinkering you know you know the deal all right it was a very big week in crypto this week Anthony as I'm sure you know Gary Gensler declares war on crypto uh a promising draft of a crypto bill um optimism Bedrock comes in uh arbitrum rans runs out of gas uh and a cohort of interesting ethereum proposals so I think we're going to get into all of the news and more uh and let's go and get started right into the prices this week so Anthony in the week that Gary Gensler declares war on crypto we dumped a little bit but then we recovered uh Bitcoin down 1.8 percent on the week ether down just one percent on the week what would you make of the price action this week because look at this big dip where everything like dumps but then like the coinbase suit comes out and everything just recovers what's your take on the markets this week yes so it's actually quite interesting to see this because this confirms a lot of kind of I guess talking points that I've been uh bringing up on my own show lately and that's this concept of a time-based capitulation in the market where essentially we already had the price based capitulation last year where things kind of bottomed out everything blew up you know everyone's leverage blew up we had the mass de leveraging event all the tourists kind of went away and haven't come back and what we should see now is literally just these opportunistic short-term moves where day Traders take advantage of any volatility that they can have because they they're starved for it right now and obviously big news events like the SEC swing two of the biggest crypto exchanges is is going to cause some volatility but it really didn't cause much uh it really kind of as you said it went down a bit and then it went straight back up really because I think the market is definitely um exhausted right now it and the the long not no long-term investors are going to be selling for this anyone who sold was just a Trader and the Traders are obviously selling shorting then they're going to close their positions and and it comes back up so I I really think this is just the clearest signal that I've seen yet that we're in firmly in that time-based capitulation where essentially the things just go sideways for a while uh until interest just slowly slowly comes back and and we start going up again eventually and start a new bull market so yeah it's actually quite quite interesting the signal that descends that I think may have escaped a lot of people especially people who maybe this is their first crypto cycle but these are the best signals to be paying attention to because this is the market literally telling you hey like I don't want to go down because I've already priced all of this in and like literally it's just Traders trying to to mess with the chart basically yeah usually when events like this happen people ascribe price movements retroactively but I think what you're saying and what I totally agree with is that the headline SEC Sues coinbase and secs whose binance is such a big scary High signal to the markets headline and so we can actually look at the price movements and say like this happened because of that and we can look at the price movements and see like well it didn't go anywhere it didn't it went down a little bit but what you're saying is it was just the Traders like everyone who's buying and taking exposure to crypto is unfazed by this and since the market didn't really go down you're saying that man we are in a place where anyone who's was going to sell has already sold and anyone who's left is just in it for the long haul so we're in that phase between like we're not we don't have a bull market we have nothing to be excited about but we have no further reasons to be bearish and so we're just crabbing we're just neutral yeah yeah and I would wager most if not pretty much all the the people that are in this still right now and are long-term investors they're probably not going to change their mind here they're not probably not going to stop buying crypto they're probably not going to sell what they have uh you know there are certain people I would assume that would be maybe selling some if they need to take some risk off the table or maybe kind of uh changing their their thesis because of this but at the same time we've known for a very long time now that the Regulators don't like crypto at the moment uh the SSC special in garagenzler don't like crypto so I think the fact that they actually made a move is a relief because markets generally hate uncertainty and Gary guns are making his move and basically putting it all out in the open and airing it out basically removes that uncertainty from the market and I actually think that people believe that this is going to either be settled uh and and there won't be any kind of I guess material impact in the long run or will actually get a positive impact from this where we actually get uh legislation uh written and passed and we actually get proper regulations put in place because I don't know how Gary genslow is going to go to a court of law and and argue that he has actually done what he's supposed to do to to quote unquote protect investors while there's all this evidence to the contrary uh especially going up against as I said like two of the biggest exchanges who have a lot of money and a lot of will to fight this uh I think coinbase especially Brian Armstrong and and definitely he's a chief legal officer Paul grebble who you interviewed yesterday or the day before uh I I think they're very ideologically involved in this uh and and it's really it for them about making sure that they can uh ensure that the SEC can't just get away with doing whatever they want which I think is is just based I guess at the end of the day yeah and we're definitely we obviously have more to talk about with the SEC and coinbase and binance but um the to me the fact that coinbase has a date with Gary Gensler and the SEC in court is bullish that is a good thing that is something to be excited about just one last thing on this whole like time-based capitulation thing because I remember when when we went through this Anthony back in the the last uh last bear market right between 2017 and or 2018 and 2020. we were in that 2019 I'm not sure if Kraken charts oh there they too lovely uh so like right now it kind of feels like we're right here and I'm pointing to the era where ether went up to like almost 400 in the middle of 2019 before it went back down to 120 before the covet dump then back down to 80. and so like to me this was like here is what we just went through from 2018 to 2019 and then 2019 to 2020 was the time-based capitulation part of the market and I'm kind of worried if we like play this forward we're like we're we're at this like local high and over the last year or so and it kind of feels like 2019 where like yeah we bottomed and then we doubled and then we went back down to the bottom again before we had a bull market and I'm so I'm kind of worried about yeah we are in a one-year era long high that's going to find like go back down just out of boredom not for any particular reason but out of boredom it'll go back down how do you feel about that so there are definitely a lot of similarities um between I guess the last maybe six to 12 months and 2019 I think on the non-price side of things so like the social sentiment and stuff like that definitely feels very similar but I would caveat the the price action of 2019 um especially on on Eighth with uh the fact that during train 19 especially during the time when Ethan BTC went up a lot and was a few months about mid 29 well I guess like early mid 2019 there was a massive Ponzi being run out of I believe China called plus token and this Ponzi took in a lot of Ethan BTC like many billions worth and it was a huge source of buy pressure now I believe that is the main reason why the price retreated so much and I struggled to see how eth is going to do the same kind of price reduction because I believe it went to 360 and then down to like 100 so whatever percentage decrease that is I think it's like 60 down or something I I struggled to see eth going down 60 percent from where did it go to like 2100 or something 2200 last local top we had so it could go down from here I'm I'm not sure but at the same time we don't have that that same kind of artificial kind of by pressure that brought us back up here and also eth is much bigger as an asset than it was in 2019 so the volatility is definitely going to be less so yeah as I said I we could definitely go back down we could go back down to like 1400 which seems to be a place where people like to to test levels because it's the old all-time high right it's the 2017-18 all-time high but at the same time yeah the Market's been extremely resilient in the face of everything over the last I guess six months especially yeah man it has been a while since I have heard the words plus token uh so yeah maybe the claim is that the high of 2019 was artificially pumped and perhaps even the low of 2023 2022 was artificially low because of uh the uh FTX and all of the The Leverage of three hours Capital et cetera okay cool all right moving on to uh something I know that excites both you and me uh this validator queue is up only if we want to look at charts that are up and to the right you the validator queue is the one to look at um there are now 700 000 validators coming 600 000 active and a hundred thousand waiting to come into the network uh that is a wait time of 44 days 20 hours which is I mean it was all-time highs last week it was at all-time highs the week before it's all-time highs this week uh and of course the execue is just zero so you are free to leave each staking but to get in 44 hours 20 days what do you get where do you make at this Anthony yeah I mean I honestly as bullish as I am on Eve staking I didn't expect there to be this big of a queue so so quickly I mean we are not that far from chappella or if uh staking withdrawals being live it's it's almost been two months now since they went live and wow those two months have gone by very quickly uh but the fact that we're already at um like 95 000 pending validators with you know 44 days of waiting around here for to clear that queue and it's just been up only with with basically besides Kraken withdrawing and a few other withdrawals here and there after Chapala went live we haven't really seen any withdrawals and uh it has definitely surprised me in a very good way obviously and I think that it's kind of a bit frustrating for me because I want to spin up some more validators and I'm like I still do it but then I'm like ugh I remember the days of not having to wait even like a day to spin it up like um for 45 days yeah yeah so so basically uh but but there are other ways to to obviously get into staking as well I believe some of the lsds like front the yield for you anyway when before they kind of activate the validator but that you know there are different ways to do this but I think that seeing it being up only like this just really validates a lot of people's thesis is around withdrawals being a nasty risking event and being incredibly bullish instead of bearish and it's just funny to see how wrong the Bears were about that that kind of uh withdrawal uh upgrade got ethereum ethereum Bearer is always wrong always wrong yeah it is a trend it reminds me I was saying this last week with Ryan like we were all bullish on the burn uh pre eip1559 and then EIP fit 1559 came in and it was burning way more than we all thought that it would and now the same thing is happening with staking it's like we knew that we thought the ethereum both thought that it would be a de-risking event we didn't realize to what degree it would just open up the floodgates for so much ether to come in and started I think like once it once it became slightly bigger than expected that started to become a medic it's like oh everyone's taking look at look at how many people's taking maybe maybe I should stake and it was big enough to the point where it turned into a meme and now everyone's like oh everyone else is taking I guess I'll just follow the herd and now everyone is staking which I think is like of all memes to get behind that's a great one mm-hmm definitely yeah it's it's just great marketing because everyone's talking about if staking now and people are understanding that you can get that really nice real yield uh on each staking because obviously there is the issuance part of of it of the rewards but there's also the execution layer Awards which are fees and Mev that's actual real money that's being spent by Network participants that go to validators so yeah I think people finally woke up to to eat staking moving on to some stats here I thought this was pretty interesting since we are in June halfway through the year I wanted to pull out some uh centralized exchange volume stats so starting the week uh coinbase was at 47 of United States trading volume 47.5 percent now it's actually down to 38 so coinbase has actually lost 20 percent of United States market share uh Kraken is at 14.8 to start the year and it's actually up to 22 so it's up 50 on the year and Anthony question to you but number three United States volume crypto exchange lmax digital what the hell is lmax digital I have never every time I ever hear about them is on the Block because they're they're their headline sponsor you can actually see on the left hand side of your screen there it's got lmax has their logo they're all over the block as a sponsor I've never used the exchange I don't really know anyone that uses it but yeah I mean it seems that their volumes are pretty big um yeah yeah okay all right I've never never heard of it uh you can see up here's this FTX is going to zero Scopes to zero this goes to zero obviously of course yeah um Pop Quiz uh what percentage do you think Gemini is at oh it can't be that much I know you can yeah but it's pretty small it's way smaller than I thought it would be it is at one percent of United States trading volume I did not realize it was going to be that little yeah I mean I feel like Gemini has always been the just the very small kind of not really talked about that much exchange uh or us-based exchange they they do make a lot of waves I think because of the fact that um the Winklevoss twins are the you know the founders of it and they're pretty famous and they had their gusd stable coin but that didn't really go anywhere so I'm not I'm not surprised by the the lack of volumes there especially given that they I believe were affected a lot by the stuff that happened with Barry silbert and his different companies like dcg and stuff like that so yeah I I do feel like the that's not surprising but it might be surprising to to people generally though yeah binance us volume started the year at just about nine percent United States market share currently coming in at just seven percent and I expect that to approach zero next month because of the sec's uh approved request to freeze all of binance assets which is actually where we are going to get to next we're going to talk about SEC suing binance and coinbase we're going to talk about the a promising new crypto Bill inside the United States and also this cool uh proposal that was put out on the eth Research Forum to increase the maximum balance of each per validator allowing us to go above 32. I know Anthony's probably got his finger on the pulse of that so we're going to talk about all of that and more but first I want to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible

don't need more uh digital currency we already have digital currency it's called the US dollar it's called the Euro it's called the Yen they're all digital right now we already have digital Investments and you you have digital you have entrepreneurs representing digital Investments on this program all day long and it's it's whether it's the big tech companies the automobile companies uh you name it It's All Digital right now the investing world what do you think about that Anthony oh man he just really revealed his true intentions huh it seems like his true intentions for crypto is to basically effectively ban it in the US because he seems to personally not like crypto which oh man which is just ridiculous because uh at a bureaucrat like this shouldn't have the power to do that let alone be able to just openly say that and basically try to impart his own views on an entire industry uh it's ridiculous and honestly I believe at this point he should resign uh given not only what he said here but a lot of the stuff that he's been doing uh but unfortunately due to politics I don't think that's that's going to happen because uh the Democrats don't want to have their um chair the SEC chair that they appointed resigned because it would look really bad on on them but generally yeah him saying this is literally just him being like Oh well I'm gonna drop the facade now and I'm basically going to tell the world what I really think yeah that's that's exactly what uh Jake stravinski's taking was it's like uh he has been operating on by like a veil of obfuscation and uncertainty and unclarity and now with suing coinbase and binance after doing the whole thing like coinbase you're totally allowed to go public you're totally fine and then suing them later after the fact that's exactly what Jake said too is like he's just now revealing his true intention is his true colors even though like we all we all kind of knew it it was still just like a gut gut feeling that we knew it and now I feel like everyone has like the strong Assurance is like no this this is Gary and he's being a a rogue Tyrant so just to recap the news bankless have done four shows on this this last week so uh we'll just recap this really quickly SEC has sued binance and CZ on allegations of violating Federal Securities Law failure to register as a clearing agency failure to register as a broker and failure to register as an exchange staking Securities and staking as a service or also implicated so the the um uh the the staking service provided by binance us was deemed security tokens including Solana cardano Matic cot algo filecoin Adam sand axi infinity and Mana were deemed as Securities interestingly and unique to the binance case was that CZ and binance uh were charged with commingling funds so a customer's assets were put through a legal entity that CZ owned and controlled called Sigma chain and so that is unique to the binance case that is just not something that is in the coinbase case that we're going to get to specifically interestingly also busd was named as a security buse the stablecoin and using the customer funds that was funneled without customers permission apparently over 20 billion dollars went through this organ this entity that CZ owned Merit Peak that was Associated I don't know if all 20 billion dollars was was buying B USD but some amount of money going through this legal entity that CZ controlled called Merit Peak purchased B USD the stable coin and some of that money was it was users funds so not great not great um interestingly uh the day after the SEC has seeked emergency relief to ensure binance U.S customers are protected uh and that is just implementing a restraining order a freeze on all binance U.S assets and so if there is any concern that binance U.S at least is insolvent or about we're about to find out I don't think there's any indication that there is but either way we will we will learn uh Anthony what's your take yeah I mean the binance case uh I guess like outside of the Securities uh kind of or unregistered Securities that the SEC claims that both them and coinbase have been trading in is generally I guess pretty strong to be honest because I mean it's been an Open Secret for a while the binance has been pretty shady right especially in the early days of Finance it's not like it really has been an Open Secret it's not something that I think that most people would disagree with given that uh they've been operating basically on this notion of regulatory Arbitrage where they move around different jurisdictions they don't really have a permanent office and they do a lot of things that are quite quite dodgy and there is a lot of evidence that the SEC has and has has put out there that that I mean it doesn't prove anything yet obviously they have to prove it but it makes binance look pretty bad and the coinbase case really doesn't have any of that because I don't think any of that went on and they're really just going after coinbase for trading things that they allege are unregistered Securities so I think binance look I want binance to win just based on the fact that the SEC doesn't deserve to to win any of these cases given just how fragrant the flagrant they have been and and how they're trying to stuff things into them like the unregistered security stuff but at the same time I'm not going to sit here and defend binance and say that they're totally innocent in this and they haven't done anything wrong given that the evidence that I've seen so far but also given what I know about binance since I've known about them since they basically became a company and all their practices over the years uh but but yeah I mean it's going to be interesting to see what comes out of this because we've already seen a bunch of dirty laundry ad uh by binance lawyers themselves I don't know if you're gonna if we're going to talk about this about how Gensler tried to become an advisor to binance in 2019 so yeah they've got it up there so if we're getting that this early what else are we going to be getting from from binance's lawyers are they just going to take the gloves off and start airing all this stuff I don't know it's going to be interesting uh time to see what happens here yeah the binance case is is interesting due to its mixed bag nature there are things that are not not about binance that binance is charged with like staking as a service platforms are deemed to be a security finance is caught up in that uh buscs stablecoin as security binance is caught up in that like Solana Matic all these tokens trading on binance Exchange or Securities binance is caught up in that and then there's the co-mingling of user funds from offshore entities that you that CZ controls and uh to Gary gensler's benefit he's able to wrap all of these things up together and say look at what these crypto exchanges are doing they are operating an unregulated Wild West fashion with no rules outside of the rule of law and he gets to wrap everything together and put the bad things next to what the crypto industry thinks are just like the normal and and good things uh so that is it's I mean it's a pretty smart strategy from Gary Gensler but like still illegitimate nonetheless yeah so the headline of course binance lawyers allege the SEC chair Gensler offered to serve as advisor to the crypto company in 2019 mean uh it's just it's been amazing you could not write a better script really I mean it's amazing to see how gensla has changed his streams over the year because over the years because he used to teach courses on bitcoin and blockchain at MIT he used to promote uh other kind of blockchains like algorand right of all blockchains he was promoting algor and um and then you know two yeah exactly two three years later he's just completely changed his tune to effectively wanting to ban crypto in in the US so I I don't know exactly what has changed I don't really have evidence to what has changed I have my own speculations one of them being that it seems like he cares more about his own personal power and political power and he wants to advance his own career other than anything else and he sees crypto as like a a joke that doesn't deserve to to live and it's just his way to I guess get more power by going after crypto because right now it's very popular to go after crypto but also I feel like he's trying to get a lot of the egg off his face from basically cozying up to SBI F and not going after FTX but now going after binance for pretty much similar things that he should have gone after FTX for uh there's a lot of things a lot of moving Parts here but yeah it doesn't seem like Gary gensley is acting in the best interest of the American people at all it seems like he's acting in the best interest of himself and himself only yeah that was uh Jake Stravinsky and Amanda's take when uh we did the show yesterday is uh Gary Gensler is using crypto as a means to an end to elevate his political status for some sort of political aspiration so he's just one of those figures one of those people that plays a political game that would like a bigger and bigger chair and so he's using crypto as a way to do this okay turning into the the coinbase side of news SEC charges coinbase for operating and unregistered Securities Exchange brokerage and clearing agency more or less the same exact suit that they took to binance uh the the big things here the the unique thing that is unique to the coinbase suit is that um they emphasize the coinbase wallet and say they said that coinbase is offering brokerages Services via coinbase wallet and so they and this is what was actually said in the Squawk Box that um interview that Gary Gensler was on is like coinbase lets you trade 16 000 tokens using their their software uh it was basically just saying yeah with coinbase wallet you can trade on uniswap and you can access all the tokens there it's basically what he's saying um but uh they in this suit the wallet is being um mentioned as part of coinbase's exchange infrastructure which is kind of positioning the SEC to go after generalized defy non-custodial Wallets on custodial apps anything that allows a token to be traded uh so that is a foot in the door that sets a precedent that is that is unique to this case um of course the the big components about this thing is is unlike the binance case the only thing about the SEC V coinbase is that coinbase is being charged with a listing Securities and doing security things like this taking as a service with CBE Solana Matic um like the many of the other tokens were deemed Securities uh and so there's nothing that coinbase did like co-mingling funds or sending users money offshore or et cetera anything like that it's just about hey coinbase is doing things with Securities uh and so that's really all they are claiming about coinbase and of course interestingly the SEC used coinbase's risks disclosures from their own S1 which and that's one is what you file before you go public as a company they use the SEC use coinbase is S1 as evidence against coinbase because coinbase said hey some of the the SEC might deem some of the assets that we have on our exchanges to be Securities and the SEC goes haha so you knew which is insane because it's actually self-referent it's a self-referential argument um anyways uh about about coinbase specifically Anthony what's your take here mm-hmm yeah I mean I feel like there's a lot of shotgun approach here from the SEC basically trying to go after everything at once and maybe try and overload coinbase's resources because they know that coinbase will will fight this and and fight this basically till its end they're not going to give up it seems like so maybe they're just trying to go after them with everything they've got and and water them down or kind of make it harder for them but at the same time yeah there is all this evidence of of the SEC doing things that don't make any sense right they basically let coinbase go public and and they they're now alleging that they're trading Securities or trading unregistered Securities that they were trading at the time that they went public so when you kind of look at that from that lens it looks looks very weird um and it seems like the SEC has a bone to pick with coinbase specifically as well I think because coinbase is fighting so hard they're like well if you're gonna fight us on this then we're literally going to come after you with everything we've we've got which is what I feel is happening because this isn't the first time the SEC has gone after coinbase and given them grief obviously with Kraken you know they went after Kraken for their staking product and then cracking you close their stacking product down and the SEC hasn't gone after them for anything else like why isn't the SEC going after Kraken for trading the same assets that coinbase is is trading maybe they will like maybe this is going to age poorly and they're actually going to sue them as well but if they don't then it clearly seems like they are only going to go after the people that say they're going to fight because they want to make sure that no one else gets the idea of fighting them because if you try to fight us we're going to come after you with everything we've got now that's just pure speculation on my part Maybe I'm Wrong maybe they will sue Kraken but yeah it seems like they're definitely trying to go after coinbase as hard as they can and with binance it's limited in scope just as a related Point here because it's only binance us uh they can maybe have some jurisdiction over binance globally if they can prove that CZ was co-mingling funds and all that sort of stuff but it's probably going to be limited to binance us and I think that what's going to happen is binance US probably just shut down uh I don't think binance cares no about binance us to keep it alive in the midst of this and then yeah once it shuts down uh I don't think they're going to cry over it but the SSC pretty much gets what it wants as well in a extremely Chad move uh Brian Armstrong says that he will not be shutting down the staking service so coinbase will continue to run the CBE staking as a service program uh they were ready to prove this in court that what they are doing is not a security and so they appear to be so confident that it's not a security that they're not even going to bother to to shut it down Senator Bill Haggerty says the SEC is weaponizing their role to kill an industry allowing a company to list publicly and then stonewalling their attempts to register is indefensible Gary Gensler expect to hear from Congress so like it's stuff like this that is like man Gary what you doing bro because it's you're going up as Icarus right and flying right into the Sun at least that's what it appears uh appears to me uh and he's getting pushback from not just you know all of the crypto industry but many many regulators and legislators uh in in government uh for some reason Gary thinks that he can just do this and get away with it Anthony never take here yeah I mean you can see that this is a republican right so I don't think gensla actually cares about what they say I think Gensler cares about what high-ranking Democrats think and what they say and unfortunately they're on his side right you have Elizabeth Warren that's on his side uh you have uh by proxy really Biden that's on his side because he listens to Elizabeth Warren on a lot of this stuff you have um Maxine Waters I think as well Brad Sherman there's just these names you you see Pop Up time and time again that take the side of the SEC and say that the SSC is doing a great job blah blah and you know the Democrats at least in the senate in the presidential level are in power right now so I think gensla doesn't necessarily care what these people think he only cares what those people think and I've been thinking about this recently this might be a a bit of a a crude analogy but I'm thinking of as like the human centipede of the high-ranking Democrats where you basically have these three high ranking I think it's like you know Biden Elizabeth Warren and Gary genslar and they all seem to be working on the same wavelength of you know screw crypto the SEC needs to be able to regulate this industry it's bad for everything Warren's trying to to go out and say that crypto is responsible for the fentanyl crisis in the US and I'm like this is just insane they're literally making up now because I think that they're getting so much pushback from the crypto industry and they're getting so much pushback from from other angles they're just like you know what we're just gonna make stuff up now we're just going to say whatever to get what we want because maybe they're even getting frustrated at this point because that because crypto's putting up such a fight as well um but yeah it's very it's very weird um when you when you look at it and very weird what they're doing but then when you kind of come to the uh I guess conclusion that a lot of them are just in it for power and they want as much power as they can assume for themselves maybe at the end of the day they don't actually care how this all resolves they just want to make headlines they just want to Market themselves and and that's really it because genzla might may not be the SEC chair when the coinbase and binance cases are resolved because it could take two three years for it to resolve and gensla may have moved on already to treasury or something like that so I think really it's all just a power play for them at the end of the day um and I haven't seen anything really to suggest otherwise moving on to a different part of this conversation um I know this one uh triggered you Anthony this is a Jack Jack Dorsey Jack on Twitter retweeting a question saying is eth a security and Jack Jack Dorsey former CEO of crypto of Twitter just says yes and I'm gonna also bring up this tweet from Udi wertheimer uh who goes coinbase onboarded Millions to bitcoin many minted many multi-millionaires by giving them trusted access to bitcoin early on helped onboard institutions such as microstrategy and he says seeing laser eye to Maxis cheering as the SEC tries to take down coinbase makes me stick to my stomach uh Anthony I know you've got some hot takes about this yeah I I mean like look there's no secret that Jack is a Bitcoin maximalist right and it's just very sad that these people fall into this Camp of oh we're Cypher punks oh we're anti-nation State we're anti-government oh wait no sec please call a label ether security please police all the other crypto assets out there and please just bless Bitcoin and make sure that Bitcoin is the one to hold the asset in crypto and it's just really embarrassing and and disgusting and then Jack says this and then he's challenged on this and he doesn't reply to any of the challenges because people actually explain to him hey you know he is he's not as security because of this this or this and this reason and yeah there's no logic here there's no reasoning behind it all it is is tribalism and fanaticism and these people just wanting the competition to be killed by the state which is just the grand irony of it all coming from bitcoiners uh but uh don't forget that today this week the SEC is officially 89 years old so Gary Gensler saying happy birthday to the SEC thank you to the Securities act Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and then he breaks it down with a thread it's so bad man if you scroll down a bit you might see my reply to this um I don't know if maybe show more replies I don't know if that's gonna yeah there you go I I said like 89 years it explains why there doesn't seem to be any signs of cognitive function left that was pretty funny oh my God it's what world does this live in and then to to finally uh tie off this uh this conversation uh we just have Gary gunzler kind of doing like the aliens pose and goes Earth is a security uh because everything is a security according to Gary Gensler okay that was all of that conversation coming up next we got a bunch of ethereum news we got both optimism and Arboretum experience downtime this week one was planned ahead of time one was not uh an eth research proposal to change the 32 each stake number along with a bunch of other pretty cool exciting things Nick Johnson's got an ens update pool together's got an update rocketpool and ZK sync era has an update we're gonna get to all these conversations and more but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web3 mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 Network built differently from the other layer twos you may be familiar with mantle is a modular layer tool built on the op stack but uses eigenlayers data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80 compared to other layer twos but it also reduces gas fee volatility mantle has a decentralized sequencer set eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network and because mantle implements multi-party computation nodes layer 1 settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two mantle is the first layer two built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest Dow treasuries in the world bit down mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of mantle like game 7 for web 3 gaming or edu Dao for the world of DSi and buy bit for tvl liquidity and on-ramps check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle and we are back with bedrock Bedrock is now installed installed is that the right word into the op mainnet so uh the op mainnet went down for a few hours while they upgraded the the network into its Bedrock update uh and so that is now concluded in the Bedrock sequencer is now up and running uh Bedrock do it reduces transaction fees it sets up uh the op mainnet to have this coherent super chain ecosystem it does a bunch of other things uh everything to be excited about um just lays the foundation for a bunch of future steps uh and it also increa improved the security by implementing a two-step withdrawal process for British assets assets which helps the security of the chain itself uh loading up a layer two fisa info you can now see the optimism a swap on optimism is coming in at nine cents which I believe makes it the cheapest optimistic roll-up that there is of course there's a ton of variables that goes into this thing so that is not just a simple um a simple way to view these things but still coming in at uh nine cents on a Uno swap swap that's pretty good Anthony uh what's your take about optimism bedrock yeah I mean it's been a long time coming it's basically their version of arbitrim nitro so Nitro went live on arbitrim a few months ago and now optimism has with bedrock uh and it's got it's basically upgraded the whole op stack so anyone that's using the op stack such as base uh the the coinbase layer two we'll be able to take a benefit of this as well and I think one of the major things and you've got it up here on your screen that Jesse talks about is that with uh the Bedrock upgrade uh optimistic Roll-Ups built using the op stack will actually be able to use validity proofs and not just fraud proofs and validity proof essentially if you if you use that instead of a fraud proof you make your chain uh what is as I guess is known as a zero knowledge roll up instead of an optimistic roll up and you can build hybrid constructions and as well and things like that so and this is something that I've talked about for a long time saying uh exactly what Jesse says yeah it's not zero knowledge or optimistic well-up it's both it doesn't have to be you know either all you don't have to choose you can literally do both and the best technology you can win in the long run and optimism and arbitrine networks can be upgraded to be you know ZK Roll-Ups essentially so they're not stuck being optimistic rights which I always found bizarre that people thought that they were stuck and they couldn't upgrade when literally it's just technology it's just software of course you can upgrade it right and neither of these um chains right now are trying to be like super decentralized or they have to go through a long last process to get upgrades into the network they're they're upgrading and moving at a pretty rapid pace so so yeah but uh but yeah Jesse's tweet here I think addresses that nicely as well yeah and it's important to note that um a validity proof or a z cap validity prover is um a very important step to uh enable what the optimism ecosystem calls the super chain right the cross-train composability of op stack chains uh Z case ZK Tech um from just a high level just allows for composability and synchronous synchronicity across trains uh so this is just a step in that direction so congrats to the optimism team for shipping Bedrock they've been uh having they've been their sites on on that update for a very long time now also in the layer 2 world Arboretum ran out of gas so it stops see it stopped deploying its transactions as checkpoints to the the layer one because it ran out of gas to do so uh that happened for about an hour before someone uh sent 1.4 eth back to the sequencer so that it could continue to checkpoint to the layer one uh so the but the Arboretum uh actual chain still continued as normal it still was a blockchain a layer two adding arbitrum blocks onto the Arbitron blockchain it just wasn't checkpointing to the layer one for a little bit over an hour until we filled it up with gas one of the more unexpected reasons as to why a a layer 2 will stop checkpointing how would you classify this Anthony because this isn't down time it's just like non-finality of a layer two how would you explain what this meant yeah definitely um you know downtime is probably the wrong term for it but also there's some added Nuance here that the reason why the I guess like the the uh the the um address that's used to batch ran out of uh eighth for gas was because there is an automated process that actually uh refills that address with eth but there was a bug you can actually see it's detailed here there was a bug that occurred on the sequence side that led to its batches reverting on chain so when the batches revert the sequence so he's not refunded the gas cost for sending the batch from the contract that refunds them so this isn't like a human sitting there having to re-up the eat that's in the account this is an automated process but because there was a very specific bug it made it so that automated process didn't happen because if it did happen it would have actually drained all of the eth uh for no reason it would have wouldn't have worked properly so uh this bug happened they fixed it and it wasn't just someone forgetting to send eth2 to the contract and you know in saying that as well anyone can send each to this contract so anyone could have added this up again if they if they wanted to which is I think actually pretty cool okay moving on to this E3 search proposal increase the mass max effective balance a modest proposal so this is coming from Mike neuter uh basically this idea is to uh reduce the rigidity around the 32 eth minimum to become a validator now it's not proposing a lower number but it's proposing that 32 doesn't have to actually be the maximum number so right now like validators are in increments of 32. 32 or 64 or oh gosh uh 96 96 is how that math Works um and so he's saying like we don't actually have to have that rigid upper bound so it could be 32 it could be 33 it could be 32 and a half and so as a result of this 32 eth rigidity we have a very large set validator set because every increment of 32 instead of 320 eth becoming one validator it becomes 10 validators and so what does this do uh this has just a a overhead it increases the overhead about the whole networking layer and so this proposal to increase the 32 eth max effective balance what this actually does is actually I in my mind I think it's really bullish for solo stickers because as they get ether from staking they have to wait to accumulate 32 ether in order to redeposit it but with the increase of the max effective balance they can say 33 ether 33.1 ether 33.2 ether and so they get to auto compound their stake and have faster compound interest there's a bunch of other benefits but uh Anthony I'll leave it to you to explain those because those are more Technical and I know you're more technical than I am yeah yeah well so the way this basically would work is that right now I mean the way it works today is that you're you're right 32 eighth is the minimum it's required to spin up a validator but it is also the maximum in that if you add more than 32 each to one validator you are not going to earn more rewards you are only going to earn rewards on that 32 eighth uh and if you were to spin up a second validator with another 32 that's when you start earning uh additional rewards because you've now spun up another validator in and with this proposal what would happen is that as you said you could stake a maximum of I don't know what the exact number is I don't know if that's been ironed out yet but let's say the maximum uh is like 96 eighth right so it's a three validators worth well you could stake like 78 or 80 eighth in one validator and you would earn the rewards based on that so proportional to your e-stake now why this is really cool is that it doesn't mean that you like as a solo sticker as you said you don't actually have to save up to spin up another 32 validator so say you have 32 eighth um and you've staked it and then you have another 10 eighth well just take that into another validator you would need to acquire another 22 each but with this proposal you could just add that to your existing validator and then also with your rewards that you get you can also add them to your validator and the advantage that lsds have right now over solo sticking is that they can actually compound their rewards because they have a huge amount of Awards coming in and they they can compound it for the whole um share share of the LSD Network whereas solo stickers actually have to wait until they have 32 again to compound their rewards so this would basically allow them to do this and now because of this what this also does on the technical side of things is it basically allows for a reduction in the amount of I guess like actual validators there are but it's not a reduction in security there would still be the same amount of each state there would still be the same amount of of full nodes if it's just that the validators like instead of someone running 10 validators because they have 320 each they would run one validator that gives them 320 uh 320 eighth as well so uh that has 328 then would be the same so and then as I said the compounding Awards would also also factor into this which is which is really exciting and what this does by reducing the validator account is it takes the load of the peer-to-peer layout so it makes it easier to run validators and full nodes it's already really easy to do this but it takes the load off takes to load off the network makes the network generally more stable resilient and and secure and then it also enables other things so if you scroll up to the top of this post uh Mike actually says what this uh what this does it actually unblocks something called single slot finality and enshrined PBS and reduces unnecessary strain on the P2P layout so single slot finality and enshrined PBS are two of the biggest upgrades coming I believe to the beacon chain over the next few years and I'll quickly just explain both of those single slot finality basically reduces the finality time from the current around 13 minutes so to epochs to 12 seconds because a slot is a block on the ethereum beacon chain or I mean it's not literally a block but people think of it like that it's 12 seconds you would have finality within 12 seconds and then in try and change PBS is basically taking what Mev boost does today with the relays and and the Mev ecosystem there and basically enshrining it in the ethereum protocol itself so it's not a piece of separate software you run it's actually part of the core protocol and this would would allow for those things to to go live there and uh I think just one last thing I know I'm ranting it'll be here but one last thing there is potentially a downside to this that people have brought up in that it would unfairly reward those who basically had uh I guess like more ether compound than those that didn't because of the share of rewards but I haven't looked too much into that and haven't done the math on that so I can't give too much of an opinion on that but uh I believe that would be something that needs to be researched and kind of uh ironed out before we could do something like this but overall this is a very promising proposal and something that I believe in one way or another one shape or another will actually get implemented into the protocol yeah this was uh just proposed two days ago on the E3 search Forum so it is in its pre-eip phase I don't even know if it has an EIP number so very very early in the process but um I think many many of us are very excited about it moving on to ens update so this is nick.eath Nick Johnson from the ens organization excited to show that this is now public my DOT box dot box will be the first blockchain Native DNS routable TLD and it's enabled via ens all registrations and transfers will be on chain and the owner of the nnt nft will own both the DNS and ens names uh I I think what this means check me if I'm wrong but there's these new domains called dot boxes and owning which is a DNS domain and so you can own you can make like Anthony dot box which is a DNS domain not just an ens name so you would go like www.anthony.box.box but owning that domain is as an nft on ethereum and it routes and it plugs into the ens ecosystem did I explain this right yeah I mean it's kind of hard to explain this like I'm five because if people aren't familiar with the way DNS Works uh it can be quite hard to explain that so I'm not going to get into how DNS works I mean I probably don't remember all the details there either um but yeah the cool thing about this is that there is currently like you know sasol.eath right where I could uh host a website on sasol.e it's not just my ethereum address but I could host the website on there um and it resolves I could host it on ipfs but uh it's not part of uh of DNS it's not DNS routable from what I know unless you're using um a service that does this like dot limo I believe is one of the services out there whereas dot box uh from from what I can tell here it would be routable in DNS so you could just visit it on on any browser and and it would be fine and it would also obviously be enabled as uh integrated with ens and and an nft on ethereum too so there were some concerns around this in the comments I don't know just just to bring up uh the concerns that it's not as censorship resistant um and it doesn't really it can be like seized by the FBI like they can see these domains it's a valid concern but at the same time I don't think everything needs to be totally censorship resistant and decentralized they can be these solutions that uh that kind of uh people can use and they can use other ones if they want as well so I guess just another solution that plugs into the ANS ecosystem and then the other cool exciting announcement that came out of rocketpool coming to ZK sync era so you'll be able to uh liquid stake your Ethan ZK sync era by just holding our eth in your wallet just like on maina and other layer twos our eth will continue to accrue staking rewards automatically can you I I didn't have time to fully unpack what this announcement is but uh what's how how does it's not just our eth on ZK sync era correct it is actually a more formal integration I mean it is and I guess like it's done so that people can obviously buy r e uh without having to buy it on on mainnet right so you would buy it on a layer two and it'd be a lot cheaper to buy it on there and that that reef is actually part of the canonical rocker pull chain so it actually still a rockable network I should say and it actually still accrues the same values as you would on on layer one so yeah it really is effectively just buying kind of arith on on there I you're not able as far as I can tell I don't think so you're able to do this you can't stake your Ethan spin up a mini pool on ZK sync era and anything like that it's really just to be able to acquire arith and then be able to accrue the rewards the same way you would on L1 ethereum and I think these Partnerships and Integrations are announced like this because of the liquidity obviously you can't just say I'll go buy our eighth on this layer too if there's no one providing liquidity for it so I think that's what they try to do they bootstrap it with the L2 themselves with rocket the rockapole community and then it allows people to buy our wreath on on these l2s and then something that I saw that made me really really excited this is uh Layton Cusack from pull together the whole poolie movement uh the the blue uh birds that people have on their on their profile pictures this came from a lawsuit that was going against pulled together forever ago frivolous lawsuit from uh some some lawyers I think in New York that case has been dismissed so the pulley Saga is now fully closed so uh I know Leighton has had been dealing with this for over a year and how I'm sure that is a huge weight off of his back it put together a huge community of of puffers poolers I don't know what these uh poolers I think they're poolers but just like congratulating to having this case dismissed because it was a frivolous lawsuit frivolous class action lawsuit by some lawyers that are are known to be doing that and so it's a big big congratulations here yeah yeah I saw this just before uh yeah I mean the lawsuit itself was garbage it felt like it was literally just done to try and attack defy in some way and the fact that this case was dismissed yeah a huge huge win for for Leighton and the entire day for ecosystem really uh I I'm just really happy that this was the outcome coming up next Bank the station we got some questions from the nation as well as some hot takes from the week we're going to talk about Cosmos we're going to talk about this uh layer 2 definition conversation I don't know if you were tapped into that one Anthony but that was funny uh anyways I see it I see it all of that and more but first a moment to talk about these fantastic

and we are back with questions from the bankless nation if you want your question asked and you are a bankless citizen hop into the Discord every Wednesday we ask y'all what do you want asked on the bank list weekly roll-up and then we ask them this first question comes from Simon Bruce 1974. I'm guessing you were born in 1974 Bruce uh or Simon uh after listening to the episode on eigenlayer I would like to understand where the actual yield comes from if the yield for eath staking is capped at roughly around four percent how is it that by restaking you are able to earn seven percent or more if the underlying asset yield is capped and eigenlayer doesn't have a token where is that coming from next and that's the first question uh next question is isn't this the kind of thing that blew up the global economy in 2008 Anthony what's your answer So my answer is I mean first of all good question because you always want to ask where the yield's going to come from right but my answer is that with eigenlayer there are a number of different ways the yields can actually be paid out by whatever project is using eigenlayer as the backbone of whatever they're building so for example let's say that someone uses eigenlayer to spin up a new Oracle Network well maybe that Oracle network has a token and maybe people are paying that Oracle network to use their oracles so they could one payout token right token uh I guess like um tokens as liquidity mining to get that yield number right and and two that those fees could also be going to the people that are restaking which would be as as the yield so one of them would be I guess like a inflated kind of imaginary yield if you you know if you take that view when it comes to token incentives and the other one would be a real yield from real real users paying to to use the network and choose another example not just an oracle network but like a data availability Network where people are paying to use this this networking to post their data there and then those fees would go to the the E3 stakers that are that are I guess using eigenlayer and then on top of that I mean you say icon that doesn't have a token I mean my my kind of number one talking point within crypto is that like if it doesn't have a token right now it's probably going to have a token in the future um yeah yeah so they could also be doing token incentives I can layer themselves for this sort of stuff so good question asking where the yield's coming from um but yeah I mean if it's coming from like new tokens that are being printed just infinitely and some kind of like weird terror-like thing then yeah I mean it would obviously be something that should be called out and people should be saying you know this looks like a Ponzi but at the same time uh there is a real yield there if users are paying to use it right you're paying fees to use it then that would go to the rest takers which would reflect as a percentage yield I don't I haven't watched the episode yet so I don't know um you know the full context here but that's that's basically where the yield would come from and then the uh the other thing I'll just say is this like eigenlayer is meant to spawn many many many networks but the economics of all these networks are more or less the tried in true science that we know about crypto economics as in you need security you pay for security with fees and token emissions uh until your network is sufficiently bootstrapped the only difference is I is that you know with new networks there's like hey new native token that is the staking token and then with eigenlayers like hey ethers is taking token the the network token does something else but ethers is taking token and so you ether gets some of the yield of the network uh and so that is simply the pattern where uh the yield comes from the next question which is uh isn't this the kind of thing that blew up the global economy in 2008 uh I mean there's a lot left to be learned about eigenlayer uh I think the simple answer is no because like credit default swaps and black market uh who owns what is not really I would say relevant to the eigenlayer system there are risks to eigenlayer um and and like the restaking because it definitely sounds like re-hypothesis education but I would actually say that there's a pretty big difference between what these things are not to say that there are no risks and those risks might be significant but they are at least different from the risks that we saw in 2008. uh next question coming in from uh Yuda Mania udemonia how do I ensure my Normie wife has access to my eth if I die my biggest hesitance in furthering my investment is to make sure that she has access to it Anthony do you have any advice for udemonia here so there are Services popping up that are I guess like trying to make a solution here on how this actually gets handled and how Estates get handled but the problem with something like this is that there's a lot of real world legal kind of work and stuff around this that exists already for handling the states of of deceased people that these solutions that are coming online for crypto assets need to work within those Frameworks and obviously within different parts of the world there's different Frameworks different legal processes so yes there are solutions coming online for this if you do self-custody your eth and then for some reason uh you pass away and then you want to pass that on in in a way where you're kind of like normal wife in this context can actually access it you can use those kinds of services but if you want to maintain like full self-sovereignty full self-custodial over your own funds then I guess the simplest way would be to just write her a guide and then make sure that she I can actually follow it and know how to access it on her own so basically Testo Say Hey I want you you to do this all on your own and if she can access it and she knows what to do then then that's it really I mean there's not much else you can do other than that it's like teaching them how to access it and in which way while keeping your own funds still secure um but yeah it is definitely a big problem I think right now for people it's not saying enough people talk about but there are definitely Solutions being worked on I don't know the names of the top of my head right now I'm sure you could Google for them uh but yeah I I think the the best way right now would probably just be to make sure that you write them a guide and they can follow the guide and get access to it you know like a trial run it's not that hard really I mean depending on how you secure your funds of course but I guess if you're doing things like staking it all or putting it somewhere else how's your wife going to know how to like unwind uh uni swap liquidity position right or things like that so that's where things get get complex and I think that's where these third-party services may be of of much uh much more help than just trying to write a guide for her but but yeah unfortunately I don't have many better Solutions than that right now it's tough to give advice for because every case is uh unique and of itself right um I think another kind of catch-all advice is like if you have a trusted crypto friend who you know knows how to operate a wallet and and do all these things maybe the thing you tell your your wife or your Normie relative that needs to recover your funds uh is that hey go talk to this person and if it's a trusted friend then they can help uh help you them out and if that if you're worried about that that person just like steals the funds well then you get to go to like nation state legal systems because you have one person who is responsible and clearly did the theft uh and so um that you just can fall back there okay last question from let's go ride bikes will Ryan ever read the ads that answer is no because I am the one with a teleprompter all right moving on for takes of the week this is coming from Zacky mannion out of the cosmos ecosystem interesting take here I think Cosmos he says Social Capital has about 12 months to do something unique and differentiated otherwise we will get swallowed by eat flavored variants of Cosmos originated ideas like roll apps and eigenlayer I feel intense urgency the hour is late interesting tweet out of uh Zaki what did you see this tweet uh Anthony what was your take I I think I did say it and I think my initial reaction to this was that Zaki is like at least 12 months late on this take um I'm sorry but I have been going on about this personally and about Cosmos just not being able to find product Market fit for a long time now uh probably as early as 2020 I believe I just never got the value prop and yeah I think he's right I think that the ideas that they've been pushing on such as kind of like the app chain stuff and and like roll apps things like like the ethereum ecosystem is just much better position to take those ideas and run with them because it has all the economic uh kind of like weight there it has all the money it has all the social capital it has all the attention whereas Cosmos no one really knows kind of like what Cosmos is is trying to do and what the central Hub is because they have this like Hub and spoke model but then Cosmos was kind of like not the hub for a little bit there was another thing that was like acting as the Hub and then people were fighting there's a lot of infighting in the community so they don't really seem to have like a shelling point that people can actually like go to and be in the cosmos ecosystem not to say there aren't people good people working on it and there aren't stuff there aren't interesting things happening there but yeah I do think that their time is pretty much out uh the l2s are already big the eigenlayer has so much hype behind it that I'm very confident it's going to accrue a lot of uh attention a lot of attention a lot of economic capital behind it very quickly uh so yeah I feel like he's he's potentially late on this by at least 12 months yeah um I mean he's basically making a big call to actions like yo Cosmos ecosystem it's time to get our together otherwise we will get routed around um this uh next take coming in from dankrad Feist he goes blockchain researcher discovers that value is social mind exploding Emoji comma blames Roll-Ups uh and this is coming out of John charbonneau's article uh that he dropped to is like hey y'all don't know what a rollup is here's what it actually is and Dan grass has Fallout continues and says a few people saying this analogy made them more sympathetic to John's argument I wonder what their model of value was before I you think that maths or cryptography somehow store value you're wrong they only help a community coordinate Oh I thought that was a great take like cryptography you don't you can't store value in cryptography value is inherently perceived and so this whole like blockchain roll-up debate is like basically the tldr is like from a Roll-Ups perspective it's it's a layer one or like optimism from the optimism perspective is a layer one it just happens to use ethereum for data uh and then like and then it turned into just like this ontology debate about like what's a roll-up and what is what is provenance and all this stuff uh Anthony what's your take on dankress take yeah so this was um a take that was basically uh well I mean the whole debate stemmed from this uh this blog post that John uh put out around you know social consensus basically and basically and telling people that you don't know how uh Roll-Ups work you know you've been lied to blah blah it was very bombastic it was uh very I guess clickbaity but the essence of his post was that yeah it's all social consensus now for people who have been around for a while in this ecosystem understand that it's all social consensus no matter what it is doesn't matter if it's a roll-up or an L1 or an out or an asset it doesn't even matter if it's the erc20 is token standard right someone used this I believe dankrad used this analogy But ultimately it is all social consensus at the end of the day we value things we use the standards like there's no reason why a token has to be an erc20 it can be another standard like you can literally Fork erc20 copy the whole thing core ERC 50 or whatever you want to call it and it'll be the same thing but the thing is it relies on people actually giving it value it relies on the social consensus same with like if there's a fork of an L1 for example the reason why Bitcoin cash isn't the real Bitcoin and Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin is because it's social consensus No One Believes Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin except a small minority of people whereas the majority believes Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin so it's the same is true for l2s if someone wanted to Fork optimism and say okay well this is the real optimism now and this is the the thing well I mean no because the bridge uh the ultimates and Bridge is what holds all the value right and so you can't Fork that bridge you can't Fork the the um the value of that bridge you would have to convince people to use your kind of bridge and for you to be the real optimism so really at the end of the day is all social consensus but I think people took issue with John putting this out because they're like dude like we know this like this isn't a revelation um but at the same time I can see from John's perspective how he's like I don't think enough people know this because it is kind of like it like if there's 10 levels of crypto understanding that everything in Social consensus is like level 10 right and I don't think most people are at level 10. that's when you're like sitting The Matrix exactly so I think John's whole point of of this post was to just outline if people who may not think like this which I can I can resonate with because I'd like would like more people to understand this but at the same time yeah I think it annoyed a lot of the the level 10 people that's for sure the only uh participation I had in this whole like Twitter debate was uh noticing that all these people were debating about the ontology of Roll-Ups and like man that is some bear Market  If Ever I saw it yeah this is what we do in Bear markets right we just debate like the meanings of words uh Fred Erickson's take uh apples and this is coming off of the hype of the new Apple Vision Pro uh launch Apple's optic ID authentication in The Vision Pro is World coin orb built into a mainstream device so Fred is just saying like hey that world coin orb that everyone thinks is super dystopian well now Apple's doing it and everyone's cool with it because it's a mainstream advice uh what's your overall like take on the whole world coin Vibe and whether or not it's like dystopian I mean it's all about the marketing at the end of the day the orb is dystopian the goggles they're not dystopian right the goggles uh people are used to goggles they're used to glasses you know it's apple as well so it's Apple gets to to swing their weight around there but the orb I mean come on like how many times have we seen like Sci-Fi movies and stuff like that with just orbs orbs are always bad whatever it's exactly evil exactly orbs are always evil goggles and glasses they're you know goofy at worst right um so I think that's the difference yeah it's all in the marketing and I think worldcoin really kind of screwed up their marketing because they I think they thought the orb would be something that was good marketing for them which maybe it was but maybe it was like that there was too much negativity as well not to say that world coin isn't you know doing well in their own right I think that they're doing a lot of great things I don't have a strong opinion on on the orb or whatever but yeah I think naturally people just say the Orbeez dystopian goggles are just goofy a great take all right Anthony as we come down to the end of it the last few questions for you is uh what's your bullsh on what gets you excited these days [Music] because like that's like table Stags at this point I think what I'm what I'm still most bullish on is the fact that we are executing on the ethereum Bro map at layer one faster than we ever have been if you had told me that we were gonna get 40 aip4844 um so soon after the you know withdrawals going live and and the merge I I probably wouldn't have believed you I would have been like nah that's that's way too soon because it's slated for the end of this year right as part of the dencoon upgrade and the fact that that is not a minor upgrade it is a major upgrade and that will actually be felt by end users because typically on layer one we like to do upgrades that don't really get felt by end users because I mean the whole point of ethereum layer one roadmap is really just to enhance layer twos which is where the end users sit and also make the layer one just more secure but that's not something end users see but this is a very big major end user facing upgrade and the fact that it's coming so quickly uh is extremely bullish and it's coming so quickly because there are so many awesome people working on it not just from the traditional core devs and researchers but also from other organizations like optimism like coinbase has been contributing to it like arbitrim and all these other teams they're contributing to it in a really positive way and they're working in harmony together and it just yeah it gets me really bullish just knowing that we can actually ship ethereum L1 upgrades in a much faster Cadence than we have in in the past yeah that's always been the thing that has I've noticed over the last like four or five years is the acceleration of protocol development even like inside of bull markets inside of bear markets it doesn't matter like the the East developers and and developing ecosystem whether they're core developers or just client teams or or EIP proposers or layer two teams everything just seems to be accelerating perpetually uh and like just like you said with with bass now we have a big big company entering The Fray uh and so yeah there's there's yeah um and especially when like protocol development actually turns into optionality for apps and bridges and chains like everything that's going to cohere very very well next bull market you're gonna you're gonna ask me what I'm bullish on Nancy uh is that what I have to do yeah that's why that's what your turn is now okay okay what are you bully Sean David oh thanks for asking me Anthony uh I'm just bullish on like this being the bottom of the United States um Gary gensters I think is at his Peak uh he has a court date with coinbase coinbase is not delisting any of the uh tokens that Gary Gensler said our Securities they're not ending their CBE program they're looking forward to their day in court uh and I think everyone in crypto is like yeah that's going to be good for us uh so I'm calling the bottom of the United States there's been a big migration eastwards to Asia there's a lot of focus on Asia right now because all of these Founders and developers are scared shitless to issue a token inside of the United States I'm calling a bottom on that so I am no Patriot I don't I do not care to wear an American flag but I'm saying don't paper hand the United States right now because I think it is up only from here and that is what I'm bullish on yeah yeah I mean it kind of feels like that because it's it's so bad that I mean maybe the only way up is up from here so yeah maybe it really it's like 80 eighth right it literally cannot be worse yeah right all right coming in uh to close out this episode and Anthony thank

hot takes on it and there's a really great Community people should join as well our daily great Discord Community uh very active in there lots of people in there they'll answer all your questions uh but yeah yeah bankless listener long time bank list listeners will know but if there is a concentric circles of crypto media I would put the core devs and all of the blog posts and announcements and progress that they make and then I would wrap the daily way around that and then I would wrap the bank list around that uh a lot of a lot of what Anthony puts out on the daily way uh ultimately just ends up in the bankless weekly roll-up content which is why it's so easy to bring him into uh the weekly roll-up when I have ever Anthony's down for me excuse me whenever Ryan is down for maintenance so Anthony we always we always appreciate it you ready for the meme of the week Anthony yeah let's do it this one came from a pseudo Theos I'm sure you saw this one but this is once again about the roll-up debate the roll-up debate in one image which is the uh the astronaut shooting the other astronaut wait it's all social consensus and then the other astronaut says it always has been it's always social consensus all the way down and it always has been any comments on this list I mean I mean it always will be until our Ally overlords take over right but then it's the social consensus of the AI Overlord so yeah it's always social consensus so someone's Social consensus Bank First Nation thank you for sticking with us through the crypto news of the week it was a big one this week and of course Anthony thank you once again for for helping me go through the news risks and disclaimers bankless Nation crypto is risky Bitcoin ether is risky crypto they might be crypto Securities you don't know but you could lose what you put in we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bank list Journey thanks for thank you [Music]
