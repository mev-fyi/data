[Music] hey bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation episode david how are you doing today absolutely fantastic things are heating up in the crypto ecosystem in the bankless universe so it's once again it is a fun time to be in this industry yeah okay so we are going to talk about tokens today specifically 10 of the top tokens in the d5 pulse index and we brought on somebody who's actually uh in jail right now uh twitter jail i should clarify twitter jail anthony cesano is um you mocked himself from from twitter sort of a vow of silence until eth goes over 1420 uh but we brought on anthony to talk all about these tokens um can you tell us what discussion we're about to have david yeah so uh this is a little bit this this was my idea to bring anthony on and it was a little bit of a of a claim about how we are about to enter uh alt season or defy season d5 summer 2.0 i think that's ahead of us and so we wanted to get anthony on the podcast to go through the tokens in the dpi index anthony is an advisor at set protocol which is the company that is part of the index co-op which produces indices the first of which is the dpi indice in partnership with d5 pulse and there are 10 tokens in the dpi and so we want to go through every single one for all the new listeners out there who are looking for ways to understand tokens right tokens are fun they go up really high they go down really low but it's also they're also really hard to understand and so i think having a conversation with the three of us to understand how we all think of these things how we see value being captured by tokens in different ways and how we analyze these these things i think will be really useful for people coming into this space who you know are excited about investments and but don't know what to do i think this is going to be a conversation to uh tap into our brains and see how we uh model out what we see it as valuable versus not valuable in this space absolutely so we talk about ave we talk about uni the uni token we talk about balancer a bunch of the top d5 tokens that you know and and really talk about the kind of the value proposition and accrual mechanisms behind them we brought anthony on because what else is he doing right he's off twitter lots of time on his hands david what else is new in the bankless ecosystem we have a fantastic podcast that just came out yesterday on monday with lynn alden can you give a sneak peek on that yeah lynn alden is the rising star of macro of just macro commentary especially as it relates to bitcoin she's a big bitcoin enthusiast but she's first and foremost a macro expert i got so much value out of that podcast uh what my biggest takeaway was talking about the primacy of the us dollar and how that relates to u.s manufacturing it turns out as there is global demand for dollars uh in order to serve that demand we need to export dollars as a country and so we've exported our dollars and what what does that mean when you export dollars you import goods but that means we are emphasizing the manufacturing of other countries instead of our own country which i think is part of that social unrest that we've seen in the last few years that social unrest is a result of economic forces and the lack of jobs that we have in america and i think that is kind of the story of 2020 is that the social unrest could be connected to the primacy of the us dollar i thought that was absolutely crazy connection absolutely fantastic podcast and we just recorded another podcast that is going to come out next week that you've got to check out our first podcast with drake drake yes well should we clarify which drake we're talking about yeah we are talking about justin drake a lead researcher at the ethereum foundation uh justin drake is all about cryptography he's a cryptographer uh and while we were doing our bowl case for ethereum bowl case for eth he wanted to get in on that because he had a really bull really strong bowl case for cryptography uh so that's what that conversation was all about ryan what were your some of your favorite takeaways oh dude it was just um i i think it was amazing to view sort of how early we are in the evolution of ethereum and and bitcoin and how far we have yet to go it's really like we have just we're in the stone age of this new era of of compute and i think justin really made that clear a lot of the the challenges that we see today around you know centralization of like medic mask or or private key management cryptography really is the answer to some of these challenges and problems so it's a super unique episode um i don't think i've heard any pod crypto podcast episode uh with this kind of content so make sure you tune into that and catch that and david because it's state of the nation let's begin this by asking you the question i always ask what is the state of the nation today yeah i teased it a little bit at the beginning of this intro the state of the nation is heating up uh as i put out a funny tweet that i thought it was funny that uh on a three-minute long popcorn bag microwave popcorn bag timer it feels like we're at second 45. we saw mkr pop off go from 500 to 1500 we just saw a dot do something crazy uh things are popping off all right wait so you're saying some of those kernels in the bag like a few of them have popped but if you still got the rest of the bag just only the very early stages of the popping process yes that's very very very early stages in the popping process and when that comes to a head i think that's what quote unquote all season is or you know defy summer 2.0 uh that you know this time it's defy winter because it's literally winter it's january but d5 summer 2.0 i think that's ahead of us and again that's why we brought anthony cesano on to talk about some of the best tokens in the ecosystem to use for mental models about how to understand and evaluate tokens and you have to be careful just like a popcorn bag when you take that popcorn bag out of the microwave you don't burn your fingers on the water vapor maybe i'm taking the analogy too far david no that's perfect there's plenty of ways to get hurt by microwave popcorn so long as you uh follow the instructions and play it safe you should be good all right david let's get to the sponsors that made state of the nation possible

okay bankless nation we're super excited to do this special state of the nation with anthony cesano of ethub of token set anthony the self jailed how are you doing in there anthony yeah how's it going you've been weaned out there for a while i actually went cold turkey are you how are you holding up yeah yeah i went cold turkey can't post tweets haven't posted a tweet since january 8th i am i'm okay i am enjoying the memes of course uh they're quite funny um that's keeping me going it's kind of funny how i didn't expect that to happen i i was like well i'm actually getting people talking about me more with me not even tweeting so this is just a bit weird but uh definitely feeling withdrawals because as you said i did it cold turkey i went from like tweeting a lot to nothing um and you know it definitely is like i i i do realize now that i had kind of an addiction to tweeting so maybe it's a good thing to take a break so yeah so for those of you oh go ahead david yeah for those that don't know anthony has decided to take a self-imposed hiatus until ether breaks its previous all-time high of fourteen hundred and twenty dollars i think that's actually a pretty genius uh marketing move twitter marketing move because anthony you've made yourself synonymous with the eth all time high and so now when the eath breaks all-time high it's also going to be known as the time anthony finally returns back to twitter i think that's a pretty genius move yeah yeah and the funny thing is i didn't plan it to play out like that at all i was actually in the car uh my fiance was driving and i'm like what if what if i just put out this tweet he said 1300 we're gonna get to all-time high i know we're gonna get there so i put it out and then we we kind of like ranged a little bit went up a little bit and then we crashed like 30 or whatever it was and i'm like okay how long did you think this is gonna go how long did you think this is gonna be a window for a couple of days i really did i mean i was so bullish we were so close but you know i think uh it's just karma right i mean you know some people are saying oh the whales are conspiring against him they're pushing the price down to maximum pain but who knows i am loving the memes that are coming out of this this is one from dc investor like visualizing what anthony's doing right now that he's legit legit me when i say the price going up i'm just like yes soon soon here's another what i've put out which is a dms i received from anthony that's funny i found that funny how many people didn't get that this was a as a joke yeah i know it was that was pretty funny it's really amazing so and people are asking how we're going to welcome you back and dc of course says uh let's report his account as soon as he comes back so he's having a lot of fun with this what's your prediction so we are recording this on on january the 15th and the so this is this is friday right it comes out on on a tuesday of next week do you think you're going to be out of twitter jail by then i i hope so i have high hopes for this weekend you know uh just based on my general kind of bullishness here the senate their sentiment you know we're very close still we're at 1200 around 500 time of recording so yeah i hope so i think so um but i mean i said that last time when i tweeted this thing so i don't know how much my my kind of sentiment my feeling is kind of worth right now yeah well we are pulling for you my friend and of course we are just as excited to see each hit all-time high and to see you get out of twitter jail if

about what we wanted to talk about today and this is kind of a topic as we're entering the bull market that i think is on a lot of listeners minds right now is how to prepare from an asset from a portfolio perspective so um i got a text just this week from a friend of mine he's like dabbling in in d5 dabbling in cryptic of course and he's wondering like in this bulls cycle um should he start to rotate some of his eth maybe some of his bitcoin as well into into d5 and maybe let's start there right because um some people believe of course that bitcoin is going to eat everything bitcoin dominance is going to stay in the 70 type range um and it will get the majority of upside and accrualness in this bear market right um others believe that bitcoin might have a you know four to eight x well eth has a five to ten x um while d5 outperforms both like a 10 to 20 x possibly right um that's more along the lines of what i think could happen but but what do you think could happen anthony what's kind of uh your perspective do you think bitcoin goes higher ethos even higher has more upside and d5 has more upside than both of those asset categories yeah that's that's my general play uh for sure just based on i guess a lot of it is based on market cap for sure it's much harder to move bitcoin and eve as opposed to d5 but at the same time i think d5 is a very broad category right where there's a lot of tokens that fall into that bucket so if you're talking about you know these tokens that maybe have a really tiny market cap that can be very easily pumped or whatever and the a kind of outperform um you know that's that's just because they're very small right so i guess when we're talking about d5 what i like to think about is the d5 pulse index which is um an index of the top default tokens that we have that we created at set protocol uh to let you track and get exposure to d5 and and that's kind of what i mean when i when i think about d5 and when i'm talking about it to newer people because uh you know a lot of these newer people taking on the risk of buying like the really low cap coins is just it's not not a great way for them to start in this space because they're so volatile they can fall fifty percent on the day go up fifty percent of the day right and there's so many of them there's so yeah this and then and the pr it's just yeah paralysis of trying to choose which ones to put your money into um and if you're not you know used to the volatility you can very easily just get kind of wrecked trying to trade in and out of them so i know we're going to talk about the d5 pulse index in depth more but that general kind of you know uh btc uh being outperformed by ethan eth being outperformed by d5 during a bull cycle is definitely uh something i i subscribe to so some listeners who have you know been through market cycles before might uh think of the term alt season which is a little bit what we're talking about here uh there seems to be a general rotation uh and this is a rule of thumb and there's totally examples of when this is invalidated but the the rule of thumb is that btc pumps and then ether pumps and then all the other tokens pump and so we're kind of getting prepared for perhaps that third leg of the rotation if it does indeed play out and so looking at coin gecko and and it's it's my belief and i'm pretty sure ryan and your belief as well that uh defy is the under served as or the underserved category right it's it's below what it should be and if you look at the market cap of all coins excluding d5 the market cap is over a trillion dollars ryan if you go down to that purple line um in the graph below uh yeah over a trillion dollars whereas that blue line is just at 30 billion so there's a huge discrepancy here and we believe according to the protocol stinks thesis that a lot of these protocol tokens represent upside potential to d5 and are ready to close that gap that is what my that's where my head is out what do you believe how do you think about that bitcoin ether al altcoins alt season uh cycle and then how do you how do you integrate specifically the defy tokens inside of that category as well yeah i think uh the thing about the alt-season it also kind of includes all the other coins and stuff out there right it doesn't just cover cover d5 but obviously d5 falls into that from a market perspective and you were just showing that coin gecko kind of uh stats there um and 30 billion being the d5 market cap they actually include chain link in that and chain linked for me and i maybe i'll anger some people by saying this to me it's not a defy token it's a middleware protocol right it's something like the graph it falls into a different category so you can take out chain link out of that right and lower the d5 market cap even more it probably lowers it to about 20 billion so yeah i mean as you pointed out the total caps over a trillion most so that is bitcoin i think 70 of that is bitcoin almost which is which is a huge amount right um but i don't think it's gonna stay like that uh during this bull market i think as you said there's this rotation that goes on you know people you know coming to bitcoin especially newer people and then they you know bitcoin kind of stagnates and then these newer people think oh okay you know bitcoins going sideways what else can i rotate into um or can i speculate on and especially traders right traders definitely do this they want volatility they don't they don't want sideways so if they're sideways in bitcoin they'll go to eath right then they'll go down on the list and it's obviously like as the kind of um more more new money floods in and volatility heats up then the lower cap coins which d5 falls into obviously can go up a lot faster and a lot easier than the large cap coins so yeah i mean this as you said there's plenty of evidence of this uh happening during bull markets in bear markets it doesn't really happen um you know people fly to safety which is obviously cash first and then bitcoin to a certain extent um i think you know last cycle we didn't really see people flowing to eat for safety maybe this cycle we do but yeah it's hard to tell there so yeah definitely that rotation you can see play out on the charts it's pretty obvious so uh but only in bull markets i think so this kind of the the the bankless um portfolios as we call it anthony that we're basically describing here which is you know a generous helping of crypto monies like ether right and like like bitcoin so you have that in your portfolio and then also you want exposure to this this neo banking layer this default layer so if you want to drop dead simple like bankless portfolio it's basically ether bitcoin and d5 like the dpi the d5 pulse index and that kind of gets you what you need to be positioned for this bull market at least that's kind of what we think and if your thesis uh if the thesis plays out that we we get the cycle of bitcoin eth and d5 then you have exposure to all of those assets as the as the cycle um as they cycle into one another and out of one another so the great thing about dpi is you can just like put some money in and set it and forget it it's just an index of all of these top 10 d5 protocols but it doesn't do one thing anthony and that that's this it doesn't give you exposure to the the micro caps so essentially when you're buying uh the dpi you're buying more more so the blue chip uh deep five tokens but you don't have exposure to this micro cap and if we think d5 is going to do something like a a 10 to 20 x like part of the question is does that 10 to 20 x happen in the large blue chip assets or does it happen with these like micro cap uh defy assets at the very bottom and you lose out if you don't have exposure to those micro caps any thought on that yeah i think with the default pulse index you're you're buying safety right you're buying uh less volatility on both sides the upside and the downside uh because they are as you said more blue chip assets they're supported by more exchanges a lot of them are on coinbase for example um a lot of them are part of projects that have extreme product market fit you know like uni swap uh uh like what uh yearn and things like that so that's kind of the trade-off there whereas if you are investing in the smaller caps right you have a bunch of different things you have to the small cap d5 you have a bunch of different things you have to take into consideration uh your risk tolerance needs to go way up right you need to be able to stomach you know those 50 in a day drops um and as a new investor i don't think many people can do that i remember when i first got into i i couldn't do it it was just it's something you have to learn and go through and then you try to swing trade it right and you know you get kind of like wrecked because a lot of us have to deal with taxes too so swing trading with taxes and everything and all this sort of stuff is just it's so hard to speculate on the smaller ones so for that's why i think dpi is perfect even for for for seasoned people in in crypto because they can kind of hedge their their risk with dpi like they do with btc and eth and then use a small part of their stack to go speculate on smaller cap things um but yeah it's all just the kind of like how much risk do you want to take if you don't want to take if you want to be exposed to d fire but don't want to take on a ton of risk don't have to worry about rebalancing out of everything you know there's an argument to be made that uh that that an index product uh with on built on our infrastructure at set is tax advantage as well um but obviously talk to your own tax uh tax kind of accountant for that but you know there's that argument there if you just want like passive diversified low risk exposure then the dfi pulse index is is basically for you um but you can you can always buy some of the default pulse index and then use some of the money you have left over to go speculate on the smaller cap ones but you do need to realize that your risk your risk tolerance has to be much higher than it does for the dpi it's almost just like in the in the stock investing world you know people will invest in indices in s p 500 and then they'll also maybe have some money set aside to play with penny stocks and really like small micro that's kind of what we're talking about here yeah exactly exactly and i think you know if you look at the dpi and the performance of it and how it handled the d5 kind of bear market so it actually launched at i think at the top of d5 summer so um it was a bit of a bad time to launch it but it's rebounded quite well i think it went from 100 as it started at um it dropped down to maybe you know 60 or something like that which is a pretty still a pretty brutal drop but that's a that's crypto right um you're gonna get that volatility and that that was like d5 coming off of a really um you know heated market so that was pretty i think that would be the worst amount of volatility you'd see um yeah there besides maybe the end of a bull market um or a macro bull market so yeah you can see here um that it just like dropped like pretty far down i probably went under 60 actually yeah 259 something like that um which you can see 50 and then now it's gone up to over 200 right um so it's not like you're you're only getting like 10 percent out of this right you if you bought around the bottom at around like 60 dollars you've gotten a quite a nice gain um you know over a 3x uh since since november so you know you are trading you know you could have got an attendance on something else right but the thing is like could you have picked that something else would you have stayed in that position uh you know could you have prevented yourself from getting wrecked during the drawdowns uh most people can't and that's why there's also like there's smart contract risk there's rug pool risk there's team risk there's all of these risks at the at the small new project micro cap level that you have to take into account yeah and those those risks are actually commonly understated i think um you know because uh people you know love to get kind of like i guess high on the on the pumps and everything but if you want to look at the perfect example look at what happened to cover right the cover token um that pumped up quite quite highly and it was a very popular kind of low cap defy token and then they had a bug in their contract which let infinite amounts of tokens be entered and you know a lot of people got got kind of wrecked on so you know and then if i pulse in this he's very strict about what tokens it includes you'll notice that it's all you know high quality projects and high quality tokens it's not it's it's not necessarily excluding like smaller cap tokens because they're smaller caps it's just because they don't meet the criteria that was outlined by default poles and that's to protect people as well right from this kind of thing happening uh you know bugs and stuff like that here lord that cover chart looks brutal what is that so that actually leads us into the conversation that we wanted to bring you on to have anthony we want to use all of the tokens in the dpi and and go through each individual one and use each one as an example for you know for listeners to understand how you and how we think about these assets on an individual basis using the assets inside the dpi and and like you said the assets inside the dpi we would consider to be the safer assets that's why they are in there in the first place they're more justifiable they have more usage uh they have stronger value capture and the market tends tends to value them more for that reason things like synthetics ave uniswap maker iron compound these things tend to be the d5 blue chips they're not going to like 100x but they're still going to track d5 very strongly and they're not there it's less likely for them to get like rug pulled and it's easier for it for new people to you know understand why these things have value and i think if we go through each one and you know explain our mental models with them it's going to be easier for listeners to understand how we think about these assets and be able to extend that to do their own research about you know people like to speculate people like to gamble in like low-cap defy tokens we know that's going to happen and we want to equip people um with learning how we think about our mental models using some of the best examples in the d5 pulse token index so that they can be equipped for that so i think we should get started let's go down the list in of all the tokens in the d5 pulse index let's start with synthetics as the the token that has the highest weight um anthony can you explain to our listeners what synthetics network is and what the snx token does yeah so basically i mean as the name says synthetics is a synthetic asset network uh you know it does a bunch of different things you can get exposure to a bunch of different synthetic assets on there whether they be crypto assets or other assets like gold that they have are currencies on there as well like s usd s aud things like that and the snx token is kind of at the heart of that so what the snx token does is it acts as collateral for the system so people will stake their estimates as collateral and they'll be able to generate synthetic assets against that so a lot a lot of people do is they generate susd so the synthetic usd against that because it's it's the safest play um and then you know you might be able to do yield farming with that susd or use it as like a stable coin within d5 sort of thing and all that sort of stuff um the snx token also gives you uh governance rights as well um over the platform uh i i you know i i mean they have a whole governance system that they're currently building out so i'm not sure how much governance right you get just yet on the platform um i don't think there's any on chatting up binding on enchanting governance yet for synthetics and also it will uh capture it captures fees too so um it's the snx token when you stake it you actually get paid snx tokens as a reward for that each week but on top of that you also get uh some of the fee revenue that's generated by the synthetics exchange so uh that's not i mean that's still quite small as uh compared to kind of it's like market cap because synthetics has a very high market cap um and i think you know as a top level thing here actually because we're going to be diving into all these assets one thing that actually strikes true for a lot of them is that a lot of them have really the top ones have really powerful narratives really powerful communities because a lot of these trade like growth stocks where you are basically beating this up so high or the markets beating this up so high because they believe the growth potential is extreme right um so yeah that's kind of like the tldr on on snx there and kind of um you know i mean it's one of the best performing d5 tokens of the last couple years as well so we're looking at a market cap of over 2 billion and just a massive run-up over the last few months here in the in terms of total locked value it has 1.7 billion locked so another metric we can look at guys is the price to sales ratio on token terminal and synthetics right now is about 58. so um you know if you look at p e ratios in stocks things like netflix are trading 80 amazon 120 or so so this is possibly undervalued relative to those things but you're paying a bit more for synthetics than you're paying for some of these other assets on the charts any any thoughts on that yeah i mean as as i said these things trade like growth stocks right they will go up very quickly because of a narrative or a story um and this isn't just synthetics you can see here how many of them trade like that right you know curve are there you know and that's because people are betting that these things are going to grow much much larger and i don't think that's a bad bet to make at this point in time considering how early we still are in you know defy and all that sort of stuff so but at the same time it lends itself to extreme volatility that i was just talking about you know it's funny like are there during the d5 kind of mini bear market we had after the d5 summer it actually dropped down to about 30 dollars and at the time i think less than that maybe like 27 or something at the time i was thinking you know this is insane right are there's growth in just one year has been incredible and it's going to keep growing they're launching v2 right they've got all this stuff coming and that's what you're betting on right and and i'm sure even at 27 dollars you know the multiplier might have been quite high still but uh you you can't tr the market doesn't trade these things like that yet uh it trades them based on future potential just like how tesla is worth so much right even though their revenue is nowhere near justifying market cap but people are saying well i think tesla's going to change the world they're going to be huge they're going to be everywhere so i want to buy it now um so yeah a lot of these things trade like that and that's why we get the extreme volatility i think one of the factors that is factoring into the snx price that you might not find from you know metrics or on train you know on train metrics is the fact that it's likely that synthetics is going to be the first major d5 protocol to incorporate uh optimistic roll-ups and really be the first d5 protocol that is able to scale into the l2 i think there's a decent amount of uh of the justification of synthetics price based off of their being the first major adapt to scale speculation based off that and that's something that users won't find unless you are really paying attention to all of these assets and and all of the ongoing things inside of ethereum and so you can't just look at the charts and and know that so uh using that as a mental model and incorporating that into other things that are also looking to scale i think is a pretty useful thing to do yeah and on that note as well i think with synthetics it's also a unique case in that you know as i mentioned snx is used as cloud or within the system which means that most of the snx is actually sitting in the synthetic system not on exchanges so you have a low float of sn index tokens that people can actually purchase you unironically have a sell side liquidity crisis at times if there's a lot of demand for snx right so that also plays into it so this is why these these kind of assets have all these little intricacies that you need to be aware of if you want to trade them well right um and or if you want to like invest in them well uh and i guess that's why you know defect index makes this really easy because you don't have to do all that if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma

yourself unbanked today all right let's talk about the next uh asset in the dpi and that is ave it was formerly called lend so token had an absolutely incredible year even in the the dpi it's up like 300 percent or so but last year didn't it do something like 6 000 in terms of in terms of growth um like yeah it was correct what's going on with ave can it can it repeat you know not six thousand percent level growth but can it repeat some of the growth that it had in 2020 you know it's funny because a lot of people think that ah there has been live for quite a while but if you look back arves platform so its money market only launched in january of 2020. so they were actually building it out for years and as you said it was known as the lend token back then it had a much smaller market cap i think in 2019 in early 2019 they had a market cap of 5 million or something like that now it's over 2 billion dollars i think last time i checked or something crazy like that uh and yeah it's only been live for for a year they just launched their v2 so you know there's all this kind of um speculation as i mentioned before on the fact that they're going to keep growing and they have been growing they're growing like crazy uh and so everyone just like loves the albert token but it's funny because that token actually launched in 2017 as part of an ico and it kind of it went up right during the 2017 mania then it came down and it stayed down like really kind of brutalized for a while and you know some people made life-changing money on this because they scooped it up when it was low because they followed the project this is another thing if you follow the project closely and you you kind of get to know the team you get to know what they're building during bear markets it's it's it's like a perfect time because you get to it was the time they said ethereum was dead they said every project that that raised via ico was basically an exit scam right and here's obviously continuing to build and continue to ship and that's why they were so undervalued during the bear market yeah and and snx was actually in the same spot so those two are something that i commonly use as an example of you know ignoring the this is dead this is that kind of fud uh in in bear markets and just you know making sure that you understand what's actually not dead you know what kind of runway these teams still have to build out these products and and kind of like the product market fit the potential product market fit but yeah i mean ave is just like one of the best stories they went from zero to you know billions in their protocol in just a year absolutely incredible story and they are number two on the d5 pulse leader board in terms of total value locked they've got three billion assets under management right now on token terminal they are generating 56 million in revenue from an on an annualized basis which is pretty impressive with the price of sales right i think it's 50 53 million sorry oh god i'm looking at synthetics again so a price to sales uh ratio of 48. um it's a pretty impressive asset so what's what's kind of your your consensus on this then anthony are you bullish bearish neutral yeah i mean it's pretty obvious that i'm i'm very bullish on it uh going forward i think money markets you know lending borrowing is the greatest product market fee in d5 outside of amms so yeah definitely very bullish on on rbe going forward and i actually want to note one thing about their growth that i think makes it even more impressive they didn't do any liquidity mining all that growth was unsubsidized yeah that was natural growth and you don't you know a lot of d5 protocols don't have that so that's just lends itself to another kind of like really bullish aspect of rv is that their product is just so good that you don't even need to subsidize the growth wow that's a really interesting point okay let's go to our our next asset on the list which is a uniswap so tell us about uniswap yeah so i guess uni there the uniswap token uh was was launched last year um too much fanfare but i'll quickly just give an overview of uni swap and why it was revolutionary i think so uni swap launched or at least i think the idea for unisop had been around for a very long time uh vitalik actually wrote a blog post on the design for uni swap uh very early on and then hayden adams the founder of uniswap took that blog post and kind of ran with that and built a product around it launched it in uh 2018 i'm pretty sure um and then launched a v2 later on and then in 2020 they launched their token so unisop is an automated market making kind of a trading platform or swap exchange uh it basically lets anyone be a liquidity provider so if you have a bunch of uh kind of uh tokens like you have eighth and you want to kind of liquidity provide eighth against usd you can do that no one can stop you it's fully permission permissionless fully decentralized and then you can earn uh kind of exchange fees so from there uh you you know uni launched the token um and it got airdropped to every user of uni swap 400 uni tokens which uh right now is worth a lot more than it was back then i think uni is at what seven dollars i just saw so worth a nice amount of money then but at the time it was still worth i think about a thousand dollars when it first like on day one so that was like a very nice airdrop for for every uniswap user so even if you had actually failed a transaction on unisoft for one reason or another you still got uni tokens because you had interacted with the protocol so yeah you had that launch and the uni token right now is just the governance token it doesn't do anything else except governance in the future the hope is that it'll capture fees from the network and unisop is generating an insane amount of fees for the liquidity providers but there has to be a split between liquidity providers and the uni token holders so the the proposed split is that well currently 0.3 percent of all volume that goes to that goes to the liquidity providers right based on what they're providing liquidity for and their share of it and then the the proposal is that we should do 0.25 for the liquidity providers 0.05 for the token holders now that hasn't been switched on yet it's it's been kind of said that it's going to get switched on when they release v3 of their protocol um but yeah i mean uni is a funny funny token here i think you know you can see there it's not trading anywhere near as large of a premium as um the other things are because unisop actually does generate a lot of revenue um yeah so 7.2 billion market cap and 604 million annualized revenue generated by unit swap it is an absolute cash cow now to your point anthony whether uni token holders actually get a portion of that yet hasn't been decided but if that is turned on then a large portion of this cache starts to flow to uni holders which is pretty incredible it's also worth talking about that not every token has the same value capture mechanisms right so what anthony was talking about with with that point three percent fee collected by the unit swap protocol right now all of that is going to liquidity providers so token holders actually get zero percent of that fee and there's and token holders will never get 100 of that fee because it needs to incentivize deposits and so when we talk about these tokens snx ave uni it's important to know that each one captures value differently and we are just beginning to figure out how to analyze these things and understand that you know maybe uh synthetics uh has a value capture mechanism that is stronger or weaker than uniswap and therefore the fees even maybe maybe one protocol has two to 10x the fees of another protocol maybe a different protocol can capture the the fees 2 to 10x better so these are all really important conversations to have anthony how do you think about both the ability of the team the uniswap team to to innovate i'm i'm pretty bullish on the the uniswap team because they like synthetics are really exploring the fold of l2 capabilities and layer two crypto capabilities really leveraging the power of cryptography which makes me really excited about unit swap and then there's also the conversation about coinbase as well maybe you can talk about how you how you speculate into the future version of of uniswap and how you incorporate some of these things into your model about it yeah yeah i mean unisop is a community darling right within ethereum it is the quintessential d5 project that everyone talks about uh that everyone loves you know everyone loves to use uh it's it i mean literally you know pretty much everyone in ethereum and in d5 will have used union stop at least once so that that in of itself is a very bullish case for uni swap but then when you dig deeper into as you were just saying you know how is the token going to capture value right outside of the governance you know it's going to get a small portion of the fees okay so is are those fees gonna keep getting larger and larger i believe they will but are they gonna get to a point where you know uni's market cap can go to the hundreds of billions of dollars right um because it's volume and and and that it's generating is actually rivaling its centralized counterparts and you look at coinbase you know they're going to ipo this year it's said that they're going to reach 100 billion plus market cap on on that now coinbase obviously makes revenue from other areas as well not just exchange fees they have a custody business have otc stuff that they do they have a bunch of other things that they do but if we most of their revenue i believe still comes from exchange fees so if we take that as an example you know you could say that uni deserves to trade at the same valuation right at a surface level narrative and that's the narrative that gets perpetuated throughout you know crypto twitter and all that sort of stuff because it's a very easy narrative to to cling on to uh but you then you have to dig into the intricacies you know our coinbase equity holders going to get dividends right i don't know i haven't read the prospectus i don't know if they're going to give dividends out what's the share right uh what's the price the sales ratio all that sort of stuff and that then it becomes it's not a one-to-one comparable anymore you need to kind of go into the the depths of each of them and kind of work out there but i think and as i've said these things are growth kind of assets i think narrative powers more than the fundamentals for the time being in crypto and d5 because it's so new and that very very powerful narrative of uni swap doing more volume than coinbase on some days you know and centralized exchanges in general i think the asset will continue to appreciate just because of that even though it doesn't do anything except governance at the moment um and it's already worth seven billion dollars on a fully diluted basis just for governance rights so and and and you know that that that on token terminal it shows the price to sales ratio is very low but but as you said um uni token holders don't have uh access to any of that so really i mean the price of sales ratio is infinite because yeah yeah don't have uh don't have a claim to the fees yet so in in that respect it is you know just valued based on a narrative and a story and a little bit of governance value yeah and at some level so are like some stocks like you know amazon for a long time what had no profits right um bezos just kicked that back into business but i want to ask another question on on uni while we're at it it's kind of the bear case for for uni right so we we don't know how all of this will play out yet um there is a bear case that says hey liquidity is is actually fickle and because protocols like unit swap can be forked so easily we could just fork and create a uniswap clone like a sushi maybe and start vampire attacking unit swap absorb the liquidity from that project right so what's interesting about that uh counter narrative or counter thesis is um if you're buying something like the dpi you don't even have to worry about it because what will happen is a sushi will just like be indexed by the dpi as it market as its market cap grows and its governance kind of votes to include it in the next you don't even have to worry about that sort of thing but if you are buying uni the token uh on its own and not as part of an index that kind of rotates through the top defy uh assets then you do have to worry about something like that what do you make of that that kind of bear case that liquidity is fickle that uh uniswap does not have a a high moat or a strong yeah i mean sushi swap has obviously done very well over the last few months um they have uh gotten a lot of liquidity uh that they are subsidizing i just want to make note of that they're subsidizing with the sushi token um so a lot of that liquidity is floating because of that but you know people you like to say that liquidity isn't loyal and that's true to an extent but i do think there are a handful of um more than a handful like a pretty decent amount of liquidity that is loyal because you know uni swap had their liquidity mining incentives um and uh for for a little while they were giving out uni tokens for uh providing liquidity on four different pairs that lasted uh i think i think six weeks or something like that they got like i think two two billion dollars or some some crazy amount of liquidity and that left as fast as it came but there was still like over a billion dollars left in unisof and that's kept growing without the liquidity mining incentives so to me that's just sticky liquidity loyal liquidity that's there for different reasons uniswap can be considered a more secure protocol than sushi swap right people trust the uni swap protocol more there's more volume being generated on uni swap so the fees you're generating as a liquidity provider are better than sushi swap the brand awareness is better right um the interface might be better you know the way people interact with it all that sort of stuff so it's it's hard to know where this is all gonna land because you know some people say because liquidity is not loyal it's just going to be fragmented across different pools whoever's paying the most for it blah blah blah then the aggregators are going to win something like a one inch right um is going to win because that's just going to be the user facing interface and then one inch is just going to plug into wherever it's got the best price for the user which i can see happening actually in the end state um not just one inch i can actually see centralized exchanges doing this where they tap into the default liquidity pools and just act as an aggregator as well we saw shapeshift recently announced that they're actually going to be using these d5 protocols in that way um so yeah i mean and as you mentioned because it's so hard to tell the future here having something like the dpi where where you know sushi swap will get added eventually to it once it meets the criteria or or even one inch would get if if the aggregator layer becomes kind of the fat layer here the fat value then one inch would be added to the dpi yeah exactly exactly so these are just things you don't have to worry about if you have the the dpi you just get broad broad um kind of exposure to you know a bunch of different categories within d5 as well right you get the amm category you get synthetic category you get money markets you know and then you can just like rest easy knowing that i mean that's just going to keep going up because a lot of these tokens are just going to keep going up and you don't have to pick and choose so that's a very powerful thing and that's why index products are so popular in the traditional system no one wants to research 500 different companies in their s p 500 right they're happy cruising on what eight to twelve percent annualized right um on average uh with some of their their capital and they know that it's safe they know that they have exposure to the economy they're not getting inflated away and their money is actually going to grow so that's that's the end state for for defy investing i think um because there's no way an everyday investor can keep up with everything there's no way i even i can keep up with everything and all of us right um so yeah all right so that's definitely so let's finish up uni with uh bullish bearish neutral yeah i think i think neutral for uni even though i think it's gonna go up well i think the bullish case is there from a narrative point of view but for me i just i mean it's it's kind of hard to to kind of like give a really bullish investment case um in terms of like future growth i mean i i still think it's going to grow i know it's weird to say this but for me i'd rather put money into something else that maybe i feel more comfortable investing in and maybe it's like got more upside potential as an active investor within this space but i do own it as part of dpi that i own so i mean i've already got exposure so yeah definitely newton i'd say neutral bullish let's let's let's say that all right okay so let's let's turn the conversation to mkr and maker one of the oldest assets in the dfi ecosystem which also had an extremely explosive week listeners will know that the mkr is the token behind maker which is the token or which is the system behind the die stable coin which is really the the only decentralized trustless stable coin with the level of liquidity that we would expect in the defy ecosystem anthony how do you think about maker and mkr mkr has been the most brutalized defy asset uh ever i think it did not really move during d5 summer which you know people were like why isn't it moving right d5 is moving why is this thing not going up and the sentiment on mkr was very very bad until one day it decided i'm just gonna pump really hard and go 3x in like a week so the the thing about mkr is that i think the maker platform has kept growing very very rapidly it's still number one right dire supply is that all-time high there is a lot of eth in there 3.5 million eth in the maker platform backing um the die and there's a lot of usdc and wbtc all this sort of stuff so you can see here 4.2 billion dollars worth of collateral in makeup and then there's also 1.4 billion die out there exactly and and that's kept growing all throughout the time that mkr has just stayed flat right flat against usd and kind of falling very rapidly against eth um so because of that the sentiment was was really bad right you and you saw it on crypto twitter if you're on there people were ragging on it saying it doesn't have a good value capture mechanism blah blah blah um but then obviously it woke up this week and now people are suddenly bullish on it i don't know that's how the markets work but the way mkr generates fundamental value is is in basically two ways right it's a governance token first and foremost it governs the maker platform and then on top of that all the positions on maker accrue stability fees so basically this is the revenue that make the maker platform generates and those stability fees are basically used to buy and burn the mkr token so the the the real bull case for mkr is that there's so many so much fees being generated by the platform that there's always buy pressure for the mkr token so that eventually you know it's so scarce that naturally the price just depreciates because there's always demand there now there's arguments two and four kind of i mean sorry for and again sorry this uh this value accrual mechanism people say you know burning isn't the best use of of of kind of um mechanism for for a token to accrue value you should do staking and let people accrue fees themselves like directly directly accrue fees and like die or something like that and i get that model i do get the burn model as well i know david you've written a lot about this in the past was one of you some of your earlier writings which i really like really resonated with um and that thesis didn't really play out until recently and now people are like oh well you know make is growing it grew a lot right that's at all time highs across all its metrics you know well maybe maybe mkl should be worth something um so i i actually think mk is a special case in where its fundamental value was growing and its token price should have gone up but the sentiment was so bad on it that it actually trumped all that its narrative its story was not good enough because crypto runs on these narratives so now that it's it's gone up again the story kind of flips people people start asking questions you know they're like oh well how did i see this coming you know hindsight 2020 and all that so that's why mk has been a very very difficult token to invest in previously and it still is difficult to invest in um it's whether you buy that it's going to keep going up still and it wasn't just like a once-off thing but personally i mean i can see it keep going up because the maker system is not going anywhere dye is not going anywhere there's obviously demand for it i mean i use maker um and all that sort of stuff a lot of people i know use it so yeah that's like i guess the tldr on on maker 1.4 billion die is nothing to ignore maker is a really interesting protocol because it's got this dual token model so users can think of dye as the product of the maker protocol and the mkr token as like the pseudo equity the the capital asset the one that collects fees and then it deflates it deflates in supply right and so that 1.4 billion die out there is uh accruing fees somewhere depending on the collateral inside of maker dow whether it's ether usdc whoever minted that die is paying fees in the same way that if you are borrowing from compound or you're borrowing from ave you are also paying fees the difference with maker and with versus ave or compound is that the interest rates that you pay on ave or compound fluctuate according to the market rate maker those interest rates that or what we call the stability fees uh change as a result of the governance of mkr holders and the mkr holders will make a very human-led decision rather than a robot led decision like ave or compound a human-led decision to uh increase or lower the stability fees to help adjust the price of die not unlike how our central bank will issue uh more currency to keep the price of the dollar down or raise interest rates to keep the price of the dollar up very similar mechanism yet when the fees are collected by the protocol those fees go into burning the mkr token and so when we see the die the supply of dye just marching upwards basically non-stop since the genesis of the protocol into 1.4 billion dollars worth of die that's 1.4 billion dollars that the maker dial protocol is able to collect fees on right now the the average fee i think is roughly two percent it's been as high as 19 and a half percent in in previous times so if you're bullish on mkr you're bullish on more die supply as well as increasing uh stability fee interest rates right so more fees paid per die over time so all this uh david david you sound maybe that you're you're a bit bullish on mkr right now i'm not sure but let's ask the question so uh bullish bearish neutral guys on mkr anthony you want to go first yeah i think again i think neutral here because as i said it's been very very hard to trade mkr and invest in it because you know if you invested in it over the last two years you had been kind of sideways and underwater against eath uh you know um up until recently and still depending on where you bought it i mean it hasn't recovered that much against eighth i think it it peaked at like five eighth per mkr it's at like 1.3 last time i checked it was down at like 0.7 at one point so you know if you if you had bought a long time ago you're probably still not up against eve so i think the sentiment is still not great on it i can understand the fundamental value and i think dye is going to do a lot of things so neutral in that i don't think i'll be buying it but i do think that it can can go up given the right conditions so yeah i think the the fundamentals behind maker are absolutely astounding i do agree with anthony i think it's kind of a tortoise v hair kind of scenario where maker is the tortoise it's going to be slow it's going to be boring defy tokens are going to like pop off like rockets people are going to feel fomo and i don't think people are going to feel fomo about mkr just because of how old and you know mature the asset is i think it's going to be a slower slower mover but the fundamentals there are so strong are so strong and and some people are going to tap into that so net time um mkr was like my first love as a token outside of ether um so i i'm happy to see it come back into the fold of conversation um i'm long long term bullish ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com all right let's go to the next so yeah you mentioned if mkr's the the the tortoise then wiring wi-fi has got to be the hair it's had it like an absolutely crazy year anthony your thoughts on the urine protocol and wi-fi yeah wi-fi is the craziest token to ever launch i think yet maybe there's crazier ones i think you know for those who are who are around when the token went live you will know what i mean but first i'll explain what the protocol is so what uh yearn is and i guess what it has been up until this point uh is a yield farming aggregator so it basically lets you pull capital with a bunch of other people into what's called a vault and this vault will chase the best yield farming opportunities for you it will let you save on gas because it will do the trading for you you know automated all that good stuff um so that was very popular during d5 summer of course right because their yields were very high because there was all these farms popping up and tokens were going up and you know the apys were through the roof um but you know it's less popular when these there's not like a d5 bull market which you know they're not really there isn't really one at the moment right it's it's still very much i think sideways movement um with some going up here and there but it's nothing like we saw in d5 summer yet so um and then you know with with yearn also launched the wi-fi token which was uh the first quote-unquote fair launched token in in kind of d5 where andre the founder put out the token uh he said there's only going to be thirty thousand you can yield for two weeks or around two weeks there's no pre-mine there's no vc allocation everyone gets a fair shot at farming it um by putting capital into these contracts and that's how it was distributed and because of that it had an extremely strong narrative and meme for d5 summer it it is like it went nuts right it started at zero dollars essentially because you know there wasn't any initial sale went up to i think forty five thousand dollar all-time high it went on coinbase you know really quickly all these kind kind of things happened and you know the yearn protocol was growing rapidly because of the fact that yield farming was taking off so you had this incredibly powerful narrative and the token went up extremely fast within a month or two now of course you had to come down right after that why wi-fi fell harder than most default tokens it went from forty five thousand to seven thousand in a month everyone thought it was dead game over things have finished then it went back up and now it's hovering around thirty thousand right nothing's ever dead here like you know a lot of the the things that are actually dead are still not dead um in terms of coins so but anyway they kept building and they've kept building up until this point they have a lot of stuff going out um they have a lot of products in the pipeline but unfortunately the token kind of feels like a second-rate citizen in the protocol at this point um i think at the moment the the community is struggling with how this token is going to accrue value going forward it originally started as a governance token and you could put your tokens into the governance contract and accrue fees from the protocol and that was actually paying a lot during d5 summer of course but now it doesn't pay much and they've proposed to turn that kind of governance off and do a new model which is could be called it's going to be called a buy back and make where they buy back wi-fi from the market they being the developers and use that to pay salaries and things like that and there's no like fee capture but there is governance so it's kind of yeah it's kind of like this limbo state now this token um where i think it's worth as much as it's worth still because of its powerful narrative you know i think the products are still still sound and i think they've got good products coming out in the future but yeah it's it's this token is probably the hardest to value in d5 right now uh just because it could change right it could be something else next month we don't know um so it's very hard to project what what's going to happen here yeah young assets are very hard to value because it's so easy for something to change anthony what would you say to the critique that yfi was just a flash in the pan just like a it's a one-time once and done kind of kind of move it had its big claim to fame and now it's kind of just drifting off into the into the ether what would you say to somebody like that yeah i mean i can kind of sympathize with that argument um to some extent where i as i said like the token seems to be in limbo right now the the community and the developers don't really seem to know where they want the token to go like what they wanted to do um so i mean there is critique there's to be made but that's like assuming that they're not going to figure this out right so the more positive case is that they figure it out they figure out good value accrual mechanisms for this token they kill keep building good products that generate revenue and all this sort of stuff and everyone's happy but that is just like a very big risk right um you know buying the the token right now i think you'd be buying it more for the narrative the meme the story right the andre narrative too like he played a huge part in it um you know his whole persona played a huge part in it so it's a it's a massive ecosystem and a massive community but like why did they turn off the value accrual like fee mechanism so it's that i mean in the proposal they said that it's going to be temporary um the justification was given that it wasn't generating much value anymore i think it was generating maybe 1.5 a year or something like that in terms of apy for wi-fi stakers so uh they would rather you know basically use the fees generated by the yearn volts or the union platform to buy wi-fi from the market and then use that to fund developers developing the core developers essentially now obviously you know you might think well i mean that's not really a value accrual mechanism because that wi-fi is never going to be paid out and sold right on the open market because if you're paying developers with these tokens they might cash it out so eventually it finds its way back to the market anyway it's not like a make up buy back and burn right right it's a it's a buyback and spend essentially um so people are like okay well then how is that bullish for the token right like how does that generate value but then other people say well you know the more developers we fund the more we pay them the better products they're going to build and and i agree with that right you obviously need to pay people you know people need to make money um and then eventually you know as the product matures more um it kind of can accrue value so i mean to use david's kind of metaphor here it's like why your own started as like a hair and now it's gone and become a tortoise right and it's it's it's planning to play the long game now rather than that short-term game it played because that wasn't sustainable so what does that make you bullish bearish neutral on wi-fi i i still hold wi-fi um you know i'm definitely still bullish on it but i wouldn't say i'm bullish on it for fundamental kind of fee revenue reasons or value capture reasons i'm bullish on it because the story is very powerful the builders are great they have a great ecosystem that they're developing with the they're called the ykk why why co system um where they've got a bunch of projects that they've partnered with like sushi swap cream cover all these different projects so i'm bullish on that because that's like a first for d5 um but uh yeah i wouldn't say i'm holding it expecting to generate dividends if you want to call it that um anytime soon all right shall we move on to compound compound is a very interesting protocol anthony tell us your thoughts about compound yeah so compound is a money market protocol similar to rv in that you can uh lend and borrow assets on there uh it's number three as you can see on default pulse here 2.7 billion dollars lock or 2.8 billion dollars in there right now uh compound is great they've been around for a while they've been around longer than rv i think uh they are definitely the tortoise if ave is the hair and i wouldn't even say that aveza hair doesn't move that quickly but the main difference is that compound moves slower with adding assets changing system parameters you know it it plays it safer right whereas rv will play a little bit more fast and loose but they'll list additional assets that may be considered riskier than uh than what compound will do uh but you know compound is probably safer than rv for for that reason i don't know on on a fundamental level or a smart contract level but maybe maybe more people trust compound because of that you know maybe the rates are better more efficient on there because of that too um it's worth noting that compound currently still has liquidity mining i think uh where you can earn the comp token for lending and borrowing on there and it's also worth noting that compounds what kicked off d5 summer because in june of 2020 they launched their liquidity mining program which turned into what's known as yield farming and they were kind of the thing that the the the protocol that popularized it uh and they were just the very beginning and and the comp token uh launched and obviously it went up a lot from all the hype um initially and then it came down and it's gone back up during during this kind of like bull market we've seen recently um so the comp token itself is used governance of course i mean most of these things are governance tokens um i don't know if they have fee capture on yet for the comp token i don't believe they do uh last time i checked so yeah same situation as uni i think you you could say that compound is is like uni swap in terms of um you know that kind of like moving slower playing it safer not taking all these risks whereas you know sushi swap moves a lot faster um and takes more risk uh so and then i think ave does as well but i actually think sushi swap i mean sorry i actually think like something like cream which we're not going to talk about i don't think because it's not part of the default pulse index but they move even faster so yeah i mean compound is going to be around for for a while it's here to stay it's not going anywhere but yeah the main difference because people might say okay well we have arva we have compound we have cream we have all these money markets you know what are the main differences it really is that kind of like how fast they move to add new assets is a big part of that because that plays into the governance culture of how fast they want to they want to um do things and how much risk they want to take and how much risk they want to introduce to the protocol uh so and that's the same with with maker as an example here mkr governance moves very slowly right that's been a critique um but as you said david some are playing the tortoise game some are playing the hair game and i think compound is he's definitely playing the tortoise game but uh you know long term i i think it's it's a winning model for sure it's funny that that's a critique to you because it definitely does add to the robustness of the d5 ecosystem that you have um some protocols that are very conservative and and and slower and playing kind of the tortoise game and others that just move fast maybe move fast and break things at you know the the far end of the spectrum but when you look across all of this you get the speed advantage and then you also get kind of the the conservative low risk advantage and all of these projects together just make d phi a whole lot stronger because we have very we have different options i'm glad there isn't only just a compound but there's also ave and cream and that there's like not only just a uni-swap but there's also a sushi it makes for a a much stronger ecosystem i would definitely uh categorize compound and uniswap in similar categories because both of those teams are really pushing the limits of crypto economics right both of them are experimenting with l2s both of them are doing brand new things that no other protocols are doing and i think that's kind of where the theorized upside behind something like compound or unis web comes from is they they integrate with something like optimistic rollups or some sort of l2 compound is is experimenting with its own application chain and that is something that you know we are not seeing out of ave or cream and we're not seeing out of sushi swap where ave and sushi schwab are more focused on like native d5 money lego integrations and really pushing the fold with how integrations with other protocols can work whereas uniswap and compound are kind of just you know working on themselves and working on how can we how can we you know maximize the value capture using l2 uh and and using some of these very early nascent cryptoeconomic primitives that i don't think anyone else is really equipped to to work with so like ryan said really happy to see similar protocols go in two different directions because there's so much left in untapped potential in defy somebody needs to go in all directions all right so let's ask the question anthony bullish bear bearish neutral on comp neutral on comp i guess yeah neutral on calm neutral bullish maybe i i haven't kept up too much with all of the work that they're doing i know you know high level what they're doing and i kind of was bearish and still ambi bearish on their application chain that they want to build i don't really see the point of it um uh until recently actually i um you know we saw that the occ in the us said that um federally chartered banks could use blockchains as sediment layers public blockchains and settlement layers so maybe the comp chain kind of fits into that and the banks are more comfortable using something like a comp chain rather than ethereum maybe there's a case there but yeah i mean i'm i'm definitely neutral i still don't think they're going to grow i just think that yeah i i i that kind of comp chain thing gave me pause but other than that yeah definitely uh still think it's great all right let's get into loopering loopering i feel like is the the most unique asset so far in the sense that it just pertains to an l2 network anthony can you go ahead and get into a loopering for us yeah loopering's been leading the l2 charge uh for a little while now so they have two uh different exchanges on layer two they have an amm exchange or something like a uni swap uh like exchange on layer two and they also have an order book based exchange so something like a traditional kind of uh centralized exchange order book model um and they've seen some incredible growth recently uh on their layer 2. they've they have over 100 million dollars locked in there now they're doing liquidity mining on there to get people to migrate across and they're really leading the charge here they're using uh zero knowledge roll ups or zk roll ups which is a different technology to what some of the others like synthetics and unisop are going to use uh they're going to use um optimistic roll-ups from optimism uh so and and blueprint have built their own zk roll-ups as well i don't think they're actually using any other companies uh so that's even more impressive but yeah they've seen some incredible growth you can see on the on the chart there yeah anthony what happened here so what happened on january 1st because we see total lock value just shoot right up massively and also token price yeah yeah i i think i mean token price would play into that a little bit because they have lrc on their exchange um that you can use but also they did a liquidity mining program which had people put their tokens on l2 and you know to earn their lrc rewards on there um so i mean i think that's needed you know liquidity mining programs are really great for incentivizing that early liquidity and we need that for layer two so i think loopring deeply understands this and that's why they've done it and they haven't done it in a super speculative way where you're earning like a thousand apy or whatever like or none of that they've done it in a proper sustainable way which i'm really impressed by and yeah they've just made the great layer to exchange uh and and one of the first that actually has traction because you know unisop's coming with it but we don't know when um you know i'm sure sushi swaps looking into this i'm sure other projects like xerox maybe are looking into it and stuff like that but yeah i think that they've just had lots of success being first move this year and being innovators so i applaud them on that so what's the value capture mechanism for the lrc token this is something i'm not familiar with i i wouldn't say i'm an expert on the lrc token itself i'm going to assume that it will have governance rights and that it will have a fee capture on both layer one and layer two if they have a layer one exchange as well um but yeah i think the token itself is probably in in kind of like early stages where they probably haven't figured out the value capture mechanisms yet or implemented it at least because i imagine that they're very focused on growing the liquidity on their layer to exchange first before worrying about the token this is something else that's really nice about buying an index because like loopering is just the first i mean i know we've all talked about before and you've written about this anthony that there's going to be kind of a layer two war for liquidity and for users right and this is the only layer two token in here it it probably won't be the last so with an index you don't have to pick the winners you just kind of they float up in inside the index which is which is kind of nice exactly and i think you know lrc the token wasn't one that was talked about as part of the mainstream consciousness of default tokens but it went up a lot because people were sleeping on it right so as you said with the d5 pulse index you don't have to even pay attention to any of this it's already in there you already caught that upside uh which is just i mean it's great because there's nothing worse than you know going on coin gecko and looking at something that went up a lot and being like wow why didn't i buy that right um and then yeah that's why the the index products are really beautiful i think uh for sure all right so let's move to ren ren is i think uh the most unique asset in this category because it's a cross-chain token uh anthony what can you tell us about ren yeah so ren uh i guess it used to be called republic protocol uh it's a it's quite an old asset i think they launched in either 2017 or 2018 their asset uh but basically what their their platform does it's a cross-chain kind of bridge they have uh ren btc um which is like a bitcoin tokenized bitcoin on ethereum uh they claim it uh to be to be fully decentralized i i think that that claim was actually debunked recently where there was centralization vectors but basically they have like a network of nodes that they call dark nodes i think that let you do these kind of cross-chain transactions um in terms of the token itself i think on the dark nodes you have to stake these tokens i'm pretty sure that the um the token also gives you kind of fee capture because to use the bridge it generates fees and obviously that goes to the the node runners and things like that and i believe it's probably a governance token as well i mean i'm just assuming that all these things have some sort of governance built in because you know if you want your protocol to be more decentralized you don't want to be the the admin key holder you need to offer incentives to do governance so um but yeah they've seen some really great growth because of red and btc over the past few months you know we have so much tokenized btc on ethereum now the largest obviously being roughed bitcoin which is uh the centralized rainbtc aims to be a decentralized version but they're all also competing against something like tbtc um but ren i guess goes beyond just btc they're trying to tokenize a bunch of assets from from kind of different protocols but it also speaks to like what's the demand for this bridging right um there's also roon as well thought chain which is a very very popular thing especially on crypto twitter um that is competing in that area so yeah it's it's kind of like the growth has been great but it's kind of like hard to to value this thing um when there's so much competition and it was so early in the cross chain kind of uh thing right now yeah the investment thesis behind ren really depends on there being like a poly chain ecosystem that really has many assets that for some reason need to be transferred between blockchains right now the only the only multi-chain ecosystem i can really see is between bitcoin and ethereum so for i think the long-term case for rent would really need to require you know many many chains with many many valuable assets um so you would you would need to believe in that it's also worth noting that while ren is a token that provides crypto economic assurances to transfer tokens between chains the team has a backdoor in the same way that you know the compound team had a back door to compound before they plugged it up with a comp token the rent team currently has a back door so it is not trustless the goal is to make it more trustless with the rent token but that is not there yet so that is something that is worth noting especially when we come and start talking about you know how to evaluate tokens whether or not the team has a backdoor is definitely something that people should include in their research bullish bearish neutral guys on red i'm going to go yeah i'm going to go with neutral because i don't know enough to be bullish or bearish about it um yeah but i i just to david's point quickly i think you know a lot of the stuff we've spoken about today um i think you know not just those but like a lot of other d5 protocols have these admin keys or backdoors and stuff like that um because they're young right uh you know a lot of the d5 pulse index don't like maker doesn't because they have the on-chain governance right but synthetic still does even though synthetic is the largest kind of um token in that index right you if that's something that you're that concerns you if you think that for some reason the team's gonna do something that's gonna jeopardize the protocol with your admin key then that's something to keep in mind um i wouldn't say it's like a major risk for the top d5 protocols but it is a risk all right let's turn to kyber network kyber a very another very old asset in the d5 ecosystem anthony what can you tell us about kyber and the knc token yeah so kyber was very popular last year i think um there was like a very strong narrative around it but i haven't heard much about it lately but basically from memory and maybe i'm misremembering here i haven't looked it in a little while but from memory they they do a buy and burn model as well where k c is burnt they also have a staking model where you can state k c and earn fees that are generated by their exchange uh in eth so it's actually paid out in eighth not in knc one of the few tokens that pays out youth dividends yeah yeah so that i thought that was very cool but i think uh and just for for kind of context the kyber network is basically a an exchange aggregator um they have liquidity pools that they pull from and you know they give you the price and that that space is obviously pretty crowded now you know you have one inch you have dexag you have power swap there's a bunch of others um so i think you know i saw a post recently from kyber's ceo i think they're trying to i guess re-evaluate what their protocol is and where it sits within d5 from a strategic point of view um because yeah over the last few months they've kind of like sat flat um they're they're kind of i i wouldn't i wouldn't say they're getting out competed but you know the other things have have grown more than them the other aggregators and stuff like that so you know investing in knc right now is probably pretty risky because you're betting that the team will figure out you know where to go next right you're basically betting on the team you're not betting on the protocol anymore or the growth of it you're betting on the team being able to plug whatever kind of hole has been you know pushing knc down more than um you know more than maybe it should be but yeah uh i think that's kind of the gist of it uh i hope to see them kind of like come back from the little i guess maybe the little hole that they're in right now because they're a great team they've been kicking away since 2017 as well they're one of the first d5 protocols but such is life with being the first is that you build during the bear market you do all the hard work and then someone comes and forks you and does it better because they have all the stuff to work from so you know this is the risk of building in d5 for for these teams i think i think one of the bold cases for kyber for knc is that uh with uniswap providing liquidity to uniswap is very capital intensive and providing capital to kyber is less intensive you can get more liquidity from less total capital when you provide it to kyber and so if kyber can collect you know comparable amount of fees you can keep that capital allocation low while still collecting a decent healthy amount of fees that's my understanding for the bulk case for for the knc token um i do it does have a competitive advantages and disadvantages to other things and so just that uniqueness i think gives it a lot of sticking power but it really takes a little bit more of deep diving into research and value accrual to really be able to place this token in relation to other you know market making tokens bullish bearish neutral neutral neutral neutral all right well we made it to the last one balancer balancer i really like balancer as a project uh let's get anthony's opinion on balancer and the bal token yes so i mean i'm the same as you i really like balancer as a project i think they are doing innovative stuff but the major issue with balancer i think and the reason why they maybe haven't seen more i don't know what their volume is right now i think their volume isn't like as high as you would want it to be for the amount of liquidity that they have in there because they're actually subsidizing a lot of that liquidity with liquidity mining rewards paid out in the bowel token um but their problem is that their interface is shocking right the balancer exchange interface is not friendly to noobs um the last time i checked i don't even know if they've updated it at this point um it's it's just very difficult for noobs to to uh navigate um it's very difficult for for even not even just noobs like people in general to and even in d5 to navigate so i think that's let them down a little bit they're obviously competing with in the amm space with uh uni swap and sushi swap and all the other ones um balancer lets you do some things like adjustable fees let you have up to eight tokens in a pool but i actually and this is what i originally thought about balancer i kind of thought that the adjustable fees thing was actually something that shouldn't have been implemented because the only reason people provide liquidity without the incentives is to generate fees or at least that's one of the reasons one of the major reasons now if you have a protocol where you can adjust fees and there's all this stuff happens you and then everyone can spin up these pools with different fees you fragment the liquidity right because and and and with with uni swap it's just a flat fee it's 0.3 so everyone is just paying the same no matter if you spin up the same pool or whatever whereas on balancer you know you can do different weightings and different fees and it just it complicates things i think to the point where it's just too complex for most people to to grasp um you know the volume uh because it's going a lot through aggregators i think aggregators usually choose other exchanges like uni swap and sushi swap and things before they choose balancer because it's just better the prices are just better because the weightings aren't you know always 50 50 they're not you know custom the fees are always flat right at 0.3 percent so you know that's why i think balance hasn't seen more success here but um i i think that the fact that they've got you know the up to eight tokens in the pools and stuff like that and the adjustable rates and fees is innovative i just don't know if there's product market fit for that right i don't know if that's going to be a long-term successful model and it's also something that uni swap can just put in if it wanted to right it's not like it's like they could literally just change a few lines of code probably and do that um i don't know maybe maybe not but you know it's not something that they can look at and be like oh we can't do that because balancer did it i just explained to you like it's all open source so anyone can anyone can do this so um yeah maybe you have a more bullish case than i do i wouldn't say i'm bearish i just think that we need to see some more action happening on the balancer side of things yeah i do think that balancer might be the thing that captures the long tail of amm value uh things like currencies like you know the ethics usdc wbtc usdc i think those are much more appropriate to uniswap however there are things that balancer can do that no other protocol can do and what balancer really is is a much much more flexible unit swap and there's a lot of value in that as well the the the t-shirts that ryan and i sold through bank list we would not have been able to do that through unit swap we needed that flexibility that balancer offers that that differential weighting where uniswap locks you into 5050 but balancer can make a pool that's 90 10 80 20 or you know adjustable so it can start you know 90 10 and then finish 1090 then you can adjust fees based off of you know some sort of logic so like not only can you change the fees but you can also change how how you change the fees right so everything gets really modular and flexible and i think maybe one of the reasons why balancer is kind of lagged behind in growth is that they are trying to go in all directions all at the same time there's so much left to do before a balancer can really consider itself done and i don't think we know what the version of balancer is going to be when it's finished doing all of the things that it needs to to build itself out on you know one of the things that really gets me excited about something like balancer is that the the adjustable fees can can reflect the changing market environment and a great way to view this is like surge pricing with your uber right if there is high demand for your uber uber will charge you more and balancer can do the same thing with volume on some of the balancer pool so if there's more volume going through a balancer pool balancer can increase the fees for that pool in that specific moment to adjust to market demands that flexibility is really powerful i just don't think people have learned how to leverage some of these powers that balancer is giving to the world i almost think it's a little bit like the apple versus android where it's like unit swap is like it provides the the easy button apple just there's not a lot of options you know exactly what to do whereas you know android there's infinite customizability on top of this thing and balancer is has all of those properties but the trade-off there is it's a bit more complicated to use and to grok and to understand yeah i mean that's that's kind of i guess what i was alluding to that is that modularity might actually be the thing that prevents balance's growth because i think liquidity providing um because it's you know on uni swap and stuff because it's so simple right you know that it's 50 50.3 fee that's it that's all you have to think about now with balancer there's a lot of other things you have to consider now as a as a just a simple liquidity provider someone who just wants to put liquidity in and forget about it right obviously unit swap is probably going to appeal a lot more to you now the question is are there more of those people or are there more people who care about the modularity the customization right and i actually think that it's it's the former because using your analogy ryan um you know apple i mean android phones pretty much look like apple phones now it used to be all about customization and customizing literally everything you do on it but most people's android phones are a samsung and they all look the same to me whenever i look at someone's android like no one really cares about customizing their phone that much um so it's all about like how much kind of like uh i guess people care about what um and not to say that balancer can't succeed or anything you're not to say that you know maybe there is a lot of people that do care about that or not just peel but liquidity um but yeah that modularity is letting them down right now i think um because people just it's too complex there's no there's no like i guess like a shelling point right to go to it's like there's nothing to there's people just doing a million different things in a million different experiments but we need to get to that point where they all converge and people learn the best practices of how to use balancer and i just don't think we're there at that point all right bullish bearish neutral let's start with anthony uh definitely definitely neutral because i i can see the value i just need to see it play out um for for me to be convinced i'm long-term bullish and i think when uh bigger players bigger funds start to get into ethereum balancer offers really compelling tools for funds to manage their own assets i think we're gonna have to wait for them to really come into the ecosystem and mature and figure out how to play in defy but once those types of people get in balancers offers really compelling infrastructure to them guys we went through the dpi 10. that was fantastic anthony thank you for your insight so much maybe just could you spend a minute talking about a couple of honorable mentions maybe some assets that you think could jump into the dpi index in in the next couple of quarters yeah so i mean i spoke about how there's a certain criteria that tokens have to meet to be included in the dpi one of the strictest criteria is that uh it needs to be uh live for six months the project so six months or more and then it's eligible but there's a bunch of other criteria but that is the one that prevents most of the tokens from coming in uh and that was put forward by default pulse the creators of the index so i guess honorable mentions and ones that i think will go in soon because they're coming of age so to speak uh sushi swap definitely that uh token and that project has had a renaissance over the last two to three months it has become a community darling they're doing a lot of innovative things and as i said their project is coming up on six months so they'll be eligible for inclusion uh i don't see a reason why that won't get included so definitely think that that's going in when it can what about curve how if curve is got a ton of value locked how come curve it hasn't made it into the d5 pulse index yet from memory i think it was because uh when their token launched the one of the criteria is that more than five percent of the token has to be in circulation and their token launched with basically zero in circulation and has been increasing since then i think at this point it is eligible i have to double check but i think it is eligible um which means that uh it can be included during the next rebalance um but that's up to default pulse who are the managers of this index uh along with the index co-op which is a dow that actually manages these index products as well so and i don't even we've never done something where we've included two tokens in the same rebalance rebalance seven monthly so i don't think there's anything preventing us from doing that but yeah curve should be eligible at this point you can actually go to pulse dot inc that's where the methodology is if people want to see what the criteria is for uh every token uh inc inc um yeah you can scroll down and it'll show you like the methodology um i think down the bottom yeah so there's the basically methodology there of of why tokens aren't included or which ones can get included um yeah so i think oh there we go it's 7.5 percent of its supply not 5 so um i think curve is at that point so yeah it's probably eligible well you guys this has been a walk through the tokens in the dpi as well as a few others there are so many more tokens listed on defy pulse that are worth paying attention to the purpose of this episode was really to kind of go through the big ones so you could learn how anthony thinks how we think about some of these tokens and use some of these anal analytical tools and analytical mental models to do your own research right this is how we do research this is how we think about these things so if you start to use that as your mental models you will be better equipped to do your own research i think that defy summer is coming it'll be d5 winter this time because it's you know it's january but d5 summer 2.0 i think that's here hopefully this episode will provide the listeners with really good mental models for how to understand what might be a really awesome time i put out a tweet not too long ago that you know if you look listen closely default you can hear the sound of defy tokens popping off and i i kind of think that we're in like second 45 of like the three-minute microwave popcorn bag where things you start to hear like a single pop a second pop but things are starting to heat up that's where i think we are and i hope this episode kind of uh leads into that market anthony thank you so much for joining us we we hope by the time listeners hear this you are out of twitter jail sir and eath has exceeded 1420 its all-time high yeah always a pleasure gents uh thank you for having me on again i hope that you know this helps a lot of people listening to it to better analyze different defect tokens and yeah definitely hope that ethan is that all-time high sooner rather than later all right fingers crossed guys risks and disclaimers of course none of this was financial advice you need to do your own research defy is risky so is it so is crypto you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
