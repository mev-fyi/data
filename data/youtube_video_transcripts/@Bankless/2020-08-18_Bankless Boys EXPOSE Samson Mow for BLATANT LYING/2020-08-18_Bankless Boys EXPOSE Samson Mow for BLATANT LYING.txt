um i was listening to the peter mccormick uh vitalik interview with uh samson um did you catch that david yeah uh it it pissed me off man i i had to turn it off last night and this is one thing i'm concerned about with vitalik because i wanted vitalik to take the offensive because he wouldn't vitalik is very very peaceful he's very pacifist and samson was being a [ __ ] [ __ ] he was being a bully he was being a bully and and he was just being a wrong bully and vitality wouldn't call him out on it because of how nice vitalik is and like it was the most disappointing don't you think david like that came through to anyone who was listening i was just like so sure man i'm not so sure because peter mccormick's audience are a bunch of bitcoiners that hear things like what samson mouse says as like gospel i am not so sure yeah i mean what one of the things that that kills me with criticism is like things like and this is back to relate back to our question uh our earlier conversation is um you know kept pressing vitalik on gas fees that sort of thing bitcoin has the same freaking problem when bitcoin is in high demand bitcoin block spaces in high demand transactions become too expensive to use only you know what they do to scale bitcoin is it scales essentially on crypto bank infrastructure on side chains like coinbase and binance and that sort of thing right whereas ethereum has a slew of other options i just find a lot of the criticisms aren't equally applied to both to both networks the part the part that pissed me off the most was uh and to to continue your conversation of how bitcoin scales bitcoin is going to scale on ethereum and that's going to be how it scales without having to succumb to to crypto banks if you want to use a bitcoin expressively it's going to come to ethereum yeah bitcoiners got really excited about uh the microstrategy purchase of like 21 000 bitcoins well there's 43 000 bitcoins on ethereum like that's twice yeah yeah so converting that to monetary terms it's 250 million versus like something like 500 million right right so microstrategy purchased 250 million bitcoin and there's already 500 million tokenized bitcoin on ethereum right and so ethereum is going to scale we are currently scaling and bitcoin is going to scale by coming over to ethereum and what you know what what really pissed me off the most was that samson mao uh said to vitalik to his face on the podcast lying through his teeth that people in d5 are preferring to use wrapped versions of bitcoin instead of oh dude it offered a stronger foundation is that where you turned it off that's right i was like this is this is absolutely ridiculous it's a lie the the the belief is that bitcoin itself is a is a found a very sturdy foundation and that you you build big structures on sturdy foundations and ethereum isn't that dirty of a foundation that's a fair criticism and that's the criticism that was baked into that argument but what samson mao forgot about is that in order to get bitcoin onto ethereum you have to have trust in something like run btc that you have to make sure that protocol works or wrapped bitcoin you have to make that bitco is going to do that correctly or tbtc like they haven't gotten out the gate but he didn't see tbtc you actually have to have to make the trustless yeah bitcoin work and so he just glossed over this massive trust assumption that this is just going to work because he wanted to spin the narrative of just like yeah you know people in d5 want to use wbtc which is just abjectly false yeah oh got it riled it just [ __ ] riled me up it me too because i think that is the um the deception that's going on right like um to be honest the bitcoin story is is simple to understand but like when they lie about the ethereum story it frustrates me here's the thing is the other thing samson was doing it pissed me off is i consider myself a bitcoiner right all right same like if you ask me but i'm not samson bitcoiner right right like that like bitcoiners are right maximalists are wrong right you know like i can be a bitcoiner and also be an etherian right right i mean that's what the bankless nation is it's optimizing for the most bankless money system wherever it exists and so his i think his painting of bitcoiners as pure maximalist is um it's just not going to age well you know i don't think that's why people are entering the space war you know what i think he's doing what i think he's playing the bitcoin game and the bitcoin game is to get everyone to buy bitcoin and so he's playing a game where he is trying to brainwash people by lying in order to get them to play the game because when more people play the bitcoin game bitcoiners the people that have have already been playing the bitcoin game win right and so i think it is a and also samsung male comes from block stream which is an attempt to build a expressive side chain for bitcoin on ethereum or big btc on bitcoin and there's no bigger stronger competitor than ethereum to block stream it's not it's not bitcoin versus ethereum it's block stream versus ethereum like no [ __ ] samson mao doesn't like vitalik and what he's built because his ethereum is going to make block stream completely redundant and unnecessary and also by the way uh james presswitch who is a very great developer on both bitcoin and ethereum discovered a bug in the block stream liquid network that is where this bitcoin gets its expressivity that would allow someone to steal all the bitcoins and like he's talking about how ethereum is like this shaky foundation while his own liquid had this bug for months that no one discovered because no one [ __ ] uses it excuse me i'm using the f-word look man i i think you're right i mean full circle here right samson is playing the game however i have a massive problem when you're playing the game unethically when you're lying about it right and by the way that's not the game i'm playing right like i i want i want a money system to actually be good for the world right i don't i don't [ __ ] care if like bitcoin gets to trillions of dollars but all we're left with is a banked money system that doesn't restore self-sovereignty to individuals like that's why i'm here and um i do think the tide is shifting a little bit david like um i think people who listen to bank lists and then tune into the mccormick interview are like oh wow is this really the kind of the intellectual mecca of maximalist because it's empty it's like a dry cause of the positive skeletons there's like nothing there there's no organic material there's no substance there so i'm that's what that's why i continued to listen to the episode because i was just like wow this is the best you've got yeah it's man i what i want to see a debate of is honestly is um like uh an aetherian um debating on like ether you know i feel like we could make the argument a little bit better right as to why ethereum might fail yeah um absolutely that was not it that was not it was not it no that that was a a bag inspired uh uh conversation from from samson mao and that's kind of why like vitalik's such a nice guy like he means the best he doesn't really want to get offensive but i would love to see a world where vitalik like brought out the teeth because he could vitality's very witty very valid vitalik is really clever and i think if he wanted to if you if he practiced at it he could destroy samson now yeah i know he's just um he's too nice he's too nice he's a better human to be honest yeah he's better than all of us that's for sure yeah so anyway
