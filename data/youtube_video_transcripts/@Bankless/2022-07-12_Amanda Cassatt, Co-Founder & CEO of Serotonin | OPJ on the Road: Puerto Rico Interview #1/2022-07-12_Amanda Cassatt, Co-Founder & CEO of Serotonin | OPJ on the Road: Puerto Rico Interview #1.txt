[Music] hey everyone a quick note before we dive in here this is an interview i recorded back in february of this year as part of a documentary i'm putting out on the nft and crypto art scene in puerto rico puerto rico has amazing things happening when it comes to nft's crypto and i really wanted to capture it so that documentary will be coming out the end of this month in all likelihood so keep your eyes peeled for that but in the meantime i wanted to release some of the full-length interviews i did with folks during my time there so this is a conversation i had with amanda cassatt who's so incredible some of you may know who she is she was the cmo for consensus as in metamask consensus from 2016 to 2019 she was really essentially the cmo for ethereum during that time amanda is now the founder and ceo of serotonin which is a leading web 3 marketing agency that's on off mojito which is a web3 platform for commerce community brand engagement and building engagement so she's really a gigabyte in the space i'm so glad i got to speak with her and i think you are going to really enjoy this conversation before we get into it we do need to hear a word from our sponsor who i'm happy to say is metamask so thank you so much for metamask for sponsoring this content they sponsored the documentary they've been an awesome partner and i really hope you enjoy metamask is the leading web3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just getting started on your nft journey you need metamask and if you need to fund your metamask account in order to buy that nft that you've been eyeing well now you can do that directly through metamask just click the blue buy button on the home screen personally i'm mad that i've spent extra gas fees transferring money from coinbase to metamask in order to buy nfts i've been using metamasks directly and it is so much better you can also buy stable coins and native tokens on ethereum polygon avalanche ceilo and others and you can do it directly with your debit card your credit card through apple pay or google pay and there is now an improved buying experience on metamask mobile you'll only see tokens that are in your region so it's personalized to you and you'll get real-time quotes so you know you're always getting the best deal if you haven't downloaded metamask yet what are you waiting for go try it out you can learn more about buying cryptocurrencies with metamask at metamask dot io slash buy dash crypto amanda i'm so pumped we're here you are the one who introduced me to the concept of the cannon club somebody else had mentioned the gallery inn but you were like carly we're going to the cannon club we're getting drinks and it's going to be fantastic and here we are in like the most gorgeous setting i can imagine in old san juan the canon club is where it's at yeah cool well i'm so excited to dive into so much with you you were like the marketer for ethereum essentially for like ethereum itself for like several years what was your journey into web 3 and sort of like where we are now i know that's a ton of space but tell people like where you were why i called you the marketer of ethereum and like your deal yeah sure so um i first learned about ethereum in 2015. i was it even was it yeah yeah it was it was it was it was just out um vitalik's white paper when he created ethereum was 2013. um earlier than i realized and then they you know they they raised 16 million dollars in the ethereum pre-sale so there was 16 million dollars of capital looking to buy 30 cents ethereum at the time and so we have to kind of paradigm shift into the mindset of what it's like when you're creating something new and people don't know what it is yet and people don't care yet and now looking back it's easy to see it as inevitable or see it as obvious but let that 16 million dollars of capital tell you how non-obvious it was i was able to raise more than that for our startup probably with less trouble uh than the original ethereum founders were able to raise that 16 million so just saying yeah to give that content and was there other there was bitcoin of course and then was like their litecoin like were other coins out there yeah yeah so so there's bitcoin and i never really learned about bitcoin early on i just wasn't part of those hacker newsletters message boards whatever um i wish i had that you weren't on that reddit i wasn't on that thread i wish i'd learned about it obviously at the time but i i didn't um and so so my path to it was a little bit different um i was um in media i worked at uh the huffington post then i had my own media startup that was without calling it this uh a decentralized micropayment based media startup what we did was it was called slant we micro paid journalists and journalism school students and college students for content based on the ad revenue served across it and we'd give them 70 of the revenue and a lot of times we were splitting the dollar splitting the cent and so even though the business model worked out logically it kind of didn't work out practically because of those third-party payment processors you couldn't actually fractionalize a dollar but you're just paying you're just paying a big spread to that third-party payment processor um and so i learned a lot about payments uh through that process and got obsessed with payments and so when i was kind of a knucklehead knocking around brooklyn uh hard to imagine it was a knucklehead but i understand thank you i was going to meet ups i was talking to people i had this kind of payments obsession and so i bumped into joe lubin uh andrew keys sam cassette you'll notice that my name is now cassette that's a whole nother story one more one more uh sparkling margarita will get there even half even half i'm a lightweight these days um but yeah um so i met some of the early ethereum folks from just kind of hanging out and it blew my mind uh when they explained to me what the technology could do not only did it solve my startups problem with the micropayments but it unlocked all these different business models fractionalization micropayments remittances in all of these different categories and every time i thought about a new sector or new industry and all the business types that are possible enabled by peer-to-peer transactions enabled by smart contracts enabled by permissionlessness it just kind of blew my mind and i realized that i needed to join the circus so i did and this is now 2015 2016 this is 2015 2016. um 2016 i'm officially uh chief marketing officer at consensus and consensus had um consensus on the ethereum foundation had split the ethereum foundation to continue building the code base of ethereum and vitalik leading that as its chief scientist and there's also an executive director and then consensus still doing a lot of the at the time a lot of the uh work with with the code um maintaining several versions um created the erc20 token standard fun fact but also starting to build some of the um not only commercial applications but the tools and rails that would enable commercialization famously metamask is a consensus yeah but also infuria truffle git coin collido and also a lot of things that didn't work right like 99 of startups fail i think consensus had an unusually high success rate compared to just your average even investor um or venture studio and obviously recently this extraordinary success with metamask but during my time as cmo consensus from 2016 through 2019 what one of the things i was most proud of was building out each of our startups not just as this is a startup doing x but as a case study for what you could do with ethereum so whether or not that project worked sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't it was showcasing to others what ethereum could do and they would end up and there would end up being all kinds of projects inspired by those projects even ones that didn't work out for example ujja um jesse grushak working on nfts for music um in i don't know what it was he started so early 2016 maybe even 2015. um and now you have really great projects in that space like royal like audiences that um that are inspired by that that are maybe even using some of the uh information from it that are advised by some of the same people and so a lot of things were too early but a lot of things worked and some of them ended up just being kind of the ancestor of some of the leading projects right now so i built out what ended up being an 80-person department by the end of my time there that included content building a big content engine about ethereum media telling the story about ethereum web 3. we were using that term very early nfts dows d5 d5 really wasn't as popular at the beginning but it became popular as a term um the ico boom we tried to call icos tges token generation events because we all know what ip ico rhymes with and i know that that might might bother certain people um so content pr um product marketing growth marketing um design both like brand design and product design um and you build out this whole team at consensus that then would get deployed to these companies that you're essentially incubating your metamask your fiera et cetera et cetera exactly and is that still a consensus operates yeah so um i was there between 2016 and 2019 through kind of ethereum's early crucial growth period and i saw my role as really being kind of ethereum storytelling booster rocket to the degree that i could serve in that capacity from my from my position um and so that's really what i was doing um and so yes that that department which we called catalyst we rebranded the word marketing um and we because because marketing gets a bad name yeah um what else reminds me of like dee's being chief vibes office officer you know like i think this space in general like i don't know about that but you're like don't compare me to that i don't know but uh but we called it something else and so we were we were working on the core consensus brand um we were putting out messaging about ethereum into the world and we were working in kind of a service capacity with all of the different um what we would call portfolio companies of consensus um but inside of consensus we'd call that the consensus mesh and whether it works that way or not these days is another story i can tell you about everything in consensus through 2019 and then my my authority fades and we're going to get into what you have done since 2019 but i want to ask you because and probably to some extent your role still is in the work you do now but like your your role was telling the story of ethereum what do you think are like the biggest misperceptions that you see out in the world in the mainstream about ethereum about crypto about this space yeah um so when i started in my role i was actually already trying to correct a big misperception okay um and that misperception was that there was something dark about bitcoin because most people found out about bitcoin from the silk road um and so uh they thought it's for buying drugs it's for you know illegal transactions because that's how they'd been introduced to the technology um so we were very intentional um trying to brand ethereum as something light and bright and luckily the personality of its founders and its early community really tallied with that i'm like i'm like literally picturing metallic memes right now i know i know pajamas like public places yeah yeah so light and bright in that regard but also in terms of enterprise adoption and so you get in 2017 february 28th 2017. i have that i have that date and blazing in my memory was the day of the launch of the enterprise ethereum alliance which really was the uh which lit the which lit the fire of ethereum price action um and basically in a single day we announced that we'd created this uh industry group um of a number of leading organizations microsoft was there jp morgan santander accenture intel a number of banks a number of software companies a number of startups and consensus and they were pledging to help create a set of standards for the enterprise adoption of ethereum and announcing that they had working groups experimenting with ethereum and so when i say light and bright i don't just mean cats and rainbows although i kind of mean cats and rainbows um i also mean um being really clear that that this can be used by banks can be used by enterprises legitimate upfront upstanding institutions it's safe the water's warm come on yeah and that there's that potential uh for them and and i think people forget now that it was really the endorsements of those large enterprises that gave the market the confidence in ethereum to start investing in it heavily on a retail level and on an institutional level because before that when you googled ethereum you got vitalik which is great for certain demographics that's going to be appealing to certain demographics it's appealing to me i mean he's incredible yeah um but now after the launch of the eea when you googled ethereum you got santander's president julio fora and that's going to appeal to a different group of people and so that really um that really changed the world um and then there are people that will say oh i don't care about traditional and old school enterprises adopting this technology and that may be and that's a valid perspective but the news cycles that came out of the price action that came out of that adoption brought tons of developers into the space and just brought tons of awareness which brought venture capital investment which brought demand pull on developers and other kinds of staff members and so it started to spin a flywheel of growth um and so that part of the story is actually extremely important why do you think or what do you think i guess of the criticisms that you get now from like jack dorsey's of the world right saying like this whole decentralization thing is kind of because really the new master is just the vcs right like not true okay oh so do you know that do you know that that argument though that folks make out there i do so i want to arrive there but i want to i want to go through your previous question first about the misconception so when i started working on ethereum i immediately was trying to correct the misconception that crypto from bitcoin that crypto in general is for dark human trafficking dark arts um because there are obviously a lot of other use cases so that was one of the first um the i want to address that misconception um that it's that it's just the same people um but i want to the the one that i've seen circulating the most recently is actually um the environmental one yeah um which you know i think it's interesting and the the thing is so nuanced that it deserves actual explanation and i was recently in a vogue article about sustainability in nfts and i spent a lot of time with her to actually lay this out because it's so easy to say you know this is bad for the environment well what does that mean right what is bad i mean so one of the core misconceptions i think has to do with the fact that mining and minting are just one tea apart and so some folks think that when you uh mint an nft that you're doing the activity computation the computation of mining and so what i've tried to spread awareness about is that essentially whether you mint 1 or 1 billion nfts you're not changing the marginal energy usage of the ethereum blockchain you are using the ethereum blockchain because that's offering you that base settlement layer that's going to enable your nft to have value because it's going to run on an actual decentralized blockchain and so you're pulling on nft existence as a concept is still pulling on this system called ethereum that requires energy to function in its current proof-of-work mechanism so you need the ethereum blockchain underserving this nft process but as we talked about minting one versus one billion nfts doesn't change the marginal energy usage of the underlying ethereum blockchain that being said the underlying ethereum blockchain that it pulls on is energy intensive in that it to the degree that it uses a proof-of-work mining algorithm but 90-plus percent of the energy that goes into eth mining into the ethereum network is from mining it's not from transactions it's not from nft minting and so there's a huge misconception about that and then on the actual energy front um two things the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake according to the ethereum foundation reduces the carbon footprint of the ethereum blockchain by something like 95 percent and then in addition to that there's a larger kind of conceptual question which i think is interesting to all environmentalists which is is the problem energy use or is the problem fuel mix so if we're using nuclear if we're using water if we're new if we're using and there are some issues with the intermittencies in in solar um and in wind but if we're using those power types and even doing a more energy intensive proof of work kind of mining and using that energy but the energy comes from those sources that aren't adding to co2 levels then is it a bad thing and i think just for environmentalists separating out energy mix from simple energy consumption is a really interesting leap to make that i think sends us in the right direction of investing in less pollutant sources of energy rather than telling humanity that your value-creating activities of very sort of various sorts aren't good to do because they use energy in theory this should be an incentivization to get to and there is right so so proof of work style mining usually bitcoin mining actually provides an enormous incentive and you can see this happening everywhere you see vertically integrated bitcoin mining operations are incentives for miners to chase renewable sources of energy which are typically cheaper yeah um and so then the other kind of miscon or misframing is it's never put in context when you hear about environment and blockchains it's it's never put in context of the energy use of the traditional banking industry system and all of the ancillary and all of the ancillary systems like mil like global militaries that exist in order to protect uh that kind of global financial system like every atomic bomb that's ever been exploded is that base layer infrastructure in a way that's subservient the continuation of that of that global financial system every single flight that's ever take so so there's there's a context and framing problem and then there's a a a a problem around just understanding the issues themselves how the technology works to someone that doesn't understand anything about computer science it's it's a real bamboozler uh how you could create one of something versus one billion of something with the same amount of energy that's not that's not instinctively clear and so i think a lot of very well intentioned people that wish well on people that wish well on planet that hope that we can live on this earth happily for many years i think the the worst part is to see them um adopt this kind of mind virus that this binary thinking crypto bad when really there are things to fix here there are things to correct here um i think proof of stake is an interesting transition there and i think uh energy mix is a really interesting goal for humanity going toward going toward renewables there's a couple things on that i think i think there's also it becomes the scapegoat issue for people who are already inclined to dislike crypto because they see it as bro they say they they they have impressions about what crypto is anyway that they don't like and then they get to thrust on it this environmental argument which is i really i really see the best and i really see the best in a lot of people i i share a lot of views with um people that identify as environmentalists and i i can't address i can't address not real concerns but the real concern i can get very specific about what it is and what it is yeah well there there's been a kind of persistent problem in media around the environmental concerns which that they they rely on and you'll know this better than i do but like one or two sort of early studies that were sort of uh done and there hasn't been like a a kind of new look at the issue i think a lot of the negative perceptions about crypto in general are um operations orchestrated by incumbents to protect their interests and so which interests are really harmed by crypto well the big banks the big the big banks and um notorious big friends for the environment well yeah so the big banks and uh there's a way in which i think federal governments benefit enormously from blockchain crypto but i think those that have concerns over um you know the the the control of the dollar um and other other fiat currencies those folks can have some concerns about crypto and so a lot of these narratives are really incumbent protection narratives that are created by incumbents when actually i i tend to find environmentalists like a challenger like an underdog are not sure that the system as orchestrated today is how it should be and in in all of those ways they share values with the people that um or many of the people that are excited about crypto yeah okay let's touch briefly on if you want to say something on that third sort of dominated by the vcs yeah argument and then let's get into serotonin and i actually have something really interesting to say there which is which is that if you're a traditional style vc you are not getting the upside in crypto that you would if you knew how to do d5 as a software engineer and so what yield farming and what d5 and a lot of the on-chain liquidity provision exercises really are is a market challenge to the prices that vcs can command in the cap tables of lucrative startups oh my gosh you're gonna have to break that down i'm going i will i will which is basically um they're saying that they can attract investors that basically behave like contributors to the software who they in the scenario people creating d5 protocols okay um and that tends to privilege developers over a mainstream vc that doesn't have a software team that can actually participate in these protocols and so the highest yields go to people that understand something about software and can participate in the protocols and provision liquidity in these protocols early a lot of vcs are still getting their sea legs under them being able to invest in liquid tokens being able to custody tokens and so to say that the vcs are the big winners here they have a lot of them have one big um but a lot of the kind of novel innovation the space is actually right-sizing the value add of a vc and challenging it and saying the value out of coders and software developers is actually greater maybe greater and so it's a challenge that's happening in the market um and that's what this represents metaphorically you see what i'm saying yeah i totally do and so a lot of them a lot of investors have one big a lot of builders um have have one big um but i think that evaluating a system um in the at this early stage by who's benefited from it um isn't necessarily the right lens because i think the permissionlessness of of web3 tech means that anyone could um be able to create for themselves on this platform without even having a bank account and yes there's a lot of barriers to entry the barriers to entry are that technical knowledge meeting someone else that knows about this speaking the correct language in order to be able to learn about this so yes of course not at all saying that web3 erases the barriers to entry that exists but it democratizes and lowers that barrier to entry to create something of real value without any material resources without access to let's say sandhill road in silicon valley to ask for funding absolutely it there are new barriers erected but it's not the same gatekeeper system that it was exactly like you can watch a youtube video like that you can you can actually sort of self-educate it in a way that isn't about just who you know well let's look at what the barriers are in the traditional system versus the barriers in this system right so in the traditional system um new money is created it's lent out at a certain interest rate uh certain privileged individuals can in a room subjectively decide what those interest rates are uh and who gets lent the money first um bitcoiners all are very familiar with this and think about this a lot and so be um and in the world of crypto um there's not that same barrier decisions aren't made subjectively the barrier is actually understanding the transparency right what is your greatest hope for call it like i don't know whatever everyday people people who aren't developers maybe aren't like technically savvy who of course have tremendous amount of advantage and opportunity in this space call it in five or ten years because the barriers are high right now in terms of the ui ux but that'll get better like what do you see as the you're like this is why everybody will benefit from this technology in five or ten years oh yeah of course so a couple different layers of that so first one does not need to be a developer in order to work in web 3 and serotonin is a great proof of that and we can go into that in depth um then um i think that um the future of work could be gamified through things like play to earn games and i think we could see similar to axia infinity and its impact in places like the philippines i think we could see um rising average incomes among even developing nations because they're exposed to these global units of value that aren't discounted based on where they live and so that's really interesting there may i mean we we've seen rising inequality economically within countries but i think we're going to see rising economic equality between countries and i think that um play to earn gaming and blockchain crypto could be uh an interesting driver of that whatever you think of that so it could help a lot of people especially in the developing world in that regard also a gamified meaning making system so people playing play to earn games could just be the future of work in developed economies as well especially in a future where you know you worked with andrew yang in a future where there's more automation um it offers a set and setting where value can actually meaningfully be created um even though it's it it's in a new kind of metaverse structure and just importing assets and data and value into that structure has economic value so it's a it's a playground where people can create value in new ways and financialize it in new ways so it's basically like a new substrate for creation both like artistic and creative creation but also uh economic innovation financial innovation technology innovation almost no sector in the u.s economy is growing and and a lot of the kind of low interest rate invest driven investments into technology stocks in the stock market it it it shields that and it conceals that oh yeah yeah but if you strip that away blockchain crypto web 3 nfts whatever you want to call it is one of the few growing industries in the post-industrial world and and when you are working in an industry that's contracting and collapsing you live in a world of diminishing returns where everyone's scrambling with each other over the pieces of the pie but if you're working with other human beings in a world where it is in an industry where the pie is growing that in i i mean even just in fact i feel that being in blockchain like you know it there there's so much opportunity you can feel that expansive you don't feel as competitive or scarcity mindset about it it's like there's not for you there's enough for me there's enough for us all because well you still want the biggest possible percentage of the growing surprise but it's still it feels different than being in other industries yes it hits at every layer of the stack emotional economic relationships when you're in something that's growing versus when you're in something that's declining trust me i came from the media industry in a moment where it was contracting and the spirit of collaboration in the web 3 space is really something something different and something everyone should get to experience um so yeah that's that's my hope um i guess i'll roll with an even more kind of macro and metaphorical hope which is i think that blockchain is a tool of freedom in the fight against authoritarianism i think a.i might be co-opted by authoritarian regimes to control people top down and i think blockchain's economic system is going to be leveraged to enable people to be free bottoms up do you and i know this you can ignore this question if you're like i don't want to talk and that's why i think nothing's more american than apple pie and crypto [Laughter] apple pie and the blockchain we're here in puerto rico i've been learning about a lot of the frustration folks have toward the government towards the corruption i think in general but especially in the wake of maria the a hope i've heard from people who are here working in blockchain is a more transparent government and sort of what you're describing which is how can we use blockchain for voting how can use blockchain in ways that create transparency among our political systems that can help to root out corruption and create more transparent government what do you think of that do you feel that here at all well i think that um i'm very glad that the media in the u.s focused as much as it did on hurricane maria because i think that brought attention and brought aid but i think that the fact that that continues to be the main story people on the mainland think about with regard to puerto rico it just doesn't make any sense in in terms of the life i actually live so the the metropolis i live in i live in the greater san juan area in puerto rico is a flourishing city with great schools with great museums amazing restaurants the food culture here is incredible some of my favorite restaurants here would out-compete the restaurants in brooklyn where i am prices too i've learned yeah they're actually pretty impressive here yeah and um just beautiful music think about the impact that like reggaeton has had on global music um just from this small island think about that that outsized impact and so thinking about puerto rico as hurricane maria it just it just isn't accurate for the life that most people live and that being said in a lot of the mountainous areas in the center of this island there are still people living without power or living without water pressure because of hurricane maria and that has to be attended to the same way that there should be attention in the u.s on the plight of some people in appalachia but that can't be the whole story and so when i think about crypto here um i i don't think about it as being used i don't think the first use case is being used in the the government or the governance here i think the first use cases they're incredible engineering talent there's incredible engineering talent here there's a great university mayaguez which is um which is training talented engineers there are four incredible accelerator programs here that were inspired by startup chile which is an incredibly successful um startup program by a country um and so those are what i'm really excited about creating creating economic opportunity for people that live here um and what the puerto rican government has done with act 20 2260 is use its sovereign powers because puerto rico has some sovereign powers to create economic incentives to power that growth and so far as far as i can tell that's been working and economic growth and development is what i would wish for blockchain and crypto in puerto rico to help accomplish and i i totally hear all of that and i i i say agree to the extent that i have like the right to agree with an opinion in your your experience here i will say i didn't come into puerto rico thinking about hurricane maria and i think it was more something that i realized had such i i i was talking to folks the other day and kind of compared it to 911 like it had such an impact i think on the psyche of the people 100 and so it it kind of shapes it's like again like 911 almost everything that comes after is in some way shaped by that sort of trauma and i had somebody say i got into blockchain after hurricane maria because there was i think there was it was a spark where they saw the cavalierness with which some of their elected officials were treating the the lives that were lost in maria there was squandering of relief funds like there was a disillusionment that seemed to follow that that i i'm thinking of pedro cruz i think you may know who who felt like he was driven harder into the army awesome development blockchain yeah he's incredibly talented and he was he he really went harder on blockchain after that because he was sort of illusioned about what was going on so it's not it's not an either or i think that's a blockchain and crypto story that's a classic and pedro's a great example of this i won't speak for him but it's a classic story i hear about blochy and crypto where you see these very old government systems and i'm speaking of the mainland u.s here um not working or squandering resources and and you think would i rather trust big centralized systems that i have very little control over or would i rather take power into my own hands be able to safeguard my own value be able to make my own money be able to not depend on these big centralized systems and i think when people have an experience of a breakdown of those big centralized systems to serve their interests their their light often goes on that they need to invest in their own their families their communities resilience and i think that blockchain crypto are a great example of ways that communities can achieve resilience and i think that's happening here in terms of maria i moved here after maria so i can't speak to that experience but you know we talk about the generation in the u.s that lived through world war ii that lived through the great depression as the greatest generation that's what they're called and so there's a real belief that going through hardship can make people into diamonds pressure makes diamonds and and that all of all of those experiences uh solidify um a community's resolve to create to move on to do something better and i think um what i've seen among the super talented people here that i've met is that same kind of diamond hard resilience and excitement to build something new it's awesome okay serotonin so this if i'm correct was sort of your immediate post consensus yeah so um i stepped down from my role as chief marketing officer as consent at consensus in um summer of 2019 to start building serotonin um i wanted to hang out my own shingle which i did with my co-founder matthew isles who has an amazing marketing background and background in web3 um and we i'd built a lot of the best practices for marketing in the web3 space namely designing systems to be self marketing incentive systems to be self marketing uh figuring out how to instead of using inauthentic influencer marketing how to leverage the influential people that you're already connected to in ways that are efficient to help get the word out a lot of the visual design conventions in the space which are evolving i promise no more interconnecting triangles as of 2018 we'll probably be doing this vaporwave thing for another minute but it will be something else after promise then a lot of the conventions around how we manage communities in the space specifically how we invite our community members to be part of managing those communities with us a lot of the kind of comms and messaging conventions how do you do comms and messaging when you're not running a centralized company where everyone's going to say the same thing where you aren't in control of everyone and instead you see your stakeholders as the public immediately even though you're not a public company because that's what you think you owe to the community so i built a lot of my team my teammates at consensus on that catalyst team built a lot of the a lot of those best practices in the space and what i wanted to do along with my co-founder is to apply those best practices to the next generation of products being built on these decentralized web 3 rails like ethereum and so we really saw ourselves as specializing in dows in d5 in nfts in web 3 utilities in l1 blockchains and l2 scaling application layer blockchain sidechain etc we've probably done more token generations than anyone else we helped popularize the retroactive distribution trend for rewarding community and avoiding primary issuer risk so it's a really really interesting great strategy we're the largest we became the largest pretty quickly web3 marketing firm and so we do we create brands visual verbal identities for brands we bring them to market we help them grow and achieve their goals on growth marketing on content social media influencers um product marketing events um all across the board and you all brag for you and then or encourage you to brag like you guys took no money right you had no vc you built up and you were profitable i almost i almost hesitate to make this joke um but we often say that we're venture funded we just didn't give the vcs any equity okay there you go because the the we have great partnerships with vcs that are investing in startups that they know would benefit from our services and so we'll work with those startups but no we just we just started working like a like a family-owned laundromat uh we just started uh through doing doing the work and then we grew i'm gonna actually lay this all out because it's so rare and i think it'd be fun to see more people do it but that's why i want to highlight it too yeah we were getting paid money and then we used that to hire more people and we didn't hire them before you had the money before before we had the money we'd hire them once we had it it's revelatory i i know i i know this is really cool i guess i just want to say that it literally is possible to do that um and then one might say well professional services is a very linearly scaling revenue model which is absolutely fair and it's not really a venture investable revenue model right i would say to anyone starting a professional services business if you can do so without investors that expect a 10x software style return you should do that because it's not a traditionally venture investable model but what we've done is we've used our position in the market we have some of the best data in the market because we have we're the largest web 3 marketing firm we have this amazing large customer base we know exactly what products they would want and they would use if only someone built it and so we built our own in-house product and engineering studio to start building those things and we have an unfair advantage getting them to market um not only because we're great at go to market but because we can sell relationships we can sell them and we can not even build it until we know that company x y and z would all be customers and and so that's how we built mojito mojito is the leading nft marketplace infrastructure platform it serves a number of nft ecommerce marketplaces most notably the sotheby's metaverse which within three months of going live surpassed 100 million in volume and what that enables organizations and brands to do is continue to sell e-commerce to do retail on their own owned website um be able to completely control the experience but to be able to sell digital goods in web3 it's amazing so sotheby's was sort of your is sort of your standout partner talk about like what what were they looking for what was the opportunity there and like how were you like how does it apply to other brands that are trying to get into the space yeah so we call this the the web 2.5 and i think we're going to have an article about this soon about what the web 2.5 is but a lot of the big brands that come to us don't identify as web 3 transition they're not trying to necessarily immediately transition their entire business model to being web3 they're just forward-thinking smart companies and executives that think we want to test these waters we want to see what this could mean for our business we want to do it in a thoughtful way that's actually beneficial to web3 and so sotheby's was one of those partners for us at serotonin and they had already planned some nft drops when we partnered with them we noticed the frustrations they had with those experiences namely that they wanted to control the crm they wanted the customer data it wasn't completely bizarre to have to do it through a third-party platform where they wouldn't have control of that experience when their whole business is curation and control of experience and so we realized there was this white space in the market and that we could really go in and build into that white space and so the other interesting thing about sotheby's is they're one of the most regulated companies on the planet because art has always been um there's always been money laundering fraud and it's a place to hide money is in fine arts always has been and so justifiably sotheby's is one of the most and all auction houses are some of the most regulated entities on planet earth and so and they're very good at regulation compliance as a result and so we were able to get our platform up to their standards we have tax assessment built in we have kyc built in natively we were able to get up to their standards and then it's really easy to talk to other even large-scale enterprises because they're the most regulated and so we're like you're a bank you're nothing exactly exactly exactly uh because we were able to get that first kind of domino uh customer awesome is there a sector that you're most excited about as you look ahead of like like sotheby's is sort of a natural entrant because they're already in art and art has sort of been the the most recent like early manifestation of nfts their sector that you're like the promise here is so great we're so excited about it yeah actually like we we've we we've signed some sports teams recently that are that are really interesting and i'm interested in that but i'm going to go with something like less predictable and more uh kind of something that people aren't talking about as much which is redeemables um so we're looking to we're finalizing a partnership with um one of the largest um liquor brands and so what on earth do you do with that yeah um so you drink it in an irl you drink it no no i'm just kidding so let's say um the most expensive bottles that these brands are selling are aged for many years and they're collectors items and they pass from one owner to another or like another example out of liquor is um is high like super high in collectible retail like air jordans right and so most people that buy air jordans or most people that buy you know one of the oldest bottles of wine or one of the highest end bottles of whiskey they aren't going to consume it immediately and they might be buying it to resell it and so there's a lot of risk to these brands to transport and to the buyers every time they're transporting these bottles every time and then and then after they've sold as their first buyer they don't get any more cuts when they're resold and resold and resold down the line and then each time it's resold is more risk because you're transporting it you need to store it it needs to be at the right temperature so if you can basically create a an on-chain representation an nft of that object of that of that air jordan shoe of that of that bottle of whiskey bottle of wine then you can continue to have it be sold and resold and gain royalties from secondary sales in the process and then finally when someone does wish to consume it they can redeem and that hence redeemable they can they can go ahead and redeem it um and so you cut down on risks loss damage and you also create a financial asset and maybe someone can borrow or loan and so basically by bringing physical reality and modeling it on chain which we can do with fungible tokens for fungible kinds of things and non-fungible tokens for non-fungible kinds of things by creating an economic model of reality on the blockchain you're unlocking this whole new category of financialization and different economic activities that can be done once you have all these assets modeled i'm getting a sign that we need to start wrapping but this is i i i want like another hour with you at some point to like continue the the like many rabbit holes we could go down you moved to puerto rico two years ago i moved here at the end of 2018 um three four years ago yeah okay end of twenty eighteen live full year starting 2019. okay and why did you decide to move here was act 60 a factor in that oh yeah three things weather can't beat it it's beautiful it's all the time i was like is it winter here right now which is a stupid question but i'm like i know it's such a great time here it's winter and it's amazing it's beautiful here el yukay uh i don't know did you get to all you guys we were tropical chop hiking in a shower tropical rainforest in the us totally gorgeous the beaches gorgeous the climate again the restaurants the museums schools i'm probably gonna you know have my kids here so a great place i thought uh for me and my husband and our family to live our life um another one was the crypto community here is incredible i think that if you're interested in blockchain crypto living here is better than living in new york or la or miami even or austin and that's because the people that move here are adventurers that are willing to um that are willing to experiment with being somewhere new and folks across the island whether they were born on the island whether they were born on the island left the island came back whether they came from the mainland these are these are all people that are pioneers and that are excited about in championing something new and i think that energy you see here is in a more extreme version here than it is anywhere else on the mainland so that's amazing even though it's a smaller crypto community than in some of those other cities i think it's more dynamic and you can really feel it and then the third factor is tax incentives and it's incredible that puerto rico has leveraged that sovereignty over taxes in order to compete with new york compete with miami compete with austin for the same pool of talent that they want to introduce into their tax base and they're able to compete and be successful because of that and that's incredible that's been part of what's attracted this great group of people that's been part of what's inspired a lot of a lot of interesting you know activity here um and so i think jurisdictions all over the world are going to compete for uh for people and we saw this in the pandemic a lot people vote with their feet people go people go places for mixtures of reasons right weather is a factor culture is a factor schools are a factor taxes are a factor all these things are factors and i think that puerto rico between the the factors it's been able to accumulate here has a really strong argument not just to attract great new folks from the mainland but also to welcome back as businesses grow here a lot of the folks that were from here that left and that would be interested in moving here if only the jobs and opportunities were here that were attractive enough to make them want to come back and that's what i'm really hoping that this trend of young people especially leaving puerto rico to pursue their careers that that trend reverses and that people that wish to continue living here on the island find thriving businesses and great opportunities amazing thank you so much for meeting me here showing me this place in the first place and again we'll do some sort of round two around three because there's so much i would love to dive into with you you're obviously so knowledgeable but also just like your historical understanding of this space having been in it so early on is amazing thank you so congratulations on everything you're doing i love it i've met so many i'll say i've met multiple people from serotonin all i've joked about this with others i don't know if i said it to you it's just all like gorgeous women it's just all like super smart like you know amazing women that i've met it's true i've got like five people from serotonin and it's all women and they're all badass so um this is a pleasure [Music] [Applause] you
