see what are you talking about more cities we could just build more of these things when the first city gets full people know what to do and the answer is you go build a new freaking city and the history of cities is obviously that there is not just one city in every single country there are many cities and interestingly what you often see is that the cities tend to be far away from each other and they tend to become very different from each other and so you know the the two major cities in the u.s are new york and l.a and la is really far from new york it's literally the absolute opposite as far as you can possibly get from new york and it's really different the culture of la is completely different than new york when you see the equivalent of new cities in blockchains that's what all these new emerging ones are new york was full and so we decided to create la we decided to create boston we decided to create chicago and and houston and all these other cities
