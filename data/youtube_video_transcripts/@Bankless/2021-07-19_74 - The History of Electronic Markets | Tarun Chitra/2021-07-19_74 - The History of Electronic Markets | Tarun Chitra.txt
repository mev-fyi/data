[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david great episode today tarun chitra on the podcast he is a polymath he's got he he spans so many different ideas such a big brain but this episode we really drew his attention to the history of the markets in particular the history of the electronic markets what did we cover today yeah really the the concept or story being told here is that the internet as we all know changed everything and it especially changed how markets are structured and so as soon as the internet started to invade the world of financial markets an interesting story is told and so tyrone has delineated these uh the growth and this story into three phases phase one two and three of the growth of electronic markets where we stopped yelling at each other inside of the pits about what trades we wanted to make and instead we just started typing our trades into computers and that has gone from people order routing into various exchanges in the 80s and 90s to consolidation to brokerages like your charles schwab and your e-trades online in the 90s and early thousands to where we are today with d5 markets and crypto exchanges and each one of these phases has similar story or similar themes throughout each one there's themes of what happens when a financial crisis crisis happens because we're talking about market infrastructure the way that the market infrastructure is built impacts the nature of the financial crisis we have the stories of how regulators came in to each phase and impacted the story of the development of each phase and the way that um the communication and computational abilities of the infrastructure or the hardware of the world impacted the accessibility and centralization or decentralization of the markets uh and so this is uh these themes are reoccurring throughout history this is a definitely definitely a podcast about you know history doesn't repeat but it definitely does rhyme and there are lessons to be learned about electronic markets that we are trying to apply to defy so that when these events unfold in d5 which tarun thinks that they definitely will we will be prepared for them yeah absolutely i think one of the three lines of this episode is just in every phase of the electronic markets you know eras there was increased access for individuals right and i guess this is the story of markets from from the very beginning the first you know joint stock companies the first uh you know stock markets um and that that was kind of reserved for sort of the the elites and um like the uber wealthy and and kind of like uh you know mercantile class and that sort of thing um just that the markets are opening up more and more over time and it's very interesting to see like defy as the third phase of this where you've got all of that but at warp speed like anybody anywhere with an internet connection can open a marketplace can create an asset can even if they have the skills create a new financial product and that's something like we've never seen before i mean i know there are corollaries to to what this looked like turin says in in the 1980s with with the first era but i also feel like this is uh uncharted water uncharted territory yet it feels it fits this trajectory of markets are becoming more and more open and um like everything is is kind of becoming uh like i guess i don't know if i'd call it hyper capitalism because it has some negative connotations but i hyper marketization if that's the word but that's kind of what we're seeing here and it's a good thing because it means more financial inclusion for for the world and more capital coordination absolutely we often talk about how crypto and defi is the wild west well you can imagine what the world is like before the internet when trades are being made by people yelling at each other on pit floors and doing hand signals to make their trades uh reminds me of the movie from ferris bueller's day off um and but uh all of a sudden the internet comes and instead of you know yelling at each other and doing hand signals we're inputting uh you know our trades into a computer and the structure of the entire market absolutely changed that was the absolute wild west back then too this is not the first time financial markets have gone through their wild west moments like the first wild west moment happened in the 80s uh turin tells a story about this one guy that had like 10 of all trading volume going through his server in his garage it was just some random dude and there's a lot of interesting correlates between what we see now in crypto where you know just one rogue developer builds this brand new financial product and all of a sudden like half the world is using it or whatever half of d5 is using it similar stories similar themes uh you know history definitely rhymes and i love where this ends where we we go through um the lens and we sort of apply the lessons learned from previous eras to the current era to try to map out what the future looks like because look man the the future of krypto and d5 is uh is so uncertain in terms of like we know long term this is going to be successful because this is unstoppable but um what might we see in the interim in the in the in the short to medium run and this gives us a framework for starting to project this i especially liked turin's description of risk that we might see in d5 both the you know the plus side of this where we've opened financial system so we can maybe see these risks more easily before they emerge but also how risk has been kind of not the downfall but an issue with every single electronic uh era previous so exciting episode make sure you guys tune in to the end of this episode before we begin we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use d5 if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrarium is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitram and join their discord all right bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest we have taroun chitra he comes from one of the most rich and complex corners of ethereum he is a big brain i don't know can't even keep track of all the things tyrone is doing he's the co-founder of gauntlet that provides economic simulation to d5 protocols to help them harden their economics super important stuff he's also a co-founder of robot ventures where he invests alongside robert lester who's been on the podcast several times in d5 he's also a frequent guest of the zero knowledge podcast so you will appreciate his audio uh he's also a leading thinker on mev that is maximum extractable value and so many other topics today we're going to talk about his concept for electronic markets and the third era of electronic markets that we find ourselves in today tarun how's it going man how are you doing great how are you thanks for having me on oh we are doing great you know what man i love that background you gotta you gotta tell us is this like an nft or like what is this background it's super colorful your glasses seem to kind of match the the ambiance of it what's uh what's the story here so i love um kind of weird niche math things that have very pretty pictures and so this thing behind me is something called uh penrose tiling um oh i know this one get david to explain it then if david knows it explained if i'm right then i could be wrong but this is uh penrose tiling uh is like the basis of a pattern if you color it right the coloring i think is very uh important and it could be wrong um but like the it's a pattern that never ever repeats and so it's an infinitely recursive pattern and you will never find the same tiling pattern ever again as the and it's an infinitely recursive pattern so it can go into infinity but you will never find the same pattern twice is that right yeah basically yeah basically it's it's it's sort of uh yeah infinite tiling with no no repeated there's a certain weird way in which the no repeated units is defined but people make very pretty pictures like this one of them so that is super cool that's going to be uh that's going to be great this entire podcast enjoying looking at that but let's get to the topic because today we are here to explore the topic of electronic markets i think tyrone you have this idea that there have been three eras three stages of electronic markets the first to second and now we are entering the third and when dave and i heard about this this concept you have this mental model you had we knew we absolutely had to unpack it here on bankless because uh i think it's an important mental model for us all to understand so let's start with some definitions and scope here when we're looking at electronic markets from a satellite view what do you mean uh by the term electronic markets and what does that mean more generally yeah for sure um i think you know if we if we kind of take a step back prior to electronic markets what what were markets they were you know you you think kind of it from history class like hey it's like in the center of a city there's like a bazaar and there's like a bunch of people who have stalls and and that's like the the earliest form of market but every new form of technology uh that has been invented inevitably finds its first usage and adoption in in financial markets so you know when when people uh sort of had the telegraph the telegraph became sort of this b2b um business to business uh device that was used for different businesses and in different towns to kind of like send messages about the weather or whether like a shipment wouldn't make it or sort of commercial details and and that was sort of the original sort of starting point of the telegraph uh but then as kind of time evolved and everyone got electricity uh you know we had telephones and then the masses started using effectively the same communication technology and that led to a lot of uh sort of new markets uh in the sense that people could buy things over the phone people could uh find new customers uh via telemarketing which of course now is viewed as antiquated and annoying but i think at the time uh you know sort of post world war one was sort of like the heyday of like going into kind of the the golden 20s that there there was actually kind of viewed as probably the way we view like instagram ads today as like much more in culture kind of in vogue type of advertising versus uh those ads and so but these were all very uh markets that were very peer-to-peer and i i mean peer-to-peer more in the bad way like you you know you have to do a lot of work to find a buyer or seller um when you're one of when you're the opposite you have to go manually kind of like figure out how to put the dots together there's not like a central place or a central kind of source of funds and trading um but what happened once we had the internet was sort of in the very earliest parts of the internet so internet created sort of by defense agencies in the 70s but in the early 80s people in finance realized the internet was a really good way to price assets that you know that sort of disintermediated um you know large entities who who uh kind of controlled most trading so if you think about stocks in the 1970s and 80s only institutions could really buy them like you could buy a mutual fund who could buy shares and stocks but you yourself couldn't really realistically do that and you would have to go through an intermediary like a bank now what people really don't even do that in the in the 1970s 80s like most listeners are kind of detached from that so you have to like schedule an appointment with a banker to go like with the broker okay yeah to go buy your mutual fund yeah to go buy shares in the mutual fund and the mutual fund would go invest in and and stocks for you um i i don't know if you've ever like i feel like i've always seen this in sort of smaller towns in the us but there are like these like physical broker branches like there's a charles schwab that actually exists as a you know i've never walked into them i don't know what they do there it's certainly made for like yeah it's definitely made for a more geriatric audience i think in a lot of ways but but that's the vestige of that time where like in order to buy stocks you would like go to a physical venue you would pay someone like five percent to execute the trade uh if you're lucky uh and then it would go through a series of middlemen and then it would go to banks and banks were the only ones who kind of dealt with the stock exchange for you so there was this like huge chain of intermediaries what happened once people this was a time where we had markets but we didn't have the electronic part of it right it was just markets yes full of intermediaries not very peer-to-peer from an electronic perspective yes exactly exactly like the the the the phrase electronic markets i think really refers to the idea of replacing a lot of the middlemen with compute and communication via the internet and also via like being able to use a lot of compute power and people in the 80s realize that you you know you could actually do that quite efficiently and get rid rid of a lot of um middlemen um in in banking uh and that sort of started this trend that obviously went to today where you have robinhood and you can go buy socks on your own you don't pay anything you know you can do your own research stuff like that you know i think we the earliest part of the electronic market revolution was getting rid of intermediaries and brick and mortar entities automating a lot of the execution and settlement and storage of stock so you know stocks for even though you you might not know that you still could request this there is actually a physical certificate sitting at bank of new york mellon that represents like the share that you bought but you know you're trading when you're trading on robin hood or interactive brokers or charles schwab there everyone is holding ious for those shares and you're really only trading the ious no one's actually physically usually moving the stock the the the brokers kind of net settle every day of like hey i bought for all my customers 500 shares of apple and i sold 600 shares of gamestop uh so you know the two counterparts execute that trade but sorry we're getting a little away from the definition of electronic markets but i think the definition is uh any sort of form of marketplace interaction where you can aggregate buyers and sellers and they can transact autonomously without needing white-listed trusted parties so just to to ground the listener tarun is is uh much more of an expert than us on the the history and progression of electronic markets and so we definitely want to pick his brain about how these things came to be like how did we go from you know the telegraph and and the telephone into where we are today which is you know trading on robin hood and you know while the listener of this podcast and the bankless nation are beyond trading on robin hood they are you know trading on defy and using defy apps uh defy is really just the next logical continuation of the emergence of electronic markets and so uh i think it's really important to understand the history of these things uh as a concept uh and then and then we can talk about how defy is a continuation of electronic markets with new things with uh the old things uh and a couple of you know weird kinks here and there as well um but tyrone help help the help ground the listener what would you say are the common themes and through lines and um just like reoccurring elements of each wave of uh each you know emerging electronic market what are we going to continually revisit over and over and over again in this conversation yeah for sure i think uh the number one thing is there's always a boom and bust cycle hidden somewhere in each of these waves another thing that happens in each wave is that there is a new technology or and or regulation introduced that causes sort of a seismic shift in terms of market microstructure and and how people interact with these systems um and then the third uh thing is i think like there's a kind of gradual disintermediation of uh third parties at each step um and uh i guess the final thing is that each new wave of technology makes the market more competitive which lowers prices usually for in aggregate for people okay so we're gonna see these themes i guess reflected in each of these uh each of these eras but you have a kind of a framework of eras that we want to go through and maybe high level i'll kind of say what they are and we can maybe start with the first one um but the first is like electronic markets 1.0 and that was really the genesis of electronic markets we had these analog markets now we're making them electronic that started in the 1980s i think lasted into the 90s then we had electronic markets 2.0 which started in sort of the the 2000s i kind of think of this as like the the e-trade era at the at the start of it and that lasts into the present era now um maybe maybe robin hood is kind of a you know transitory um thing into partially one foot in era two and one foot in era three that started in the 2000s and uh up to this point and then we have electronic markets 3.0 which is kind of the the crypto and wall street bets type era maybe that tart started in 2015 2016 or so and it overlaps with era too so these are the three eras that we're going to talk about so take us to the first roon let's talk about this electronic markets era 1.0 the genesis of electronic markets take us all the way back to the early 1980s um what was the technology that really enabled this and um like uh where did it start and where where did electronic markets start arriving on the scene and um take us through the timeline yeah so um i know many people have probably seen in movies like these pictures of these guys at like the stock exchange or the commodities trading exchange like raising their hands and like doing all sort types of hand signals to say like hey i want to buy like 500 cows or i want to sell you know 500 shares of disney that was what was happening in the 70s so there was you know the new york stock exchange the physical location was filled with people from banks and sort of brokerage and trading firms and they were the only ones who were officially allowed to trade stock um and what happened in the 80s is you know actually sort of in this 1970s something that we don't really see right now right now when you think of stock exchanges as as just an individual you think of the new york stock exchange you think of nasdaq you think of maybe the chicago mercantile exchange maybe the london stock exchange maybe the tokyo stock exchange you know like there's always like one or a few in each country but you don't think of like many but in the 1970s every city in the us had their own stock exchange so there was much more regionalized stock trading so you might be at the philadelphia stock exchange and comcast would be listed there instead of in new york so there wasn't bizarre why why is that is that just because like every all the companies in that region would sort of aggregate to their local city stock exchange yeah so the idea is that like you know maybe people in philadelphia the companies that are ipo'ing there are a little smaller than the ones in new york but the buyers and sellers had to meet physically to actually buy the stock so the buyers in philadelphia tended to have less either less money and the sellers have less lower valuations to sell so they just met geographically in the kind of like the their local they represented their community as finance this was like pre-globalization right like it's just like hey like i'm going to invest in the company down the street from me rather than exactly i'm going to like send my order to new york yes exactly exactly and so uh what happened there was a little bit of of consolidation but the consolidation wasn't in due to technology the consolidation was just like the new york stock exchange bought the philadelphia stock exchange and so they're the same brand but they they and they would net settle for you so if i lived in philadelphia i wanted to buy a stock in new york i'd go to the philadelphia stock exchange and then they would relay it and there'd be fees on relaying so the problem with that is that's extremely expensive because a i'm paying locally for the relayer and then b i have to pay on the other end like when the trade actually gets executed so what happened when the internet came out was people realized they could get rid of this relaying system and this kind of net settlement a few days later so like if i was in philadelphia and that was my stock in chicago uh i wouldn't even be guaranteed my execution would happen within a day it might take like two to three days they might not be able to actually fulfill it they might not find sellers it was very inefficient and like very it was almost like going to the mall and like going to each store and like looking for like the one share that you're looking for that you want right there was no liquidity you place your bid and then any time between one and three days later it might get filled is that kind of the yeah exactly and it and there's no there was no way to like find the liquidity it wasn't easy to figure out like who wanted to sell who who versus who wanted to buy and that's why i needed to like cast your line right you would cast your line and just hope that somebody nibbles on the hook right is that why they're all shouting at each other that way they're so loud and like arms waving shouting is because exactly they're casting their line lines and making a scene so that someone hears their bid yes exactly that that's it's called it's called open outcry that's like the pit where people would do that and it literally is self-descriptive like people are in the open crying out like okay so open outcry exchanges are kind of these old school ones um and so what happened was when the internet even just the idea of the internet came out you know darpa like late 60s early 70s people who were traders were like hey i could replace this whole relaying system and communicate information about bids and offers between the different stock exchanges without actually having to do this physical relay thing right and and now all of a sudden people were able to compete on price uh across different stock exchanges and that was sort of the first glimpse of hey uh the this idea of like hey really fast communication networks and a lot of compute power can replace the system of like hundreds of people and like very uncertain execution like you don't know when you're going to get filled stuff like that so is this kind of like the emergence of the we use the phrase liquidity begins liquidity and while that usually is pertaining to specific assets as in like uh the uh us dollar is liquid and it tracks a bunch of liquidity but right now uh we are seeing like perhaps uh you know running on the example of the philadelphia stock exchange perhaps there is like an internet connection the fir one of the first earliest internet connections between the philadelphia stock exchange in the new york stock exchange and now those two liquidity pools all of the people shouting in philadelphia can also technically also be heard in new york and so these two liquidity pools are now collapsed they same into the same they merge into the same like liquidity pool of the stock exchange uh and is that kind of what we're talking about yeah in the same way that like now like vcs and like silicon valley people love talking about aggregation effects this was the first aggregation effect due to the internet it's literally aggregating liquidity across different stock exchanges um and so there was there was still people shouting in the pits but now the people were connected to more cities right yes i mean so so people shouting in the pits let's say i shouted uh in philadelphia prior to the internet let's say i want to buy five shares of disney and i knew there were only like three brokers who had disney i would go like hey you broker one i want five shares of disney broker two i want five shows disney broker three i want five shirts this thing how much can you sell to me for it what's your offer and prior to the internet they were literally like getting on the phone calling someone in new york saying hey can you shout in new york and tell me who actually has disney then that person in new york would go you know what i mean like that part got turned into like query [Music] and so like slowly but surely the internet started replacing but there were jobs there were physical like people whose jobs were literally to just like sit and pick up the phone and that their jobs were kind of replaced by the by basically the the computers those are the relayers those are kind of like the bridges between blockchains yeah like order routers like there's people who look like they're order routing right you know like switchboard routers like phone ones it's like basically like that they were basically doing everything like that prior to the internet right so and we also have like in the in the crypto world we have like dex aggregators right they're going and finding offers at all the different dexes are these like the original exchange like well i'll find you the best rates by calling up all the different brokerages and all the different exchanges and i'll sell you the best one same kind of deal same deal except extremely slow extremely with huge fees with huge fees so this had to be true when this came about uh electronic markets started showing up in the 1980s this had to be hugely transformative for the financial industry give us a sense of um how quickly this happened yeah so you would think it happened really quickly but kind of a little bit like defy it took place it kind of really started with the more esoteric and new assets first rather than the older assets so options um so like the right to buy a stock in the future or the right to sell a stock in the future we're sort of uh done kind of only by legal contract um prior to maybe like the late 70s there are two reasons for that one is economists only sort of figured out the math for options to some extent in the 1970s for how you should think about how much an option is worth given how much the stock is worth but the other thing is that uh well that math is quite computationally intensive uh and so you needed a lot of compute power to actually compute what you should think you know compute a price to quote for an option and so options had this double-edged sword where they needed both a lot of compute and a lot of like communication about liquidity how where the bids and nas are and so they were a natural fit to be the first uh electronically traded asset because a you need a computer to even figure out what the price is and b you also needed that you have this problem of like open outcry just doesn't work for for options very well right uh correct me if i'm wrong but options in order to really be a competitive product they need more participants than the typical like bid asks of you know spot markets is that correct yeah to some extent so so one of the reasons is options trade at every price that theoretically they trade at every possible price like i can buy an option to buy apple stock at one cent i mean the option will be worth basically nothing so you have to actually consider all possible future prices not just the current like buying a spot instrument is like i just bought it i hold it with the option it's it's actually it's its value changes quite a bit as a function of how how much volatility there is in the price of the asset and so there's you could think of it you know in some ways an option is sort of a form of insurance and so the more volatile an asset is the more you're willing to pay for insurance but the problem is you have to compute do a bunch of actuarial math to basically say like how much insurance do i need to get a certain type of exposure or a certain type of protection and that's where a lot of the compute comes in and so kind of in the way defy is like they're these crypto native assets that are kind of computationally annoying uh if you were to like turn them into a stock in some weird way like like you know we we talk a lot in d5 about synthetic socks but you could also imagine the opposite what if someone traded synthetic maker at the new york stock machine there's no reason they can't in some way they they you there are synthetic stocks in the normal world like for instance chinese companies when they're in the u.s the stock you're buying is not actually really stock in the chinese company it's actually a synthetic sort of implicitly pegged to the the real thing called an auditory deposit receipt but the the idea is that kind of esoteric assets that have weird computational needs or weird sort of uh behavior are always sort of the earliest assets to get adopted by new electronic markets um right and so options kind of led the 80s right and options just like it was just a rehash what you said options were specifically enabled by advancements in our humans ability to compute things thanks to computers but also importantly humans connectivity with other humans markets connecting to other markets with the internet and so this is one of the themes that you've been talking about like growth in our ability to you know leverage the internet for communication allowed for um uh more more liquidity more total market participants and then also our growth in computers allowed for more complex and rich financial products like options so options perhaps never would have been a thing or really not the thing that we know of today without this new first wave of electronic markets is that correct yes so so so actually maybe that's another very good point uh that you've made which is that uh what you're asking about like what's a common thread to each new revolution and each time there's always some new set of financial assets that couldn't have existed without uh like the the new type of electronic market um that's a really good point and we're going to like come back to that so i can imagine did did we see like options volume because i can imagine that in the old days you had to get a whole legal crew like lawyers involved to draft up options contracts right it's super like time intensive process cost intensive process and so i would imagine options markets and products were very limited but during the 80s did we see an explosion in options market as a result of uh these electronic markets yeah yeah we we definitely actually that's another i guess common common thread uh is is each new electronic market revolution removes a layer of lawyers like because i don't i don't even view defy that much as as like a financial revolution as much as like a legal revolution it's really about just like removing the matt levines like i i use this as kind of a joke so matt levine is kind of this famous bloomberg columnist who writes this comic-con money stuff which a lot of people uh both in finance and outside of finance read and he he used to be a derivatives lawyer at goldman and like i view a lot of the products i see in d5 as basically replacing his job like he would be like the derivatives lawyers like looks through the contract tries to structure how it should be priced and like now that's being done in like a smart contract uh i mean they're not called smart contracts for nothing right like contracts that's a that's a legal domain not a financial domain yeah so so that's another thing to actually keep track of as we go through this is that like think about all the lawyers that are getting removed or like how much leave how much you need a lawyer how much that's reducing well that makes me feel good but like more abstractly i guess what is the role of a lawyer or contracts to begin with it's like this um more abstract notion of like establishing trust between parties right and so i guess what we're doing is we're enabling that trust to be like pushed into code pushed outward and that just unlocks a whole bunch of new use cases i suppose so every time we remove a lawyer we're removing the trust in like the legal system and the contracts and we're putting that trust somewhere else is that yeah a way to think about it yeah for sure i mean this concept of an exchange tradable asset needs some notion of standardization right like if i go to a stock exchange i'm like i want five shares of disney and then tomorrow i'm like i'm gonna sell five shows at disney it needs to have fungibility it needs to be able to like be standardized and people aren't like no no i don't want the ryan disney share i want the david disney share like it can't have that property right but the problem is these bespoke financial options for instance like employee stock options are a great example of something that's quite bespoke relative to a star uh you know a normal like option on a equity instrument and obviously those have very low volume right it's like employee stock options you can't trade them um and part of the reason is there's there's like an enforcement mechanism that has to has to take place and so anytime you want to standardize an asset so that it can be traded without people having to on every trade inspect the asset carefully manually um that's kind of when that's the sweet spot for for these types of things and and over time like we we can do more and more complicated uh enforcement of transfer logic in code instead of with lawyers because the lawyers in the legal system enforce property rights which is the logic for transfer of anything and so the like less you need the legal system to enforce that the more you can increase volume and liquidity that's sort of the trade-off so turin what else did we see with the advent of electronic markets in the 1980s was it was it so we seen some new products we've seen the removal of uh like some lawyers uh we've seen standardization of of assets were there any downsides as well to this or how did it end how did this first era end for sure yeah uh so there were you know i think kind of in the same way we've we've finally seen defy due in one year what took all of the 1980s to do there was a lot of experimentation with new asset types and most of them were just options on x which doesn't sound like a lot but remember options were already like kind of this mind-blowing invention then or mind-blowing that you could trade them and anyone could use them type of dimension um and so basically people started experimenting and then people started doing riskier and riskier kind of options and what happened in 1987 uh which uh was sort of partially driven the crash that happened was partially driven uh by the options market um was was basically that there are these types of banking institutions uh called uh thrifts i believe so thrifts or savings and loan banks if you've ever uh ever heard of it um but yeah so basically what happened with uh these thrifts is they were sort of they were promising much higher interest rates than your normal savings account but they weren't really fdic insured so they they're not banks that like promise they'll they'll pay back uh if they go under or like the government promises to pay you back if they go under and these banks savings and loan banks work in the following way like people who are depositors earn yield from directly from people who are borrowing to buy houses so they're they're only like you your your money when you put money in to get yield is only used to lend to people who are buying 15 to 30-year mortgages right but the problem was there was a ton of inflation in the 1980s and uh the problem with mortgages is mortgages are fixed interest rate products right like you pay you you fix the rate at the beginning of the lifetime that's it when you're in a really high inflation environment you if you're promising the depositor is like five percent yield and your issue you've issued all these like six percent mortgages right so there's just a little bit of spread if there's a ton of inflation that six percent is actually worth less and less over time and it basically means like you have to do riskier and riskier things and these savings and loan banks started like trading options and indirectly through weird ways and that that exacerbated some of the problems that later happened um but what was learned which was really good data from 1987 was we learned when the option math breaks down so people didn't know exactly how the math should work um and that big collapse kind of helped crystallize in people's minds the benefits and the downsides the risks of these electronic markets if they weren't designed correctly and people weren't like being very careful with them wait um what what collapsed uh sorry like the stock market had this huge huge collapse um i think it was called black thursday i believe or sorry black monday but it was just this uh this was a consequence of um of uh the the speculation that was going on in in order to combat interest rates so do you remember that uh when when gamestop was kind of uh in peak gamestop against march or february or whatever there were a lot of um a lot of memes about uh something called a gamma squeeze right so what that means is basically option sellers so like let's say i buy a call option that means the person selling me sold me the call option which means that when i exercise it i have to have a share to deliver to them right an option is the right to buy in the future and so usually people banks will who are selling options you're paying them a premium up front for it like in like insurance uh they [Music] will cover it so they will go buy the share so that their exposure is not zero people in the 1980s didn't totally understand that you need to do this quite carefully or like and electronic markets help you automate this but they weren't as good as they became in the 90s to like actually automatically hedge your risk like when you're selling options and what happened was all these people who bought options started exercising them because the price crashed and like i want to buy like i want to like put a floor on my loss or something and then the underwriters had to go sell in this case they weren't call options they're all puts but they had to go sell shares and then there's kind of this compounding effect their sell shares push the price down more people would exercise people would sell more shares and you had this kind of like this kind of the opposite of sort of like a yeah this bad feedback loop and like that kind of that was the first time we had a sort of like electronic market in the modern definition sense collapse due to this feedback loop and because it's an electronic market it wasn't easy to stop right in the i'm in the pits raising my hand thing the the the referee i mean like whoever owns the stock exchange who they actually literally had people who would like have whistles and stuff so i i i prefer i like to call them the referees uh and then just like blow the whistle like no trading guys can you please stop trading yeah no it was actually literally that like there there was like the the whistle person to do that so this was something that was new right this this didn't exist prior to having electronic markets we weren't used to this idea that like these things could just like run on their own and kind of have big collapses so um but i think what happened after that was the the crazy thing is that options volume crashed after 1987. and then people slowly started to get more and more comfortable with like buying options and then for banks and hedge funds and stuff hedging their risk in options and options volume just grew exponentially since it has not decreased and so you know the 90s especially in the first tech bubble boom um we actually saw kind of the markets even when we had the dot-com crash the market didn't collapse due to like bad risk management um the market collapsed because there's no demand which is much safer than what happened in 1987. and so that that was kind of you know i i kind of bucket those two boom and bust that boom and bust cycle as like the first era because you know what happened in the 80s was you know a few people realized how to do this and there was kind of a small set of people who really uh understood like the technology uh and then of course once the crash happened then a lot of people like hey what is this thing people are doing like regulators started looking into it more uh but then in the 90s uh what happened was basically everyone realized hey i could just start a stock exchange or i in the same way that you have hey i can just like fork this a m and deploy it somewhere else uh and and and and the there's kind of this weird effect of like there was tons of new stock exchanges and then they eventually collapsed and that's what leads us to 2.0 before we get to phase 2.0 i want to hammer on some details about the first wave and my intuition is that these this new new frontier at the time of electronic markets enabled by the internet and computation also probably i'm guessing opened up the or lowered the barrier to entry for more new participants right like like and the the theme that i think is also probably true is the same thing with defy right like i personally probably never would have gotten into the world of finance if it weren't for crypto the invention of crypto opened up the doors to more and more people to be more inclusive and include them into what was previously a more permissioned more siloed industry is that did that same theme happened in the first wave of electronic markets and and who were the people that were new to finance that like the emergence of the electronic markets really enabled them to come into the fold yeah so um that's a great question uh so two things so so my first you know my first job was i worked somewhere for this this billionaire who was a cs professor at columbia in the 1980s he left and went to go work at morgan stanley after and then after a year of like kind of being pushed around by the jocks uh jock old school trader people uh he left to start this hedge fund which is you know one of the most successful quantitative hedge funds that has been made uh but a lot of the people in the 80s and 90s were really like cs and hardware and technology people who like never would have been exposed and it's sort of similar in d5 in a lot of ways but there there's another another example like so yeah in the beginning the very first wave was actually a lot of academics in math and physics and like uh basically like people who had to do the quant math modeling for things like options because like no one knew how to use them the finance people couldn't figure it out so they needed to get like the the quants and the math math quizzes in there as well exactly and then by the 90s things had people had a better understanding and you got way more of the computer scientists technologists style of people so i think one of the coolest examples of this there are two examples um the first example is um there's this company i forget the name of the founder but there's a company called automated trading desk which was a guy in west virginia who who is just a developer just made a exchange in his backyard he just like made you know back then there's no data center so he just bought a bunch of computers in his garage and at some point had like 20 of at u.s equities volume um running through this like basement in west virginia because he was just undercutting everyone on feet he was just charging like one tenth of what like nasek and nicely were doing um and then citigroup got you know kind of like fomo and then they they bought automated trading that's like 800 million dollars and so it's like there was this kind of like oh if you have a good idea you can get rich type of thing which kind of uh i think also i've heard this one before definitely some recurring themes i i want to talk about one last one maybe before we leave um the the 1.0 era of electronic markets and that's we had this kind of maybe nasty crisis that was partially as a result of electronic markets in 1987 the black monday that you're talking about did regulators step in after that and what happened to the the incumbents was there uh some consolidation um so how did regulators react and how did the market shake out from a consolidation or centralization perspective yeah that's actually a great question so regulators really focused on the thrifts so they focused on these people who were buying the options and less on the stock exchanges um so what happened was there's a ton of bank consolidation so like a lot of the mega banks you see now the the seeds of consolidation happened then like citigroup at that time in 1987 forget about group it was just citibank and they only had like they were only like in new york and like boston or something and there's this guy named sandy weil who became the ceo and he went on this like m a spree and just bought up like hundreds of banks and one of the reasons he was successful was partially because like of the savings and loan crisis because like government regulators like started regulating these savings and loan banks became too unprofitable to be like podunk town community bank uh that's the savings alone bank thrift and so they were all like kind of for fire sale for cheap and so he had the strategy of just like buying up every bank and then that's kind of how we got to the the current state was regulators regular the banks and not the exchanges and brokers but uh that theme will be recurring in 2.0 i think the time when regulators started to realize they had to maybe do something uh in regulating the exchanges was in 1997 uh which is toward the end of this first era there was what was called the asian financial crisis and the asian financial crisis uh you know i think is is well detailed in this book called when genius failed um about this like these like nobel prize economists who started this hedge fund that actually caused some of the collapse okay so like wrapping up um the first era we have we we've we've gone from this analog era where we had orders in the pits and and manual human order operators to this this first inkling of electronic markets and what that did was there was a massive liquidity boom right made these markets more efficient um it enabled new assets it removed a layer of lawyers as you said there was some asset standardization we had lower barriers to entry so all sorts of new entrants it kind of ended or got bumpy in a crisis regulators stepped in there was some consolidation these are some of the lessons we learned from the first era now uh true take us to the second era pick us up and i think it's maybe starts in the late 1990s or early 2000s uh where are you our timeline yeah i think the asian financial crisis might be the end like 1997. let's let's let's so now we're in era too what happened to electronic markets era too same way that people get fo mode by crypto and the price to go up people got fomo'd by all these tech ipos like pets.com and whatever all these like things that you know uh if you're old enough you might remember like your parents being like i gotta buy get e-trade and charles schwab and go like buy this company have you ever heard of it uh like uh and so that era part of the reason that like the e-trades and stuff of the world could work was that electronic markets made it cheap enough um for new businesses new entrants to actually build these kind of front-end businesses that faced the reta retail users face consumers and hid the complexity from them but also didn't require extreme like ownership of like a brokerage firm like like extreme you don't have to do as much work as a bank right the idea is like you the electronic markets made it easy to be kind of like a light bank you could view e-trade or charles schwab as like bank light is this like a early fintech would you say or not quite yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly early fintech like at each each uh uh phase i think there were sort of like bridge companies that connected the two sides these types like this side yeah and this side it was like e-trade charles schwab when they became electronic uh interactive brokers which is a public company and then on the between phase two and phase three it's robin hood and the real question me is like if i map this to tech companies robinhood is sort of like myspace in some weird way like that if we if we view defy as like kind of the the the the future um and we're saying that robin hood is transcending phase two and phase three just because it has crypto assets on its platform right yeah and they also like provide provide this like zero fees thing is kind of like i think like this idea that idea is like very not phase two in a lot of ways in other ways it's not really phase three either but it's it sort of makes it unique and so it really sounds like the delineation between these phases is not clear as in there there is no event that clay that delineates between phase one and phase two and there is no event that delineates between two and three is just kind of i think the asian financial crisis plus um the development of e-trade that era in 1997 and people getting home computers was it i can't give you like a date like the precision i'll give you is one year but 1997 is like a very good point to say because that was the time when kind of retail users were fomo'ed into buying stocks and they're like why should i pay a broker and like people who are young and had their first computer and dial up internet were like i can just buy this online it's cheaper why would i go to this brokerage pay them five percent when i can pay like eight dollars fixed because that was a big innovation in fees at that time that you had to pay a fixed price for an arbitrary size trade before that you had to pay percentage points right and so would you would you say that phase two is really a story of financial markets and brokerages making their way into the homes of the average everyday people everyday persons because of computers because of the personal computer and the internet and the internet and the internet and yeah and home internet um and also the dot-com boom was made it a little bit like uh oroboros like it ate itself because like people were investing in all these companies giving internet to people at home you know that uh of course you know people had a bit of exuberance just like but you know like we see in crypto all the time um and maybe went a little crazy and then you know we had this kind of pullback um but after the dot-com bubble uh crashed it was a very gentle crash in the sense that none of the financial infrastructure broke like in black monday 1987 1997 asian financial crisis the financial infrastructure actually just broke like like markets behaved in ways that were not supposed to there weren't correct like risk settings done there wasn't like risk monitoring there weren't people really paying attention because the risks weren't really you know when it's when something's new it's oftentimes really people sort of at the on the edge who are playing with these things but they're not like trying to actually analyze them they're just like i want to like play with cool new gambling toys and so those standards get learned over time and and they're people who kind of do that without without trying to trying to stay on the same path but also going down those quick little side quests what does it mean for a market to break as in like do things just not clear is that how you define a market breaking or just kind of go into that a little bit more what do you mean for sure in 1987 definitely not clearing was certainly one of the problems and not settling like like there just weren't enough shares like brokers promise x amount of shares delivered and those shares didn't materialize and like that caused people to have even further lack of confidence because they're like oh i thought i bought the share and now i can't like sell everything else right like maybe markets breaking is i like well i brought these shares and some some company i have this legal contract where they owe me shares and they don't have them to deliver therefore we're going to court and we go back with the twitter fail whale yes going to court it was the twitter fail whale i don't know if you guys remember yeah yeah they were just like always down like this this is like that that's kind of what i mean like you're trying to use the service like buy or sell things and like it just doesn't right it's definitely down would you say 2008 was another example of markets breaking a little bit different than like the dot-com bust in that you know that was a bubble on a bus but 2008 was a bit more like oh we don't really understand these financial new financial products that are on our balance sheet yes 2008 was things breaking for sure again because it was like in the same way in 1987 people didn't understand properties of options and like when certain risks need to be hedged and when you know like when they aren't hedged like what the worst case scenarios people just were like oh well that's a low probability event it turns out it's not when everyone is trying to sell at the same time same thing in two on eight it's just that it was done with way more complicated derivatives that have no transparency um and so there's kind of this theme that whenever there's a big blow up oftentimes you find under the covers that there's this kind of these assets that people don't realize hold risk but actually are holding a ton of risks like i could definitely see the um the lens that we've been using which is like the the new entrants are these retail people with uh with their computers um we've got increased liquidity i suppose coming from from retail do we have any new assets in this era i guess we have some innovations in like trading fees that sort of thing but are there like we saw the birth of options really in in the first era um do we get a new set of assets in yeah yeah yeah actually i would i would maybe delineate this era uh to be more precise as like 1997 to 2012. um and it has both a boom and a bust the last cycle had a boom and the bust and actually sort of had two busts but here here we have sort of like you know the build up to the financial crisis and the financial crisis and then kind of the recovery post financial crisis um and the reason i'm stopping in 2012 is i put the robinhood era plus crypto i'm i'm sort of mixing those two in in the kind of new era uh with d5 sort of being kind of the the where we're living we're living in that era now um but what happened then was were a couple things so uh in this era there were a lot of new financial products uh mortgage-backed securities of different forms like the mortgage-backed securities always existed but they didn't become tradable until this era and one of the reasons they didn't become tradable was people didn't have a math model that they thought worked of course we learned that was not a very good model but but we also learned that with options in 1987 so it is there is quite a bit of similarity uh and once people had a model they could like write algorithms to to quote prices uh and then things became exchange tradable you need fewer lawyers you have way more compute power we're we're like in this like moore's law era at that time where compute power is doubling every 18 months on average right your your home computer was getting doubly as fast every one and a half years uh and mobile phones were kind of starting to to take off around then although yeah i think apps were really sort of the end of this era um but the new instruments were like uh kind of volatility features uh so like the vix um etfs so this was the era when people started really for lack of a better phrase aping into passive investments and this completely changed the market structure um of the financial markets so an etf right is a share of something you buy that exchange tradable fund which thanks to electronic markets improving in their efficiency let you get a lot an exposure to some type of sector let's say i want to buy the metals uh metal miners sector but i don't want to go buy each individual stock i just want to own metal miners that's around the sector well percentage yeah but it needs to rebalance maybe i just want 10 miners 10 percent um like i don't know i don't know 50 miners 50 like distributors in that industry um and i want a 50 50 weighted portfolio just like a unisop what could be share i want 50 50 pool but that means i have to go trade to try to like keep it rebalanced and that sucks and so what people were doing before then is you pay these active mutual fund managers and you pay a really big fee to them to keep it rebalanced and so etfs were once people were able to write algorithms that were much better at holding option risk programmatically etfs became possible because you could basically say hey we're going to uh here's how here's how what the portfolio is going to look like here's how we're going to rebalance it and it's going to be done electronically there's not going to be a human in the loop actively saying what to buy and sell and there's going to be this arbitrage game that's created to keep the portfolio roughly balanced so where does the role of communication and computation come in with these etfs how does improvements in these two things really enable that product yeah so the improvement in communication is that uh you know somewhere in the middle of this era so 2003 to 2006 uh the u.s government decided that they really wanted to um make sort of arguably at that time you know what they said the intention was was not what the outcome was but the what the stated uh goal was was to make markets um more sort of equitable every stock exchange had to offer the national best bid and offer and what that means is let's say let's go back to my example of like the new york stock exchange and the chicago stock exchange let's say they're owned by two different companies one is nasdaq one is nicey and let's say that there are two there's a company that's listed on both so there's gm shares at nisei and there's gm shares at nasa well before the prices were allowed to be different so the nizzy could tell you gm's share price is 30 nasdaq could tell you it's 25 but that was just because like the people trading on nasdaq think it's 25 and the people trading on nazi think it's 30. the u.s made this regulation called regulation neutral market service reg nms and it basically said every market had to actually go look at every other exchange and quote you the best price so basically this meant that nazi actually had to go to nasdaq and say like hey nasdaq what price you're offering and hey we have to offer it at the same price because there there's this idea that this would be like more fair and transparent this caused insane consolidation this is the reason we have like so few exchanges uh in general this this also just seems completely antithetical to the concept of markets in the first place so the sec is the the agency that put in the regulation nms in place and they're just dictating that the market must price certain assets at a specific price as dictated by the lowest or or the best most optimized uh market participant that's giving the best price and they're saying like everyone else must offer that same price that seems a little bit crazy right and i i think it was like the i still like so i wasn't working in the industry at that time so i don't have at that i don't understand what the intention was because like you read the law it doesn't really make any sense in modern terms because basically it led to this consolidation we have where you have an oligopoly of like citadel jump a few other people who are the main market makers so it turned everything into this computer science distributed systems problem of how do i synchronize many nodes each think of each exchange as a node how do i synchronize prices across all nodes in the minimum amount of time um because like there's an arbitrage profit so the government basically created this like weird arbitrage profit and the exchanges exchanges don't want to take risk they don't want to be traders they just want to like collect fees on every on volume so what they did is they invented market maker maker taker rebates which you may be familiar from just on centralized exchanges or even yield farming in some ways a sort of a make or taker rebate um but they they basically offered you incentives for making sure they're pri they they met the reagan ms rules so like if you did a bunch of volume and you also did a bunch of trades that made sure that like the nasdaq price and the nizi price were synchronized then you got a cheaper you you basically got a discount on your fees um and that kind of led to this heavy consolidation both in exchanges um and also in trading firms that were market makers so you remember how ice and era won there was this this kind of wild west of like hey this guy in west virginia just like made an exchange i had 20 of the daily volume there were tons of exchanges like that in the 90s dot com crash killed a bunch of them and then this regulation really killed all of them and and now we're back to kind of this like oligopoly we have like cme chicago mercantile exchange nasa act nicely that's it pretty much and and just rehash why the emergence of etfs were so important in uh helping accelerate this story ah yeah yeah so sorry so so etfs are kind of guaranteed trading volume so one thing that that all of the kind of like smart i put in air quotes money at that time was saying was like oh etfs are dumb there's tons of adverse selection everyone's picking them off it's exactly the same as sbf saying unispot will fail because like everyone there's a ton of adverse selection there's a ton of adverse selections but all these people don't care they're fine yeah what do you mean by average selection yeah so so adverse selection uh basically means like you know you're when i'm an etf and i'm the etf is like hey i have to buy 500 shares every day to keep my 50 50 50 ratio of my two assets you're telling the market you're going to be a big buyer and so everyone will front run you and just buy in front of you and then you they'll sell to you at a higher price right so let's say the current price is ten dollars everyone knows the etf has to buy new shares of 3 59 p.m everyone goes at 3 58 p.m buys up all the shares pushes the price to two dollars then the etf has to buy at two dollars and they all sell into that so so like all the med stuff you see is the same as this so it's it's it but the idea is that like hey the etf's telling you what's doing so you're going to get front run so that anyone who holds the etf is going to lose money that's sort of true but it's also there are a lot of people who like they'd rather just own any exposure even if it's losing money in the like it's not the optimal exposure it's still better than sitting on cash for them right like and they they don't have to think they literally just buy the thing and they and it's sitting in their robin hood account it's like they don't sit and trade yeah it's lazy lp right like and passive investing always wins like if there's anything that this era has taught us is that passive investing used to be 10 of the market in the early 2000s it's like 80 percent of volume in stock the stock market right now just because of etfs because of etfs and then there's all these other types of like like all the active managers and mutual funds now rebranded themselves as like hey we're like active light we don't do much trading but but that's all boomer finance that's like targeted to boomers like mutual funds are truly like i don't i don't think anyone under i don't think a single gen z person knows what mutual fund is like wait so just just to just finalize the this train of thought the the etfs and the consolidation of um i think consolidation in the industry uh we actually haven't finished finished that topic how did the emergence of etfs lead to the consolidation that we know today ah right so etfs had a bunch of guaranteed volume right they're telling you when they're buying and selling right and people in the same way that robin hood sells their order flows citadel the etf underwriters the banks who just want to collect some small fee they collect a very small fee on creating and redeeming so creating is i let's say i there's an etf called the car etf the america the detroit etf and it you you it's made up of a portfolio of one-third ford one-third gm and one-third chrysler um so to create an etf share i like an lp share right when i create a uniform lp share i have to give them eth and i have to give usdc here i would take maybe two shares of gm one share of chrysler and half a share of uh ford and i would give it to the etf underwriter and then give me one unit of etf share same thing as like making a uniform lp chair uh and then there's a redemption process which i can redeem one share for for the fair value and so that's this arbitrage game just like with lp shares that uh etfs created to kind of like keep themselves synchronized to the market prices so if someone observed a deviation in the price they could buy the basket for cheap sell create the share and then sell the share for more and then that way the prices would track exactly like unison um and uh basically that arbitrage game became extremely profitable if you bought order flow from the etf so you you were you were go the etf underwriters the people who are minting and creating the shares like blackrock uh you basically like hey blackrock sell me your order flow and i'll execute it and make sure make sure it stays synchronized so there's a lot of that that the path of order flow aggregated a ton of volume but then all the volume got sold to a small number of people executing it in the exact same way robinson is now it provided better execution it also lowered fees for people but it did consolidate the industry into a very small number of players so a very small number of players were responsible and had control over the order flow and that that starts to my mind lead us into like kind of how the whole robin hood gamestop debacle how the foundations for that were set right would you say that that's correct like what you are talking about right now is the the tremors before the actual event of the whole gamestop debacle that would you say that's correct yeah yeah this was the same thing happening at the like institutional level like with order flow like basically banks used to be market makers they used to be quoting prices on markets electronic markets made it possible for small firms who were not banks and didn't have a banking license to quote much faster if they had better technology and so all these technologists like my old boss in the 80s and 90s they basically front run banks into being market makers but then once we had this kind of flip of the passive investing world banks were like hey we're not even going to try to market we're just going to sell our order flow and it's easier income for us and then that led to further consolidation that's why like new trading firms are actually very hard to start right now i would say in in tradify in crypto of course with screen passers but totally so let's in order to keep on like defining this wave to phase two of the electronic markets can you kind of compare and trust the the start of phase two and the end of phase two and like you know where what was with the state of things while phase two was getting uh started and then once you know phase two was kind of coming towards maturity and kind of finishing up where did it end up as yeah so it started with the dot-com crash and kind of like a lot more uh like people kind of a little bit like the crypto bear market like people basically there wasn't much retail there was only kind of like institutions and institutions were trying to figure out new products like etfs by the end we had these these products really growing massively and increasing retail uptake um but we also had very few players who were able to be the uh market participants who are market makers and so in the same in a lot of ways like market making became just like a very small set of people who could actually do it um which you know unlike in d5 where like anyone could be a liquidity provider if you want to be um i think that that that sort of is uh you know we started there were more maybe like a lot of market participants not many retail products by the end new retail products not many market participants right so we in in phase two and and i think also perhaps phase one as well we are increasing the accessibility of markets to more and more participants yet the service providers the people actually routing trades and making sure things execute has consolidated to a fewer and fewer set of people you say that's correct yep and what's the role of uh the stock exchanges in in phase two where are where's the the nasdaq where where's the new york stock exchange how did those grow and develop during phase two yeah so those uh grew kind of the way in the you know you know after the savings and loan crisis i said the government's like regulated these drifts and then like you got these conglomerate mega banks uh you had the same thing happen um where basically like after reagan mms came up basically it was impossible to be a small upstart exchange and everyone just sold to cme or or nassac or nazi so like the big exchange conglomerates you see now are they just basically bought up everyone so they're when i say fewer market participants i also mean fewer venues right right right and and also it correct me if i'm wrong but we're also kind of seeing like the very early days of what the crypto knows as mev also crop up during phase two uh where like there's a you know everyone wants their orders prioritized first and then the people routing the orders have the advantage can you talk about the early days of mev but in electronic markets phase two which we wouldn't even have called mev what would what did he did high frequency trading just highlighted frequency trading let's look at the average of that yeah high frequency trading really refers to like when exchanges started um selling co-location so exchanges were like hey you know what we should actually sell i wouldn't say it's like selling priority but they kind of were like hey we'll like sell priority in some weird way where if you pay to rent a server at our data center you get slightly faster execution speed um and then it became this kind of like hardware war of like who could build the best hardware um and high frequency trading boiled down to like who could build the best hardware so that your order got the the moment you got a new signal you could process the signal as fast as possible and like output in order um as that's possible and so some people started custom hardware for that and that that kind of was like i'd say like the peak peak hft was actually post financial crisis pre-financial crisis the technology wasn't that good post-financial crisis i think i think the financial crisis in general kind of caused the exchanges to be like hey we need a diverse fire business model and then there was also this new wave of of hft people who are way more hardware and cs and way less quant and they were sort of the wave of people who were doing that so some i guess i like i worked in hft before i came to crypto so but like it it's definitely like a industry that's like focused on uh like speed and execution and less on like did i have the right math model is there a huge arms race in hft touring yeah i mean it's kind of the armed race in hft has also led to like super consolidation um because like just yeah the cost of like hardware microwave towers everything is gone up exponentially and the profits of decayed uh so like yeah basically it's the profits don't totally decay they're kind of flatlined but if the cost of hardware is going up every year then it's like only the biggest ones are going to survive would you say the the whole high frequency trading phenomenon would that is that more of an afterthought of the phase two of electronic markets or is that like a core component of it it's definitely an at the end yeah at the end why at the end so i think the financial crisis caused people to be very cost conscious which led which will lead into phase three uh and so when people are cost conscious uh they want really fast execution um because there's a sense in which the faster your execution the lower the information difference between market participants because like markets are synchronized faster and that means the prices are the closest to the true price in some sense um the mev part of this was just like hey if there's a ton of people competing to be first then they're all competing and keeping the the prices synchronized right like they there's sort of a sense in which uh competition does drive prices down the mev case is a little weird though because the order flow is public right so it took citadel a while and virtue and others to realize they should be buying order flow by writing contracts so you do high frequency trading but you sign multi-year deals with robinhood or whatever to buy all their order flow in mev land it's actually quite different uh the order flow is just public right like it's sent to the mempool uh of course like with some some nuance i mean some miners let you send order flow directly and stuff like that but so be before we finish out uh the the second era and go to the the third era that we are in right now i gotta ask the question did we remove any lawyers in this in this 2.0 era yeah i think we like added a bunch of lawyers in the beginning because like people want to make these crazy volatility products and mortgage-backed securities and weird derivatives uh like the matt levines of the world that's that's when their careers took off financial crisis killed all those lawyers i would say okay uh you know i think there's a reason he's a journalist now and not doing that for i mean that i mean there's probably many reasons but i wouldn't i wouldn't i would say that's probably one of them what about the second phase really killed the lawyers uh i think basically the advent of high frequency trading and the advent of passive investing vehicles meant you didn't have to do all sorts of weird structuring because the passive investing vehicles made this arbitrage game a little bit like uniswap that kind of replaced the lawyers having to do the pricing the market was able to do the pricing without them oh go ahead david when it comes to the financial crisis how did the state of the market structure as a result of the changes that we saw in phase two did that the the way that the markets were set up and and you know um architected did that change or or impact the the financial crisis at all um i think it did for these kind of like esoteric securities like mortgage-backed securities um partially because like those were all traded on weird venues or over the counter between banks so there's no transparency into how the contracts what the terms of the contract are and how they get executed and what triggers payments and i think you know when we go to phase three we'll talk about how like that defy is kind of like made you makes uh lets you do that without lawyers and so like and also while making it transparent as to what the payoffs are hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation thus far in the second half of the show we get into electronic markets 3.0 or d5 and talk about some of these companies that are transcending the barriers or transcending the gap between 2.0 and 3.0 uh robin hood coinbase centralized exchanges these come to mind but also we talked about the different ways that electronic markets 3.0 3.0 ethereum and d5 are fundamentally constructed differently and where electronic markets 3.0 really rhyme better with 1.0 rather than 2.0 i thought that was a fantastic conversation and then we also get into the new risks of defy now that defy has come and solved a lot of the problems that we find in the legacy world what new risks have we introduced and what is uh tyrone doing at gauntlet to help deal with some of these risks hope you're enjoying the conversation there's so much more to get into before we go any further however we have to talk a moment about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so i think it's time that we actually move on to phase three but first i'd like to summarize phase two how would you characterize like if if you could do it in just like a sentence or two how would you characterize the legacy of phase two what did it leave behind as we go into phase three passive investing is the main way the market wants to invest if you want to increase the number of market participants two hft completely annihilates the banks from market making um and then the order flow business is created but for institutions not for retail but phase three will move to that and what's the themes the incoming themes for phase three and also was there some sort of uh you know uh event or year that really marked the the leaving of phase two and the entrance into phase three yeah so i think you know if i if i go by industry profits the the peak profit and year for high frequency trading was 2012. uh so that sort of like signals to me one of the ends like the that was like the pinnacle of that era and what happened from 2012 on was this new uh new entrance of retail via apps like robinhood and also via crypto retail into markets in general uh and i think like centralized crypto and robinhood are sort of the stepping stone um and d5 is sort of like the expression of like that taken to kind of its logical extreme of of how can how can we sort of remove middlemen so the thing about hft is it's often reviled um like oh people front running us but the weird thing is the prices for everyone the reason robin hood can exist and offer you free trading is because like hft is so competitive that the prices just like fell through the floor and basically uh you know these like traditional brokers can't take like percentage points at all anymore right so high frequency traders brought prices to the floor do you mean like the arbitrage opportunity as in like margins tighter and tighter and tighter exactly and so like a lot of these like old-school brokers who like that's that's where they made their money uh couldn't do it without a ton of technology and a ton of resources and so like obviously the technologist kind of killed the fat cats in that case so would you say phase three is not faith phase three isn't defy it's more about access to markets and so i think perhaps the reason why you're including robin hood in phase three even though has nothing really to do with crypto other than the fact that it allows crypto assets on this platform robin hood is the weed of defense the gateway drug it's like right coinbase two perhaps like these are these are these apps that are like phase 2.5 maybe yeah they're kind of these transition things yeah yeah exactly okay so how would you characterize phase three then what's the theme of phase three why does phase three exist i think the theme of phase three is internet culture and memes will beat suits in some sense and you know i think a lot of people who are doing quant trading probably have had better decades than they did since kind of this era um what is the what is the underlying technology of phase three that really unlocked phase three yeah so there are two two aspects to it one is new back ends some new back-end technologies that replace intermediaries so that's crypto um and the other is the mobile phone so you know yes the iphone came out in 2007 but if you remember for like two or three years apple not only didn't have an ice uh app store but you could jailbreak your phone and like install these kind of like renegade third-party uh app stores and we kind of had a little bit of like the like hacker culture uh in mobile phones that completely got eviscerated by the app store and so like by 2011-ish uh i think i feel like that was that was sort of the you know the the era of like centralization in in mobile phone land um and why is that as such a thematic component of phase three why does that matter so much because it changed the user experience for finance like basically people got super comfortable once they got comfortable with mobile phones and apps they also got comfortable with mobile finance like doing finance on your phone and the idea that you can do this without going to a branch remember we started in 80s where like you had to go to like the weird brokerage firm in your town and like go stand in line whatever and now it's just like i can just use this whenever 24 or feels like 24 7. that was like a huge tectonic shift and that was something i think that brought new users and new people new entrants into the marketplace and i think the other thing that's interesting that kind of really took place is that crypto over time became kind of the prediction market for what would happen in stocks so i feel like the boom of retail investing started in crypto and then kind of got copied by you know we saw the same trend of like memetic investing over sort of like fundamentals based investing uh kind of seeped through we also saw sort of um like disintermediation or like calls for disintermediation uh from crypto kind of starting to be seen in the equities market especially after the gamestop stuff and and you know people actually realizing that hey the back end of the financial system is actually still whatever stuff was made in the 90s like it hasn't you know uh and then you know we sort of see this idea that like retail users want to buy exotic products like the uh you know i think defy pretended this thing where like options volume on robinhood has never been you know it was like there was more retail volume in options than institutional volume for the first time ever this year um and this idea that financial access to even complicated products is made easier by a uh sort of mobile phones b um everyone has a computer with a ton of power around them all the time like and they can be crunching numbers and doing kind of like basically doing all the financial modeling themselves without any infrastructure costs and then c this idea that uh you can use financial products and apps almost as easily as it is to use facebook or to use social media um or twitter and i think that is really what portends to defy where once you have composability it's like it's just like you know using apps on your phone like using integrating apps on your phone and being able to like play with a much larger universe of products so i think this the last phase has really been is really brought up by the the de-institutionalization first of all that that's clear that that is the number one trend but the second thing is that compute uh has become so cheap and easy and communication is so cheap and easy for everyone not just for companies not just for exchanges not just for market makers that these markets can kind of scale to all humans and also at the same time be awake 24 7 and people can create and destroy products as as they need them which you know i think in in normal finance it's extremely slow to make a new financial product and it takes a lot of time to like get liquidity and like get people to understand what it is and define crypto really have made it so that the inventors of the products can be their own marketplace they can be their own media go like you know go mark it down twitter and tick tock and then they can also just uh kind of like do this without any with like relatively low capital costs true not i'm interested when we uh when we talk about like the the first era in the second era right and um we talked about these kind of companies and products that are sort of these uh these bridge type products and maybe robinhood is is one such um bridge product right um but what strikes me is uh the way era 3 is different than era 1 and era 2 is the previous electronic market eras existed within the existing financial system right whereas era 3 is creating this brand new almost from the bottom up financial system where all of the themes that we saw in the first and second era of like increasing liquidity enabling new assets removing a layer of lawyers stan you know standardization of assets erc20s right lower barriers to entry um all of these things seem to be like almost on steroids in this in this third era in this new parallel financial system that we've invented so it feels like robinhood is just this like bridge thing to get us to this weird bizarre new world in this new financial system that we've built from the ground up where it's like arrow one and era two except amplified to you know to the tenth degree um what's your take on that yeah i mean i think that's that's a good way of thinking about it it it it it has this like exploratory playful nature though that is that sort of feels like a little bit reminiscent of the early part of the 80s prior to the crash you know like people were just like making all sorts of crazy stuff doing all sorts of sort of wild experimentation um and you know i think that that's sort of inevitable that we're going to run into some issues right we've already seen some issues with with d5 stuff but i think the cool thing is the democratization of these assets basically means people will try to use them in weird ways that are not expected and you know that that's going to be kind of both good and also bad but we're going to get new data points from it and i think the idea is like really about kind of like over time building risk you know i think one of the big things institutions have that retail users don't still don't really have and then they do now for for stocks and options i'd say but not for defy is really tools about like understanding risk and stuff and that's because it feels like the 1980s and options where people didn't really know and you know it's like getting the math right is the hard part right and and we've kind of over time we started with getting the math right then adding technology thinking the math right the nang technology and there's kind of this like back and forth and usually the crashes punctuate the times when we transition between new technology causes new behavior versus like new math causes new behavior new product when i say new math i'm also mixing new product because there's a sense in which if you're making a financial product you do have to sort of define the math of like how the asset gets traded so so terran we've got this era of uh experimentation this new playground as you've said do you think that this might also precipitate like as in the 1980s all this experimentation precipitate some sort of crisis and could that crisis even cause you know regulators to step in and do some things i'm wondering about the themes that we can learn from era 1 and era 2 so that we can project forward and see what we might anticipate uh in this uh in this crypto defy era yeah i think you know we we're certainly going to see uh some forms of crashes again you know we we already we already had cryptos had had a few uh but the cool thing is they happen faster in crypto but i think the second thing is that as we get into a world where there's a lot of d5 protocols there's a lot of dows and uh you know these protocols kind of like learn best standards and the things people kind of figure out how to model this stuff [Music] we will eventually have tools that people can use to measure this risk themselves in a manner that's understandable and interpretable um when they're building new products it's sort of like if you could understand how to get composable risk models in the way of composable money legos then you could make it just as easy as as using robinhood turn i i want to run this by you because i'm not sure if it's completely true or not but i i the the story of this podcast is that you know history doesn't repeat but it rhymes phase phase one and phase two are similar but not completely the same phase two and phase three are similar but not completely the same but i i think i i can make the case that phase three is meaningfully different from phase one and phase two in the sense that are the uh you you talked about how back ends are different now and you talked about how that's crypto you know ethereum and bitcoin are these new settlement networks that are replacing the bottom of a financial system whereas phase two was an evolution on phase one right it was an evolution of financial markets as they currently existed into something new whereas phase three is something completely brand new now we're not reinventing finance we're just in reinventing the substrate that it exists upon and so while these are the same themes throughout history it is phase three is radically different from previous phases in the sense that the guts of the system are completely brand new is it would you agree with that i think phase one also is like that yeah i i think phase one is phase one coming from phase zero right like yeah coming from like pit traders like replacing that was that was also a similar tectonic shift um but and the overarching another overarching through line is that phase three and d5 it's just way more accessible than what came before it and you talked about how like you know we can easily spin up new financial instruments and you know market that on twitter and like i think we have seen also not legal advice sorry sorry yeah very much not legal advice never ever um and i i think we can take a a lesson from andre cronier's book when he you know releases yearn and it has this like this accidental success that he didn't even intend to market right like and he actually got frustrated at the level of success that it saw because of just the nature of the industry and so we are now seeing a complete democratization of what it means to make a financial product uh just because of the the nature of this new substrate yeah for sure it's completely different it's completely wild but there are still lessons to be learned uh for sure and i think a lot of the lessons boil down to like how do you think about risk at each new stage there was a new mental model a new mental framework that needed to be invented new tools to to kind of think about risk because like a lot of the point of different final financial products like new ones is to do risk transference at some level transferring risk from some part of the market to another brother market and in defy land it's even wilder because the risks are sort of when you have a composable network of apps uh you know the the figuring exactly kind of like how to hedge that under any different possible user behavior is is is is quite different than oh i'm just hedging the exposure to the stock price and it's like a static object in some sense there are a couple themes that i want to re-revisit here one of the themes is uh the removal of lawyers out of the system can you talk about how you know phase three has removed lawyers yeah so i mean d5 definitely is removable so i i view unisop liquidity shares and and and all of the generalizations of them as basically etfs where you don't need barclays to be the manager like the smart contract is the underwriter um and a lot for liquidity from the perspective of liquidity provider right because the liquid liquidity provider is like hey i want a 50 50 portfolio and sure you could use it to facilitate trades right from there in sort of an abstract sense um i i think there's like that the the the sort of disintermediation both at the consumer level like the retail user can go do it themselves and at the issuer level like why do i need to go to blackrock to issue the etf and i think that's kind of the crazy wild improvement that we've seen again not without pitfalls like this if history rhymes we're going to kind of learn that there are hidden risks but you can only you know there's a combination of both modeling and thinking about things and also just like breaking things and so right you kind of need both lenses and that the cool thing is this industry definitely feels like it's in this phase right now i think for normal finance and stocks and stuff i think people just uh yeah it's like too regulated like to do anything creative in yeah speaking of the regulation i think one of the the big ways that these this third wave has really broken away from the the previous two is that not not only have we reduced the need for lawyers but like to some degree if we keep if you keep your construction of whatever you're building inside of defining types inside of smart contracts instead of needing lawyers the evm is the lawyer right the evm is the law and so not only have we broken away from lawyers but we've also broken away from regulations right because the like i said the evm is the regulations and and so i kind of think that like regulators are it's going to take them a lot longer for them to come to terms with phase three than it was for phase one and phase two just because the ethereum ethereum doesn't use the us legal system to settle and so like if markets quote unquote break down it's up to the evm not to the u.s court system to make the markets clear uh and so what's your opinion on the fact that you know we now have this new court system which is the evm rather than the u.s legal system and how regulators are going to approach this world of crypto uh using lessons from phase one and two yeah i mean i think the initial regulator strategy was of course block the on-ramps uh so so i will say regulators took a long time for electronic market like the early for phase one they they like didn't know what was happening it's it's like closer to this right now okay uh i think that they they didn't have the tools they weren't really sure like because they're so easy to start a stock exchange and you didn't have any regulation on this national best bid and offer thing you shut down one like someone else will come up like it wasn't as structured as it is in crypto where it's like built around that being the modality but that was what was happening in the like late 80s early 90s for sure um but i i would say yeah it's going to be hard for them to grapple with um but i think that's the beauty of of kind of being in this space right now is that for now i think it will be kind of uh you can actually try out all of these new things um without you know with some level of impunity uh i think in the long run governance will somehow end up being part of like regulators will somehow try to like you know like the block the fiat on ramps will be block the governance on-ramp type of thing like that i think that's the route they would go yeah with the themes that we've been following so far in in the show how would you um account for just the fact that there's a massive number of centralized exchanges that have cropped up right um in in 10 20 years we haven't really seen exchanges outside of the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq but as soon as crypto shows up you got coinbase kraken gemini finance you know ok x you know bit thumb uh and that's not even to talk about the decentralized exchanges that exist on ethereum why why is why was that enabled like what what part of this this story enabled so many exchanges to just crop up yeah i mean it it's a little bit like the early 90s when in stock exchanges anyone could just go start a stock exchange randomly right and the difference is uh if you remember in phase two we had this this regulation that completely killed um a lot of the stock exchanges and forced consolidation in crypto it's much harder because a your fiat exchange centralized exchanges are the fiat on ramps for most people and they need to have local banks and i think it's just way harder because it's like a global phenomenon to like imagine a world where there's like one centroid exchange um i think the other thing is just uh there's so many assets and so many like different like standards at different exchanges for which assets they have how much liquidity they have and it's actually really hard to do a lot of the arbitrage like people like oh there's so much easy arbitrage between like the thailand bitcoin exchange and the us one well the problem is you need a ton of tai bot and a thai bank account to get money into that exchange right like so there's all sorts of weird like pseudo-regulatory reasons for like the the kind of like explosion and centralized exchanges i think um but yeah i think the fiat on our on-ramp thing is certainly the the main thing governments know how to do and that's like the only thing they'll probably continue to do uh so turin you've mentioned a few times we've been talking about um you know phase three that each of these other phases have presented new risks and um you know d5 in this crypto phase presents new risks as well i'm curious from your vantage point and like you've got i mean you're working on this with gauntlet you're an investor in the space all sorts of things um you know mev in and out what are the big risks that you see on the horizon for defy and crypto at this point yeah i mean i think we we composability is a two-sided sword as well you know there's the boons it's it's much more capital efficient in some sense uh but obviously the risks are that you could compound your risk as you move through different protocols but i think one of the bigger risks over time is is going to be more from uh like users not understanding what they're buying uh and i think that's like that's like in general kind of fine i think it's much harder when people are you know taking a ton of leverage and they don't understand when their leverage might like when they get liquidated or when when something like an adverse event happens and i think a lot of reducing that is figuring out how to convey in simple terms sort of likelihoods and probabilities of risk to users in a way that they can understand and in a way that they can say like when i do action x this is what how much it will change my risk now a little bit like options and 80s like you know the math isn't there yet the way of reasoning about things isn't totally there but i mean that that's sort of what we we work on at gauntlet but it it's it's like there's still this sense in which there's a lot of like fly-by-night uh kind of uh behavior and i think if we don't have good risk we're not going to risk models risk assessments risk kind of understanding we're not going to actually be able to get to this kind of dream of like closer to under collateralized loans and closer to being more capital efficient than um centralized exchanges because capital efficiency comes to the cost of security like how much capital you put comes at cost of like oh how easy is it to take advantage of the system and being able to walk that tightrope um carefully is going to be the key to success of d5 kind of taking away from it yeah i will say just from like a practical perspective it is really hard to understand the risks like i so you take something like um you know a dye versus c dye right so like dye wrapped in compound versus dye wrapped in ave i like i have no way to tell the you know like the risk difference between the those two assets and if one is riskier than the other um it's very difficult is this the sort of transparency you're talking about and what do you do at gauntlet to to help with this because it seems like a lot of these things are hidden and um like the risk is really difficult to quantify so how do you start to quantify the risk of these types of things yeah i think yeah so something like something the difference between ada and cdy that is not static it's not like i can tell you yeah right forever at all times that the a die is safer than c die or c die is safer than a die it's always changing based on the user behavior in these systems so it's dependent on the types of loans that there are outstanding it's dependent on the types of liquidity providers how often they're adding and removing liquidity it's dependent on the liquidators like can liquidators are there enough liquidators do they have enough dye and so this complex mesh here is different than normal finance in another cool way which is you have you have multiple agents and participants who each have to sort of if if they're rational and the market conditions make sense each of them working as expected somehow keeps the system safe but if any one of them is sort of removed the system can collapse and that's just the nature of decentralized version of this versus sort of like a bank if a bank collapses well government bails out or you know like the legal system somehow resolves that right that's not going to happen here right so the key here is to make sure there's sufficient incentives for all of the participants and that all the participants can earn a profit given their sort of utility their measure of happiness uh in these systems and so you know what what gauntlet uh you know how we started and kind of how we got to where we are now is when i was working in high frequency trading a lot of the ways that we were we would optimize and measure risk in our trading strategies that we'd put in production is we would take our strategy and we would take what we thought other people's strategies are in the market and we would run a simulation where they sort of played a game against each other and we'd run millions of different universes of the same simulation and say like hey what percentage of time does our strategy win and which strategies does it win against crypto markets are kind of similar there's in in the case of a lender there is a borrower there's a lender and there's the liquidators the liquidators are keepers and they each have different incentives the liquidators have very low time preference and they just want to optimize profit instantly the borrowers just want to pay the lowest rate and the lenders just want to earn the most yield and they all even though those three are sometimes opposing you can find these equilibria where they're very stable but you need to be able to say hey what do i think this user does what do i think this other user does and what i think this other user does based on the data that you've seen historically and also things that you haven't seen but could be kind of irrational crazy behavior from them and crypto systems are also analyzed this way when we analyze consensus protocols or we analyze zero knowledge proofs we try to model a world where we assume that the these advertise adversaries or users can be byzantine and maybe not rational and maybe sort of doing something erratic and so what we do is we model all the users in the system and then run simulations of them kind of competing using historical data and then say what percentage of the time does this particular type of adverse event like a liquidation happen and so it's slightly different than the way people quantify things in you know the way people think about risk models in uh sort of like an insurance company or uh sort of like more like an asset manager but it's much closer to how people in high frequency trading and sort of ai in a lot of ways think about modeling risk because here the transparency actually means you can model it in a way closer to hft or ai and so you know from doing that you can start to to say things like hey if the parameter the interest rate curve in the system was slightly different then this event happens 50 percent less and so that that's sort of the outputs of kind of this type of modeling if that makes sense true and i want to present i want to put on my like blind ball hat and i want then i want you to see uh see if i'm being naive or smart or not and a lot of with these phases phase one phase two there was some sort of like market event market crisis that perhaps ended the phase and then moved on to the new one also regulators came in and started acting because of the crisis and started to you know shake things up a little bit uh and and i want i want to see if that you know i want to know if that's going to come true for for defying crypto right so far this industry has come being relatively blessed to be protected from some heavy-handed regulation and there's definitely been conversations and some some light regulation coming but overall as an industry we haven't really been too regulated we also really haven't had too much of a financial crisis because this a this industry isn't big enough to really have a financial crisis uh but b like we go through booms and bus and we have our market events that are negative but they just don't really impact the greater globe you know we the crypto has gone through like multiple major drawdowns of 90 in asset prices and it survived that the markets survived that d5 was born in 2017 2018 and then we we saw ether lose 95 of its value d5 kept on going worked just fine then we had black thursday uh with with covid or black tuesday or whatever it was where you know uh asset prices got cut by 60 in under a day so we've had both like long-term drawdowns with asset prices that caused liquidations and things were fine then we had extremely fast volatility drawdowns and very short amount of amounts of time things kind of got broke up a little bit but ultimately markets cleared the ethereum blockchain kept on going nothing really bad happened and what you are talking about with this financial modeling that's going on that you guys do at gauntlet to talk about you know risk parametrization for ave and compound we are able to do that by the very nature of what defy is we have the data to do that and we can make more informed simulations to make more informed economic platforms and so my bold case for dfi and ethereum and and this this industry at large is that we have so much data permissionlessly available to everyone and we have this new financial substrate which is you know ethereum and the evm that will continue to clear markets no matter what as they have done that perhaps we never actually have our big financial crisis moment that previous phases have had that have brought in the regulators and so perhaps the evm and the ethereum blockchain just keep on chugging people like you and and companies like gauntlet keep on doing great financial modeling because of the richness of data that we have and we are actually protected from any sort of massive financial crisis by the very nature of the industry industry am i being naive here well you could argue that bsc was a financial crisis in some ways just in the sense of like in the sense of like all of the kind of like rug pulling and like i think that the the key thing to a financial crisis is there's a lot of naive or uneducated participants who lose a lot of money and right now the thing is if we're being real everyone in this space is like a little bit like you know paying their theirs their risk tolerance is certainly not low right it's not like no you know like the sec only really goes after people when like grandma loses her her pension money right and like that's the that's kind of the type of thing i think that would be more like institutions losing money like some let's say like some college endowment like puts money into iron finance and loses because mark cuban told them to like like that's the type of stuff i think that like people would call a christ a sort of crisis in some ways it's like when moms and pops sure you know lose money who are not kind of like risk seeking to some extent and i'm not trying to say i'm not trying to call everyone on this call super risky but i'm just saying yeah compared to like the the people who like yeah like pension funds kind of that's kind of when people start getting a little antsy i feel like okay well my question still stands though so like is there a fundamental difference in these phase three of the electronic markets that protects us from systemic risk that we've seen happen in previous markets yeah transparency so one one really cool uh thing i think that is uh that exists in crypto is that we've already we have like tons of cdos mortgage-backed securities that do fine they're just under different names like you could you could view makers mkr is sort of like security for a cdo um you could view staking derivatives like lido which basically has sort of something like uh a little bit like a mortgage-backed security backed by your stake that's locked up and the cool thing about them and this is the difference between 2008 and d5 is not necessarily just that uh that you know hey it's electronic the data is is is super transparent it's also that the information is propagated through all the entities using things because of composability so in the mortgage crisis well here's what kind of how things would happen you would go get a mortgage your mortgage issuer would then go securitize it the securitizer would make shares like they make a company that bought your mortgage that company would have shares those shares would get sold now let's say you default on your house so the company owns a bunch of mortgages that owns the securities the default process takes like three to six months i mean very locality to locality sensitive right like oh like you know maybe certain places like you can't foreclose on on a house in one month and other places you can foreclose instantly and there's a whole legal procedure and there's also all these middlemen there's the person who made the company that's securitizing there's the mortgage issuer there's like this whole like cruft of that industry which is mainly due to regulatory capture to be honest um and so the security has a price last traded price but the information of like which houses are foreclosed what's the true value of like the mortgages inside this black box that's the company has it could take six months to reach the security like the securities holders will only learn about it six months later and they'll be they'll only learn about via some weird disclosure form that's regulatory required not because like the issuer wants to tell them in d5 you're issuing these crazy securities but the information is priced basically instantly like within a couple blocks right like something happens smart contract executes all of the you know price change there's a decision tree of like hey how should we mark all the different components and like here's the new price of the security that fact that the information in a complicated financial product can be propagated through it and executed atomically and sort of instantly basically instantly is a hallmark of how this is much more different than kind of what we saw in 2008 and why all the lawyers were necessary there because the lawyers were the ones who are like propagating the information between the different entities right right and ensuring that these transactions order lawyers order routing and the lawyers in case anyone listening doesn't know take much higher fees than like robinhood uh so yeah you could basically think of that and so i view the lawyers in that whole industry as like like the open pit you know to get back to phase one like the open outcry people they're the ones who are like doing the hand signals and and they got replaced and this feels a lot like like d5 really feels like it's these complicated financial products that were gate kept are now kind of being unleashed so taron this has been an incredible i guess walk through the three phases of electronic uh markets here and i'm wondering if you could just like leave us with a few final thoughts for um this phase three era it feels like we're maybe still in the front half of phase three but but i'm not sure like so how do you see this playing out and how can we prepare ourselves uh for for the rest of uh phase three yeah i think the the sort of main things uh to think about are you know one what primitives will be invented that might be even further out on the risk scale that get lots of capital in because i think those are the places where you're most likely to have kind of these kind of potential crashes like super highly leveraged things that like you know get stuck in in in certain ways like there's no liquidation mechanism there's no way for things to to exit correctly um but on the more positive side um being able to actually see like c5 entities become front ends for d5 because they just don't think their their businesses are regulatory not viable and so it's just easier to be a d5 front end than to to actually be a centralized exchange i i think that that is the sign of like the transition into the new phase we have a word for this yes uh we have a phrase we call this the d5 mullet to rune which is like uh fintech in the front define the back you know yeah exactly it's really cool to see that with uh with the exchanges in crypto banks uh moving forward uh man it's been great to have you you are a wealth of knowledge sir thanks so much for joining us on bank list thank you for having me action items guys we
