[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs and our favorite recurring segment moment of zenika i am joined by the one and only zenica 33 we are going to talk about all things happening in nfts and crypto this week i hesitate there because it'll really mostly be about nfts and not everything happening in crypto there's too much happening for us to cover at all but we're of course going to dive into the bear market the uh by the time we finish recording this podcast ethel probably have dropped by another few hundred bucks so that's that's fun that's the game we're playing these days of like if i go to dinner will eath have crashed by the time it's over uh and we will talk about goblin town the doxing that has happened there uh drama with celsius other projects we're keeping our eyes on and uh and some general updates before we get to all that though we have to hear a word from our lovely sponsors living a bankless life requires taking control over

dive in zenika tell me how your week has been my week has been surprisingly good given the the catastrophic bear market and the the fear and doom and gloom out there i'm in amsterdam at the moment from met amsterdam nfc conference here it's it's fun it's wild it's amazing i met so many people both from the zen academy community and just the wider community and you know you wouldn't tell that there's a bear market like there's so much excitement and exuberance and people are happy and and just connecting and networking and like it's bustling um yeah i will say conferences are the best place to be when bear markets hit because for that exact reason it doesn't feel like it i was at consensus in texas and i was still there sunday night as like things were really starting to implode and like the price of eath had dropped to i don't know whatever dropped down like 1200 at that point and um and celsius was is was freezing withdrawals which we'll get into a little bit and uh and i was just surrounded by you know people getting drinks in austin from consensus and everyone was like yeah you know it happens happens it'll bounce back yeah we've been here before yeah do you do you feel for for me when we had the first big drop i i was a little bit more rattled and this now second wave i feel uh pretty unrattled did you have the same experience 100 i've been saying all like so many times this week that i feel better now than i did when eth was at 2300 when it dropped from like 3k 3500 down to 22 2300 uh i don't know i just felt for whatever reason more panicked and more dream and gloom and now whether it's just numbness or getting used to it or i'm just comfortable enough whatever it's just yeah i i feel fine are you sensing that from the zen academy community as well for example um it's a really good question so i think yes i think it there was definitely more like panic and doom and gloom and and fear um i guess when prices tanked that first time i think it was uh coincided with the the war in ukraine so there's a lot of mixed emotions there but now for those who are so i'll say this for those who are still around i think people are pretty happy and and supportive but there's clearly been a decline and a drop-off in engagement not just in zen academy but like every discord on twitter everywhere people are just sort of leaving the space and going hey you know uh i tried nfts i tried web3 i tried crypto it wasn't for me fun experiment i lost a bunch of money i'm gonna go back to real life and that's that was me in 2017 2018 as well uh but i think of the people who are staying around and like anyone listening to this if you still if you're still listening to an nfd podcast in june 2022 you're you're like already fairly serious and you haven't left so i think that that is is gonna give you such an uh like a leg up and just be in a great position like two years from now so yeah yeah that's that's good to hear i think i was starting to feel like my the twitter algorithm had just identified that i mostly resonated with people who were like gonna keep building and so all it was feeding me was people yeah like gonna keep building and so it's like in my universe everyone just feels like they're like cool and like yeah whatever and i i felt like i feel like i may be a little bit out of touch but i think the self-selection bias is evident like that that first wave of the crash probably this maybe sounds overly dismissive but like flushed out a lot of the people who who maybe weren't going to stick around and so the second wave of the crash anyone who stayed around past that first wave is like well i'm sticking around here too yeah and frankly i feel i feel stabler than i've actually felt in this industry for a long time and i think i didn't realize but for a while there i felt that things were overpriced like it felt like things were way too fast the name of the podcast yeah yeah i was only being like a little bit tongue-in-cheek when i named it this like you know and and it felt too frothy so when i was buying into things it did feel a little bit like i you know is it it's really going to 20x from here like not immediately and so i now finally feel like i feel kind of excited where i'm like i'm finally getting in at prices that feel a little bit more like okay i'm really gonna make money on this now and i uh i really wasn't feeling that for a while so um there's a little bit of relief for me as well as excitement but i i felt conflicted about how to communicate out about it because i've worried maybe being like too jubilant like that or like all pumped i've wanted to express that because i want people to feel reassured like hey i'm still buying eth i'm dca and like nothing's changed really for me um and if anything i feel more excited but i haven't wanted to say any of that and then been like have that come across as like dismissive or like insensitive to people who have lost a lot and are hurting and maybe overplayed their hand a little bit and um so i haven't known how to balance that but it it feels like most the community is a tough line to walk yeah yeah i think i think it's good for people to hear that people are still optimistic about ethan people are still buying nfts and looking at it as a good buying opportunity because i know so many people that are just sort of either starting to deploy or getting ready to like you know buy a lot of stuff because prices are down so much and they still believe like in certain projects long term and i think sort of to what you said before it's like it's not just people being flushed out it's also projects being flushed out the low effort projects the ones that didn't have substance and yes it sucks and it's sad for holders of those projects but um on the flip side it's good for the the true builders the the projects that have you know they raised money and then they they you know sold eth to stables and then they've kept that in a treasury and have planned out for two years of runway or they've you know whatever they've had good business planning um so they they can survive a bear market and there are projects like that out there so it's great to see them sort of shining a little bit more yeah so the question i always have to ask are you buying anything right now got your eye on anything right now so honestly the one thing i have my eye on it's been going up in price which is insane but i've been really wanting to buy another the currency by damian hurst because that burn date is coming up i got one from mint like a year ago and i was always thinking yeah you know what i'm i'm gonna buy another one but i'll wait for it till it dips a certain point and i missed like i don't know a month or two ago when it was really low and then so it went to like 3 8 i think or maybe even a little lower now it's at like six and it's just been going up no actually it's like seven and a half actually just keeps going up because we're getting closer to the burn date and yeah that explains what i want the burn there is that you can you can choose to get a physical by damien hurst if you burn the rft and or keep the nft and and forego the physical so you're making people choose yeah i think he's actually already created 10 000 physicals so it will either be you the nft gets burned since the burn address or they will literally burn a physical or maybe for some oh that's eco-friendly dramatic but yeah it'll be like all right you know and you know for people like me who only have one it's like well i want to keep the nft but i would love a physical damien hurst so it's just like it's a real selfie's choice well yeah it's it's yeah needing wanting to get another one so it's yeah that's the one thing i've been looking at other than that um art blocks it always comes back to block some generative art for me you know it's so funny because you've been saying that on this pod for a while now and i think the very first episode i did with you like a for the formal interview episode we did right we like you like broke down art blocks on the podcast um and you know when i really joined the space it just felt like a lot of art block stuff was was already pretty expensive for me and so i hadn't really been able to fully dive in but i interviewed this past week at consensus tyler hobbs and eric snowfro were both on a panel and it was just killer panels thank you x seneca uh all seeing seneca um but of course we got into generative art and in prepping for that panel i was doing even more research on both eric and tyler and our blocks and like i get it now like i'm i'm on the train i like i really i want to be buying art blocks are i totally feel like that that that's a high conviction bet that that will have value in the long term here you know that it's just it's to the extent that art collecting has remained a thing for the last however x many centuries since humans existed essentially 50 000 years ago there were paintings on walls yes yes and this is this this renaissance period of generative art and art blocks is at the very center of it you know the it it launched it and so it um you got it i'm this market crash art blocks has like stayed pretty stable and prices have even been going up um but but it's because it's already crashed 95 percent over the last six months so that it basically they run out of sellers like there's just yeah yeah one of the things i'm gonna chill art blocks one more time because it's it's not a show because i really really believe in it but it's one of those projects that the more you spend time in the space and you talk to like ogs in the space or people who've been around for a while or that everyone likes art blocks it's like yeah it's the project all the generative art rather in general it's the sort of the thing that almost everyone can i i i really haven't heard a good bear case for generative art i've heard like art blocks is releasing too many projects too much supplies could be better but if we take our blocks out of it just like a generative art as like a medium as a new art it's not new it's been around since the 60s but like this this renaissance or this revolution of generative art this new new wave ushering in merged with blockchain technology it's like i haven't yet heard of any sort of counter argument to why it's not going to be even more massive than it is now like yeah absolutely and if anything i think it's it's suppressed from a mainstream macro perspective because i think i think there is a resistance people have the idea of art that has a computer in the mix like somehow they see that as like less human art and i think that that will absolutely change and people will really realize that all this is a tool like a paintbrush or like paint or you know whatever watercolor and colored pencils like all of these things are just mediums for creating art and and the computer is the same thing so these folks who are creating algorithms to to output something in it and oftentimes there's a you know the kind of mix it's a very strong mix of mana machine like that's certainly as much art as photography or anything else um and and i for me i started to appreciate the craft behind like fidenza's like i was it was diving more to fidenza's having interviewed tyler hobbs and and so really understanding that one of the things that's so incredible about that project is given that art blocks you're stuck with what you get right there's no like i'm gonna out i'm gonna use a computer to output a ton of different options and then pick my favorites like with art blocks once you mint one whatever the algorithm produces like that's what you get so you know there's a little bit of roll of the dice there so understanding then that fidenzas has such variety in in its output while keeping the quality of each piece really high that's a really incredible feat difficult to do yeah and and so when i start to understand the craft behind it that's when you get to like oh wow yeah like this is art and this is for sure going to have really long standing value so yeah i'm glad i did not was not on our agenda today yeah to do an art block it's always on my agenda i will always upload stories on my agenda this is seneca's like yeah hidden he's just trying to red pill the world on our blocks at all times seriously um but but i will say i had that quick moment so i uh i'll probably i mean to your point it it hasn't like wildly dipped in this bear market it seems like you know we are not the only ones who have had this thought but um but you know it's also i'll say fx hash as well is a really great place to collect generative art on the table which we've talked about i can't get on tezos new york state of course new york has restrictions about tezos so i could use like a vpn but if the fbi is listening i won't do that um okay let's continuing in the bear markets you're always looking at art blocks did you see this stat i've seen it a couple places now that you have about ten percent or up to ten percent of wrapped ether offers on openc are getting accepted i did not see that that sounds crazy high but also believable yeah yeah so to contact people i mean maybe this is self-explanatory right but obviously it's a bear market so it's a it's a buyer's market right now so this is to say you know usually in in normal or call it bold times you get an offer in wrapped ether i know my first reaction to that is always like okay that means if i want to sell this i could get even more by just listing it 20 30 a little bit below four but then 20 more than my highest wrapped eath offer so like i'm gonna go do that but liquidity obviously having dried up quite a bit in this bear market folks are like if i have an offer on something like i just want to take the money you know bird in the hand is better than two in the bush or whatever like i just want to take the money uh that's being offered to me so if you're in a fortunate enough position to have some liquidity obviously you know we're talking about there's there's good buys out there simply because prices have dropped but also you could start putting you can start putting some offers on things maybe lower even below floor and um the odds of it getting accepted have just gone way up so um some strategy there for folks who are yeah honestly it's probably like it's i always say it's one of the best strategies at all times if you're trying to like if you have a limited budget or bankroll wrap your eat and then just like make bids below floor eventually someone's going to accept and and you'll buy a piece below floor so now even more than ever have you uh do you have any success stories with that personally are you no i'm i'm always too bad at that i'm i'm i'm i guess time poor and i just end up buying floor pieces way too often but my friend jamie i'm time poor but but eath rich so uh well yeah which is now you know i wish i was time poor and usdc rich but um you know my friend jamie he's always making you know bids and and succeeding you know tremendously at it so it's a great strategy he's a true he's a true degen now they have bots that can help you do that as well so there's tools out there that can make bots on like an entire collection or i think looks rare has a collection bid and i've i heard open c just introduced collection bids or they're introducing them so i think that's a great way to support protocol yeah they might be doing some of that might be in that um okay very interesting well let's talk just also some things that i think really impacted the the sharp decline the the celsius celsius withdrawal pauses you know it's a it's a cyclical thing or it's it's circular right you know which is eth was dropping celsius wasn't gonna be able to make margin calls it appears so then they pause trading so then each crashes further you know like i feel like it these things kind of end up just a cascading effect where where were you would tell me that you're where were you when celsius paused withdrawals and what was your reaction that's a really good question i think i would have been i don't know my life is so crazy i think i was here in amsterdam but i remember um i think actually maybe i was back home i was the night before they paused them there was all this like clearly not fud but like this noise going around on twitter about how like the staked to e thing was there was deep egging there or like quote unquote depending um and you know it doesn't look good for celsius because they have a lot of this steak to eat and that's tying up their liquidity for the long term and people are sort of having issues with drawing and stuff like that and then i've read this fantastic article by kobe his sub stack on on the whole issue and i was like oh okay i get it it makes sense and then the next day i heard that they were withdrawing i was like oh that's not good um walk me through the kobe i saw kobe tweeting some things but i i didn't end up reading the article what was the the thrust of it yeah the gist of it was just like so why um staked eath trades lower than the price of each so for those who don't know staked eath is basically um in an st yeah st this teeth is in anticipation of the the ethiopian emerge coming up you can sort of stake your eth and i i think it's basically acting as like a validator sort of proof of stake concept which we're going to move to rather than proof of work um to sort of help the the transition period again i'm not an expert of it but you basically lock it up so you look it up in a protocol lido i think is the biggest one it has 10 like tens of thousands hundreds of thousands maybe millions of eth in this protocol and in return for locking it up you get some small return on investment i don't know if it's like six percent eight percent on on whatever you eat which is it's not bad but um and you so you you deposit your eat and you get a steak to eat st back and in uh well i think it's like a year after the merge is complete and official something like maybe it's like six to eighteen months is the window you'll be able to exchange your staked eath back for one eighth one to one and in addition you get some yield so then people are like well shouldn't stake to eat always be worth one eighth why is it why is it trading at lower and people like buying and selling and i mean there's a few reasons one is obviously the liquidity lock-up period so if you need liquidity now you might be willing to pay a premium over you know waiting and keeping it locked up for 18 months or even longer um but then there's other things like smart contract risk if something goes wrong with lido which it seems very unlikely that it would but you know we've seen crazy things in in defy and all sorts of stuff um so there's always some risk there and there's a couple of other factors and effectively the price of staked eth kept dropping and then some of these protocols like celsius which had large amounts they in order to sort of like cover withdrawals and pay their debts and all that kind of stuff um they were starting to sell their staked eath at you know lower and lower prices instead of you know one to one one safety to one eighth they maybe said all right we'll take a 90 you know we'll take that and then we'll get 85 80 and eventually it drops to a point where people are like all right i'm willing to buy you know steak to eat and lock up the liquidity for two years until i can get the eat back but that's that's like the my understanding of it i'm not an expert but kobe sort of just yeah maybe we'll if you can link to the article in the show notes it's really good and he does a much better job than me of explaining how and why it worked and yeah it sort of led to this whole celsius collapse i think i'd seen something that celsius was only collateralized like 95 right like they could only cover like 95 of things they had borrowed against and you know when you look at these these loan opportunities like i look at like being collateralized like 250 percent 300 percent so that you're you're in super good shape to like cover the loan if the price of eath does start dropping and it it seems like celsius was incredibly poorly collateralized and was not in clearly they weren't right clearly they were not in shape to handle something like this and it's just so incredibly irresponsible um and and it really frustrates me because this stuff is avoidable this is not like inevitability this is not just like oh well that happened like no like be fiscally responsible and this and you don't lose people's money and um i actually have a little bit of money in celsius at the very beginning of last year or probably january february when i was starting to to get into d5 i was looking at some of these like apys or you know these like these yields that you can get and i was like oh this is this is so interesting like this is the this is part of what's exciting about all this stuff and i read through a whole bunch of different wallets celsius block fi next to like all of them and really you know i was alone just trying to figure out what what made sense in new york has really strict laws so you know you can't use binance in the states generally you've got finance us which is totally different so i don't know why but i ended up going with celsius i put like 30 bucks in it it's been so trivial but it was literally two tested out like this feels like too good to be true that you can get these returns i think at the time the the eth staking return was even even higher too um it may have been a little bit and so um or usdc maybe i even staked some usdc because that was like the highest one was you could get like 12 percent apy if you're staking usdc um anyway just relieved you know for for a year i was very consistently getting my rewards from celsius and i'd sort of like all right this is feeling like stable but but just never felt confident enough that i like really fully understood these models to like put more in and obviously very grateful that i didn't at this point um you also referenced that there was some uh there were rumors about this going around i think it was on sunday monday was when they they paused the withdrawals pause the transfers but there was this really interesting thread with is it alex mashinsky yeah who is the founder of celsius and a gentleman named so mike dow my dot mike mike dudas mike doudous mike dudes yeah yeah he um he tweeted i'm saddened by how many people are cheering on the demise of celsius network this is the day before they paused um right they paused withdrawals and he's like i along with many others counsel people not to put their funds with that risky business however many did and the large number of retail folks look like they are soon to be wrecked uh we all lose and then he said i hope retail can get out i've been hearing about accounts locked that would be similar to luna we shall see and alex mashinsky the ceo of and founder of celsius replies you didn't see this seneca i'm seeing your face looks like you didn't i don't think i saw this but he replies and he says to mike and he's like mike do you know even one person who has had a problem withdrawing from celsius all right and misinformation if you are paid for this then let everyone know you're picking sides otherwise our job is to fight tradfy together and then of course literally the next day he freezes it so what it looks like is the ceo basically because he must have known at that point that they were getting close to needing to do it to freeze withdrawals so he it sounds like he's doing that basically to prevent people from panicking and withdrawing so there's you know enough money in the system kind of locked up before he then freezes it withdraws i mean it's such a bad look and somebody else is tweeting like you know basically ceos who like come after people who like say mean things about them on twitter is like should be the biggest like red sign top signal you know such a red flag so anyway yeah it's giving it's giving d5 a bad name which is a shame because it's not defy it's c5 centralized finance it's like a hybrid cd fight i guess is maybe the the best way to say it but um yeah it's it's unfortunate and it's just one in a string of like what a dozen things now that have like really just been more nails in the coffin of this this is this ethereum thing this whole this whole bull market which is clearly well and truly over now now it's about when are we gonna bottom and then how are things turning around from here yeah absolutely uh and it'll bring regulators upon us faster which look i think there's a need for regulation you just want it to be smart and you know lobby three's doing some things not over-regulated yeah yeah yeah i just you know people don't i don't think congress understands the difference between an algorithmic stablecoin and like ustc backstage most of the people in the nft and or the web3 space don't know the difference yes yes so it's tough if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up

to join pfp communities and dm with some brand new internet friends okay and then of course before we we move on to some specific specific projects um i gotta ask prediction where's the bottom here oh well yeah i mean i i sort of in my group chat predicted the bottom at i don't know like 1800 or something so that was clearly clearly wrong i wasn't very like super serious about it but yeah um who knows right like no one absolutely no one knows anyone that says three figure three figure eighth i think we do see three figure eight i think we do i think we're so close to it at this point that it's it's not going to take much just one more like this whole three arrows thing if that like it implodes even more than like i haven't been following it closely or like one more protocol goes under or something like that we'll get to three figures and then i'd say i'm gonna be extraordinarily shocked if we drop below 500 but i wouldn't be shocked if we get to like five six hundred but i'm gonna i guess to throw a prediction out there i say we bought him at eight thirty oh specific i appreciate that i'll give folks a sense and i retweeted this i believe ryan shawn adams had tweeted this out but you know in the last big bear market eath dropped 95 percent the expectation here is that they won't drop that far we've talked about this before on this show but typically as as industries mature the the percentage drops become less and less each time so eth dropped 95 last time you know hopefully it bottoms out at 80 or 85 this time around i was hoping it was going to be 70 we've already blown past that i believe but if it were to fall 95 again it would fall to 235 dollars would be 95 drop from its all-time high like holy so crazy also say to be reassuring not that i want to be reassured the idea of it falling to 235 but like if it were to that's not unprecedented right like right like it's it's bounced back from that kind of a a fall before um yeah so i don't think it'll it'll go there i think you know we're probably looking at maybe 85 percent and i i'd have to do fast math my head to know what that yeah that number is um but i i agree we'll hit six figures i was listening to an old clip where i was like it feels like it's gonna get worse like i was saying i think it's going to get worse and then and it's like this lovely clip i'm like i should clip this and show how precious and then at the very end i'm like but not eat yeah everything's going to get worse but i feel like you know bouncing along the bottom at fifteen hours i think we were all bullish on eth like this year coming into the murder just like a lot of people i spoke to like i'm i'm going to sell nfts i'm going to stack each i think ethan is going to do well yeah i was like oh i was like nfts i think we've got more pain to come equities more pain to come like all of this but i was like you know all right 1500 1300. well i was like well not clipping that that doesn't make me look good um anyway truthfully i'm not shocked i think i mentioned to you michael bury had said something about you know equities could fall another 65 and still within be within um like historical norms so i've really i really haven't been the idea that we would have like more pain on on that side was not uh all together shocking to me um yeah again i thought eath was gonna stay stronger than it has but not worried bullish long-term continuing to stack my eat um okay some specific projects goblin town of course goblin town is is the project you have to talk about every week doxxed very cool the team behind illuminati nft and which is like the truth it's like the umbrella org for that um alex one of the co-founders also co-founded a company called upstream um that does some cool things and and i have a a good friend who works there so really excited for them what was your reaction to the doxing news so crazy so i was here in amsterdam and emily who's part of the zen academy team works for mocking her fiance is like part of the goblin team and she knows the illuminati people so it was we were at like a group dead and she was telling us our minds were just being blown and there was a lot of like you didn't tell us why couldn't you tell us um all that kind of stuff um she was one of the first the people who like mentioned goblins to me like you know whenever they first minted but it was just like one out of five people where like i saw it in zen academy sort of proof she messaged me and so like what do you think of three minutes and it was like that was it i was like seems cool website's cool let me get some yeah what a what a reveal um yeah i'm not surprised that it's not yuga what are all like 18 or something um yeah yeah it's obviously it's been a very fortunate project for me um people always say like how did you know how did you know i was like i did not know i have if you look at my wallet i've got like a hundred of all these other projects that went to zero but eventually you know these these project mean projects you just need one sort of payoff to take off and then it sort of covers all the rest um you were saying you're not surprised it's not yuga i'm not surprised it's not hugo i mean i think yeah it would have shocked me so much to hear it was you great i it doesn't seem like them it doesn't seem like the emo or playbook um what about you what did you think about the reveal yeah well my my first reaction was i was supposed to go to a dinner with that team uh at south by southwest and if if the audience will indulge me just for a minute while i say i was in austin i was like i i quickly run out to buy a shirt like to buy like it because i didn't have like a nice professional outfit or whatever and my phone just literally my service drop like my phone would still work but like there was no service and there was no internet so i couldn't get online which makes no sense because in the middle of austin to the point that i like borrowed somebody's phone and called my now fiance and he just called me an uber to a dinner he was at i was supposed to go into dinner with like what was now the goblin towns team i think it was like illuminati it was an upstream it was one of the companies connected to like alex and truth and then and um so i had rsvp to go to it and then ended up at this other dinner because my phone had kaputs and then when my phone came back online i was like i'm already gonna be late to this dinner i'm at this other one like i'm just not gonna make it and i don't i feel terrible and i you know i i texted emailed them after i was like i'm so sorry like you know i had this other kind of commitment that i was supposed to maybe be at my phone and i'm like damn it i've burned a bridge with the goblin town team um i hopefully it wasn't i don't think it's a real bridge and i don't think i'm excited for them i think you know alex has been building and i know there's others but he's just the one that i know best has been building in a variety of ways for years now and it's it's cool to see a payoff like this and you know definitely makes me bullish i think they're they're awesome people and so it's cool to see awesome people being behind something that that you like glad it's not zagabond yeah i know and it's people with with without baggage i mean who knows i i don't know their intimate history but again like really good sense of them and i i have as i mentioned a friend who's worked for upstream and has worked for alex for probably almost a year now and has always spoken really highly of him and so he strikes me as a like a high integrity person which it's just great because with these these undocks teams we've had right such a mixed bag in the reveals absolutely so let me ask you this so you know the price is down about three eighth i think peak it had hit more like seven eight it got up um did it pump at all after the the reveal of the team or it's just sort of stagnant it dropped actually it was like five ish maybe a bit over five before and then it sort of dropped down around three where it's mostly stayed but the price of illuminati has gone up because i think that they mentioned that so when they launched they kept a thousand back and they were like we're gonna raffle it off to our community or i doubt i don't really know how it works there's two illuminati tokens there's like the big collection and there's i think something called the 178 or 187 and that has like a 12 i i i don't really understand that whole ecosystem but um that pumped but then goblins dropped so i i think it makes some sense that um when you eliminate like the the the speculation element and people aren't now buying goblins because they think it's yuga or they think it's people or they think it's this that the other um that takes away some of the price generally the the speculation was baked in uh and then it comes down to like what people think of the actual team and i think probably a lot of people don't know like me as well as like i i kind of know them i i know a little bit about them but i think i even have some of the basic illuminati things but um i don't understand it so i i don't know the people behind it very well so it's not like yeah i think a lot of people are like having to do research and being like alright so what kind of team is this what what are they going to do what are they saying i think they came out and said that there is no road map so they still don't have a road map which i like i don't like i don't like road maps but um it does make it an interesting idea then it's like well where's the value gonna come from is it this is fully a meme project to fool your community thing um yeah yeah absolutely well you know i've said this a number of times this podcast which is this space uh rewards like vagueness and punishes specificity because vagueness leaves room for the imagination to say it could be this or it could be that and and that's true i usually mean that in the sense of like hey i'm specifically a project that's building an animation studio that's going to you know reward hold like whatever that's specific and those prices those projects don't get priced as high as a project that's like i mean azuki for example like kind of vague what could it be you know like it and um and in this case i think we're seeing it again like the vagueness of who's the team like allows the price to pump and then the specificity of like here's a team you know here's the team it's like okay we're you know we can't just like speculate and let our imaginations go crazy so that totally tracks two patterns that we've seen yes they've said still no road map my favorite part you love the no road map thing i love the no discord thing i'm like oh yeah discord they're saying they're still not gonna have a discord um but they have said they're coming out with merch at nfc nyc and i believe they're partnering with fuochias for a party at nftnyc yeah i saw something like that yeah and i think they have a food so you know a food truck yeah it's a very cool goblin burger drop yeah yeah yeah it's it's a cool brand so it'll be very interesting to see where they take it again without a road map but just building and having fun and playing and they've got the cco component which i know you love so uh we'll see where it lands okay the maybe last thing i want to talk about or maybe we'll tack on a couple things at the end here um nickelodeon has announced their launching nfts this summer and i want to get on my soapbox here my john rogers sized soapbox um they are launching with uh recur which we've seen you know a number of these sort of franchise ip stuff do star trek i think um top gun and it feels like these projects i'm i'm a little bit bearish like the this they're not they don't seem to be nailing it these just like franchise entrance coming into the space and um you know i i talk about this all the time with john who's for people who haven't heard him on the show before i've had him on a couple times he's he was the head of franchise at disney for a decade and i want to give a little context here again i apologize it's going to be a bit of a soapbox but i think it's educational um so i believe i've said this in the podcast before but i think it was in like one episode so you may have missed it which is disney was like the number four studio if you look at w you know warner brothers and all these different studios that are out there disney was like in the top but wasn't like the top for decades and then basically like the the early to mid 2000s really catapulted to being number one i may not have these numbers precise but the general arc of the story is correct here and and really that happened under bob iger because he made this transition to franchise ip that's when they bought pixar they bought star wars he really doubled down and totally reformulated the disney business to be built around these franchise stories and um and that paid off huge for them and and john was brought on as the first head of franchise that wasn't a role within these big studios before and his job was to think strategically and from a business perspective about okay for these franchises how do we make them last so like pirates at caribbean as an example forget the johnny depp stuff that sort of complicated that franchise in years since right it was like we're going to say no to some business deals when pirates of the caribbean is at its absolute peak we're not going to burn it out and take every deal we can this is john's role to decide he's like we're going to we want to think about this in a long term because in a decade we may want to revise this franchise and do something new with it again and we can keep bringing these franchises back in authentic ways but if we've burned them because we just monetized them to the absolute max in the short term here that's not going to work so that's why i love talking to john about this space because he just brings such an interesting perspective to things and um and he so so he's a big proponent of some of these big studios and they may never get there but like the smart strategy is to like with franchise like to reformulate the business around this like multi-medium style content where you're going to have people who are like they're going to have an nft in their wallet and then something's going to happen in the tv show and that's going to affect what's happening with the nft and their wallet and this this way where we're going to we're going to enter a new world like that and that these studios have just not freaking figured it out yet and nickelodeon's owned by paramount and they've done a couple of these drops where they clearly are not seeing nfts as that kind of an opportunity and they're they are seeing it fundamentally as like let's get quick cash on something and issue these nfts where the art is frankly maybe kind of mediocre you know the the effort in it doesn't feel high it doesn't feel like it's tied to a really bigger picture strategy um and he really is like i don't i don't think they're ever going to get it and the final piece on this long rant that people are hopefully enjoying because i again john is just so smart is he's like it feels to me like they're doing what they did with 3d movies and he's like avatar came out and it was the biggest thing right james cameron huge movie and he was like avatar was shot in 3d so it shot to be made for 3d and people loved it and then what happened was people want the the studios wanted the quick cash grabs and so they started shooting movies for 2d because it was cheaper and easier but then in post like making them 3d because they could charge the audience more and it very quickly killed 3d because audiences are smart and they and it wasn't a very good experience because it wasn't actually shot for 3d and it like kind of killed 3d off and now you don't see 3d films at all because you just started to have this kind of negative impression of it because it didn't feel that special and you're being charged more um and and they weren't really and he's like i feel like they're gonna do the same thing with nfts which they're gonna burn people out on these licensing deals they're doing they're not publishing themselves they're not really like investing in themselves they're licensing out these other platforms and people are going to be able to smell that and it's just going to feel kind of cheap and money grabby and they're going to burn people out okay again i've stolen most of that from john rogers but i think it i i think i i really agree um and i just wish more people were thinking about it and and um like paying attention because i do think there's such an opportunity and we're missing and like john's like don't do your looney tunes nfts yet like that's an incredible property and franchise like wait learn and in three years when the mainstream market is more ready and your fan base is more ready and people understand there's more there's more wallets out there then do it and do it really interestingly yeah no i agree completely um and another thing that john mentioned to me once is that you you only get to launch nfts once as one of these you will only ever get one opportunity as your first launch of nfts and it makes so much sense to do it right and wait and yeah i think to your point to his point most of these big studios they're not doing that at the moment and it sucks because like you said it's going to burn people out and give nfts a bad rep and i think that's why it's probably going to delay mainstream adoption it's going to be a while maybe i'm pretty sure that we have to change the name away from nfts to something else digital collectibles digital assets yeah totally totally yeah we'll have to change that name exactly to get the stink off of it um yeah well along these lines i will say feature uh feature.io launch their marketplace uh i don't think it's like the fully end version of it but feature for those who don't know they have this like licensing marketplace that coinbase used for when they cast the board apes in their trilogy features marketplace was the one they used to like cast apes and then you know seamlessly pay out the the ape holders and um i've had them on the show i'm really bullish on that i met with stephen who's one of the co-founders at consensus in texas this past week and i i have to say i think they're like really ahead of the curve they have some really interesting things that are coming out and uh they're an example of people who i think are really thinking about it correctly when it comes to like ip and storytelling and um and and they're also building tooling for that so their their marketplace that they coinbase used is now live i think i think on i think they're only supporting a few projects right now and eventually they'll support more but world of women is one of the projects they're supporting so on the positive note when it comes to ip and yeah nfts nice last thing seth green got his ape back we've been tracking that story a little bit he paid like 300 000 from the the person who bought it from the thief in order to get his date back so he'll be able to move forward with his movie and uh bill gates let's just end end with bill gates coming out and saying that nfts are fully built on the greater full scheme grateful theory yeah it's it's just a real shame to hear from him because i think you know say what you want about him i think he's he's smart he's you know he's got a lot of he's brilliant yeah exactly he's exactly for him to say that i i don't know i mean there's certainly elements of truth to it 100 there's so much that happens within the nft and the crypto space that really is just you know people trying to find other people to be the exit liquidity and and the great it's exactly as he says but he's really throwing the baby out with the bathwater bath water if he says it's all that and and i just hope it's i'm yeah i really think it's like ignorance and he hasn't looked into the the complexities and depth of it because i really believe that if he did and if he understood the tech he's very you know he's a tech-minded person and um took that time then i i can't imagine him not believing in the the tech again um but you know he's right like for ninety percent of the space it really is based on that greater fool's theory and it's just like people like all right well i'm gonna buy this and now i'm gonna pump it and then i'm gonna find someone else to pay more and then i'll sell and then they'll flip it there's a lot of truth to that but just a shame yeah this is what surprised me so much about it was it was such a surface level take like he's 100 right if you're somebody who hasn't looked into this space at all that's exactly what this is right because all of the like there's so much surface level stuff that is exactly that so that's very ponzi and just greater fool and whatever what surprised me so much about this was like you know i love warren buffett i've talked about that on the show warren and um bill are like very good friends warren and charlie munger you know are are very vocally against like bitcoin and crypto and nfts and think it's all stupid and i i'm not surprised when it comes to them because they also didn't get into tech right like they weren't into internet stocks like they just like we just don't understand this this value prop and we don't know how to like so we're not going to invest in it and whatever so i'm like okay warren's like not into crypto not surprising he hasn't looked into it he's not he's a consumer goods investor he's not a tech investor bill gates is a tech guy like he he i'm sure he understands blockchain and um so i was just really surprised to see this a piece of me almost wonders if he's really just trying to protect consumers and is really just worried that fundamentally most like retailers are not going to be able like aren't going to have the time or bandwidth or whatever to like really dig deep and so he's sort of saying this to get retailers from just kind of buying in wantonly and using a bunch of money because the reality is a lot of that has happened there are a lot of people whether it was gamestop trading or nfts and crypto who have like who've been wrecked and um so i i almost felt like that was his motivation because it's it's really hard for me to imagine that he doesn't understand the underlying tech here or that there's something interesting going on with the underlying tech it definitely seems off-brand to me for sure um yeah maybe he's doing that maybe it's an end ends justify the means situation who knows all right well on that note zenika thank you so much as always for joining us we'll be back in a couple weeks still k money building uh here
