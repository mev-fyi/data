you have a house you take a mortgage you take out debts and it's good that this debt is denominated in US dollars for example one of the reasons is that it's inflationary and so over time it becomes easier and easier to pay the debt you know the reason why the house is kind of a good collateral is because house prices are up only so that's the reason why banks are just so comfortable at giving you a mortgage because houses are optimized as collateral and then US dollars are optimized as debts and it's the same thing with IFA you have ifas are optimized as a collateral asset again to which you're going to take debt which is going to be a stable coin like die or Rye or LUSD you actually want your debt your collect your asset to be deflationary you want it to grow in value over time because it means that you're less likely to get liquidated and therefore lead to these like large systemic risk where potentially like you have mass defaults and things collapse that's the only two types of money there's collateral money and debt money is that is that a fair take yeah that's one way to classify the two sides of the coin right yeah
