can you explain the importance of providing this kind of liquidity and how you think this feeds into just the broader ecosystem and the future of the digital ecosystem yeah i think that today there's like 10 to 15 billion of lendable nfts at the end of the day it's a token standard and what can that token standard capture and value well a lot of things online could be digital ip it could be music it could be ticketing it could be digital land financial nfts like uniswap so when you think of this online economy and the ownable internet it's going to be massive so when you think of nfts as a technology that's capturing all of this digital native ip a good portion of those assets will go towards loans i think we do start to see these lower value assets where people use loans as a way to get money out of the system and into real life but right now these high value and fts are digital like luxury goods and being able to leverage that asset for liquidity is important just because there's a lot of money tied up in these things so it just makes sense to be able to enable a lot of that liquidity to happen
