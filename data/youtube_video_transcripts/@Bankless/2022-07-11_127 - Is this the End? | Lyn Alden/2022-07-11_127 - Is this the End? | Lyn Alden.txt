a group of elders gets in a room every six weeks and determines what the price of money will be and it doesn't matter where you are in the country i mean this is a country of 330 million people 50 states very different markets and they kind of set the nationwide price and then also because we're the global reserve currency this has international ramifications and so i i just think that the model itself is kind of anti-antiquated uh and that as software each the world and as we kind of go through a somewhat inflationary crisis i think the the shortcomings of that model are kind of being laid bare welcome to bank lists where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless once again guys the bankless journey has veered into macro territory because we got some big questions these are tumultuous times in macro markets and we brought on lynn alden who's the perfect person to tell us more about this and our basic question for lynn david was are we going to be okay and her answer was kind of it depends not really it's complicated the big question is how are we going to get out of this and this is what we asked lynn a few things to look out for in this episode number one what's the checkmate for central banks what do they come to an end of their capabilities number two why crypto is the only honest market left lynn makes the case for that number three is this capital r recession going to turn into a capital d depression and number four a theme of this episode is what decade are we in is this the 1940s the 1970s or oh my god is it the 1930s i hope not number five we end with some tips on how to prepare just basic life advice what you should do to store your value with your career uh even in kind of your family world david this is just a great episode for us i think put a lot of missing pieces together for for me in all of the craziness that has been the last three months maybe the entirety of this year of 2022 in macro markets we've had wars we have inflation we have a fed doing all sorts of craziness now we have a recession what's that going to turn into we get into all of those subjects yeah the fog of war for macro markets and even crypto markets right now is really really thick everyone's confused multiple people from multiple different parts of of the world have stated that this is some of the hardest times the hardest market like sentiment to invest capital no one knows how to invest or where to invest people are just they feel frozen they feel like they have paralysis and that's because the macro markets are so confusing there are so many different things at play and so we go through a list of them just with lynn alden we talk about the choices that the fed has made and the choices that the fed has left to make and how there's not really very many tools in the tool belt for the federal reserve so those choices are kind of fixed and so when we fix that steering wheel where does that trajectory take us and then we go into the macro the external forces commodity prices energy prices food prices those things are kind of fixed too there's not really much influence or choice that we as humans have over these things and so when we blend all these trajectories together where do we go and so that's ultimately where we conclude with this podcast uh and then we finish off with like you said lynn's advice and her advice was grab your bear market buddy uh because you know you need to not go alone into into the bear market and so that's what i'll say now is as you go listen to this grab your bear market buddy because you might you might need to listen with a friend send this to a friend guys uh in all the chaos that's going on i think you'll get a rare um breath of signal from this episode because lynn is always uh clear of thought and help you shape the next decade and your outlook on it we're going to get right into the episode with lynn alden but before we do we want to talk about these awesome tools for going

in the chat so i'll see you there bangla station super excited to introduce lynn alden she's back again on bank list anytime lynn comes on the podcast you know there's something going on in macro and today is no exception uh lynn is the founder of lynn alden investment strategies he's a leaning expert in macro markets focuses on long-term debt cycles and how that's impacting everyday markets of course a ton to discuss on crypto on fiat on bonds on equities on whether jerome powell is going to steer us off a cliff or whether we're going to be okay and so lynn we want to find out what is going on my first question to you first of all welcome back to bankless it's great to have you uh and then could you answer the question is this the end like are we all gonna make it i think a lot of people are worried i'm worried myself what's going on here happy to be here thanks for having me um i i think we can divide it into a couple different time frames uh and so in the in the kind of the big macro scale i've been using the the framework of ray dalio the long-term debt cycle and so in that in that conception it's the end of something big right but of course the end is a long process and it can be a decade-long process so i think that basically you know with the long-term debt cycle every several decades when you reach a massive amount of debt when you go down to zero interest rates and you have kind of just massive amounts of debt in the system usually go through some sort of currency devaluation and system change right so it's not the end of the world but it's the end of an era basically uh and i think that's that's something we're seeing in a number of markets um but you know to get less do me than that if we focus more on the near term we're in a you know cyclical downturn uh and not all cyclical downturns become recessions uh but some subset of them do uh and so when we look back over the past you know let's say pre-covered we had like a 10-year long uh you know economic expansion in the united states we still had three cycles within that decade-long period of accelerating growth and then decelerating growth and it just that the decelerating growth never became negative growth it never became an outright recession even though you had a couple near misses there and so what we've been in over the past more than a year now is a decelerating growth environment and then combined with the fact that this one is so inflationary uh you know kind of leading up to that that this one is is becoming more severe and is kind of starting to look like a recession at least at least by many indicators so it does not look like a recession in terms of employment yet but by most other especially leading indicators it does look more recessionary and tying this into you know crypto uh you know to the extent that i'm here uh historically when you look at you know the the you know bitcoin and crypto bull markets a lot of people tie it to the bitcoin having which i think is relevant to some extent but also actually matches up very very closely with these economic accelerating and decelerating environments and so for example we can use the the perching manager's index it's kind of a a go-to macro indicator for economic acceleration or decelerate it looks like a sine wave over time and they average roughly three year cycles and it just so happens that all the bitcoin bull runs were during these rising pmi environments and all of the downward or choppy sideways periods were in declining pmi environments and of course that all of crypto kind of goes up and down together maybe with a little bit of a lag and a lot of what dictates the pmi environments is also liquidity conditions uh and so central banks and kind of dollar liquidity around the world generally you know one of the big questions was for example why is bitcoin not serving as an inflation hedge and of course that would extend to any sort of finite token why are these things going down when you ironically have high inflation of fiat currencies and there's actually really good charts out there that show you know bitcoin in particular i use that one because that's what most the macro people look at because that's the biggest most liquid one and you'll see that you know in rising global m2 so rising global money supply year of year bitcoin does very well in that environment and now we're actually at a period where money supply is growing more slowly than it was a year or two ago and you have multiple central banks mainly the fed kind of pushing back and strengthening the dollar compared to many other currencies and so when you translate all that back into usd denominated global m2 growth it actually kind of came to a standstill so ironically now that you know price inflation is happening with a lag from monetary inflation and some central banks are actually fighting back it makes more sense is why we're seeing kind of downward price action and number of assets including bitcoin and cryptocurrencies lynn you you focus on like these long-term debt cycles and you're really really good at placing us in history or at least like talking about what parts of history rhyme with our current phase so i kind of want to pick your brain as to like where we are in the arc of this long-term debt cycle and for just for added context we brought you on i think our first episode with you uh was episode 48 january 18th of 2021 and we titled it the death of the dollar dominance and this was basically a prelude of things to come where the dollar was really it's going to lose its place as like the king of you know global currencies and uh like we've seen events you know especially lately uh where you kind of see the writing on the wall and then we had you on in august for episode 76 titled inflation in 2021 this is when inflation really started to pick up which was one of the things that we kind of predicted with that dollar dominance we were going to see dollar inflation uh and now here we are in july of 2022 uh and there's that that like gif that famous internet gif of that truck and it's hurtling towards a wall and like you just know it's gonna crash but then it cuts and then it's gonna crash and then and then it cuts again and never actually crashes but it feels like that the question that ryan started with like are we at the end this feels like with just like extreme inflation extremely high interest rates this kind of feels like the last hurrah before we really start to see like the uh the actual uh just reduction of the dollar dominance would you would you agree with this arc and just overall where are we on this are this long arc of the global debt cycle yeah so global debt cycles are kind of correlated to that global reserve status but not necessarily the same thing uh and so in the last kind of long-term debt cycle we did see the transition from uk having global reserve currency in the united states one point i've been making for a while is that you know now there's really no country large enough to have the only global reserve currency that was kind of actually anomaly that the persistent history it's not something that necessarily has to repeat over and over again and then i think we're heading towards a more decentralized uh type of system and i think that was somewhat accelerated by the the you know the events you've seen in ukraine right so you have russia initiate a war and then and then the west responds by cutting off their foreign exchange reserves and then you kind of you know everyone kind of realizes around the world at the same time that wait a second you know the money-like aspects of these reserves are maybe not as money-like as people thought right if they can be censored if they can be confiscated uh you know whether or not you agree with the reason uh that now gives an incentive to a number of countries wait a minute i mean we're holding liabilities of countries that we're not necessarily fans of um you know what does that mean what should we hold instead and so i do think that we are now we are starting to see for example gradual shifting away from treasuries by russia was obviously early to do it china has been doing it since 2013. um you know japan has been a big buyer treasures but now they kind of have to protect their own currencies so they're they're not really buying treasures anymore either and you've seen for example some of the economic forums putin has called for kind of you know alternative payment systems uh you know cooperation with some of the other peers like between russia and china or russia and india for example india's actually stepped in even though india's more of a you know somewhat of an ally to the west and you know compared to china or russia they stepped in to buy massive amounts of russian crude and so i do think we're seeing a little bit more of a multi-polar world emerge rather than a you know a unipolar world you know just kind of a us-dominated global order i think is shifting into you know kind of a more multi-polar you know multiple centers of power and right now we actually the dollar index itself is very strong but that's in large part because it's heavily connected you know it's heavily based on the euro and the yen and europe's obviously having a very specific energy crisis more so than even the rest of the world uh and japan's doing yield curve control with a very tight cap and so basically it's one of those things where you know it's not that the dollar is weakening right now it's actually quite strong but the the global demand for it especially among foreign central banks is drifting towards that more decentralized model and if anything over the past decade we've seen a mild uptick in gold usage among central banks because you know i would see something like bitcoin or these others are nowhere near big enough or or stable enough that for most of them to be interested and so gold is kind of the you know the self-custodial inflation protected asset that they could turn to if they want to you know hold money for a long period of time and not have counterparty risk so we have central banks that are definitely following the reducing the dollar dominance playbook but we have the dxy the dixie which is like the dollar strength index having like i think 20-year highs or just really really strong right now and so i want to ask you about the the dollar milkshake theory which i'm pretty sure you're familiar with uh the idea that before there's a collapse in the dollar there's a significant strength in the dollar because so many debts are dollar denominated both inside the united states and outside the united states that even if we are on the precipice of like a total reduction in dollar dominance in the world first people have to buy dollars to pay back their debts and then the big like cat crash and reset happens do you uh ascribe to the dollar milkshake theory and uh do you see that as the evidence of what's going on in the macro markets as uh supporting that theory so i think that the theory has a lot of merits and i i've actually met and and discussed and debated with you know the person who proposed that theory brent johnson uh you know got my acquaintances with him and you know when people macro people debate that theory you know the ones that understand it it's not so much they disregard this theory the question is how does that theory end up and so basically for people that aren't familiar that the point goes that you know united states is global reserve currency uh that doesn't just mean that central banks hold it it also means that it's the it's the currency that most offshore debt is denominated in so if a if an entity makes a loan to developing country either the government or a large corporation there they often don't want to do it in their local currency they'd rather do it in a harder currency and that could be dollars euros yen things like that and dollar of course is the easy disproportionate one there and also it's not even mostly u.s entities that are necessarily making those loans entities in europe or japan or china will go out and make dollar-based loans to you know a country in africa or a country in south america and so as a result the world outside the united states has according to the bank for international settlements something like 13 trillion dollars in u.s denominated debt um now that's somewhat offset by the fact that the whole world outside of the u.s has something like 50 trillion in u.s denominated assets right so the u.s has run these gigantic structural trade deficits actually about you know 14 trillion dollars worth of trade deficits over the past you know call it 25 years or something like that and they take those dollars and then they buy u.s assets so they buy treasuries uh when those started become kind of worse investments they shifted to buying u.s stocks they buy u.s real estate uh and things like that they kind of pile it into financial assets uh and so when you basically when it comes down to the dollar milkshake theory the point is that if there's any sort of disruption in dollar cash flows the strength of the dollar goes up dramatically because all that debt represents demand for dollars and so they have to basically they have a short squeeze they have to buy dollars if they want to cover their own debts or try to service them now where that that theory i think becomes so much self-defeating is that if the dollar spikes too much like what we're seeing right now and what we saw back in actually in march 2020 during the you know kind of the worst of the covet crash um it starts to cause ironically us recession global recession global liquidity problems and then those foreign uh entities start selling u.s denominated assets in order to get dollars so you start to get problems in the u.s treasury market illiquidity problems because the foreign sector stops buying or outright starts selling them in order to get dollars and so you know first it hits other countries but then it ricochets back into us and i think that right now we're kind of in that phase where it's ricocheting back into us and that's an environment where almost nothing other than dollars does well including u.s assets u.s stocks you know multiple things start selling off and then of course bitcoin and cryptos being so volatile and a smaller market they generally you know there's some of the earliest things the fall they get crushed but even things like you know equities real estate gold just assets around the world sell off because basically this unit of account is strengthening so much and causing kind of for selling that's interesting uh yeah it's it's interesting how interrelated all of these things are lynn and you know um you talked about sort of subscribing to ray dalio's long-term debt cycles um overarching thesis and uh i've recently read his book you know principles for dealing with a changing world order where he kind of looks historically at other empires and kind of the rise and fall of their monetary systems as well and so you kind of wonder if this is uh sort of part of the the fall of the us as a monetary leader and i think you're indicating that well you know before that happens completely there might be an erosion right and there might be some um you know uh some pluralism in terms of the monetary instruments used but but i'm curious if you could kind of ground us with any historical analogs here so is this like is this like something that happened in the 1700s should we go back to other uh you know our history of other empires or even i've heard so many people talk about this as the 1940s maybe that's a good analog you know uh or others have talked about the inflation of the 1970s some people when you start using the the recession word people immediately think back to 2008 which was in most listeners uh i guess every listener's life lifetime who's probably listening to this um and it also feels like hey if things get really bad if the recession the r word turns into the d word are we entering a 1930s type time range so are there any historical analogs for this that come to mind for you or is this just the 2020s it's completely independent thing and uh brand new so it's a good question i mean i i think that that that quote that is either correctly or false attribute of mark twain it's really applicable and i've used it number times which is history repeats um his just repeat but it does rhyme and so analogs i think are actually really useful uh but of course there's no perfect analog and if you go back far enough technology is totally different and so basically the 2020s uh you know are their own thing but we still learn from periods of history you know but i think that the base is to understand different analogs so that one can then see how they're different from that if they don't study history at all they're completely blindsided they think it's all unprecedented whereas actually there were rather similar environments and so i think we can divide that into two two parts one is the you know you mentioned dalio's principles of you know the focusing on that global reserve and rising and falling empires and then that's different from maybe this current macro environment even i think they're related so in that book what one thing he does is actually he'll he'll take an empire and he and he kind of goes back in history so there's you know kind of the call the chinese one the united states one the uk uh you know the netherlands he goes back in time maybe 500 years or so and he tracks these these handful of empires and he grades them on multiple scales right so there's like they're you know their education uh their military power their economic size uh there was you know their global reserve currency status basically the acceptance of their currency by you know their their various trading partners in other countries around the world and there are some that are more leading and lagging than others so education for example is a rather leading one uh where that starts to rise before many of the others and then starts to fall before many of the others um whereas the other ones you know because of network effects and momentum that is you know takes a long time to turn around those are more lagging and so global reserve currency is actually one of the most lagging ones where all those other things come into place first and then their currency gets widely accepted and then even as some of these other ones start to clearly deteriorate the global reserve currency is kind of the last one to roll over because there's still so much network effect and usage for it that it's you know it's the incumbent it's very hard to displace until all the other pieces are there and so dalio often points to china as kind of the rising power compared to united states which is many ways compared to you know the united states with the rising power compared to the uk um i think that there is some accuracy to that but i mean i don't think that you know transits into me you know 20 years from now we're all using the yuan right i think that's that's not what that means i i think that ultimately we're going to is again a more bipolar type of world you know maybe a tripoli world whatever you want to call it but not this kind of unipolar world i mean after world war ii which is maybe the closest analog because that was the rise of the united states over the over the united kingdom you know most of the world was devastated the united states was kind of like almost untouched right and so we were rebuilding our allies we were helping rebuild some of our enemies i mean we you know we had kind of the last intact manufacturing base and that was kind of a you know becoming a hyper power status which is which is pretty rare in history and so i you know outside of something like that happening i think that the the error we're going into somewhat more decentralized somewhat you know different polls uh and just you have the relative diminishment of the united states i mean we have something like what four or five percent of the population uh at our maximum height we were like two-thirds of global currency reserves and that that's kind of inherently unstable system it's kind of it's hard to maintain that level of dominance and i think we're naturally drifting towards where is the population centered where are these different sources of power and so i do think that we're headed in that direction and then tying it into historical analogs in other areas like what is where what is this inflation similar to what is this economic environment similar to i have been using the 40s as the closest comparison and the reason i've been doing that is so when people think of inflation they often think of the 70s right so they just go that's the that's the one they think of but the environment was quite different and the causes of inflation were quite different the one similarity i think was the shortage of energy but outside of that you know most of the money supply growth in the 70s was you had a demographics boom you know the baby boomers were entering their home buying years you had a lot of bank lending happening and so you know when commercial banks make loans that increases the broad money supply and of course on top of that you had some fiscal problems but the deficits are actually much smaller and a lot of that broad money supply was happening because of the banks you also had pretty low debt as a percentage of gdp and so you know paul volkl for example the head of the fed at the time could raise rates to double digits to try to you know kind of purposely put the u.s in a recession stabilize the dollar for international creditors and go from there right so i think it's both the causes and solutions to inflation were quite different than what we're seeing today and actually i think a closer analog is the 40s which was you know you didn't have a lot of bank lending you didn't have a lot of demographic expansion uh but you had you know after the 30s actually let's go back to the 30. so you had this you know obviously 1929 crash and you had a decade-long depression and you had rising populism uh you know both between countries and within countries and that took different forms i mean obviously in in europe it you know you had the rise of nazism and that obviously contributed to global conflict you also had populism in the united states multiple other countries because of that tough economic environment and then eventually when you ran into the 40s and you started to get that conflict happening and he worked out a lot of leverage in the system you had you know huge fiscal expenditures right because a lot of it was to fight the war and to kind of rebuild things after that period of of you know stagnation and populism and so the inflation that we saw in the 40s was very fiscally driven it wasn't bank lending driven it's very fiscally driven so you had a sharp increase in the money supply and you had very high public debt to gdp which means that the central bank couldn't raise rates to double digits because you'd bankrupt the federal government and so they just held rates low anyway uh despite significant inflation and you had this you know this huge fiscal driven inflation and i think that you know what we've seen over the past you know call it 15 years has kind of been a replay of that where we had the 2008 crash in many ways that you know i have a whole bunch of charts out there that show it's very similar to 29 crash in terms of it being a private debt bubble that unfolded and then you know throughout the whole 2010s we had what in many ways was a mild depression i mean emerging markets basically they had you know almost no you know except for china and a couple others most of them had no dollar denominated gdp growth over a very long stretch of time i mean you look at their stock markets they've gone sideways and dollar terms for for 10 15 years um you know many of them have not had you know kind of substantially new highs in dollar terms uh even in the united states and elsewhere you had unusually slow gdp growth you had rising populism and tensions uh in the united states and europe and many other countries and so you know going into this we're very very leveraged and then we have you know the pandemic we have you know this very levered system hit by an external catalyst and so we have something that looks like wartime finance and response you know trillions and trillions of dollars printed uh ends up being a very inflationary as one would expect uh and so i think that in many ways the 2020s are resembling the 1940s but then there are some differences so in the 40s going back to ray daly's conception the united states was a rising power we were running trade surpluses now we look more like the uk looked in the 40s were structural trade deficits we're kind of the incumbent power uh we're you know we're more de-industrialized uh due to kind of shipping our supply chains overseas uh and so there are a bunch of differences i think but i i think that people should be familiar with the 40s if they want to have a you know kind of a decent macro framework here so is there a vague way where this um plays out like the 1940s except the us as the uk something to that effect well i think in terms of the uk had a diminishing share of global gdp in that time and i think that that that could play out for the u.s somewhat similarly um in in all of my kind of 1940s comparisons i have you know obviously the the first thing people think of is like wait a minute world war and i'm like i'm not saying that's gonna happen i was like not making the kinetic comparison unfortunately that that's gotten more direct with you know obviously recent recent events uh where you have more kind of uh you know kinetic conflict happening but i do think that this is a time where you know we go through transitions and right now it's europe i think that's most at risk for a lot of things but i do think that the united states i mean that you probably at the end of this decade is going to have less of a unipolar grip on global financial markets than it had you know going into this decade i think that there's more catalyst for countries like russia and china and then even countries like india to develop just alternative systems and alternative stores of value having a more decentralized money system definitely seems to fit into the theme that we've been seeing there's less globalization going on our supply chains are broken people are moving manufacturing like but to be more domestic and also kind of more or less fits into the crypto side of things like yeah we also like our money to be internet based and not based in any one particular triographic region and so it's really helpful just to like kind of take these like decade and almost century-long time frames just to really place us into history but also at the same time lynn like the markets seem the the fog of war around markets seems so thick right now like we are not looking five ten years long investing horizons people are looking at like what is the fed going to do next week so i want to zoom in here and start to get a little bit granular as to like how we get out of this like that we're in a disequilibrium right now everyone understands that whatever the financial or economic state of the world is is not normal right now and we would like it to go back to being normal whatever normal is we're probably going to be it's probably going to be a new normal but that's fine so long as it's stable and so my question to you is like we have a few paths ahead of us how do we get to like a stable path what does that stable path look like what is this new equilibrium so we have like the fed's gonna raise interest rates or lower them so like what are the paths ahead that the fed have like what are the reasonable outcomes that the fed's choices are going to make in the next like three six uh 12 months so my expectation for you know several months now is that the fed's going to raise rates until it breaks something and i think we're kind of entering the phase where things are starting to break nothing's kind of broken so much they have to pause now but i think that you know basically they were late to respond and now i think that they're kind of making another mistake which is responding super aggressively too late when they've already kind of missed their window so you know we already have you know economic decelerating activity and then they're tightening into that which is actually historically very unusual uh and you know they're basically their credibility's on the line you know jerome powell's legacy's on the line where you know they have a long-term two percent inflation target and they're looking at like 8.6 official inflation levels higher if you look at a number of important categories and so it's understandable that with employment so low and industry it's so high that they're going to try to fight it that the problem is that the source of inflation is largely outside of their control so a lot of the inflation happened not because of fed actions but because of fiscal actions um and number two they can't really do anything about the supply side right so the la you know the lack of energy the lack of certain commodities things like that i mean if anything's if you tighten too much you can ironically make it harder for for many companies to bring on new supply and so i think that they have a very limited tool set but nonetheless in order to preserve their own kind of just legacy and kind of purpose they're trying to use the tools they have and i think they're going to basically use them until it gets messy enough because they can't create new supply but one thing they can do is try to suppress demand and that can potentially lower prices but then ironically that comes at the cost of a recession and you know kind of checkmate for a central bank is when they have high inflation but for one reason or another they cannot raise interest rates uh and so for example in the 1940s united states you're fighting a total war you have 130 percent you know federal debt to gdp of running massive deficits and the treasury department just says look uh you know we're not going to lose this war so you're not going to raise interest rates and you just can't you just can't do it and so that that was an example where they just said look you know inflation's running hot but we're going to cap yields anyway so at one point the 40s you had 19 year-over-year inflation and they still didn't raise rates because they just they just couldn't and and it wouldn't even really matter because the source of inflation was a decision to you know print a lot of money build a lot of stuff and fight the nazis and and things like that right so it's just a different type of inflation than what you see in say the 70s and i think that right now there's a number of central banks are essentially checkmated where there's you know too much debt in some of their areas like for example italy has 150 debt the gdp japan has 250 public debt to gdp and so you know they can't support five six seven eight ten percent interest rates uh and so their central banks the ecb and the bank of japan are basically saying look we just can't raise rates right now um so you know we're gonna hold rates low despite the fact that this is happening um the fed has a little bit more leeway and so they're still in the phase where they're at least trying to you know raise rates uh from a very low level to try to combat it but again i think that runs into the whole dollar milkshake thing we discussed earlier where the fed is kind of an outlier compared to a number of other developed countries and you see a dollar strengthened too much then you ironically have foreign entities sell treasuries and start causing you know problems in u.s capital markets and and the us economy and i think that ultimately forces the fed to probably stop tightening by next year even if even if inflation is still kind of running hot or is quick to bounce back as soon as they do so i think i think kind of the the new normal for this decade is probably going to be this kind of cyclical inflation where the you know it can go away for periods of time but then it's quick to return once once the conditions are right for it and i think that you know in many ways the past few decades have been unusually disinflationary in the sense that you know we we you know we basically had more money supply growth but lower inflation than you'd expect for that money supply growth because we had a lot of leverage we could pull uh to prevent wages from rising and to kind of push that inflation elsewhere and as a large part due to globalization right so we kind of you know we push a lot of our manufacturing to cheaper places of the world so that you know we basically had that big offset when you combine that with moore's law and technology and things like that uh we had a rather you know disinflationary period of time and i think that we've kind of run out of rope for that path um both for just geopolitical reasons and just kind of populism reasons and then just due to due to you know kind of the the natural limits of how much you can do that i think we're now kind of in a process where we don't really have that ability to push inflation elsewhere and so money supply growth more readily results in inflation for us going forward in developed markets and then in addition commodity cycles kind of go through these kind of 10 to 20 year cycles where it takes years and years to bring on these big commodity resources and so you have this period where you know prices are low nobody wants to invest eventually you kind of work through the existing supply you start to get price increases you start to get inflation and then a lot of new capital comes in and builds up all this new supply eventually over build that takes many years and then that's you know you know the the high prices end up being their own cure for high prices they bring a lot of capital then you have oversupply at a period of lower prices and i think the past you know call it 10 to 15 years we've been in this commodity disinflationary cycle over supply and i think that that's mostly behind us now so i think that you know going forward the next you know call it five 10 15 years i think we are in a just inherently more inflationary environment because we're not over supplied with energy in most commodities and we don't have those offshoring disinflationary levers that we had so in some ways it's not that this is highly inflationary although it is it's actually that the past decade was highly disinflationary it was unusually disinflationary we had unusually strong levers to offset some of our monetary growth and we don't have those levers anymore so i think there's going to be more correlation between money supply and inflation but of course for the lag i want to get uh just a little bit more clarity on what you mean by the fed is going to raise interest rates until something breaks uh and when you when you said that my mind immediately went to the crypto markets which are like things a lot of things broke in crypto in the last month we have like 3 o's capital got liquidated that had contagion and voyager like celsius is underwater a bunch of just like smaller crypto banks are are going under like block flies distressed so if we're looking at the crypto industry as like a litmus test like well a lot of things just broken crypto however crypto's still very very small so if we're taking this to the larger financial market and you're saying that the fed is going to raise rates until the larger financial market starts to break like what's an example of something breaking in the financial market is there any like weak link that sticks out to you like oh that's going to go first i would say treasury market or credit markets for example uh you know one of my macro friends luke groman describes uh you know bitcoin and crypto as last uh functioning fire alarm meaning it's one of the last free markets and so it kind of it's kind of the care in the coal mine it responds quicker to changes in liquidity than other markets that are larger and more managed right so so the fact that we've seen so much carnage uh among all this leverage and all these things wiping out i think as a precursor what we're seeing you know to a lesser extent in macro markets um because there's no you know the central bank is not going to rush in and do anything with crypto it's all of that is just on its own it's it's going to survive or die on its own based on the merits of the projects um and so if i guess analogs are good here so if you go back to 2018 right so so the last time the fed was raising rates they were raising them through 2017. you had a strong economic environment um you had you know kind of the incoming fiscal stimulus because they did tax cuts that were not you know offset by any sort of you know other spending cuts elsewhere so they're basically putting more money into the economy and you had a rising economic environment but again this this generally goes through cycles and so by the time you got into late 2018 yeah you know you were kind of out of stimulus and you were kind of slowly rolling over in terms of economic activity you're starting to get slower growth and the fed was hiking rates and jerome powell described it as being on autopilot he's like we're just going to keep doing this we're going to keep reducing our balance sheet we're going to keep hiking rates and eventually credit markets broke and by credit markets i mean that you know corporate bonds basically corporate you know corporations have need for refinancing their debt uh you know issuing debt to do operations things like that and especially in the weaker markets that you know the non-investment grade the junk bond markets that market completely froze uh for like six weeks nobody was able to issue debt because the the yields were messed up the market was liquid nobody wanted to you know no one no one in that environment was like you know i want to buy right now junk bonds right so the whole market froze and so a lot of people saw on the surface that the s p 500 went down 20 percent which was which was of course a notable event i mean it's a pretty big correction but that's not why the fed jumped in they jumped in because they saw credit markets which are much more tied to the economy and much more tied to corporate solvency and liquidity totally break and so you know they had to basically pause and say you know you know we're going to be data dependent we're not going to autopilot we're going to you know start adjusting a couple months later they were already kind of trimming their rates a little bit and this is all pre-covered this was in 2019 and then you had the repo rate spike that's another thing that broke so interbank overnight lending markets broke the federal reserve had to come in and reliquify those so they had to end their balance sheet reduction ahead of schedule and start expanding their balance sheet and then by march 2020 when you were full-on and coveted you had a massive crash you had the dollar spike the milkshake theorists playing out you had foreign sectors selling treasuries so the federal reserve had to come in and buy treasuries to reliquify the market so you have the treasury market break so those are examples of things in financial markets breaking that are you know closely tied to the functioning of the us economy that the fed is basically forced to jump into and some of those things like the treasury market or the repo market are something that is you know if they break the fed will literally have an emergency meeting and fix it in like hours or days right those are those are like the core of the system you know credit markets you know those can break for weeks and then the fed will be like okay we have to figure out what's going on here whereas like something like crypto markets or so on the periphery that you know they can break and the fed will just keep tightening until one of those closer markets starts to break and as i as we're having this recording uh treasury market illiquidity is getting pretty problematic so it's pretty volatile market is pretty illiquid so we're starting to see signs of stress in the treasury market uh it's not completely broken like we saw in march 2020 but it is getting quite messy and we're also seeing rising spreads uh in corporate bond markets so we're starting to see more distress in those markets and neither of those markets have gone to out like outright breakage but they are getting weaker and i think pointing to the fact that you know the market's starting to realize that by next year uh maybe even before then the fed's probably going to find it harder hard to continue tightening regardless of what the inflation numbers are showing us this is so fascinating by the way lynn and to bankless listeners i can't believe this content is free all right this is the beauty of podcasts all right so like in in previous decades um in normal people would have no access to this level of analysis and this kind of information much harder to prepare and uh the the kind of analysis that we're getting lynn is just um helping me think which with much more clarity about the rest of the 2020s so you know thank you for everything you do and uh it's so cool that like with the internet age that we're living and all of this is is free anyone can listen to this um but when there's a that's also just to jump in that's also why the analogs can be tricky right so you're looking back in the 40s technology and they're essentially doing what's called financial oppression they're holding industries below the inflation rates you know people didn't have ready access people couldn't rattle off what's inflation rate what interest rates you know they would they would check their like weekly newspaper if they were into the markets but you know basically the information traveled very slowly and a lot of what was happening was only known in hindsight as we dissected what happened throughout the whole banking system who was buying what how is this being managed whereas now in the age of information you know people are updating each other's like memes on the internet about what's happening in real time and spreading that out we have a meme here that we want to talk to you about but like is is this also why things seem to be happening so fast like it feels like we're we're living through like decades in the course of years and the whiplash that we've seen lately has felt like we've lived through several big you know decades just in the past three or four years do you think that's ties into the thesis of like things will actually happen at an accelerated rate with the highs and the lows and everything from here on out i think partially that said i think that there's there's two things one is that things when things start to get break you know basically when they at the end of a long-term debt cycle when you have kind of a a phase change in the way the system works you get more volatility and more whiplash so that's number one we kind of saw similar things in the 20s 30s and 40s but number two yeah i do think that the the spread of information uh means that markets can adjust a lot quicker and so you get a lot of kind of wild action and that's actually i mean that's part of why those crypto banks had so much problems you know even the ones that weren't outright insolvent they had bigger bank runs than than most banks would ever experience because all that money can move faster and you know those kind of the whole point of the space and so you had bigger bank runs and and more liquidity problems and it all just kind of becomes contagious right away

listening to you lynn is the fed doesn't care about equities right now it definitely doesn't care about your crypto asset prices doesn't care at all but when things start breaking in credit markets closer to treasuries that's when they're going to start caring but one thing that that i can't quite square in many of the macro people we've heard from and talked to late lately is this so um dan morehead from pantera capital put out um a memo recently and uh you called the recent actions of the fed the rate raises like you know point five percent increase or something like this and what are we at now lynn is it like one point five percent one point seven one point five percent and we just had a 75 basis point increase which was the biggest in in you know something like that so the biggest in in uh 25 years the biggest in a long time you called that aggressive um but dan morehead in his you know uh in his commentary was like that's not aggressive what we need to be doing is five percent like or higher we like that's uh that's how much catch-up we have to do because the fed hadn't been doing anything since the signals were there of like a year ago let's say summer of 2021 we should have been doing more the fed should have been doing to more and so rates have to increase so like four or five percent maybe higher and so i hear that sentiment from some macro people and i also hear like the other um it seems like you know uh unstoppable force meets immovable object sort of thing like at five percent um the us's interest rate rate payments have got to be absolutely crazy and like to your point about breaking like what has broken in the world economy at five percent levels god knows god knows what crypto prices look like what um stock prices look like and what credit markets look like and how does the the us actually service its debt and pay its debt this is something i can't quite square can you can you help bring some insight here how is it possible that um we need to raise rates to five percent why are some macro people saying that why are others saying like you can't possibly raise rates to five percent because if you do the us won't be able to service its debt yeah it's a good question i think that i think that actually comes back to why studying periods of history is so useful and so back in in 2020 i i started writing about the inflation that was likely to come from from this increase in the money supply uh and also expecting that interest rates would be slow to rise in response to that high inflation uh basically we'd have a large and normal gap between inflation and interest rates and that's actually what we've seen i mean the the fed is you know even though they they just had you know their first 75 basis rate hike in a long time they're still the furthest behind inflation they've ever been since 1951 since basically the end of the whole 1940s inflationary period and so basically they're basically further behind inflation that they have ever been since the last long-term debt cycle ended right so and i think that's why historical analogs are important because if anyone was using the you know the the 2000s mild insulation environment or the the 20 the 1970s inflation environment they have expected higher interest rates in response to that higher inflation whereas if i think you're looking at the amount of debt in the system and you're looking at kind of the low threshold of interest rates where things start to break uh you would more readily expect that policy makers would have no choice but to have you know basically have an inability to close that gap and i think that that's what we're seeing playing out and it's normal for macro people to to be wrestling with this with this viewpoint because it's such a it's not something that happened in their lifetimes uh and so really you have to go back to history books and you have to kind of look at bottlenecks in the system and start trying to judge what break what is the order of which things break because as you point out if you up to five percent interest rates that sounds responsible that's like you know we should have positive real rates i mean if we have high inflation we have to raise rates that that makes sense for a lot of people but as you point out that breaks basically everything uh so you know not just stock market going down but housing market breaks probably the foreign sector has to rapidly start selling treasuries treasury market goes completely liquid like it did in march 2020 and then what do you do there right so it's like it just you know the whole system kind of seizes up and i think that's a function of the fact that you know for 40 years now we've had lower lower interest rates all the way down to zero and in some cases negative in some countries and that's resulted in higher and higher debt relative to gdp and that debt is only serviceable with low rates and i think that that is what defines a long-term debt cycle that's why it's different than a normal deleveraging event because there's so much debt the system that it ever delivers normally the whole system breaks and so given the choice between massive you know bumpy deflationary collapse or spreading money that historically the result in printing money uh which can take the form of holding interest rates below inflation for quite a long period of time and so in the 1940s for example inflation averaged six percent uh it spiked as high as 19 and the fed held rates at roughly zero percent um and they basically just said you know we're not going to default so this is interest rates and we're seeing that right now in japan where you know they're above their inflation target but they're holding rates at zero and they're capping their their 10-year bond at 0.25 percent with yield curve control they're basically printing money into inflationary spike because they're like our debt our public debt is 250 debt to gp so we're not going to raise rates to positive real levels anytime soon and we're seeing a similar thing in europe they're basically saying look italy's got 150 debt to gdp they're not going to have positive rates basically bondholders are going to default in one of two ways if if they raise rates they're going to default nominally right so italy is just going to be unable to service debt or you just everyone's going to take a haircut and you know italy is not going to default nominally but they're going to basically default in real terms when you keep saying default in real terms right so um what we're talking about is inflation is really the pressure release valve here right that's how we have the in the in the long term debt cycle we have we've pumped this like this balloon maximally full and now it's gonna pop but the way we can like deflate it slowly is through inflation that's kind of seeping out the sides and is that why we're seeing that with like the yen and the euro why they're at like you know 20-year lows relative to the to the dollar is because we're starting to see kind of inflation um deflate this uh this debt pressure that's been building up i i think that's what we're seeing but it won't be a pleasant process and so basically in a normal deleveraging cycle the amount of debt in the system comes down um whereas in a long-term debt cycle basically end game type of scenario there's so much debt in the system that it can't come down without collapsing everything and so you instead you have the denominator go up which is money supply right so you have debt compared to gdp nominal gdp and compared to money supply go down not because there's tons of deleveraging but because there's inflation of the underlying unit that that debt is denominated in and you know that's one it's a very messy environment and it's so rare in developed markets i mean this happens all the time in emerging markets it hasn't happened in our lifetimes in developed countries and that's why this is so challenging to navigate it usually involves financial oppression because if you're inflating away the currency people want to get out of the currency so then they often try to block the exits and say well you know you can't buy like in the united states when they went through this period they made it illegal to own gold you literally for if you owned a benign yellow metal you could get up to 10 years in prison which is you know kind of insane uh by today's standards and so basically it's it's one of those things that's kind of intellectually offensive that they say okay well this is you took out this debt this is what you owe but when push comes to shove that's that's essentially what happens in history where they they kind of inflate it away and you know there's there's way there's scenarios where it can happen slower than others and there's ways that can happen more spectacularly and more kind of terribly and that partially comes down to what's happening in the real world right so for example the fact that europe is now energy insecure kind of makes that more of an emergency for them uh whereas you know japan and into the united states it's a little bit less of an outright emergency and might happen more gradually for example whereas some areas are are more in emergency status and then of course that's even more so for some of these periphery countries uh like sri lanka for example that's like being completely unable to get fuel um because they have kind of fewer resources in general so their whole reserve system is messed up and so i do think that we are an environment where a lot of debts will be inflated away and that can mean different things depending on the order of events that happen right so it could be a spectacular blow up or it could be like the 1940s financial oppression scenario where it drags out over a decade and you know everybody kind of takes a haircut is there any software landing if it happens to all developed countries at once it seems like all the central banks are in a similar scenario and if it happens to everyone is is that a softer landing than if like it's only happening in a few small pockets i think that still remains to be seen because the challenge there is that even though it's happening to every country at once it's not happening to every person in those countries equally right so for example right now in the united states consumer sentiment you know the university of michigan does a consumer sentiment survey nationwide and they it's actually got their lowest ever reading yeah here it was last month in june since they started doing it yeah like 70 years ago right it's just it's never been lower basically the it only got almost as low during the bottom of the subprime crisis uh and uh very briefly at the end of the 70s early 80s when they had massive inflation and volcker was trying to put the economy into recession to fight it which is you know kind of similar to now but basically it's the worst ever reading and that's in large part because you know the average wage went up like six percent official inflation went up eight point six percent um you know food at home went up twelve percent uh high protein foods went up fourteen percent gasoline went up fifty percent uh and so you know basically even though unemployment's low people in general are miserable um and it doesn't it doesn't affect everyone equally so someone has resources someone has a lot of fixed rate debt uh you know if their income is unaffected if they you know have all their needs met they're in pretty good shape whereas if someone's kind of struggling that's where you're going to get rising populism rising social discontent and that can make you know a soft landing is not soft for everyone and then you can get kind of you know fluctuating changes in leadership of that country and then you know just basically i think the united states and europe in particular among developed countries are pretty vulnerable to just kind of shifts in political wins around back and forth you get whiplash and what the people want from their politicians because they're in kind of an impossible scenario i want to set up a scenario that i think we are all about to run into you know go speaking in the frame of mind of you know history doesn't repeat but it does rhyme but it's also very different and one of the reasons why it's different is from technology and we already talked about how like this the speed of information especially memes being passed around on the internet is part of that technology people just like understand things better and faster these days and i also want to bring up the uh something that's stuck out to me lately is that you know the federal reserve is led by the the elder generation the boomers of the world meanwhile there's just like this growing younger cohort on like crypto twitter that is surprisingly like well versed in like money and economics and finance for what they would be in their in previous eras and so there was a meme that was circling around on crypto twitter lin that i want to get your take on and ryan's gonna gonna share it here in a sec uh the bankless weekly roll up we talked about this meme at the end of the show so if you listen to the roll up you'll you'll know it's coming so this is a meme that progresses quarter by quarter so we start in q1 2021 and every single quarter has jerome powell's face and his quote he's quoting in q1 2021 quantitative easing won't cause inflation and then in q2 2021 we go some inflation but it's transitory q3 okay high inflation but it's peaking q4 2021 okay inflation but maybe not transitory but job market very strong wage growth very strong and then q1 2022 okay we need to hike aggressively to curb inflation but no worries economy very strong soft landing definitely possible q2 2022 and this is like you know it's circled red because this is where we are currently uh negative growth in q1 but no no recession risk q3 2022 okay recession coming but you're not gonna lose your home q4 2022 okay you're you may lose your home but you're not going to starve to death q1 2023 you may die but at least you'll go to heaven and so like but part of this is this like technology that is passing around like these memes that by the way i love his face like how it transitions to like at the end these memes that are very well understood by like younger generations and it's commentary it's like social commentary as to the performance and the knowledge of the federal reserve so lynn when you take a look at this meme is it as first is it as dire as it may as the me makes it out to be and and second is the fed like how would you rate the actions of the fed is the fed like a competent institution right now so i mean dire i think depends on where you are right so if you're if you're in sri lanka it's pretty dire even if you're in europe it's pretty dire uh maybe less dire depending on where you are in the united states or where you are in japan or where you are in certain countries maybe less dire so i you know you'll die to go to heaven is not on my macro forecast thankfully but you know i think that but i get the meme basically one of the things i've been analyzing is the question of what does the fed understand that they're not saying versus what do they not understand that's actually kind of an interesting question right because you know prior to this whole covid fiasco and the money printing and the financial pressure and the inflation you know blackrock uh with with a former fed official released a report saying in the next downturn uh because debts so high because interest rates are so low we're gonna have to print a lot of money and you probably do helicopter money so probably fiscal stimulus combined with that but that could be some inflationary so they're gonna have to hold interest rates low for a period of time despite that so you're gonna have to have kind of coordination and then the big challenge becomes how to not have inflation get too high and out of control so like the whole road map was there i mean they they saw busy everything and there are a number of analysts like like me and others that were you know we had been reading things like that and we've been doing our own kind of similar research and saying that's that's probably that's basically the problem and so it starts to play out in real time you know central banks never come out and say look the sovereign debt's too high so we just have to hold rates low and financial repress everything i mean they never just say that they never say we have to inflate the debt away so they have to use euphemisms they have to kind of phrase it in different ways and so the question then becomes what do they know that they're that they just have to phrase differently or kind of you know kind of push the can down the road and kind of mislead people versus you know what do they actually just that they honestly think that they that they can solve it or that they you know that they think they're doing the right thing and so you know for a while uh the fed and other central banks were saying it's transitory when a lot of us knew that it wasn't or at least not not nearly as transitory as they as they think it will be um and so i i do think that the fed and other central banks are facing a competence you know chronic crisis here where their tools have always been kind of lagging indicators right so they're not very good at forecasting if you look at the fed's track record of forecasting basically what they do they never predict a recession because that you know they're kind of inherently political organization right so so predicting a recession is kind of an inherently political statement in some ways even even if it's not it just it just comes off that way so they never predict a recession um and what they do basically no matter if things are high or low they kind of point back to everything's gonna go back to two percent that that's all they do they they basically draw a line from wherever it is now to two percent inflation and like you know two percent gdp real gdp growth and like 2.5 interest rates and they just are always kind of going back and trying to point towards that medium and they don't really have a good track record and i think that that's all kind of being marked to market or being kind of realized now because now they're facing this kind of more end game type of scenario the super high debt level combined with inflation which is just not something that their tools are well equipped to handle and something that they contributed over decades to getting us here that they don't really have the tools to get us out of uh and so i i do think that you know in countries around the world especially these developed markets that have these super high debt levels so europe japan united states like i wouldn't want their job because it's an impossible job and you either have to like lie or you know like you have to be stupid or kind of look stupid and it's just it's inherently challenging environment to be in right so i think that they face a credibility crisis and it's not it's partially because they contributed to it but it's also partially because their predecessors contributed to it and that's just an inherently rough place to be and i think that the model itself is old right i think that you know if if you ask most people are price controls a good thing like should the government set prices of things most people would say no um whereas like it you know in the united states we've had price controls on money since 1913 right we control the price of money basically a group of elders gets in a room every six weeks and determines what the price of money will be and it doesn't matter where you are in the country i mean this is a country of 330 million people 50 states very different markets and they kind of set the nationwide price and then also because we're the global reserve currency this has international ramifications and it's literally because a group of people in a room are determining that that price and so i i just think that the model itself is kind of anti-antiquated uh and that as software each the world and as we kind of go through a somewhat inflationary crisis i think the the shortcomings of that model are kind of being laid bare that is why of course in crypto we were looking to uh immutable algorithms to control our monetary uh policy as a way out and maybe as the the institutional trusts in the central banks around the world uh erode in this decade as we expect they will maybe that becomes an increasing reason to turn to crypto of course that is the bull case but i want to ask you uh another thing that this meme was conveying i think towards the end with the uh well maybe you'll die but at least you'll go to heaven part which is like kind of this grim humor but but also a concern that i've heard david articulate i've thought about it in the back of my head as well which is one decade we haven't talked about lynn is the decade of the 1930s and the r for recession can turn into a d for depression and we have the populism we have um you know kind of like the commodity prices the the global instability the political instability um the like this could turn grim very quickly d you haven't mentioned the 1930s as as a possibility but what do you think about that is is there some remote chance of course there's always a chance but do you think it's likely maybe or do you think it's a probability worth considering that this r could turn to a d depression and we get a decade or maybe less than a decade of some sort of really big uh calamitous dip in the economy that is worldwide in nature and does affect the us does affect the developing world as well as the developed world i think that's possible it would take a different form and so the 1930s were pretty disinflationary decade and that's because you have the popping of a private debt bubble and so you had busy under utilization of existing capacity so you had commodity over supply you had low economic output and then the economy had a tough time kind of bouncing back and responding to that um whereas i think that to the extent that we've run into a calamity of this decade and i think we're seeing kind of early signs of of one uh due to energy crisis um i think it'd be more of an inflationary type of depression right i think that basically you know if i look at the bottlenecks of what could make this decade really really bad it's you know partially what's happening with the money system but it's more so what's happening with the real movement of essential goods right so it's really about can people get the energy they need uh and energy is kind of the master resource that affects everything else and so if you look back in history you know even though individual countries can kind of reduce their energy use the world almost never reduces its energy use because like you know there's so much developing uh you know kind of uh countries around the world there's still people that need a lot more energy and even the countries and developed markets that have been able to kind of flatten their energy use it's a large part because they shipped some of the most energy and intensive production to those developing countries so they kind of got off their balance sheet and out of mind even though they're actually benefiting from that higher energy consumption and the only times where global energy usage went down year over year uh one was you know a kind of a three-year period in the in the early 1980s which was basically when volcker basically put the you know kind of the us into a severe recession you had a latin american debt crisis uh you had a big dollar spike and you had this kind of just really rough uh global uh macro environment for for a few years uh so that was number one that was basically that was actually the last time that consumer sentiment was anywhere near this low was that period right so it was a terrible period for almost everyone the other one was the global financial crisis you had one year of you know less energy uses than the year prior and then the third instance was 2020 the whole coveted crash and basically you know economic lockdowns and shut-ins and reduced air travel and things like that and so generally reductions in energy consumption are associated with the worst economic environments in modern history right the whole kind of post-world war ii era um i i don't have data for energy consumption during the 30s but it would not have been pretty um possibly worse and so i think that that's one of the key things to look at is if we do have serious trouble getting the energy we need that's where you can get really bad you know like humanitarian outcomes and it doesn't affect everyone equally it affects it depends on where you are physically what resources you have available to to you um and i so that's that's the thing like if if there's a economic thing that keeps me up at night it's about energy security energy distribution uh and then all these kind of other things come come later so so the the money system all that is really bad but at the end of the day it comes down to can we get energy can we heat our homes in the winter can we you know get food on the table right because even you know a lot of fertilizers are made from natural gas right and so if natural gas you know like in europe it just looks like a weimar chart that making fertilizer in europe is going to look like a weimar chart right so basically it really comes down to whether or not we have abundant energy i want to hear what you think about the fertilizer and food topic but before before we get there i just really want to double down on this whole energy conversation uh oil a barrel of oil saw its first decline in price in the last like two weeks in a while and like i think like if we take a trailing average of like ten five for ten years oil and gas is still really highly priced currently but at least it's coming down in the last two weeks so that's like one very cautious note of optimism to be had there if that continues to trend downwards i think that's a big relief as in energy prices gas prices food prices start to come down but question question for you is is oil really at the center of this or like what is if we're if we're saying that energy uh is at like the center of whether or not we go into a depression or a recession or it's just a or it's just a pullback what charts are we looking at what are the energy prices how do we measure this whole thing so oil natural gas would be the two biggest coal uh and nuclear and other things like that are also are also big ones and so you know basically if you look at oil is more oil's more fungible than natural gas so oil is is pretty easy to transport around the world uh and so you can get kind of dislocations in price but it's generally pretty similar prices around the world and so brent crude and and west texas intermediate crude you know there could be brief anomalies where they differ but for the most part they're rather similar prices and you know right now we saw a dip in oil usage but we have to keep in mind that the us strategic petroleum reserve so the the oil that the government controls they're actively selling oil into the market to try to suppress prices that they can't do forever for obvious reasons they only have so much we also china's been under lockdowns for you know a large part of the spring and even now and basically they have unusually low jet fuel usage and car usage because they have you know kind of centrally suppressed their economic activity so the two biggest countries in the world are either increasing supply or suppressing demand for oil um and so i think that i i would you know any sort of dips i think that you know you have periods timer gets ahead of itself people bid up the price and then you have kind of you know pullback you have demand destruction you have recessionary type environments i would be slow to celebrate those pullbacks because i think that the underlying supply constraints are still there and so i think that those can bounce back quickly or if they keep going down it's a sign of basically depression space is sign of recession happening natural gas is a less fungible energy source because it's much harder to transport if you want to transport internationally you need lng right so you either need to you know transport over land with pipelines usually those take years and years to build they're very expensive or if you want to transport it by sea you need lng which means you need these multi-billion dollar facilities to cool it you know there's this whole technical process to you know basically liquefy it transport it and then unliquify it and there's there's kind of a firm amount of lng capacity that we have because these are multi-billion dollar facilities that we we don't just switch on overnight and we don't just have flexibility for people who are not familiar what's lng liquefied natural gas right so it's natural gas that we put into liquid form uh and cool it and so that's so basically the result of what i'm saying is that because natural gas is more costly to transport relative to the value of the product we have much different prices around the world for natural gas compared to oil that is pretty unified and so right now for example european natural gas prices are absolutely through the roof they're multiple times higher than you see in the united states or canada because they have an energy crisis they get a lot of their natural gas from russia so that's obviously a geopolitical problem right now but actually that was already happening before the war they just were having limitations there and their ability to get natural gas from overseas is much more limited than their ability to get oil from overseas because the the capacity to transport natural gas is much more limited and takes a lot more money and time to get that capacity online in order for say canada to ship over natural gas to europe or the united states to ship over natural gas to europe and so i think the two markets to watch one is just global oil prices but then two natural gas prices especially in specific regions and then also i mean you as a fallback you know i mean asia uses coal quite heavily because they don't have a lot of oil and gas deposits so they use a lot of coal uh despite the fact that it's dirtier in most ways and we're actually starting to see in europe that some of those markets are falling back on on coal basically due to emergency conditions that basically they've you know they they have not built new nuclear facilities uh they're at their limits in terms of natural gas that whole market's breaking uh and they can only get so much oil and so they have a fall back on on coal and so i think that basically looking at these big you know markets are some of the the underlying things for for kind of near-term intermediate term energy usage so here's what i'm i'm concerned about um the first half of this podcast we were talking about how the federal reserve's hand is more or less forced with its tools it's it's it's steering wheel has one of those things in it that's locked so it can't really steer it it's out of options the global markets for oil we're already broken with supply chains so that kind of is is a fixed thing as in so we can't really fix that it's not it's not fixable uh we're already like maxed out as far as i can tell from the limited information that i've gathered maybe you can help clarify we're already maxed out with how much gasoline we can pump out of the ground or how much energy that we can produce so that option is fixed as well we don't really have much choice there it sounds like we have a little bit of ammo left in our reserves that we're selling into the market to help supply to reduce price but i mean that runs out so as soon as we're done shooting that ammo then we're then we're kind of stuck there it seems to be we don't have very many choices and our future is already set and for better for worse maybe that future is actually you know a clear sky somehow we make it out of this okay you know maybe it's not maybe it's a capital d depression but either way our we don't have any choices and if you're telling me that we don't have any choices that makes me scared ah and i don't really have a question i kind of just want to hug like do we do we have any where are the clear skies here are there any or are we kind of effed so i think as we go deeper into this deck i mean there are ways to bring more energy online just not overnight right so you know partly is if you're an oil company or an investor in a potential oil company um you know there are quick oil sources you can bring online like shale where maybe you're willing to ramp that up a little bit um but other hand there are like oil projects you could do offshore that takes seven years to pay back and you don't know what the market's gonna look like uh you don't know what governments are gonna do you don't know what technology is gonna look like and so you're hesitant to do those and and you know right now if you look at oil pricing markets they kind of like the fed they they still kind of think this is transitory they're like oh we're going to go back to normal and like oil price is not going to be that high so if you're if you're planning on putting three billion dollars into like offshore development you're like well maybe i shouldn't and i think that basically the the more kind of pain this this goes on um the more incentive eventually you start to get of both governments and corporations but no no we have to go get that oil this is like an emergency and this this is not going away right so i think there are still levers to pull in terms of bringing new supply online uh and then building lng so that for example you know relatively cheap american lng could then kind of arbitrage some of the super expensive natural gas in europe and kind of arbitrage and spread out those prices a little bit so there's kind of natural things that over time should begin addressing this and i think their concerns come if one is you have kind of say governments make wrong decisions and either try to suppress new production or or control production and then mismanage it right i think that those are risks they're basically you can kind of like snatch defeat from the jaws of victory where you're kind of maybe starting to come to a solution then you manage to mess that up um and also it's one of those things where if you're on the periphery if you're if you're in a poorer nation or if you're in a poor segment of society it's like you're you're kind of last in line in order to get this resolution so i think for a lot of people it is a really tough time to be in uh but i think over time that this can be fixed and you know the fed's purpose right now like i said before they can't do supply but they can try to suppress demand so they're kind of trying to take discretionary demand off the market they're basically saying look if you're going to go on a frivolous vacation maybe you shouldn't right so maybe maybe you know curtail your optional usage so that the more essential usage gets used right so that that's kind of what that's the lever that they're pulling and i think that over the longer run the only way we truly get out of this towards you know constructive disinflationary growth again is to get more energy supply and distribution online and then that can also i mean you know china's building nuclear plants uh there's a lot you know there's all sorts of technologies if you look long enough in the future deep geothermal certain types of renewable resources uh you know i think that there are long range ways to address this and it's just there's there's intermediate things in those longer range things and it just that's why i think this is going to be a challenging decade because these are not things we can snap our fingers and just get you know long duration oil projects and gas projects and lng terminals online tomorrow would it would it be unprecedented in the same way that the united states government like put a permanent bid on vaccines before they were developed and just just footed the bill for that would it be unprecedented for them to do something similar with energy markets where they hey we need investment into our infrastructure we promised to buy oil like this many boils of barrel barrels of oil at this price for the next four years to give some sort of like security onto this investment by by the private sector would that be unprecedented that would be kind of like the 40s right so in the 40s they said look here's this war we're going to do we're going to be a permanent bid for like industrialized building industrial facilities making war machines and you know you're you're going to get paid right so that's kind of what we did also they did the same thing they said okay we need aluminum we're going to build aluminum like that's just we're going to throw public money into building aluminum right so basically you had a very inflationary decade but they actually had a lot of real world goods and services that came from that and so that actually that actually helped make that inflation not permanent right so yeah you brought on you know new resources because of that so if you had some sort of policy where they said look we are going to you know incentivize new production uh as quickly as possible and and longer term as possible i do think that would be one of the more productive uses of public capital i mean if you're gonna if your choices are either throw you know billions of dollars towards corporations for frivolous purposes or throw billions of dollars towards energy development i would take that latter one every day of the week right so that's not the worst use of of incentives or public capital and basically if you know the u.s said look if if prices go below x we will expand our strategic petroleum reserve to pay you x so you have you have no kind of downside risk over the next five years from producing oil you know i think that that i mean that probably you'd have periods of problem in the future you might have oversupply at some point right you probably that that's kind of the history of public arrangements where they solve one problem they create another but i do think that is one of the solutions uh here but i think this is overall just going to be a very challenging decade i think different countries are going to handle it differently i think some of them might try to do things like that other times i think the private sector can wake up and and you know if you kind of get out of their way that they can go and do that and it's of course it's a very challenging balance because during this period of commodity over supply that's when a lot of people develop some of these environmental goals that they then are stuck because now you have an actual crisis and you're kind of you're balancing between the environmental goals you were kind of planning for and then being hit in the face by the real world and i think that that's it just i think a lot of people are kind of adjusting and kind of navigating that in the way that they see it really quick question before we kind of just summarize everything um food or excuse me energy oil uh these like energy markets are at this epicenter of everything but then like downstream of that immediately becomes food uh can you just kind of paint the picture of what is the state of fertilizer markets and just food markets and if there's any just like you know contagion risk there so there are so uh i mean a subset of fertilizers are made using natural gas right so energy is is a key input not just in in driving to work but also in you know making food and then even once the food is made in terms of transporting it and packaging it and getting it to where it needs to be all that is very energy intensive process and so generally when you have price spikes in energy that translates into price spikes in food which of course is one of the most bad types of inflation because it's an essential good and it hurts impoverished people the most they spend the largest percentage of their income on necessities like food and fuel and then it's compounded by the fact i mean so rush is the biggest fertilizer exporter first of all um and so there's obviously you know we we think of russia as an oil exporter but they're actually you know they're the second biggest oil exporter they're the biggest natural gas exporter they're the biggest fertilizer exporter they're a big exporter of nickel which is an important metal for batteries and things like that so all the a lot of the renewables that people want to do they have sources there so they're you know given the fact of the largest land mass it's not shocking that they're basically the most important commodity market um and so that obviously has some geopolitical implications but either way you know basically so russia is a big fertilizer exporter they're also a big wheat exporter ukraine is a big wheat exporter um and so i know that ukraine's like uh you know harvest has obviously been disrupted from this you have kind of you've had kind of wheat problems and if you look actually at a wee wheat chart there is a sign of good there so you have this huge spike during the the run-up to the war but it's actually given back a lot of those war related gains because i think that that might be cooling off to some extent but over the very long run i think the key thing to focus on is fertilizer because if if natural gas prices stay high that means fertilizer prices are likely to stay high which transits into higher food prices and like i said transporting it now again you do have a supply response over time so for example one of the world's largest fertilizer producers nutrient is expanding their production they were kind of on the fence for that for a number of years where they always had the option to maybe expand it and you know now they're kind of accelerating some of their expansion efforts because they you know the market has given them the signal yes we need all this new uh production uh and so i think that over time you can get responses to that um but it just you know commodity cycles tend to tend to be rather persistent they tend to last you know five to ten years on the upside and five to ten or more years on the downside because a lot of these projects do take years to bring online uh and so i think that that is the big challenge right now is that you have so much debt in the system increased money supply so much now we have real world constraints on energy and fertilizer and things like that and so i think we're gonna have a period of you know high inflation interest rates below inflation and to the extent that it's either bad or terrible part it really comes down to the real world right so so can we get the energy can we get the fertilizer can we get that who's gonna get it and i think that's the situation we find ourselves in so lynn you've dropped so much fantastic information for us and i i feel um like i uh have much more peace on the possibilities and the you know different outcomes of the 2020s you know particularly on the macro side than i did coming into this um i guess as we conclude you know two big questions one is could you just give us a summary of what this new normal looks like yet again i know you were alluding to it earlier and then secondly want to leave the listener with some action items what do we do so i i think the message has been clear from this episode for travelers into the 2020s of which we are all on that journey you know steady and in time and space we are entering the 2020s there is going to be a new normal we cannot expect a world of the 1990s or the early 2000s or the 2010s the 2020s are going to be different there's going to be a new normal there's gonna be an adjustment we should get prepared for that so first what does this new normal look like can you summarize that i know you mentioned cyclical inflation that's going to be an ever constant thing you also mentioned commodities going up because we are undersupplied on commodities is are those the chief characteristics of the new normal are there others how do you summarize that i think that's a good way to put it i think that you know we can describe the recent normal which is based in the 90s the the 2000s and the 2010s which was we had china open up to the world we had the soviet union collapse and all you know those states opened up to the world so we had this big pool of labor uh that was able to connect to developed markets and so we had decades of geographic arbitrage where we could offshore things it's very disinflationary force and it resulted in this period of abundance where you know you you can always go to the market and there's you know everything you could ever want any color uh and and pretty cheap and that's kind of the environment we've been in and i think that we've kind of exhausted quite a bit of that where we've now we've tapped into that labor you know china is now a rising you know geopolitical power um obviously there's tension in russia now so you basically i think we've we've gone from this unipolar world that was opening up and that was becoming more efficient interconnected i think now we're going into a multi-polar world a more contentious world uh and you know we that we've have to reshore some things uh and they basically no longer have the capacity to push inflation and push you know kind of lower capital elsewhere um at the same time we've you know we went for the long period we under invested in commodities that this tends to happen in history i mean the 1970s another contributor to why we had so much inflation is u.s oil production peaked in 1970 structurally after like a century of going up and rolled over you know all the way until the 2000s when we you know started doing shale right so we had we became more reliant on those external sources the middle east and that's that that's along with money supply growth that's part of why we had such an inflationary decade so it's always the combination of commodities and then whatever whatever's happening with the money situation and so i think going forward because of how high debts are because of how kind of tight our energy situation is and because of how we've lost some of the disinflationary levers i think we're going to have a more constrained world for a while i think then that could take the form of inflation uh and there are other periods where you can get disinflation but then scarcity and and recession uh and and basically the shortages right and i think that those can manifest in different ways and different severities depending on where you are and i you know navigating this is obviously challenging i mean that's something we're all trying to figure out um i think that there's practical things people can do like you know corporations are very lean manufacturing oriented they want to have low inventories they want to do just-in-time delivery and i think it's kind of up to households to have you know stockpiles if they can basically to not rely on that everything is going to be there for you all the time right when you need it with no interruptions right so i think that that people have to become a little bit more self-sufficient a little bit a little bit more ready for periods of disruptions and challenges and then number two you know i think people approach their portfolios differently i mean i take a rather diversified approach i have cash i have equities you know focusing on kind of real like energy equities cash flow producing pipelines things like that i mean i have a diverse set of equities i have some gold i've said bitcoin people know that and i kind of just i diversified a number of different assets that i analyzed to be important for the next decade and of course people have different expertise and they'll find different things that they want to invest in or different things that they want to exclude but i do think it's important to be somewhat diversified because you can have big shocks i mean as you saw crypto just completely went down dramatically if someone was 100 in crypto their net worth is down you know 70 80 or more um whereas if you know if they were like 100 cash over the past couple years they just got you know their their net worth went nowhere went down in real terms while everything else went up for a long period of time and so i i generally have a mix of multiple assets uh but i think a lot of it's also just you know cultivating yourself having you know trying to build relevant skill sets trying to you know basically make your life as resilient as possible because i think there's that there is kind of challenges ahead of us and the one area that still could be disinflationary is actually ironically white collar labor right so we've we've spent the past couple decades you know kind of um uh offshoring blue collar labor and now with with remote work it becomes super easy to hire any competent person around the world and that i think that actually kind of um can result in disinflation for for a lot of white-collar jobs um so i think that basically people have to just i think cultivate diverse skill sets um be as valuable as possible and and be diversified and basically have resiliency in your own life this is all fantastic um insight and i think this this key of self-reliance is going to be important in the 2020s you have to get out there and learn how to do things because the old methods will not uh work and even even questions of like where do you store your value and to your point lens like you know people used to store their value and you know savings account in the bank maybe maybe now in the 2020s you want to store the minimum necessary that you need for some time horizon to pay bills and such and then with the other value that you want to store look at this diversified set of of assets uh including of course crypto and other things one last question on that because you touched kind of career and you've touched um you're kind of storing value uh but one piece that i think might be shaking uh people a little bit is um their mental health actually and i know that um your your focus is really like macro but there is a psychological element to investing into macro as well do you have any words for people in this volatility on kind of mental health and how we should prepare in that way well i guess people don't want their macro advisor to give health advice but i mean i think exercising and eating healthy is really important i actually it's funny one of my earliest articles i wrote like a 9 000 word article on kind of fitness and and healthy living because you know i i i've always kind of been into fitness and i used to do martial arts i used to be like an assistant instructor for martial arts and it's kind of a big theme for me and so i i think it's people should not underestimate the importance of exercise staying in shape um you know kind of you know trying to eat like whole foods uh you know as much as they can get back to fundamentals get back to fundamentals yeah and then yeah i mean developing strong relationships with those around you uh either online or offline um because we're we're social animals and you know we need to interact with our tribe or our group and other groups and and so i think that mental health is an important thing and i think especially in this environment where people hate each other so much there's rising populism due to extreme wealth concentration due to changes in the money and breakdown of money systems and things like that i think it's important for for people to at least try to be have gratitude for what they have and and be as constructive as possible to those around them and i think it's also it's it's an environment where you know we talked about before about how information travels super fast that also means bad information travels fast basically we have a flood of information both accurate information and false information and people have to be really discerning and like look for sources and like kind of not always just kind of focus on whatever they would have reinforced what they already think but then you know seek out information that they disagree with so that they can then learn from it and then you know basically then come to a more informed conclusion and that that's from multiple different subjects and so i think that that's and that's part of self-reliance it's basically having your own information filter um so that you were not getting in a bubble um and that you were getting out there basically trying to understand the world how it works and i think this is it's a really really challenging environment because it you know kind of breaks a lot of bubbles i think that people have been in for for decades in various countries uh such a good way to end it backless listeners hope
