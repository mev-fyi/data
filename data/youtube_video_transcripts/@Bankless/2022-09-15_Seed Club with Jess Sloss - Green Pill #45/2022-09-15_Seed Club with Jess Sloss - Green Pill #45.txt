foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we are talking seed club with Jess Sloss the founder of seed Club Jess is a prolific member of the ethereum community and Seed Club has incubated many many important Downs in the ecosystem incubated accelerated and some of those dials are impact dolls so one of the things that I'm really excited to talk to Jess about on this episode is this idea of an impact out generator function so basically how do we generate more impact dowels which then generate more positive impact on the world of course impact hours are any dial that have a positive impact on the world and what does it look like in a web 3 native way to run an accelerator slash a generator function for some of these projects and what is the eventual network of networks of networks that comes out of that if you if you play that forward so uh we talk a lot in this episode about playing the long game uh about about positive some games between community members and Jess talks about seed Club being a sense making Network a tool that allows you to slide into the DMS of other people in the network and work through the hard problems and make your project more successful which hopefully is the progenator of more positive impact in the world so uh Jess is just an OG he's so deeply thoughtful and there's such great stuff happening at C club and this is a really fun episode talking about generating uh more impact Dallas in the world so I am really excited to bring you just loss of seed Club enjoy refi summer has arrived and cello is here for it cello is the layer

sign up at coinshift.xyz slash bankless all right hey hey Jess what's up what up what up so good to have you uh tell me about seed Club what do you guys been up to what are you what are you doing what are you trying to do yeah 9C Club I mean we're building the leading Network for Dow operators and web3 communities and our core is the C Club accelerator where a few times a year we bring together the most exciting Community token projects and help them design launch grow you know kick some butt out and sort of building this new way of Distributing ownership to the people who are creating value on the internet beautiful uh how many codes were how many cohorts have you done and how many projects have gone through so we are kicking off applications for our fifth cohort on Monday August 1st uh we've worked with about 65 projects so far um some of those are out in the world others are still you know heads down building their communities I think that's you know one of the things that we really focus on is you know we very much don't want C Club to be a token Factory or a community Factory in any way we you know play the long game it's one of our core values as to think long term and uh have adopted the lfg tag as lftg that's thoughtfully go uh because we think there's just you know so so much more value in in sort of doing the the hard slow non-scalable work that we think ultimately creates value in communities and and will hopefully be shown in in the market as well yeah one of the things that I think is so cool about seed Club is is it's kind of like a generator function for dials so like in in math and computer science a generator function is something that generates other functions and uh you know I as as listeners know I'm really excited about impact aisles things that have positive externalities for the world and I kind of think of seed Club as an impact out generator function so you're kind of like generating and spinning out or accelerating impact dials is that a fair framing for for what you're doing yeah I think we you know it's like a network of networks in many ways I get really excited by the idea that some of the projects that we get to work with will be far bigger and more popular than than C Club itself in the future and I think when we start to see you know we've done four cohorts so far over 65 projects that are out in the world I just sort of think ahead three four five ten twenty years into the future and think about the impact of those networks on the other networks that they end up creating it's I think a really exciting web that that gets created there and you know there's there's no shortage of big hairy open questions around how to go do these things well and I know you and your listeners are well aware of that and you know I think the idea of building together and being a part of a community that's all focused on pushing at their own unique edges but you know sharing their their learnings back and having sort of this incentive and ownership mechanism that that ties people together is what would I get really excited about I mean for me the whole thing that pulled me into this space in the first place was it was really early into social media and saw the value is being created in this web 2 world and and also saw the early negative impacts of that not only just sort of the social impacts but also that as creators people who are investing in creating value in these networks so we had no say and and were creating profit for the centralized entities and so tokens as ownership you know mechanisms and networks I think is the use case for web3 and when you start to sort of step out into that um you realize there's like a whole lot of open questions there and so we wanted to go figure out how to answer those questions uncover new questions so I often refer to C clubs as a sense making Network it's the most valuable asset I have in the world is just the amazing people that will take my call and reply to my DMs and sort of formalizing that and hoping to yeah turn that into that generator function that continues to generate insights for brilliant human beings who are investing their heartbeats into you know things they deeply care about yeah yeah I think that you know one of the the neatest things that happens in this space over time is the relationships that you develop with people who are geographically diverse and skill wise diverse and in a bunch of different niches and can can sort of advise you on what you're building and it's a very positive sum relationship over time and you know I'm wondering you know have you have you actually have the people that have gone through seed Club help you build seed club like you said it's like a sense making Network so are you in this like ooda Loop where where they're helping you build the next cohort yeah 100 I mean we sort of think that the core mechanisms we're designing for is bringing great people and great projects together um yeah we're opening applications on Monday which is our process of involving our community and helping to you know curate decide choose which the which projects join for our next cohort so our token holders have a big uh impact on that but the other side of that is our collaborator Network so these are folks who have deep experience in the web 3 space or in certain aspects of you know organization building and um you know we sort of bring those folks together through the the 12-week program that is the C Club accelerator so very much that collaborator group is increasingly being made up of folks who have are alumni who are out there you know learning the the Contemporary lessons that you can only learn by building at the edges and you know there's I mean I mean c-clip launched almost two years ago and I think about just the number of narrative switches new token models like you know different ways that we actually launch these things and I think it's you know in no way are we becoming more and more clear I think there's more more Innovation and uh ideas and experiments that will be run and so those people who are running those experiments are by far the best folks to help guide the next batch of projects yeah it's really amazing what a cohort based model can do I actually got my start building startups going through Tech Stars in 2008 and just going through in a cohort based model and learning about startups together and you know some of those people are still some of my best friends almost 15 years later and so um I've seen the power of of of that sort of model and now I'm wondering how you can compare and contrast seed Club to more web 2 type things like techstars or 500 startups or YC yeah I think there's a lot of similarities right like the cohort model being able to bring folks together supporting them through you know the network that gets developed in in those types of organizations I like to frame it as you know techstars y combinator are like perfect examples of running accelerators as a firm and what C Club wants to build is the accelerator as a network and where you know we're recognizing sort of ownership and governance in the network through um through our token and so like the the basic sort of I guess the deal that the teams enter into when they join C Club is they contribute three percent of their tokens to the C Club Dow and once they complete the program and launch their tokens they do get a grant of Club tokens back as well and so we're sort of the lining incentives over the long term here where um you know c-club has this incentive to not just support server accelerator but to help these projects grow we have a whole cultivation working group that takes uh those projects that have launched and are about to launch as they leave the accelerator and help support it with legal a fundraising and token design and organizational development Etc um and then of course the the people who are in those projects become Governors and owners in the C club network as well and um you know not only have like the social capital alignment or the intrinsic alignment of wanting to see more of these things work and succeed but also have you know a true say in how and what we do so I guess like meaningfully we don't invest Capital into these projects which I think is sort of like the other big difference and um you know it's definitely something that we continue to think about but what I like so much space is that the first conversation when you're starting a startup like often the first conversation is how do I go get a pre-seed investment I need money how to go get money I think in web3 we have so many new tools that exist to help build that early Capital base whether that is financial or Social Capital as well and and those conversations should start a lot sooner so while we do very actively support teams and and raising funds or or you know generating capital for for their Dow they have many more tools so whether that's a crowdfund or an nft collection or traditional you know Venture Capital um going in knowing you have options I think is important right yeah um you know I'm wondering okay so we'll actually let me set an object level uh question and then we can we can we can get weird uh after that but like what kind of person should apply for the next seed Club cohort and I think you said applications are are on Monday where can they go to apply and who should who should consider applying yeah so accelerator.c club.xyz or give us a follow on Twitter we'll be sharing that equate uh often I think over the next while um you know I think we're really interested in the intersection of tokens and communities so you know web3 communities tokenized communities Dows um we sort of stay away from the deep D5 space as I think they're sort of specific knowledge that's you know best suited to be driven by folks who are those Builders but you know the the community and culture aspect is a big open space that I think has proven out to be uh you know rich with opportunity over the last two years and and that's really where we play so I mean we see um folks who are launching communities um Service devs uh a number of the probably the biggest increases in tools and platforms focused on on sort of the Dow and Community token space um and so we have wonderful projects like Cali Dao and Mirage they're building more of the tooling layer and then we're seeing a big interest in in DSi projects big interest in around sort of this like co-creation of narratives and IP and CCO and I think what excites me so much about how we structured C Club is that we don't have to have the strongest opinion on what will work um really what we're looking for is interested passionate folks who want to you know invest in our heartbeats and in building something meaningful and the core thing that we're looking for is folks who want to give ownership to their community so if you're wanting to go build you know a central entity that launches Collectibles and and it is sort of structured in a way that It ultimately will lead to more value extraction from the community it's probably not a good fit for us we think tokens give ownership in communities or or networks and those are the types of projects that we want to back yeah amazing um you know one of the things that sort of triggered for me when you were saying that is I remember in techstars some of the most successful tech service projects were things that came in and built for the techstars network uh that helped them move faster and so send grid was the first tech Stars thing that ipo'd and it's because they made sending I don't know if anyone's ever set up an SMTP server which is the email protocol but it's a  nightmare and sendra just made you like ability to do it in one line of code and their first customers were all techstars cohorts and so it's interesting to me that a growing part of what you're seeing in C Club is kind of like Dao tooling uh and I'm wondering like what kind of cross-pollinations are going to happen at scale at seed Club I don't know if that triggers anything for you but that's what it triggered for me yeah I mean I think it's um it's interesting because you know we do see so many interesting projects that come through and and some some that some of those are applying for C Club others are you know building tools for C club projects but there's a very big difference between you know say tool Builders who have are building to solve a problem that they have faced in a Dao or a community themselves versus two builders that are trying to build what ultimately feels more like a SAS or a product for for Dallas without having maybe that intimate understanding of the the biggest challenges that exist there and so when you end up there is like with all is a lot of like all-in-one Dow tools or you know there's no no mystery that if you look at the user experience and participating in Dallas right now it's it's can look from the outside like rather horrendous there's a whole bunch of tools and mechanisms that are being brought together and it feels like you're spread out over across a bunch of different platforms um but you know there's the reality for Builders who are building in the space is that there's just so much uncertainty about the future and that you know making bets on these all-in-one platforms or these tools that are requiring more of a lock-in or big decisions from Dallas that ultimately limit their optionality in the future is just not super appealing and so what I'm most excited about is seeing the types of tools that are actually being built either alongside our Dows and then probably even more so about the Dows themselves building the tools that will ultimately you know solve their problems and so so I look into the market of successful versions of this it's noses safe it's coordinate you know these are Builders Dows who have been able to come together bring the social and financial Capital together discover issues in their operations and have generalized a product that we think will sort of you know be make it easier for other builders to do and so this like deep collaboration and understanding of the problem space I think is absolutely essential and my bet is very much that the most interesting useful mechanisms tools platforms are going to come from these communities rather than be built from just the outside with the Assumption of you know uh it is the you're looking at Dows as if they're just Enterprises rather than these sort of organisms that have acknowledged Insight talent and capital to go build cool things themselves yeah so it's just so interesting um well you know one of my favorite moments it just having been involved in Bitcoin for years is when people come up to me and they say hey like y'all materially change the course of my career or helped me in some way and uh it's just like it's like the golden retriever I mean it's like it feels like a good boy uh and I you know I'm curious you know with the Alumni network if if you have any of those moments and and if that drives you in any way like that network network approach to helping each other out yeah and it was I get to spend my days talking to brilliant people who are trying to solve big problems towards you know a thing they care deeply about and you know I get to have that feeling pretty much every day which is like you know probably the biggest blessing around and for me like I'm so fascinated about exploring the edges and new ideas and uh you know I think up until sea club which feels just like a you know crazy experience it just it came out of 11 people on a telegram and just built this momentum and and to be able to get to do have this thing structured in such a way where I get to go do you know work with such smart people who are dealing with the biggest challenge like the big challenges get you know is what I get brought into and what you know our support network and C Club get brought into and you know those are everything from you know how are we design our token and thinking about capitalizing the organization to you know managing interpersonal relationships and Community structures and you know how how do you actually focus a group of people on on a big goal and get alignment there and and these are not easy questions and they're not things that can just be turned into Frameworks and templates and just be you know successfully applied easily and yeah there's nothing I'd rather be spending my time on yeah it's beautiful um I guess I'm curious you know you said you like to kind of be at the edges and and be in the frontier and and and bring those things back I'm curious what what are you most interested in trendwise right now you know take me down a weird rabbit hole well I mean I think like there's been a lot of learning around what is the right Community token structure to sort of launch with or for the early days and I think you know a year and a half ago that was fungible tokens and you know both C club and Bitcoin I think in different but similar ways sort of launch tokens um for Dows that were sort of based on on this model of fungible tokens and investing and distributions and Etc and then I think you know with nfts taking such a an increase in interest over the last you know eight months to 12 months that a whole bunch of new experiments were being run and so I think our our most you know if we look it back to our third cohort I would say 90 of projects we're exploring launching fungible tokens and then our fifth cohort that's flipped so 90 of them are exploring launching nfts and I think there's a lot of insight in there especially for the earliest days of communities I think part of that is this idea of sort of ownership in a brand or a meme is is more tangible and easy to understand um reduces some of the the challenges around liquidity because both allowing for tokens to have a market but not a crazy big market and not requiring teams to spend a lot of time and effort on standing up uniswap pools there's sort of this programmatic Revenue that can come back to it and and there's this cultural aspect this sort of uh identity that was really seen take Center Stage over the last few months that I think is is also interesting so I think that's the thing we're thinking most about right now is what are the the types and structures that will really support our communities at the earliest stages to to like you know rally their community and to you know distribute ownership and then how to do that in the in a way that is both provide a lot of optionality for the future but you know taking bold step forwards with a strong belief on what a good good enough token model is for for teams right now so I think you know the probably the most interesting project in this direction right now is is nouns and in that Perpetual auction mechanism I think there's going to be a lot of exploration in that over the next little while I think a lot more failure than successes um and teams that are able to sort of figure out what those uh you know pull apart the aspects that make the now Niche model successful and apply to their their use case effectively is definitely something we're interested in um but we see it you know the other two big groups or nfts Dow tokens so just more you know having a traditional structure for for a dow token but using nfts instead of your c20s or fungible tokens and then there's this big Middle Ground around membership and membership passes Etc that sort of creates interesting new Revenue sources and and governance opportunities as well so I think you know we'll be leaning pretty heavily into that for this next cohort uh we have fairly strong opinions I think for the first four cohorts we've really tried not to to come up with Frameworks or strong recommendations we were still still we're and I think we still are in this sort of you know idmas right now and and really like to see many many different options and my dream is that some new token model comes out of C club that takes the World by storm so we don't want to just be too too focused but for many communities that have something that's pretty clear like in their mind that you know the removing some of the uncertainty around what Frameworks can get them from zero to one is super powerful so I guess you know I'm curious to pull the thread on this like I think in web 2 basically there was two models that everything converged on and one was you sell your users data to advertisers and you just optimize for page views and clicks that's one model um the second model is the SAS model which is you try to get as many people into a 9.99 a month or something subscription plan and then you optimize for lifetime value reduce cost per acquisition and then you scale and those are basically the two models in web two do you think that the community like the model in web 3 are going to converge on one two three five or like a dozen options or is it too early to say well I think we can see some of that convergence happening right now but I'd also say I think it's it's too early to say in many regards um you know I think like this um the idea of ownership or prop like yeah ownership in in the meme or in in the brand I think is is one that has been very powerful so far um so whether that is is nouns or that is you know Aku and sort of the story that's being built there or or you know this idea of you know pool Suite is a project that we've worked with and you know having executive cards that represent sort of membership there um so I think that's interesting that like how you actually go and turn that into a meaningful token structure or revenue or ongoing um you know Capital creation I think is is the big open question um you know you could look at at projects like proof which and and board Apes which have sort of run a model right which is like launch something get a whole bunch of Interest launch a bunch of derivative projects I think there's sort of like a a limitation on that at some point I don't know where that's hit maybe we've hit that already um you know I think that this sort of membership access thing is is interesting we're sort of seeing a blending of subscription with ownership um yeah and then I think like this you know again with nouns there's this Perpetual sort of uh like what are people behind or they're buying you know a digital representation of a meme that is designed to prepare you know propagate itself into the future um and I think there's something really interesting about that as well and I think these questions that we're asking around Community tokens are some of the similar questions that should be asked of the broader web3 or crypto space as well like what what are we actually buying when we own a governance token what is the model that's actually working there and I think there's a big TBD on on all of it and so um yeah I think I I really one of my big fears is that we start to see something that really clearly works and all of a sudden we close off ourselves to all sorts of New Opportunities because I think you know the one consistent thing since I've been in the space for the last uh five years now is it changes and we we learn off of previous iterations and my guess is that continues for some time right yeah that's beautiful um are there any other Trends on the edges that you're interested in in talking about you know take us into the frontier yeah I think I'm just constantly surprised by the variety of Industries or categories that people are are sort of applying the web 3 lens to um you know the the research space is fascinating to me if you think about just the the number of uh the sort of this ability to bring a crowd together to do sort of collective data creation and turn that into some some value that can be you know created and captured by a dow um I think there's some early or exciting or early experiments and what seems to be called DSi um but uh you know I think there's still so much to be done there and it starts to get into some of the tricky questions around IP and you know often sort of touches the real world in interesting ways and so that feels very very much on the frontier um and I also think we've just sort of come through such a big wave of nfts as pfps and sort of you know speculative Collections and I think like the the hard work now is for people to make these you know digital assets relevant in a world where there isn't just you know a wash of cash trying to flip pfps you know one of the big things that we you know always caution our teams on is like you know speculation might feel good early on and be able to generate a large treasury but ultimately it usually has an impact on your ability to build meaningful value as a community of people who are there for speculation are often not there for the big adventure that you're going on as a community and so I think while you know token design structure a story all these sort of things play into how do you actually launch a project that um is focused on getting you know ownership and membership in the hands of the right people who are there for for a big big aligned vision and you know ultimately allow you to sort of move and innovate and do the hard work of actually creating value in these things you know I think there's there's a world where you know Community tokens Dows look more like the evolution of a patreon or a Kickstarter um I'm far less interested in that I think what Dows and networks and Community tokens look more like these startups where they're you know they have an Insight we like to call that the you know a call to Adventure but then the hard work is is and and where values created is through solving big problems and innovating and so these teams need to go out into the world and and sort of uh discover their own insights and You Know Remix existing mechanisms and ideas into to and package them in a way that actually creates values for their organization so that is very much at the edges uh I think we have a lot of you know yeah we're on the market right now a lot of speculation a lot of hype a lot of you know the the floor prices high but there's sort of a diminishing returns to that as that money gets spent and we need to start thinking very very hard about you know how do we turn these things into sustainable growing organizations yeah yeah understatement understatement of the uh of the podcast right there yeah well I think it's it's I mean I just I love zooming out right you start to see a few of these cycles and you see such a good opportunity to bring resources to bear on these these uh organizations but um I think there's a big difference between folks who are really leaning in maybe it's their first cycle or they're just here for more short-term gains and really you know playing those short-term gains and capturing that moment which I think is great if you're doing it with the sort of long-term uh you know incentives of mine but so many were in the short term so we have to kind of work through there's a lot of false signals out there in the market right now I think that people are trying to you know use as insights to go build new projects I think as those start to you know fall apart and to whatever degree they will I think we'll start to see a lot more you know thoughtful long-term thinking in the space I'm a big fan of compounding I'm with Warren Buffett here I think it's the most powerful thing in the universe and uh you know I said shareable sea Club I think it's this network upon Network so when I think 10 20 30 years in the future if we've built this institution that persists the impact is just going to be so much greater than anything we'd be able to generate in a six to 12 month total marketing cycle yeah it's amazing how much of this just comes down to the marshmallow test I mean don't try to get rich quick that's a great way to get rack to lose your principle you try to get 20 on these things and you know I really think that being long-term greedy I used to follow this podcast before this is before my web three days but it was called get rich slowly and I just love that memetically uh because it made me think that oh this is the Horizon we're going after and we're being long-term greedy but but you know the ultimate trap you can fall in is just trying to get those that short-term gains and and um you know it's amazing to me how much this this just comes down to to playing long-term positive some games at the end of the day yeah I think a big part of that comes down to conviction in the space and I think there's a you know a lot of folks that come in you know in the same way I came into the space it was I wanted to buy into the Dow I wasn't technically capable enough to do it so I didn't lose my mind okay that's when you buy ethereum in the first place um and you know but so it was this like Fascination but also maybe Financial return um but you know I think you start to see like the the more conviction that I build in the space and and the importance and like my why of building here that you know there's just no no way that I would ever want to sacrifice that potential to be a part of such a big important movement for for these sort of short-term games even though I'm pretty sure when I was a child I probably would have eaten the marshmallow like I think about that yeah more than ever to admit you know the Opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto Community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet Opera lets you access defy apps quickly and easily the upper wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view your beautiful nfts but the browser

of has I don't want to say tentacles tentacles is not the right word but it's a network that is reciprocal with hundreds maybe thousands of dowels and it's kind of like this mesh Network that rises and falls with all of the alumni and people that have gone through seed club and then the people that their lives have affected you know tell me tell me about the sort of vision where where seed Club is maximally successful does it look like a network of networks Dow dows yeah I think like the you know we often think about how do we sort of display the value that c Club creates because what we very much don't want to do is just put a list of Assets in our treasury not only does that not capture like all the the work that hasn't been done yet it's just sort of a small snapshot but it's also like the very much the wrong heuristic in my mind and so this mesh Network like the visualization of this network I think is really what we'll be leaning into and I think there's sort of like two main values or things that get me excited about it one is I think one of the core um models that most dowels will roll out as some sort of incubation or accelerating type of product or service or working group right like if you've brought together people on a big adventure and you have capital and you have this ability to get things seen a very natural thing is to to use that that value to help support others other projects that are in you know working towards a similar adventure and so we see this early on even with like our projects like cres house which are on a mission to to buy and operate an NBA sports franchise and are taking a bunch of small steps towards that and you're seeing all sorts of new tools and sub-projects and things sort of spin out of that and so we'll sort of see well cross house would be a node from our our second or third cohort what then you'll see is probably a whole bunch of nodes off of that and and you know the the impact will grow far beyond anything that we would have on on a daily or a weekly or even maybe any basis like there are so many things happening through our communities right now that I have absolutely no clue about uh but they're sort of through line right back to to C Club the other part is like we have a number of participants that come through and have you know applied with it with a team and a big big idea and then they ultimately decide that there they thought was there wasn't there and so we're very excited about teams who realize that and say hey this isn't going to work the way we thought it was going to work and so we're going to Sunset the project because for us it's the most important things that we put out projects that we can truly deeply stand behind and support our brand is associated with all of these things and so the worst idea would be for a team to move forward and launch a token just because even you know even though they don't have anything anymore but what happens out of that is that those people become some of the biggest supporters of our other projects so I think about Austin Roby who who applied for our second batch with ampled he came in um went so deep on on the sort of community token model for ample which is like a a music uh like patreon but it's set up as a co-op which is super interesting and they ultimately decided not to go forward with the token but Austin and Yancey strickler was one of the co-founders of and CEO of Kickstarter applied for our fourth cohort and they're now building a project called meta label alongside Rob who is the founder of etsy brilliant people are coming back and so and then of course people start other projects or they join other projects and so this sort of network of networks if we think about great people and great projects are this is constantly evolving and so um to me that's the core right we just want to be very thoughtful about the people and the projects we bring together sea Club isn't trying to be the a million person Network that anybody can just join you know there is a curation at every layer that we play with and um you know that's not always the right model and I think this broad permissive access is very exciting for many projects we are going the opposite direction and it's one where um you know the value that to get to create for early stage projects is is best done through curating smartest best aligned human beings we can and projects and supporting them with the tools and resources to go be successful yeah yeah beautiful um so I mean like 10 10 years in the future it seems like you've just kind of created this Alumni network that's got the all these positive some games and hopefully he's having a positive impact on the on the world but they all sort of have uh a network that can support each other and in seed Club kind of has governance or upside uh I think three percent of of each of the projects is is what you said yeah so so yeah three percent is contributed to the Dow and so yeah we you know C Club will be an active participant in governance and and support beyond the accelerator and you know I think we'll continue to explore how we can be supportive as teams and projects and and doubts become bigger and bigger um and and then those folks the people who are who are leading those projects and the projects themselves get a grant of Club tokens as well so they will be a part of choosing our next cohort you know managing um where and how we put our time and and Steward our funds long term and there's just so many unknown questions um for the operations and structuring of C club that we still have to go figure out and you can think of no better group of people to help inform that than the folks who are you know running their own experiments in their own edges of the internet yeah totally um and then you know I'm sure they refer potential next projects from the cohort to the network and word of mouth is the best I've always just found in hiring and with like with with discovering new products word of mouth is the best way to discover High signal to noise because it's your friends and if you trust them then there's it it just it just filters out all the noise well I mean I think like trust and attention are the two scarcest resources on the internet and you know we're really maximizing for building trust and and you know creating value for the attention that our projects provide and then also can be a a great signal um for uh for the broader public to see like what you know my my big dream is that we Steward the C club brand to such a point that as you see a project that's come through C Club it's a it's an easy thing to say yes to pay pay attention to um and I think that's why we work with very small batches and we're you know we didn't scale our cohort size even though we saw almost a 10x and increase the number of applications for a last cohort we're not scaling the size this time in fact if we don't you know we couldn't theoretically go smaller if we felt like that was still going would be necessary to create like the the right sort of potent of human beings that are coming together um so yeah I think like making sure that we you know if we do that well we create so much value for our members as well where we can actually put these ideas and maybe some of them look very weird or wild to start with but if we have conviction on them we can play a very you know meaningful role in helping them get from zero to one which is you know I think especially for folks who are coming into the space from the outside and haven't built their own sense making Network it can be a a big challenge to build that trust and Authority that gets on the radar of people who who have you know the ability to really you know amplify or make a difference for some of these projects so I think that's the some of the most exciting things we think about meta-label you know meta label came in with this big exciting vision and also some big huge questions about web3 I think they were very very Discerning about how they were stepping into the space and um it's probably one of my my favorite stories is just to see you know see the change in the excitement that that team has had in the space and there's just no doubt in my mind about the value and impact they're going to create yeah yeah it's it's really a beautiful thing I mean to see your friend succeed this is you know this is like the thesis of a lot of the stuff that I've been having on the Pod over the last little while is Squad Squad wealth uh meta-label growing a network together that that's positive some game and it feels like we're moving from this like this you know Yancy always talks about bentoism which is going from now me to Future us so expanding out on the time Dimension and on the multiplayer Dimension and it's it really is just all about succeeding together on on long-term uh time Horizon that it feels like that's the consistent theme that I'm drawing in a lot of uh green pill guests and uh yeah I I I'm curious if you how you how about jobs with you yeah I mean I think like the it drives well I think you know there's this sort of part of human nature that and I definitely sort of feel as well where you know it can can feel like you want to be competitive and and that there's sort of this um you know we so much of our lit or at least my lived experience is one that started defined by scarcity in different ways and I think what is so interesting is how often the lessons come to show that by being open by being supportive by really trying to lean into I love them the now me and future we uh ideas is not only a far better more fun way to live your life but also leads to more opportunities and however you and success however you want to Define that whether that is more connections relationships you know wealth opportunities Etc like this building these networks of people that you just Vibe with and and you know you want to see succeed and they want to see you succeed is just like such an incredible asset and and next superpower I think and so 100 on board with that yeah yeah well uh I think that you know we've been rolling for 35 minutes uh we got maybe 10 or 15 left I'd love to just open up the aperture of this conversation towards uh really whatever you're interested in I think that you're on the frontier and you could probably guide it so is there anything I didn't ask that you want to jam on yeah I think one of like the you know it's been so interesting to see this Dao meme really take over for the last little while like it's it's uh got a lot of momentum behind and it's sort of entering into the point of conversation right now where it's I think getting more mainstream-ish early mainstream attention and with it comes all these sort of like very obvious criticisms that I think many of us that are in the space already are very you know clearly understand but I think they're sort of um you know even within the Builders of the space sort of uh misunderstood and I think a big one of those is around sort of like the the organizational and operational structure that exists in these communities um and I'm curious actually in your thoughts here as well and I think this sort of early sort of thin version of the meme that people get is like okay there's this huge you know wide flat hierarchy-less organization that has maybe a token and has some incentives and they're going to go out and solve big problems and it's very easy to pull that apart because you know well it's you know very tough to make great products if you're trying to design on based on consensus you know how do you ensure that the tragedy the commons or a free Road load of problems don't sort of completely destroy your operations and your your Effectiveness as an organization and you know on and on and on and on I think there's a you know haven't we already solved all these problems with with the company structure and so I think like the the most interesting conversations I'm having with our alumni projects right now is sort of going from I don't think that belief that there's you know we we're very clear and at least our world view that you know did just a pure flat structure can be um can be challenging to navigate early on in in Dows and that some structure is important but I think most teams sort of underestimate the importance of of structure in in rolling out operations and actually doing the important thing which is you know building momentum and ensuring that these organizations sustain over the long term so I think what's interesting there for me is is both like the fact that I have always sort of operated with this idea of of you know c-club having operational structure and not just being this broad permissive network but there are so many levels of that and understanding and what we've seen over the last little while in our organization is that the more clear and structure that we can apply not to the end of like here you know here's the CEO and your boss and and um they're going to tell you what to do but more and like how do I as an individual come in and create value towards what what are the Norms how do we actually build the structures that allow for self-management to to be effective um you know for us it's really been about bringing in Far More structure and encouraging far more leadership than what I think most people who maybe are on the outside of the Dow space would recognize yeah yeah I think there's a lot of experimentation going on right now I mean you know one one thing where maybe you and I differ you know I'm actually curious to pick your brain on this is like I don't think a lot of these dials are going to be successful if we have if they have if we go all the way from hierarchies to just totally flat organizations it feels like proportionality is is something in the center there and and and I'm wondering how you think about proportionality because you know there's really a lot of nuance in that people uh if they're in a role in which they're really crushing it and delivering a lot of value I think that you need to have that proportionality of of outcome and and governance control that that routes towards the a players that are in the right roles and and like B players who are in the wrong roles should be moved out of it and you can't have that in a totally flat organization you need to have a proportionality in in that so I don't know the organizational Dynamics As you move away from hierarchy get way more complicated because you have to build this peer-to-peer mesh network of feedback where people are honestly sharing feedback and receiving feedback from each other and evolving forward word and and I think proportionality is is a big thing there so you you know I don't know if there's any Trends you've seen but that's what I've seen in the get coin Network yeah I 100 agree and I think you know the the biggest point of impact or maybe there's two one is sort of the the culture that gets built and set I think being very purposeful around that culture building which is sort of like the the evolution of the the sum total decisions that are being made and how those are being made and um I think like that's a much easier thing to do when you're a small group of people and you can have those sort of open lines of communication and fast feedback but it gets exponentially more difficult as you start to expand that Network and so you sort of have a window of time to really set that culture where you know as you grow and grow it becomes much more difficult to make those changes in in some cases I think it might be you know the risk is existential where there isn't a coming back from that unless there's a hard reset um which I think is is challenging and the second big piece is like who who and how are you bringing are you sort of bringing people in or are people joining um and I think like four networks are aiming to be more flat and have no hierarchy like the the you sort of need to move that that the structure needs to support that so if I think about you know C club we are you know very we have a very small stewards team um and ensuring that those people are incredible Builders but hold the values and culture of C Club very clearly their minds are essential for us as they build out and and you know recruit for their contributor members Etc and ensuring that those sort of um I guess the the early people that are are taking and assuming responsibility or or the right people and and making tough changes if that's not the case um I think when you look at something like nouns which I wouldn't say is a very different type of organization where they're you know yes they're sort of financial barrier to access ownership in that network but anybody can do it and if you have money you can kind of can can join what they've done is sort of pushed a lot of like the hard organizational structuring work out to the edges and so they said hey all we're going to do is allocate Capital so we vote on proposals and then teams or individuals who have their own work structures and leaders Etc are now tasked with response the responsibility of executing on that so I think there's like you know depending on how you are building your network or Dow you need to think through like what are the right decisions to be made by you know by by these token holders and and then how do you ultimately create structures where small groups of people can you know can create value can be measured on that value can grow their reputation and ability to further Access Capital based on that value and there's still a ton of work to be done in the announced ecosystem on this but I think that's maybe one of the most interesting insights I think Brian Flynn tweeted nouns moves the ability to rug away from the founders and to the contributors it's like an interesting yeah well just even using that word like just even using that word creates such a diversarial dynamic to be but I I could appreciate that we're at least taking that and pushing it out to the edges well and I think what's interesting is like when you look at how that that Community is deploying capitals it's very much being done um I mean at least from the outside I'm not an ounce holder um with the idea of like velocity of of funding and of projects and experiments being one of the core metrics that they they track right so it's it's not as if there's this like huge important I don't even think they have a clear feedback loop on on sort of measuring that success right now which is probably a bit of a mess or a piece that needs to be built out but instead they're saying hey there is so much energy and excitement for this let's make sure we're putting hands into it or money into the hands of what we collectively believe to be you know useful projects in this space knowing that many of them will probably not have the impact that they want to have but that enough will mm-hmm yeah yeah that's yeah one would hope with the law of large numbers that enough will um I think it's an exciting open experiment right and this is the thing that gets me so stoked into space is is you know if you're if you're running a project in the space there's every week or month new mechanisms come out that you have to really look at and see like does this materially change how how what we're doing um you know will get done uh sort of a new type of of category that's being designed here that we need to go play in or that we should you know adapt from in some way and so this idea of you know I think of Dao's as one of the like the Dow that we're building C Cloud as one of our products so we need to think through and evolve the mechanisms that ultimately support the the development of the C club network and uh you know I don't think that the knowledge and structures that we have today are going to be the ones that persist fully into the future and and the ability to sort of innovate and stay up to and incorporate the best parts of the projects in in the right way I think is probably the biggest challenge and opportunity for folks that are sort of tasked with that part of Dow building yeah yeah oh man uh it's been so great to chat with you about C Club I just think that what you're doing is so cool and it's so pro-social and um it's like like I'll start from the thesis that I wanted to have you on the Pod was Generator function of impact dolls and you know if these projects are creating object level impact then then you're sort of like generating that and at scale and in over time I I can't wait to have you back let's say in like 2024 and talk about all the alumni and and how it's gone so uh thanks for coming on the Pod man it gets me so excited to think about what 2024 and 2025 looks like um and yeah huge fans of Bitcoin and of yourself as well in this podcast so it's really great to be on here and uh I see collaboration in our future and we'll you know continue to look for great ways where we can come together cool well I see coordination in our future little slight slight change in framing there but uh yeah both we could do both we can collaborate and coordinate you know I'm really interested in I'm actually I've I've no longer involved in leadership at coindao contributing from the edges but I wonder if there's a way where seed club and get coined out could work together in some way because I know that git coin grants is where a lot of projects in the space go for first seed funding and and so is seed club and so I wonder if there's kind of a way of sharing not deal flow but you know up and coming projects between the two dials and uh I can only Wonder out loud and in front of all the podcast listeners what that looks like but maybe something will come together over time between the two communities yeah I've definitely been thinking about that a lot as I've seen uh some of the conversation online in the last little while and I think you know what we want to do is make sure that we have like the the human capital and and the knowledge to sort of support teams and and the hard work of going from you know the idea to building a meaningful organization in the space and we can get really good at that um that's the type of value that I would be very excited to to see how we could bring to a sort of similar ecosystems yeah gag almost Vision uh and I'm just wondering I'm wondering out loud about this but you know like I almost imagine that anyone could mine the get coin Grant status at once it's grants 2.0 it's totally decentralized for you could mine the grand status set of okay what are the top up and coming projects uh in the ethereum ecosystem through get coin grants you you funnel those into a c Club application and we we just pass those off into seed club and you know get coin incubated get code incubated and incubator and kernel also and I think that there's also an opportunity there to to to sort of be a a progenator of projects that go through both accelerators and so so yeah maybe that's what the the relationship will look like over time but um in the meantime just just looking forward to vibing with you on on regen stuff and impact owls and uh and we can take it from there yeah I love it you know folks are applications are opening on August 1st but that also allows for people to come in and actually see who's applied at comments help up vote help us choose the next team club cohort so if you want to get an early look at some of the most exciting you know Dows and Community token projects you can do that it's at accelerator.c club.xyz you need to hold 10 Club tokens to participate but we'll make that pretty easy for you if you're looking to do it so yeah thanks Kevin really appreciate your time in yeah definitely okay so that you can go to accelerator.c Club in order to apply and then where can people find you online uh what's your what's your Twitter handle I'm that tall guy in C Club HQ for the C Club account I'm really I mean do we meet in person briefly yeah yeah I don't actually know who's taller I'm not flexing it on my Twitter my Twitter handle but uh then obviously I am I don't know Kevin yeah yeah you're definitely LARPing taller than me but uh we're well looking forward to to seeing seed Club grow and thanks again for being on the podcast appreciate it thank you [Music]
