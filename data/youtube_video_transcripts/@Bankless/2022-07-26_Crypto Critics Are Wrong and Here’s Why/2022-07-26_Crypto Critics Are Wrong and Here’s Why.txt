if you're into crypto you're not using crypto can't criticize something you don't understand I've spent a lot of time working with defy and smart contract protocols and kind of learning about the space and who's doing what I thought I was pretty well versed I've been I've taught classes on blockchain and cryptocurrency but my knowledge kind of was a little out of date and when I caught up with it I realized I'm living in the past this is not how things work anymore so somebody who was very familiar with the basics of blockchains in 2015 would think oh Bitcoin ethereum immutable you can't reverse transactions but this is not true anymore right like we're way past that we're technologically that's like talking about the internet in 1990 and you know it's 2010 things are different now and you have to be very very closely this is actually one of the problems with being anti-crypto
