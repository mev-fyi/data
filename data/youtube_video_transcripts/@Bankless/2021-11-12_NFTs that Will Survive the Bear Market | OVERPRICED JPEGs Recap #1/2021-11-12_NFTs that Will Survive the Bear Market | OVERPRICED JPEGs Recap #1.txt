hello hello everyone welcome to overpriced jpegs the show about the metaverse about nfts about why the [ __ ] some jpegs are worth more than your house i am carly riley and this is our inaugural episode we are going to get right into things today but i i do just want to first give people a little bit of sense a little bit of a sense as to why i'm doing this show i think it can be put quite simply which is i want to make us all rich i mean i'm sort of kidding about that but but not really at all uh i do want to make us rich and i don't think it's going to happen overnight i don't have that power i am not in this for the shirt short term but i want to make us all rich in the long term i still have so much to learn about this space so much i'm excited to learn about this space and i really believe that if we put the time in week after week to follow what's going on to dive deeper to understand what's happening we'll get smart and ultimately we'll make money i also think this technology is really exciting and i want to help change the world and yada yada all that good stuff uh we'll talk more about all of this as this show progresses but for now i wanna i wanna dive in here's what we're talking about today uh we're gonna talk about which nft project is weathering this bear market right now better than the rest and why why this project is doing well i want to tell you the story behind the war between crypto punks and crypto funks if this is something you have not been following why it matters for this space in general punk 2476 and zeneca33 two nft influencers that i love on ins on twitter have both launched nft projects this past week and both projects seem to be aimed at helping them sort through all of the new projects entering the space that want their attention they've taken different approaches both interesting we'll talk about it and discord is stuck between a rock and a hard place and by rock and hard place i mean between gamers and web web3 who will win the battle we'll talk about that and i'll give some thoughts on the metaverse and that'll be the show so here we go everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axiomfinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse xerion is the perfect place to view the entirety of your crypto portfolio all in one spot not only does xerion aggregate all the tokens across all of your wallets but it also displays the nfts that you've been tirelessly collecting xerion even reports the value of your nfts in your overall portfolio giving you the most comprehensive report on the entirety of your crypto portfolio xerion isn't just a place to get an understanding of your portfolio but it also hooks into defy activities like trading borrowing and lending all in one convenient place so you don't have to memorize all the various defi websites to do all of your default activities to get started go to xerion.io bankless and load up your wallet or wallets into the xerion interface and supercharge your defy experience and enrich your nft lifestyle that's z-e-r-i-o-n bankless we are going to start with nft stats and the updates i pull from zenica33 great influencer in the nft space uh you can follow him on twitter at zenica33 and he has a google sheet that tracks on a daily basis how different and different nft projects are doing uh specifically from a floor price standpoint i'm not necessarily someone who thinks you should track floor price every day in fact i i think you shouldn't worry too much about floor price on a day-to-day basis i believe in long-term investing but hey we're doing this show weekly and we want to look at what's going on because over time the projects that are succeeding or not it becomes instructive uh so i think if you're in the nft space you are aware that nfts are down we are definitely in a bear market are we at the bottom i don't know is this the next nft winter will it be a two year long period of hibernation like it was last time i don't know i think probably not is the answer uh but definitely projects are down across the board what's interesting is if you look at newer projects and older projects both are are down but the newer projects are more likely to be sitting around mint price whereas the older projects may be down from their highs or down on the week but still are significantly higher than where you would have minted those projects so there's definitely strength in being an og right now during this projects that launched more recently are struggling in this market i wanted to highlight one project in particular though that i think is interesting zedeka shouted this out as well byo pills bio pills this is a project that has seemed somewhat immune to the broader bear market happening they they launched atom with a mint price of 0.06 eth right now the floor is around 0.25 they haven't seemed to struggle during this bear market the way other projects have so dove into that a little bit it's a project i looked at uh probably a month ago a couple months ago and i it was interesting but i didn't quite get it for those who aren't familiar with bio pills it's a it's 10 000 nfts that are pills different colored pills generated there are traits etc but it's not a project with fancy art by any means and the project calls itself metaverse consumables which i think is partly why it didn't strike me out the gate like what is a metaverse consumable right like i understand the benefit of an edible in the real world but what does this really mean when it comes to the metaverse i think since a couple months ago when i was looking into the project we've gotten some more clarity on that and i think that clarity also helps to explain why this project has done well recently for one thing they've announced a partnership with a game that will be using these bio pills as like power-ups and um boosts within this game so that helped me to understand okay you're talking about within games within four particular avatars these might be able to get you give you you know boosts and power-ups in various ways um that are common in video games so that's really interesting um they also just announced i believe this week that they are going to be launching their bio crafts which are these vehicles as part of this whole byo universe they call it the bioverse and i think that has has really been part of what has has caused the spike recently in their floor price so the takeaway here really specifics aside are that this is a unique project it's innovative and they are really executing on their roadmap right now so not that they're the only project necessarily doing that but as we're looking at why has this project managed to stay afloat when so many others are struggling right now i do think you have to look at those factors i will also say i they are a project who seems to have conviction and i'll give an example of what i mean by that but i find that really appealing in projects uh now you know people could fool me and and seem like they're having conviction when they don't but the example i'll give with with bio pills uh the project is that if you if you look on their website and look at their road map um they were very clear this is a small thing but they were very clear that they were not going to do a delayed reveal that once you bought your bio pill once you minted it it would be an instant reveal and they they said specifically like we don't believe in delayed reveals and they said that quite strongly and the reason that strikes me is a lot of projects do delay reveals the reason for that is projects want to make sure that the metadata is okay once people start minting you just you you want a little time as the project creators to take a beat make sure everything's okay it buys you a little time to deal with the metadata so there's something very confident about having an instant reveal right and that's interesting when you say we don't believe in instant reveals or we don't believe in delayed reveals it also just says to me you have a point of view and you have an opinion about this space in a way that i i like i like when people take strong stances the other comparison i'll give is creature nfts i will say i'm a holder of creatures i am not a holder of byo pills bio pills i don't know which is how you pronounce it um creatures very early on after the mint a lot of people were asking when are you going to be on rarity tools when are you going to be in rarity tools for folks who don't know what rarity tools is it's a site that where you can go and look at different projects and look at how rare different nfts within the project are and so people use that loosely as a way to value different nfts within a particular nft collection so people were asking creatures when are you going to get on rarity tools because that's what all projects do and danny cole the founder of creatures was like never like we will never be on rarity tools creatures are rare because you love your creature essentially [ __ ] all the way off i don't believe in this and i loved that i love founding teams with a point of view who care because what that conviction says to me is we care about this project and we are making strong decisions as a result of that and what i'm looking for in an nft project is a is a strong team so that's my my rant lord knows next week bio pills could be down this is not to say go out and buy bio pills but it is to take a deeper dive uh in a project that seems to be doing quite well when when many others are struggling so take take from that what you will make of that what you will uh that is some of the updates from what we're seeing this week in nfts there was a scandal in nft land this week well i should say it's been an ongoing scandal that every so often i think emerges into the twitter sphere and that is what i want to talk about next and that is the ongoing battle i'll call it between crypto funks and crypto punks i'm sure everyone listening to this presumably knows what crypto punks are they get considered really like the first nft project they are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the low end and millions of dollars on the high end they get a lot of credit for being like the genesis nft project jay-z famously made his crypto punk his avatar on twitter right these are uh a big deal found created by by the team larva labs crypto funks in the meantime is a project that was launched as a parody of crypto punks and basically it's the exact same avatars they they look exactly like crypto punks except the head instead of being turned to the right as it is in crypto punks the head of the punks are turned to the left i guess for the crypto funks i may have that switched around but bottom line is it's just like a turn of the head and so there's a lot of questions around okay is this copyright infringement like this is such derivative cheap artwork should this be worth anything [Music] the reality is all of this would probably be a big nothing and nobody would really care and people probably wouldn't be that interested in funks except that back in july crypto punks larval labs the team behind crypto punks went after crypto funks for like ip infringement and was able to successfully get crypto funks delisted from all the major nft marketplaces so openc specifically delisted them others did the same and that triggered this community movement that was like we stand for freedom of expression we stand for the market being able to make a determination about whether or not funks are are worth something and it really catapulted the funks into suddenly being a relevant project in ways that previously it really hadn't been there's also a whole scandal where the original crypto funk's founder rug pulled the community then the project was handed over to the community which gave it new life similar to fame lady squad if anybody's followed that story um i'm i'm conflicted on the punk funk drama uh i think i i'll i'll lay out the the two perspectives here uh and i'm i'm pulling from some notes because we have a i have some tweets that i want to refer to on the pro funk's side the argument is this project has clearly been a parody from the start at no point were we trying to deceive people into buying our project thinking that they were punks we are not selling a gucci bag pretending it's really a gucci bag when we're actually a knockoff all along this was meant really as a joke and and they're saying so from that standpoint like i guess essentially take a joke um they also are making this point around hey we say in the blockchain space that provenance is really important that is the origin story of the nft and providence is important because you can see provenance represented on the blockchain so it's very clear that crypto funks are not crypto punks because it's it's on the it's on chain and you can you can see the difference of these two projects and they're saying if that's what we're claiming in this blockchain space then and that's the benefit of the blockchain then why are we trying to apply web 2.0 rules where we get lawyers involved then we have to have these legal battles because we can't things aren't as open and transparent why are we applying those rules to the web three space okay on the anti-funk's side i think the strongest proponent of this that i've seen the strong proponent of the anti-funk's crew is jim mcnielis he goes by jimmy on jimmy.eth on twitter jimmy with a with a one he's pretty well known he's a super og in this space and he has come out really strong against funks he he had a tweet this week that said if you support funks you support right click save people right as in folks who argue that nfts are just something you can like why bother having an nft i could just take this picture right click save it and have it myself i will say jimmy is a technology purist so to help to understand his perspective on this and why he's so offended by what he sees as like derivative art getting attention and having people buy it uh jimmy started the project avastar's he in doing so really foresaw the pfp trend that was going to happen he was incredibly forward thinking in that way and avastar's all of the artwork all of the metadata all of the information about avastar's is on chain which is which is distinct from many many projects who keep the art for example in ipfs they most projects keep art and metadata of various sorts in um databases that aren't on chain whereas avastar's all of that lives on the blockchain for anyone to see and it's something that jimmy feels really proud of and really feels very strongly about for good reason avastar's also has something called the replicant factory which is uh you're going to be able to take very soon take two avastars breed them essentially and create a a new generation of avistars all of that is also happening on chain which means that whole process is being run only through the smart contract it's trustless right you don't you're not trusting the team to execute it it'll all happen within the smart contract it's incredibly sophisticated technology it's really impressive what they're doing and so i respect jimmy's perspective when he is then i would say offended by projects who don't understand that technology and who he sees as like derivative ripoff projects um that are kind of spitting in the face of what he sees the nft world as as being supposed to represent um my takes on all of this are essentially that i wouldn't buy a funk i wouldn't buy a crypto funk this is because i think the entire surge of the funks has come about because the community sees it as a middle finger to institutions to web 2 to middle men to centralization et cetera et cetera and i don't think you can you're they're going to be able to build a long-term movement on that because i think there will always be a new project that can be a way to give a middle finger and because over time they're not going to be able to strike brand deals they're not be able to they're not going to be able to grow the brand in any sort of i hate to say it but like mainstream way because they do have because larval labs does have a legal case against them essentially so it's going to be very hard to continue to bring value in my opinion in the crypto funk's universe it's mostly about being a part of a community that's giving a middle finger so certainly not something i'd be interested in owning for that reason i also think and the funk people may not like to hear this but as web 3 gets bigger and more mainstream and as as it becomes what we all want it to be it's not going to be able to stay the kind of the the purity centralization though it's not pure decentralization now right but the pure decentralization uh like power to the people movement that that people want it to be and i know folks are not gonna love to hear about that but the reality is like for brands and more individuals to get comfortable in this space there's going to have to be relics from call it the old world right legal infrastructure to support artists who have their projects being ripped off we have to be able to support creators who are creating work and and there has to be enforcement mechanisms around that so uh i am grateful for this controversy for what it's raising in terms of the conversation in terms of the discourse uh i don't mind that funks are doing what they're doing because i think it's it's an interesting question that they're raising but i certainly wouldn't buy them and i think in the long term the space is benefited by having a certain amount of legal recourse for artists whose work is ripped off okay we have two there are two nft influencers that i love that have both dropped projects this week so i wanted to talk about them also because they are similar in terms of their goal the first project is by punk2476 that is the nft influencer formerly known as artchik uh i love punk2476 it's still hard for me not to call her arctic also no shade trying to be thrown here but art chick is just an easier thing to remember and like better personal branding i think than punk2476 which is just much more of a mouthful but it is what it is um punk2476 in her own words stealth launched a token project this past week it's really interesting sh the the goal is to allow people who want arctic sorry who want punk2476 to review their nft projects a way to get her attention and to help her sift through all the noise that isn't just dming her so i will say i am hardly i am not at all an influencer in this space at this point and i have people who hit me up and ask me how do i get influencers to notice my project how do i get influencers to promote my project my nft project right how do i get attention in this space so i can only imagine how often punk2476 gets hit up for something like this people asking her to show their project to promote their project i'm sure that her dms are flooded with this all the time so this nft drop that she launched this week was her answer to that and it's really interesting and creative essentially uh the way her project works is you you get these they're called 2476 coins and you stake them into a smart contract run by 2476's team or herself and the the the staking is associated with a twitter handle so somebody it's clear whose twitter handle is doing the staking essentially of these tokens and arctic and her team punk2476 and her team will review the twitter handle uh for whoever staked these coins review their project and determine if it's something that punk2476 wants to talk about if it's a project she wants to promote so what's important to note here is that staking these coins do not guarantee you promotion it's not guarantee you that art chick will oh my gosh this is hard why is this so hard for me it will not guarantee you that punk 2476 will promote you but it is a way to get on her radar and the point that she would make about this is that the point that she has made about this is it's also transparent and on chain so her point is look paid promotions by nft influencers are happening right now whether you want to know it or not we like to think of this space as being so authentic and nobody's getting paid to promote anything i've actually even thought that before recently and her point is no no there is paid promotion happening but the problem with paid promotion is when it's really sleazy and hushed up and you don't realize you're being promoted to by somebody who's been paid this now you can go you can see who's staking these tokens it's on chain it's transparent it's everything that this community believes in and she's really up front when she starts promoting something that she found through through the staging contract i think it's really interesting um i i'll be curious to see if other nft influencers adopt this stance again increasingly as we move into the mainstream with all of this and maybe that's two years five years ten years down the line i don't know i imagine it'll be more it'll happen faster than that but you know i'm having a hard time thinking of like red bull staking coins into a contract to get archic's attention oh my god punk2476's attention but uh but i could totally be wrong about that either way innovative interesting i love it zenica 33 who i mentioned earlier in this episode is also had an nft drop this week that was aimed around how does he figure out what projects to pay attention to we have a common theme here you have nft influencers who are getting hit up all the time by people wanting them to show their project to review their project give feedback et cetera et cetera how do you sort through all this noise zenica's approach i would say is feels a little bit more straightforward than punk 2476 is uh zeneca basically launched an nft that has two tiers there's a uh more affordable tier uh where you can buy in and you get to join his discord community which is a token gated community you need one of these tokens to get in you'll be a part of his his kind of crowd you can see what he posts he'll put alpha in there etc pretty basic transaction at the the more expensive end of his drop you he's i think issuing 333 nfts at a price of like 3.33 eth or or something along those lines and um those are going to be people who get specialized attention from zenica33 so they'll be in a special exclusive discord channel you can get you can ask him for advice you can show him in your project he'll maybe hop on a call with you so it's basically a way to sell his consulting services uh using nfts and again sort through the noise of all the people hitting him up for for various needs again i think it's awesome i think it's cool i like projects with clear utility to them where you really understand what the value prop is what you're getting i am excited to say that i've had a conversation with seneca 33 that we will be publishing through this podcast in a couple of weeks so you can hear more about this directly from him seneca's a huge i think wealth of insight into this space so we'll continue to track what's happening with these two projects as well as how other influencers are handling this um but i really respect both those two and i'm excited for them okay closing out the day here we have i feel like we need to say something on the metaverse the the zuckerberg metaverse you know meta news is a little bit old at this point but i didn't have a podcast when he announced the meta news so we didn't get to talk about it i spent some time this past week and watched the 80-minute video that zuckerberg and i guess now meta released talking about what the metaverse is and and what they think it will be people are obviously very very hesitant that zuckerberg is at the helm of creating the metaverse people a lot of people have bad taste in their mouth from facebook for good reasons from zuckerberg there are a lot of comparisons made to ready player one and the uh sort of mega villainous like company that is trying to take over the metaverse and ready player one they see similarities to zuckerberg and all of that i i i hear all of that i agree i think um zuckerberg in his 80 minute video did at least pay lip service to everything that we as a community would want to hear in terms of saying that he wants interoperability that is like he wants people who are in the facebook metaverse or the meta metaverse to easily be able to go into another metaverse and take all of their items with it so this wouldn't be just a closed space where if you own something within the meta metaverse it can only live within the meta metaverse uh so again he paid lip service to all that i think we take that with a grain of salt really the big thing that struck me as i was watching it was i mean holy [ __ ] this will happen whether it's meta that is leading the charge or another company microsoft announced they have metaverse initiatives going on um or if it's a truly open integrated metaverse through multiple smaller players decentraland it's the sandbox cryptovoxels the metaverse is coming and that's when nfts truly explode i mean it's just so obvious when you think how much time we'll be spending in digital worlds even if it's not more time than we're spending now it is different time in the sense that we'll be in each other's digital rooms and digital spaces and we as humans want to signal who we are in our digital spaces in our in our physical spaces right and in our digital spaces so nfts are are so clearly here to say and it's going to be incredible what happens to this space when the metaverse becomes increasingly a reality so perhaps stating the obvious but it did strike me anew as i watched that 80-minute zuckerberg meta video final news i want to close with discord and and discord i guess ceo jason citron posted on twitter uh an image that seemed to look like metamask integration with discord and he said probably nothing right he made a joke the expectation of course the the implication here being that at some point it looks like we might get metamask integration with discord which would be great for people who are in nft communities it means we don't have to deal with like annoying buggy bots like collab land or just bots with limitations like collab land to like token gate our communities it might be much more streamlined than that very exciting from my perspective there was intense pushback from the gaming community again for anybody who's maybe listening to this my mom who does not know uh discord is an online you know is a chat app that is basically comprised of two big communities it's it's used by gamers and it's used by like nft crypto people and there are lots and lots of gamers who don't like nfts who don't like the idea that or who do strongly disagree that nfts are going to take over the gaming world i'm not going to comment on that right now i'm not a gamer myself i'm doing a lot at the moment to understand the gaming world better and understand nfts and gaming so i can be more well spoken on it but gamers push back hard to jason citron and this this idea that there might be metamask integration with discord and so jason sort of came out and was like well hold on hold on we're not doing this quite yet this is an internal thing we're playing around with please don't you know please don't attack me will be interesting to see what happens there i think it's inevitable i i think we will get metamask integration with discord the the power of nfts what's happening in cryptocurrencies the reasons for it to move forward and progress are just too too strong so uh companies that are fighting it not that discord is but companies that are are fighting that uh i i believe will ultimately lose so i think we will get metamask integration into discord or we'll just get a brand new platform that people are using for nfts and cryptocurrency but it is interesting to see the gaming community push back as hard as they are on that announcement that's it y'all that's the week so far please i would really love your feedback on this i moved quickly mostly because i feel like when somebody is doing a solo podcast you want it to move uh it's very hard to do a solo podcast like sitting here just talking to a microphone without anybody to bounce off of i'm learning how to do it i'm learning how to do it well uh i might not be there yet so this is all to say please please give me your feedback tell me what topics you thought were interesting what you thought weren't interesting tell me where you need more explanation where i talked for too long and belabored the point would really really love to make this something that's useful to you all um i just want to make us rich guys that's i've said this before i don't want to do it overnight because i quite literally can't do it overnight but i want to do it over time and i think as we get smarter about this space as we track trends in this space and we do it over the long term inevitably we're going to do pretty well so thanks for being on this journey with me thanks for tuning in and i'll talk to you all again next week oh this episode should be airing uh on friday tomorrow which will be saturday i have my very first interview coming out i interviewed benny betty nft she's the co-creator behind the dead fellas project i'm so excited to have got to talk to her one goal i have is to interview a representative from every nft project on zenica 33's nft stats list i think it's really helpful to understand this space by understanding the people behind the various projects in it and it'll just get us smarter make us smarter and more discerning about what projects we like and what we don't so please please tune in to that it'll be both on the bankless rss feed as well as the overpriced jpegs rss feed and uh also if you liked this or even like if you didn't like it but you think and you but you like pity me if you could subscribe to this podcast and give it a rating i would really really appreciate that um i i'm in this for the
