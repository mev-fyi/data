[Music] hey hey and welcome to green pill today i've got a medley of contributors from get coin dao to talk about grants round 13 and how you can use get coin grants to fund your project this is an experiment in a new format in which we have dao contributors from impact dial projects coming in to provide a 360 view of the impact their project is having it's also kind of a deeply personal episode for me because i'm one of the co-founders of git coin and i get to show off my life's work at get coin and how it can help you a web 3 enthusiast raise money for what you're doing or discover the next project that you want to get involved in so i don't generally like to talk my own book but we tried to orient this episode around other contributors to get coined out and the benefit that get coin down bitcoin grants round 13 can have to you the listener with the start of grants around 13 on march 9th so without further ado i give you git coin dow talking about grants around 13. [Music] all right welcome to greenfield i am here with the get coin crew to talk about get coin grants round 13 which starts march 9th welcome lindsay thrift and kevin olsen who are vp product and vp engineering at get coin respectively welcome to scott moore and annika lewis scott is a co-founder of get coin going back with me since 2017 2018 uh and scott and annika are both work stream leads at the get coin dao public goods funding work stream hey kevin good to be here hey y'all glad to have you here and then finally sean mcmanus of the memes merch in marketing work stream at get coindao is here sean what's up hello great to be here great to have you so i've assembled this crew to talk about git coin grants round 13 lucky number 13 which is a way that you can get funding for your impact project grants round 13 is coming up annika what is grants around 13 and how can it help founders in the space yes so grants around 13 is our quarterly public goods funding event that we hold at the get coin dow grants around 13 will feature over three million dollars in matching funds for early stage projects uh in web 3 and beyond and so effectively grants around 13 is a way for projects to get funding in order to advance their their public good that they are building and bringing into the world and so this is the event that we run every three months um grants around 12 which was our last grants round generated over 6 million in public goods funding for early stage projects and we're excited for grants around 13 which we hope to be even bigger and better than grants around 12. cool speaking of bigger and better what are the what are the stats how big is the grants around how much money is going to be flowing around do we think yeah so we currently have three million dollars committed in matching funds from our generous matching funders so thank you all for for coming on board there we've got nine different ecosystem rounds so different web 3 ecosystems that are really looking to use public goods funding to build their ecosystems and grow their communities and in addition we also have three cause rounds this time around so beyond web 3 we are starting to support social causes and we've got rounds around climate change human longevity and also a special round this time around for ukraine which we'll talk a little bit more about later awesome scott i'm wondering if you could take us a deep dive on how quadratic funding works and why it's so powerful for allocating those millions of dollars in matching funding absolutely and i think actually what's super important about the way quadratic funding works which annika kind of mentioned is that it can be used for really any cause we don't need this to be something just for web 3 it can be something for the world and public kids at large and that's something that i think is going to be an increasing theme probably even throughout uh what we're talking about today but ultimately quadratic funding is just a democratic way to allocate a matching pool according to the preferences of a given community so the goal is to understand what do people care about and why do they care about it and most importantly how much do they care about it with their actual dollars being a metric for how much is actually distributed from matching funders so as annika mentioned we have three million dollars in the pool from a generous group of donors we have dns urine uh the ethereum foundation has historically been one of our largest supporters and a host of others including actually even some just large anonymous individuals who have been willing to donate to our causes and to republicans at large and the way it works essentially is that you can imagine uh over well you won't have to in a second we'll do this round actually over the next two weeks but over the two-week period a number of people will donate ideally um and usually i think it's in the range of anakin correctly around now 50 000 or so people um which is honestly staggering to me considering uh what we we're looking at in grants around one and two but ultimately that group is deciding where the matching pool funds go so basically over those 50 000 donations we're learning effectively what people care about and we're kind of like effectively donating those funds according to those preferences so um i'll pause there but hopefully that helps i will burst your bubble scott and say it was 27 000 unique contributors back in gr12 but hopefully we can hit that 50k number this grants around 13. let's go what i think is so cool about quadratic funding which is an idea from vitalik buter and glenn weil is that the preferences of the poor and the many matter more than the rich and the few so if two grants raised the same amount of money but the second grant raised it from way more contributors that second grant will get way more of the matching funds so we've built a matching algorithm to distribute that three million dollars ish based off of the preferences of the little people in the ecosystem relative to bag size so i think that's what is really exciting about quadratic funding to me um how can we use quad so say you're a d5 founder nft founder or founder working on a project in the space how can you leverage grants round 13 in order to get funding for your project yeah and on the grantee side so in order to get funding you can go to get coin dot co slash grants and click on the application there's a grant application you can walk through it's pretty straightforward much simpler than your typical charity grant application for those of you who are familiar with the not for profit space um but go on there check out the eligibility policies for the different rounds uh and apply for a grant and it's definitely not too late to apply for grants around 13 there's still lots of time so on the grantee side that is where to get started if you are a project that is looking to build your ecosystem and grow your community and give back to public goods generally speaking you can also come on board as a matching funder it's not too late for that either so definitely reach out to us if that's of interest and finally if you're just you know a web 3 citizen like like all of us and interested in you know seeing certain projects advance definitely you know exercise your your vote in quadratic funding so as scott mentioned quadratic funding is effectively voting with your dollars on where you want to see the matching pool funds go across all of these thousands of projects so definitely go to get coin.com grants browse through the interview interface see what's there and contribute to public goods because public goods are good public goods are good so speaking of the grants around 13 round i'm noticing that we've kind of grown the main round the ethereum round vertically over the the first couple rounds of bitcoin grants and now we're expanding out into doing d5 ecosystem rounds and uh longevity rounds and climate change rounds and the one that that piqued my interest here is the growth of a ukraine round which is obviously a very hot topic right now can we talk a little bit about the ukraine round and what kind of grants are going to be in that what those funds can be used for yeah absolutely so the ukraine round arose actually out of an immediate need and i think anyone listening uh is probably familiar with the crisis that's arisen there over the past few it feels like months but actually i think it's even a little bit less time than that since everything sort of emerged and we had a lot of matching funders reach out to us figuring out you know they want to support effectively as much as they can and i think everyone does right now um and they wanted to figure out what the most effective way was to do that and ultimately we decided that based on what we'd seen with other projects we've worked with um i personally have been helping a little bit with unchained fund i know other folks have been helping out with things like ukraine dow we wanted to figure out how we can rally the bitcoin community towards projects that are effectively on the ground doing work directly around humanitarian aid and around journalistic freedom uh in this in this case so we have a number of projects that are specifically from groups like the giving block who have been doing really great work towards this cause over the last uh even i'd say you know six months to a year on the ground in various regions and we have another group of projects from endowment which i would shout out to as a very kind of cool uh i guess almost fiscal host for a lot of these projects the other groups of projects are actually on the ground emergent projects that arose from the crypto ecosystem directly so ukraine dao being one of those on chain fund being one of those and again our focus is on non-military uh humanitarian aid instead of focusing on sort of what role anyone should be taking in the conflict itself but the support from matching funders has been massive uh we've about 700 000 committed so far and we're hoping to see that grow up to hopefully a million by the time the round ends amazing such an important cause and a novel use of crypto in order to support uh those who are suffering because of the war in ukraine thanks scott so it seems like bitcoin grants is growing out horizontally from the main ethereum round and then growing out to ecosystem rounds and then cause rounds i'm curious and after grants round 13 it seems like these these rounds run every every single quarter say in grants round 14 i'm building a project and i want to leverage quadratic funding in order to help build the ecosystem around my project sean uh can you say a little bit more about the offering that bitcoin is giving to d5 founders and to project founders around growing ecosystems with quadratic funding definitely yeah so we recently announced git coin aqueduct which is a way for ecosystem builders to implement quadratic funding with a single line of solidity code so it essentially allows you to solve for two things one is supporting your builder community and the second is around building a strong and sustainable ecosystem we're really excited that tally has decided to partner up with us and become one of our first partners for aqueduct tally wallet is creating an open source wallet for uh that is like community owned and that value is very important to them and so they've instantiated this aqueduct um even prior to the formation of their token and of their doubt all right very cool so one of the things i think is really neat is how as quadratic funding grows how the matching pool kind of just stacks as more and more causes and ecosystems are added to get coin and we've seen that on bitcoin grants because of quadratic funding the um like a one dollar contribution can be worth a hundred dollars in matching coin center even had a thousand dollars in matching for a one dollar contribution because of quadratic funding and i think that's because in grants around 12 it was in the the the main round and it was also in one of the side rounds at once so we saw this kind of like effect where one round is like a crypto economic is like a fan that creates a force for funding public goods but when you stack the rounds on top of each other it's like a jet engine that creates this insane matching multiple and so you're saying that founders can email founders at founders of of projects can email founders at getcoin.co and get hooked up with their own quadratic funding round that way is that right sean yeah so if any ecosystem partners are looking to create an aqueduct in order to automate their public goods funding going forward and plan it into their their general quarterly rounds they can go ahead and email us at founders gitcoin.com and we can help take you through the next steps thanks sean so uh scott since uh you're my co-founder from back in the day on git coin i want to talk zoom out a little bit and i want to talk a little bit about the mission of get coin what is git coin why do we run these rounds what do we believe that causes us to work on this insane quadratic funding formula and to organize these rounds so uh i guess i'll just i'll just ask this what is the mission of bitcoin and how does it drive what we do i i feel like it's actually being the central point the north star of what we've done for so long and it's kind of amazing because when you look at a lot of organizations as they shift towards dows they often change there's often changes in priorities changes in uh sort of focus and i think we've always been focused on impact and focused on trying to grow and sustain public goods throughout web 3 to start admittedly and now of course kind of expanding into republicans in the real world uh the physical world as well and that sort of mission of growing and sustaining uh public goods especially digital public kids has been sort of a center point in this larger picture of creating impact and i actually think you've done a really good job of framing what it is that we mean by impact and what it means for a dow to be kind of an impact dow and i would highly recommend actually people check out a post on the bitcoin forum gov.goodcoin.com that kind of goes through some of these pieces in terms of what it means to create impact and how we can actually kind of in the way that we were talking about with these different rounds stack together impact from different like pluralistic values to create one sort of larger scale almost uh you know transformer-esque uh you know sort of uh you know megazord type structure i think that my reference might be a bit dated for folks now but the idea though of kind of creating that that structure and acting as almost a shelling point right for these sorts of different pluralistic values to come together and and act in one sort of consistent way i think is really important because it's actually and it's very timely in the context of the the situation in ukraine it's something we've seen nation states and these even supernational bodies fail to do for so long and that's that's actually kind of coming to a head now with crypto donations to ukraine in the context of uh crypto actually in many cases donating more than other un bodies or rather larger institutional bodies in the real world and it's actually something that um to me makes me very optimistic for the future versus i think it's very easy to get kind of bogged down and pessimism in that sort of framing of things but we have these global coordination tools and i think it's possible for us to look at sort of this you know kind of kernel the mission of growing and sustaining open source software and digital public goods and how that's blossomed into this broader vision of impact across these different pluralistic you know overlapping circles or communities sort of as as you called them and it's really interesting just to see how that's sort of been a its own sort of way to solve global coordination problems in a way that wasn't possible uh before so yeah i'll pause there but i think that's a really important kind of mission and i'm glad to be supporting it so we started off funding open source software and have since diversified into a more pluralistic view of public goods all sort of public goods are good and luckily quadratic funding which worked on open source works in all these other ecosystems and one of the things that i think that we've really been trying to design and to get coin from the start is to be a channel where greater combinations of strength and intelligence can come together to coordinate these outcomes for public goods and um one of the things that i want to zero in on there is that credible neutrality so it's not scott's preferences or kevin's preferences that inform what get funded and and part of the reason why we're doing this episode on bankless and on greenpild is to get people to come out here and express their preferences of what they want to see funded and even a dollar makes it makes an impact uh well this is a crypto podcast so even a die makes an impact and and i want to talk about that credible neutrality so we're trying to build a vessel for those greater combination of strength and intelligence to come together and that was kind of the idea behind the launch of git coindao which is a more credibly neutral institution to shepherd forward our values can you tell us about git coin dow and sort of how that credible neutrality is important in how bitcoin is governed yeah absolutely and i'd love to hear actually annika's take specifically on sort of the public goods funding workstream's role in this but my view just very quickly is that ultimately the dow is in a sense this kind of culmination of these different pluralistic communities which have all come together you know right now sort of under one banner but increasingly under a constellation of banners to push forward this mission of digital public goods and broader public goods in the world at large the i can i think principles sort of thing to think about is just how does a dao actually operate a dao is kind of a non-hierarchical um you know individual contributor initiative based way to kind of come to consensus about and start to execute on like a given north star mission ideally in my view the mission is actually a key part there's lots of doubts that like don't have a key mission and i think those will tend to over time do worse than daz where there is that central mission so ultimately to me i think the vessel comment that you made is actually very accurate the dow is a kind of vessel for pushing forward public goods and it's a vessel that's coming together from many different work streams that have kind of emerged relatively organically and relatively kind of swiftly to think of different ways to solve this broader sprouted problem and it's almost i think the most emblematic example of how this has come together is almost the broader refi movement which i think at this point is honestly well beyond kevin like when as far as i understand you like kind of came up with the name of regenerative finance like two years or so ago and it started to sort of slowly propagate it's nice of you to say but the regen network i just have to say was way before me i've gotten involved in propagating it yeah that's true greg greg actually yeah shout out to greg um who's been i think honestly one of the most pro yeah probably even i forgot about regen network sort of like being the first in that in that place and i think that um the work that they're doing both in cosmos and beyond is is really important um definitely check out regen network they're also a sponsor i believe for grants around 13 and have been a huge supporter the um that broader pluralistic sort of i guess structuring of these these uh these work streams from the ground up though is i think really what it comes down to um but i would love actually yeah before i keep kind of going on about it rambling a bit anacai would love your thoughts uh about from the pgf side how we're thinking about this yeah i would say overall big plus one on everything you said around kind of the dow and the intent there and the structure i think from a public kids funding perspective you know it's been really interesting to see since first getting involved with the dow kind of early last summer to to now and seeing you know how grants is run in a more downnative way we definitely still have a ways to go i think initially you know having some of the grants program centralized and kind of starting to stand things up and going from zero to one um was was probably the right structure back then but now as kevin said you know we really want to move towards a world of more credibly neutral systems and kind of you know consent based governance at scale and just bringing in the community to decide how we run these rounds as opposed to it being done kind of top-down hand of god from from one or two people uh in a centralized way so very tactically for us in the public goods funding work stream you know that has meant over time doing a lot more kind of public-facing governance posts and snapshot votes around the structure of the round and bringing in the community to make those types of decisions we definitely still have a long way to go in terms of getting to the level of decentralization that we would like to but it's all coordination uh the process is iterative and we're definitely on our way there so really excited for what the future of the dow holds in terms of these grants programs and executing on the big vision that we have ahead totally so we're a coordination tool for the ecosystem that is itself trying to coordinate into becoming a dow at this time certainly yep one of the fun things that i think about that is okay so bitcoin grants is on its third 13th round the first one was in january 2019 totally run centralized and then in may of 2021 we launched gtc which is the governance token governs how we handle fraud on the network how we size and allocate the rounds and so we started to decentralize the governance and with the launch of the bitcoin dow in gtc gtc is a governance token and there's there's different layers of decentralization that we've been working on as we embark on this long journey of turning a company into a dow or i guess the grants part of the company into the dow and then turning our centralized platform into a protocol so um i want to end by talking a little bit about grant's 2.0 and our vision to turn bitcoin grants into a credibly neutral protocol and the decentralization i think that's the kind of like feather in our cap when it comes to really becoming a doubt and becoming decentralized so kevin olsen and lindsay thrift uh what is grant's 2.0 and why is it important yeah what is grants 2.0 um well it's the version that came after grants 1.00 that's to say that the centralized version of grants that we're running on today um served the purposes we needed at the time when we were figuring out was there a space for quadratic funding where people are going to use this you mentioned at the beginning that vertical scaling that we went through of the main round and now we've had multiple rounds to test out what we've kind of been referring to as horizontal scaling but the testing of all these other rounds now with tally coming on and aqueduct it's super clear to us that there um is an appetite to run your own rounds to to really like hold the future of your own ecosystem and project in your hands and be able to continuously fund and grow that um and very simply grants 1.0 the first centralized version doesn't serve um the purpose of giving everyone the sovereignty they need to run the rounds for their programs and to scale over time so grants 2.0 is our vision to take quadratic funding and really just public goods funding like we're using quadratic funding today but there's multiple other mechanisms existing and emerging that you could use to allocate funds as well so it's our vision for taking public goods funding to the world where there's thousands of run rounds running at any time um and it's really us going from fishing for you giving you a fish um here's what you need to start your project looks like you scaled let's give you three fish to actually just teaching you to fish equipping you with all the tools that you need so we're taking our current product we spent the last three four months or so really going deep on what exists there today what's the problem statements we're solving for what are the domains that have emerged within that product and what goes with us into the future and into the decentralized future so we're headed down a path where we'll have a decentralized protocol that's composed of a few different components which we'll get into in a bit but the spirit of us we want to be fully open source build in a way that marketplace can emerge there can be plug-ins for different mechanisms you can choose how you govern your own rounds bitcoin will have opinions about how we govern ours but that will continue to expand and grow over time um so i don't want to steal too much of the thunder kevin olsen has been a fantastic partner in us figuring out what's this architecture look like but that's our vision let's be decentralized let's give everyone the tools they need to run and govern their own rounds great kevin kevin olsen first off cool name ko uh second off what's grant's 2.0 oh man i mean lindsay that was amazing well done um so it's it's gonna be a couple things right so the first thing we're starting off with is figuring out decentralized identity right and proof of personhood so we're gonna start off with d-pop that's gonna be our first component that we're we're going into um and we're really excited uh kicking that off like next week uh so you know no pressure uh getting going um and then beyond that we're with like these domains that lindsay was talking about we're getting into um kind of the the components we take to run around right so we're getting into like where a grant publisher is sort of the self-sovereign person you build a grant you publish that out onto a decentralized data layer right we're still investigating exactly what that looks like um but then we're building on top of that all of the operations that we bring to bear and making sure that our partners can take that on themselves the round manager and then lastly for the public the grant explorer experience is something that again the round uh owners will be able to kind of customize and uh tailor to their needs so we're really envisioning kind of this end-to-end um what it takes to run around to fund it to make that available to a community and then for folks to explore those and then also to fund them i think a big part of that that i'm excited about to make sure we highlight is that we're really doubling down on the actors in the grants ecosystem right there's like i am a grantee i own my project and by having the grants publisher be its own part of this ecosystem you can take that from round to round you can take your project to any realm that's aligned to the vision and mission of your project and source funding there so today it's stacked in our centralized system but it should stack and spread over time as these rounds scale and then same for round manager if you're a dow that's looking to spin up your own grants program you will be able to decide what mechanisms you use for choosing eligibility what's important and to the values of your of your community how do you want to do that it won't be decided based on the eligibility requirements and the process and practice of git coin we'll still be here to offer best practice and and share with you how we're doing it but you'll have the opportunity to run the rounds you want to whether that's annually weekly monthly whatever you decide works for your ecosystem and then how do you decide who's eligible who gets to participate in that decision making do you have your own token that you're using utility for making those decisions so there'll be so much opportunity for focusing in then on these parties um as they run and then the grant explorer being the interface for the front door that we all have hoping that we create some commonalities so as someone who is a web three citizen going around wanting to allocate your funds to projects you care about you have something you recognize you know how to move about these rounds and allocate your funds where you want them to go all right very cool well uh while i've got you here and we're all public uh doing this in public and building in public i want to raise my hand to this guy and say sorry for building it centralized to start and lindsay and kevin thank you for cleaning up the mess really excited about taking all the things we've learned from grants 1.0 and putting them into grants 2.0 anything else to say about grants 2.0 no man just excited it's going to be a really exciting journey getting to meet a lot of the ecosystem you know so if you're interested come talk to us i mean we have so many people who are building in similar spaces we want to learn from you um you know get in touch cool i would love to just step in and just kind of highlight some of the power i see in grants 2.0 as lindsay and kevin articulated it like there has not been anything like this before as a grantee right so just very tactically like let's say you're building a really early stage d5 project and you want to get grant funding right now you would probably go out to 15 different grant programs and submit 15 different grant applications what the idea of what lindsay and kevin articulated is you could just do one grant application and automatically be routed to all of these different grants rounds that you might be eligible for whether uniswop wants to fund your grant polygon coinbase etc etc um so to me the power here in kind of the protocol and the standardization from a grantee perspective is just massive and i think in the context of you know charity funding grant funding ngos you know all of all of kind of the structures there i don't think we've seen anything quite like this so um major shout out to what you're building here yeah super exciting there's an amazing actually just very quick analogy that i heard which is that the ecosystem rounds are kind of the bays and the main pool and the main round that we're running is the ocean and you can just imagine that these things all eventually flow back to this larger pool i just think it's like really kind of beautiful to think about the way in which this is kind of its own like when we say ecosystem i think we often think mechanically but it is really almost in a ecological sense kind of an ecosystem my cellular almost network of projects that are coming together um just awesome john i saw you were going to jump in sorry about that yeah i also wanted to stress just one thing just to contextualize where we are i think in this funding journey like it's you know most people it's not the first thing that they do that they join web 3 and they start funding public goods this is still a fairly niche thing in the last round we had 26 000 people um donate which is incredible but there's over 21 million metamask wallets right now so right it's still a very very small percentage so i think what's critical is that everyone who does donate and who has done this in the past talks to a few of their friends about it right not just your crypto friends but also some others i would love to see a day when when we have people getting a wallet in order to fund and support public goods all right scott you gave me an idea grants uh grants 2.0 launch party near the ocean just to hit home that ecosystem metaphor you guys know i'm partial to mountains but we can go to a beach for this all right is there anything that i didn't ask that you all want to say about grants around 13 git coin grants and if not we can start to rap maybe the only thing i would quickly mention is that we kind of talked about the dow and i think we talked about the idea of people getting involved but if you really practically do want to help with this mission if you want to see how sort of everything works internally and is made i think it's very there are a few options and i would say one check out gov.bitcoin.com really quickly i kind of mentioned that before but two just check out our discord um discord.ggslash bitcoin uh there's a lot of great stuff happening there from a lot of different people um there's community events i think like multiple times a week across all these different work streams um so i just had to show but uh if you want to get involved definitely check that out for sure come help curate the vibes all right so any other calls to action say you're a project founder looking to set up a grant or looking to discover new projects in the ecosystem where can you go bitcoin.com grants so if you're looking to start one one up click the application button and go through the application process if you're looking to browse you can filter by all sorts of different types of grants and see what public goods you might want to fund in grants around 13. alrighty well thanks so much get coin crew for being on the show and very excited for grants round 13. peace and love [Music] you
