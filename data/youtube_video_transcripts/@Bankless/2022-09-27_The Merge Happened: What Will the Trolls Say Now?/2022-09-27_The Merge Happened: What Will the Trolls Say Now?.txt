what are the trolls going to focus on after the merge is done now that we have proof of sake they're not going to just uh you know wave the right flag right they're going to move on to the next thing if I was a troll I would probably be waving one of two flags so like one of the flags you can wave is obviously that proof of stake is actually bad and the other flag you could wave is that sharding will never happen like if you want to wave the flag of uh sharding never happening then you know there are arguments that you could make about how like the API peer-to-peer networking of data availability sampling is actually complicated and that stuff is uh not gonna happen and actually ethereum is going to hit scalability bottleneck soon and uh blah blah blah blah blah but betting against the ethereum ecosystem's ability to produce technology is something that clearly does not have a very good track record so I think yeah I know if I was a troll I would definitely kind of stick to the ideological side and just try to argue that previous take is bad somehow
