icos oof not great like nft mints oof not great but we have to remember that like that part of the market cycle for financial assets exists before and after crypto and the reason why we don't see it in the in the traditional world is because by the time a traditional Equity IPOs on the stock market all of that speculation by early VCS the first round of financing the second round of financing that's not available to the general public yeah and so this is the naked truth of markets and now it's public and the public is reacting to it is friend.tech good or bad that's the conversation David and I want to have today this is a special episode I think uh an opinion episode getting into some controversy here friend.tech this is an app that has dominated the crypto landscape for the last two weeks kind of exploded on the scene and now it's breaking out into mainstream audiences these are non-crypto audiences so should we Pat ourselves on the back is this a moment for Victory lap and congratulations or do we need to take a moment to more carefully reflect on the consequences of this new financialized social application some questions we're asking today is friend.tech good or bad are financialization and Ponzi games all that crypto can really give to the world is any of this even a correct conclusion or maybe we're just moralizing this whole crypto thing too much these are the conversations I want to have with you today David uh what are your thoughts going to this episode why are we even doing it I think on the surface level friends.tech friend.tech is a fun fun game for crypto influencers and their followers to all kind of play together and I think simultaneously while that you know Shenanigans is happening there's another conversation Brewing as to like what what are the deeper consequences of an application like this if it does scale to the whole mainstream world is this the crypto dream is this what it means to be a crypto person I don't I don't think a lot of people are here for that mission or that future and so I think we also need to also Define the concerns that people are having about what what are the values basically embedded into an application like friend.tech and we can't seem to as a crypto industry create too much other than some form of financialization of things uh that already exist like social media apps and so is this all that we have to give do we is this what we have for the world is hey here is your web 2 and web 3 is web 2 but now with Finance is that really it is is that what we want and is that good I think there's a lot of different little nuances to unpack and so that's what we're going to do here on this episode yeah I think this is a good opportunity to uh to figure out what we really care about and why we're here and any excuse to do that um we we take it on Bank list so guys that's what you're in for today before we get to the episode we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible including our

friend.tech good or bad for crypto out on Twitter and of course most of my followers just like yours David they skew crypto native and I was actually really surprised at what the results were so uh good that option got 53 percent bad got 47 let me ask you before we continue this episode were you surprised by results like these certainly yeah I was ready for a good to mostly dominate the fact that we were basically at 50 50. I was surprised as to how many friend defectors there are out there friend naysayers yeah and I will say on bankless um the last couple of weeks we've been pretty favorable about it seems like a new proof of concept application so this is an alternative opinion I think we need to hear this is Anthony sasana replying to this tweet he says I haven't seen crypto Twitter this divided on something in a while and I think he's right we've uh there are a lot of um haters out there of this entire friend.tech experiment and that's important to go into David before we talk about kind of the controversy and the pros and cons of this particular application maybe we should spend a minute actually defining what this thing is so this is what we might call a social fi that's been a term going around lately as a sort of a new narrative but it's like a social Ponzi game on the layer 2 uh base and notice by the way I said Ponzi game which is very distinct from a Ponzi scheme um to us and you know how we've long used this term a Ponzi game is completely transparent you kind of know what you're getting into um I would say in some ways Bitcoin is a bit of a Ponzi game something like ethereum ether the asset is a bit of a Ponzi game I think I even think the dollar Fiat is a bit of a Ponzi game it's something that gets its value from narrative belief so don't be distracted by our use of the term Ponzi game but uh it's a very distracting terms specifically the the game element implies a scheme is a scheme and a game is a game a Ponzi scheme implies as a central operator who has differing incentives and a Ponzi game is simply referencing the fact that in order for this to be successful we need to have a constant inflow of new people in order for this to work new Believers new new Believers yes and and I actually don't want to necessarily ascribe like whether or not something is a Ponzi game is a very deep and long conversation and I think long time bankless listeners who have perhaps listened to every single Bank this episode will understand the nuances that come with that term um it's got a very negative connotation and we actually are using it in a very neutral way I would say and so I I think part of the world of money and finance like the dollar it's a piece of paper and people are paying money for it it's a Ponzi game in the sense that it's almost synonymous a Ponzi game is almost synonymous with finance and so I don't want to ascribe necessarily some sort of like opinion to this word Ponzi it's just like when you go very deep and understand the world of money and finance you understand that well everything is a story and everything is kind of a Ponzi and what is the doll it was a Ponzi that doesn't pop and so there's a lot of like there's a lot of connotation baked into this Ponzi word I don't want to get distracted by that yeah so I probably shouldn't have led with this loaded term if you're not familiar with with all of that background so so let me maybe uh restart that this is a social game of sorts on on crypto social financialization game yeah social financialization game where you can buy and sell your your friends essentially or shares of your friends could you describe this in a bit more detail David so when you log in to this new app friend Tech you connect your Twitter accounts and so you need a Twitter account to get started and that's because you mean you are using your social graph on Twitter to bootstrap your social graph on friend as friend.tech I always want to say friends as soon as your Twitter account gets loaded up you're given a base address and then you load up your address with some ether and you buy your first share of yourself and that opens up your room and any of your shareholders these are now called keys any of your key holders can unlock your room room so your key holders can start to chat with you and so every single person on friend has their own room and they get to chat with anyone who owns some of their keys I'm gonna I'm just gonna go back to start when you say you mean you mean chat room it's a chat room it's a chat room yes and so me as someone who has a bunch of Twitter followers when I made my room a bunch of my followers were able to buy my shares and we were able to start to chat with each other I have a 190 000 followers on Twitter I have uh I think like 60 shareholders on friends and so I so that's a much smaller concerted group of people and these people have paid anywhere between .01 to 0.5 ether to be in that room um the importantly the price of shares is on a bonding curve and so as more shares are minted the price of these things go up if you are a shareholder you can burn your share at any time and you will receive back the current price of the bonding curve and so if you bought my share at like .01 well you could sell it today into the bonding curve for 0.5 because that is how much one of my shares is worth and so this is where it starts to get into a little bit of a financialization system the more shareholders you have the more expensive you you are which is kind of what a free market does the only thing that's different is that this is on a fixed curve and so a lot of influencers oh and also importantly when you buy or sell a share there is a 10 uh tax that is charged and that tax is split 50 50 one half goes to the creators of friend Tech and then the other half goes to the uh this the person that you are selling that share for and so me as a and anyone on the app they also accumulate trading fees for anyone who's buying or selling your shares and so you get more money as people sell or buy your shares so as a Creator you are essentially getting trading fees and you're having someone buys or sells so so you want you kind of as a Creator you sort of I'm using this term Creator but I think Creator is a writer I think that's a Creator influencer these things might be synonymous in the rest of this conversation uh you're incentivized towards volume I suppose that's one volume yeah and as an owner of these shares again they're called keys but we'll use that term synonymously again as the owner of these shares you're incentivized towards a number goes up right you start to get more bullish and what's interesting here is uh you have you said 190 000 followers on Twitter it's free on Twitter to follow David okay to get access to this room costs money and it costs money to an increasing degree which uh is a completely different game that we're playing the other thing I guess I'll mention is of course this is all on D5 rails right right so that means uh this is smart contracts everything's very composable I think I saw maybe last weekend David though you've been tracking this much more more closely than I have like the ability to sort of export these friend shares these friend Keys as an erc20 so I could like start to buy David shares if I want on regular uniswap bonding curves is that create correct or it's like these things are plugged into other areas of the open defy economy yes that's right it's a money Lego and so some people some people were able to make a contract that buys or sell shares on the bonding curve and then also turn those shares into erc20 tokens that can be built into uniswap so it's plugable in with the rest of defies composable okay now uh the question that my mind goes to is like oh cool we've created something uh neat we think is neat or some segment thinks is neat is anyone using it what is the answer to that question is anyone actually using this thing the answer is definitely yes a friend Tech got released about two weeks ago 110 000 unique addresses have connected to uh to base and to friendtech uh so that was 110 000 unique Twitter accounts uh and so while we typically don't ascribe unique addresses to Unique users for many reasons this one actually has stronger assurances than other platforms because of the connection to Twitter so as basically call it a hundred thousand people inside of two weeks and some people from the web 2 world are not impressed by those numbers but let me tell you in crypto and web 3 right these are Big freaking numbers especially for every market like our biggest apps don't see this kind of uh daily active monthly active type of activity in crypto so our our our apps crypto apps are most often um you know I guess sized based on value in assets under management or total locked value these types of measures so when we see a large group a large group of real humans using an app that's a pretty big freaking deal I also saw like tweets from Brian Armstrong for example the transactions per second that a base is serving up has now surpassed ethereum and a lot of that traffic is driven by this this uh this application the friends.tech application we're at two million total transactions from Friends uh and then also there's 21 almost 22 000 ether in trading volume which is about 38 million dollars so 38 million dollars have changed hands because of this application now reminder that's 10 of a fee is is taken on all of that trading volume so that's and then that is self is split down the middle between creators and the team and so that's basically almost two million dollars in revenue for for the team and almost 2 million dollars in cumulative revenue for all the creators on the app I mean not bad for two weeks right yeah and this thing looks like it might be picking up more steam even though I think volumes are down like the last 24 hours or so this looks like it's leaking into mainstream almost in a way that um nfts did what are we looking at here David yeah so this is just a composite of a number of different things that I saw on Twitter uh we have on the top left FaZe Banks uh Gracie Hardy Grayson Allen as new people playing in friends FaZe Banks is a YouTuber Gracie Hardy is an only fans Creator Grayson Allen is an NBA player so three different very different corners of the internet that's different yeah we also have disclosure who is a DJ Duo very crypto native DJ Duo uh friends with Adelphi digital guys and Delphi digital got them into friend Tech and then on the right we just see what is what was my home screen where you can just kind of see global activity and like I know what a crypto person is and who they are and I can definitely tell that the uh casu heart only at fans in BIO person is not a crypto person that is an only fans Creator and so you can just see the different um people that have shown up for uh you know using friendtech it makes sense that um who's next in going to after the crypto natives to adopt this um platform well it's going to be Creator economy folk and that's that's gonna be only fans uh and also YouTubers people who create and have fans just general social media type stuff so there we go this could go from a crypto native sort of toy to mainstream very quickly right and that's what we see happen to nft so it's not unprecedented even in crypto for us to get these breakout applications and this shows hints and signs of a major breakout application of course might not be friend.tech it could be some other social uh finance application that's using a similar mechanism but like it's early and it's showing signs as I mentioned in the intro um David and I Bank list has mostly been supportive of this experiment I mean it seems fun to us hey people are using our apps it's great it's crypto right it's it's defy um it's getting private keys in the hands of of more people I think there's some question as to what how non-custodial this wallet is the implementation details aside this has the potential to get usage on layer twos up uh and uh that's always a good thing more people more block space more apps that go mainstream the worst case scenario for me for crypto is like we build all this stuff and no one actually uses it um but and this is what I think the rest of this episode is about there's also some arguments against this uh some people in the crypto Community as we mentioned earlier 42 43 I actually hate this experiment they're actually very much resistant to it and we want to give air and oxygen to that opinion too because I think there's some Merit here and I think it's worth consideration so shall we dive into that now David yeah that's it all right so this was a tweet that was brought to my attention from someone uh in the bankless Discord from autism Capital you know uh it's an interesting account here but regarding friend Tech it's sad that after SPF there's no pretense of doing good through crypto anymore or even trying to change the world for the better no more talk of decentralization no saving the world no conviction at all vitalik is quiet all the old layer one promoters are quiet all the loud voices have cashed out and gone silent there was nothing learned from the last cycle of scammers shitcoin promoters and massive Founders secondaries you were all dumped on by these guys now you're allowing yourself to be dumped on again with this new you've learned nothing and now the shell of kryptos all purely PVP from the other guy now the nft scumbagry managed to get even worse concentrated zero value creation for the world absolute moloch congratulations you played yourself and in the short term money grab you're cheapening the broader Narrative of crypto being a force for change for a short-term Fool's gain and the response to this will likely be LOL STFU I don't know I'm making fees wow yeah oof pretty pretty hard-hitting statements there was also a take from a bankless citizen um that this tweet uh spawned a conversation inside of the bankless Discord and so the the citizen said in my opinion it's incredibly Reckless and I lose respect for anyone who is presenting this app as some kind of breakout web3 app have fun with it if you want until you lose your money but it has nothing to do with web 3 or crypto values the entire premise of Financial financializing social relationships is also in my opinion a contemptible concept worthy only of mockery big influencer accounts found yet another way to extract value from the herd so this craze will continue until the next fashionable Ponzi is unveiled it's not what I signed up for but let's face it no one gives a damn if you have dot Ethan your name it's just experimenting and anything goes who cares that I'm Shilling this to ordinary people who are going to get wrecked me and all my rich friends are making free money this is great all of the Innovative Tech is just used to create more advanced ponzis now this is a take that I think I I think this is well articulated for the contrarian side of friend Tech and this is also a sentiment that I've heard across crypto both inside and outside of crypto and just overall I would say this shares a sentiment with a very deep concern about crypto like we have many many apps that look and feel and share some elements with friendtech and it's about like the underlying structure of these things and concerns about financialization at its very core and some things I think are very deeply tied to what crypto is like crypto almost is synonymous with financialization I know there's a bunch of non-financial use cases of crypto that we are really trying to crack the nut of things like identity but for now really the thing that crypto has been able to do is produce more Finance than we had before and I think a lot of people are in crypto for deeper reasons than that and they get Jaded by all these financialization apps that seem to blow through into mainstream before anything else well I get it I mean like 2022 that was that was all greed inspired right that was all I was seeing that the the the the comments that you just articulated we've also heard that from crypto Skeptics who are also fairly crypto knowledgeable like like Molly white like you're just financializing everything you're just creating pyramid games out of everything and praying on your social relationships and is that really what crypto is about so I think the aversion here is is crypto just becoming this gambling greed inspired Ponzi thing that seems custom built to only serve already rich influencers all right that's like when you look at this platform that's what it kind of looks like and here we are we're bankless right we're crypto decentralized values we're supposed to be changing the world and we're celebrating this hollowed out Ponzi game yet again and people are going there scratching their heads and they're like is that the best that we we have is this what we're offering to the world like and here we are in the bear market and we've talked about this being sort of the bill build Market where the tourists are gone the seller stay and uh we're supposed to be building stuff that helps the world that drives utility to real people and instead we're getting caught in these cheap tour straps and so people some people are looking at this and they're going that's not what I signed up for I I'm not saying I agree entirely with that sentiment and we'll discuss why but I think that's like a summation of it for me I think a lot of frustration comes from how readily accepting uh crypto was of friend Tech and I and I think the current state of crypto could probably be excused from that um because like like what did we have in 2022 we had uh stay I'll go stable coins that were unbacked completely blow up we had a Ponzi that went to zero and now everyone hates crypto and we are Desperately Seeking validation from mainstream Society in any way shape or form and so I think um a lot our standards perhaps are lower than they otherwise would be because we finally have these protocols that we're pretty proud of I'd say we have base the layer two that everyone is really optimistic about and the transactions are cheap and the transactions are cheap and free and the ux is great right and onboarding is so fast and so this a lot of crypto is like look at look at what we can do look at this latent power that we have as soon as somebody can figure out how to put all the pieces together we will have explosions of mainstream applications and so I think crypto and myself included are the reason why we accepted friend app friend Tech so quickly is is because of this is like as we able we were it's proof that we were able to go mainstream um yes it was with this financialization and social relationships um and yes like soon as I got into friend Tech I was like oh this is a transfer of wealth from small to large this is what is built in here like am I going to like me as a as somebody with 190 000 followers I go into friends Tech and I immediately get 0.4 ether from Trading Advantage I have the advantage right and and so that but I'm willing to excuse that because influencers are exist both inside and outside of crypto and there's no new Dynamics here like you know the people with 1 million accounts on Instagram also get Tailwinds of capital and fame and stuff like this right so now the only thing that's different is we are taking that same power that influencers have in the first place in web 2 and now we're also layering on financialization onto it which is what happens in in web3 and so I think a lot of us kind of excused that element because we were just so stoked to see something actually work and break out out of this bear Market but maybe it's also fine I can tell in your response there that you're like deeply considering that alternative and you're kind of like wondering well you know is this bad I even question the premise of why should you feel bad for this you're like why should any influencer sort of feel bad for this right isn't this just another kind of mechanism uh I mean I guess a few things I'd say and this would be sort of the the opposite it take and then we'll get to what you and I maybe think about this and we'll bat this back and forth a little bit though your one take is this is just a pre POC it's a proof of concept right so it's basically like look what we can do with this new social fi stack and uh you know our transactions are cheap and this is a layer two fluxing its muscle and we can get by the App Store and Android and like it might not be this but like isn't this great we're selling block space look at the potential here right even if friend Tech is evil the ends justify the means because it shows us the past sure and and there's like look we vampire attacked an evil web 2 company right isn't that the whole like purpose like people are so you know incentivized to Port their social graphs um so so that that's one element and I said on a roll up I think a week ago like I've switched bullish on social fi as a result of of this experiment but but I also want to question the premise of like why why you should even feel bad about this you know because it's transparent right like everybody knows that there is a bonding curve and that like what they're getting if they buy David keys or anybody's Keys is just access to a chat room like I almost feels similar to how I felt about jpegs at least in the early stages which is like guys you're buying a JPEG right it's a picture there's nothing hidden there there's nothing hidden this is like so if you want to Value art like you know and you think the Mona Lisa is valuable other elements of art and you don't really know why well like it's all about kind of social cultural value and that stuff can be so fleeting but you know exactly what you're buying when you're buying a board Abe jpeg don't you I think I think this is why people were getting excited because say you're not a crypto person you don't need to explain a bonding curve like oh yeah when when you buy shares or Keys the price goes up yeah and people like oh yeah that makes sense yeah I understand that so that's the thing I'm not sure that you should feel bad about this right and that that's where the conversation is and there's another retort which is like what's wrong with with having fun yeah I could also say like um people can't stop it right so another reaction to somebody who is um like worried about this and concerned about this is okay don't use it there's lots of games that I don't play in crypto like I just choose not to like you get to choose your character class when you enter you could be a Trader if you want you just stacky you don't have to do it you can you can get into the nft community and trade jpeg or you don't have to like you could just opt out yeah so what do you think about those replies yeah and every single I think a lot of people are ascribing responsibility to the platform when they ought to ascribe more responsibility to the individual creators and how they manage their own chairs and how they manage their own bonding curve right uh and so I saw a quote from one of these accounts who was saying like oh yeah suzu who is like one of the lead creators on friend Tech not a great look he isn't oh yeah yeah he is he's like in the top 20 leaderboard yeah and so like somebody somebody said like oh yeah suzu is in his own chat room saying that he thinks his own prices can go higher and I'm like of course who says that who cares though like what are you doing yeah so it's like a lot of them is on the responsibility of the people partaking in these games right and so like I as soon as I got into friendtech like I said I understood that okay this is a transfer from small to big like many small accounts are going to be buying the shares or the big accounts and then the big accounts are going to accumulate The Ether and then they're going to promo promote their accounts and say which should try and incentivize more people to buy their shares so they can get more trading fees I realize that like as soon as I got in there which is why I did that like I'm gonna give away my trading fees to some of my one of my shareholders inside of seven days which is both me pumping my own shares and then also giving away the accumulated Revenue because I didn't want like to have any sort of evil ascribed to me so I'm playing the game and also trying to do my put my best for foot forward with it so that was my Approach and I think like a lot of people need to well the responsibility that people are trying to ascribe to the friend Tech platform should also be beholden upon the people who are managing their own chairs yes technology is a tool is a neutral tool hopefully and it's really about how you use it and what you do with it and I also think that we can totally also talk about the way that the platform itself is construct the mechanism the mechanism itself because I think the concerns about friend Tech is that sweet if we get all these influencers on top on this imbalanced platform what or I thought were trying to make balanced platforms and friend Tech doesn't seem to be balanced when it so rapidly um rewards people who already have social capital and financial Capital right okay so there's some there's two levels of criticism here there's one a criticism about the underlying mechanism and the system which uh is certainly valid and then you're also making the point that the same social primitive that a Creator can use to rug their Community can also be used by a Creator to build a fantastic community and so the technology itself is somewhat neutral although the mechanism design behind the scenes of the system can be either like good or bad or something right balanced or imbalanced and I also will say even if you do say think that the friend Tech platform is imbalanced I will say it's built on the op stack which 15 of all the trading revenue from base goes to retroactive public goods funding sure and so this is the whole Theory the whole thesis behind the optimism Vision which is degeneracy turns into regeneracy and so maybe the imbalance of friends is concerning and we should talk about that but I also will say at least it's built on top of the super chain which is well they're supposed to turn transaction fees into public goods there's a there's levels to that too and what is the super chain what is the optimism ecosystem built on top of it's built on top of ethereum which is an open permissionless decentralized public good for the world that needs to be funded by fees that's how we're funding this whole thing and there's been a lot of degeneracy that's actually funded uh you know the block space of ethereum right including some fantastic things but that's how we get a global banking system that is actually permissionless and can scale to the world and can be opt-in so there's a public good being being created as a byproduct of that there's also there's also a point that van Spencer made in our episode yesterday David which is creators don't have a lot of ways to make money in general online there are often intermediated by Third parties or aggregators right and so the internet was a force for disintermediation for democratization uh for for creators but it has its limits and now here's a new way for creators to monetize right again that can be either you know it could be suzu you're like about to rug you or it could be I don't know some Creator who's creating a you know fantastic chat room for their followers and this is a tokenized mechanism to um you participate in that and to build a community around it and so that it feels like could be a net good as well and then there's also the argument that this gets more private keys and more hands right yeah I do think we really should put a pin on the argument that okay like we are we are just introducing financialization into our social relationships well Facebook Twitter well Twitter's actually paying out royalty fees to creators so maybe maybe Twitter's a or excuse me X is a new case here but like I think people are forgetting the fact that like Facebook has previously robbed content creators creators of the opportunity to financialize themselves and so this is actually restoring that power to creators I will say the five percent take rate from the app is pretty steep but it also makes sense for what it would be in the early days I would expect that to either be routed around or come down over time but you know you know the um the old you know kind of Chris Dixon thing and this comes from Bezos like uh your take rate my opportunity I think these margins will continue to uh contract and if you you compare five percent to like 30 for the App Store or like zero percent and Facebook just monetizes all of its user data it gives nothing back five percent is kind of low and if friend Tech gets competitors then that might compress to like 2.5 percent to one percent on downwards yeah this is a an adjacent conversation but the erc20 tokenization of shares that is a contract that got built and deployed by a developer out yes recently so now you can take your shares turn them into erc20 tokens and then they're on uniswap well we actually have tools like collab land and telegram rooms where you if you own a token you unlock a telegram room so we actually already have the components to rebuild friendtech without friend Tech and so I think this is why like maybe frontec isn't the thing that is going to blow up or maybe it's not the long-term equilibrium of these things but you could rebuild friend Tech without the fees using uniswap erc20 tokens collaboraland and Telegram and now people are privy to this and so I don't think this the

show notes okay so we talked about the uh you know the haters case and the why why it you know we should be against this and then we talked about why it's awesome I want to kind of ask you what what you think about this and maybe I'll frame this with like kind of your conclusion to date at this point in time right again this experiment could like um turn into an even more positive direction or it could go into kind of a negative Direction so obviously this is your take a snapshot in time I would say but I think the the biggest criticism that stands out for me on the the against why frontec is bad type of case is is this really what we want to be known for to mainstream it's SBF monkey jpegs and like social pyramid schemes like I thought we were here to change the world I thought this was like a democratization play an equality to everyone play okay and so yes Ryan and David I can opt into this or not but now I see like my social layer every all of these people in crypto whom I respect and what are they talking about it looks like again this is a social media type of effect so you can get in kind of these bubbles but it looks like everybody's talking about this Ponzi pyramid scheme and getting excited about it and maybe it looks like they're Shilling it to me and they see this and they're like WTF layer zero I thought that the social layer of crypto stood for more than this so I guess where do you where do you stand on all of this at this point so we talked about the against use case and you know the the four use case what's uh your take after absorbing this kind of kind of reaction in this opinion part of what I consider to be the bull market for crypto at large is the explosion of more markets for more things and I think I think markets are inherently good like I know we know like technology is neutral I think markets are good because if a market exists then there means that there's no Monopoly so the market is the opposite of a mar of a monopoly it is the bizarre not the cathedral and to me that a bizarre is something that is foundationally uh in Balance there's an equilibrium there markets don't behold in any one participant more than the other so if ethereum wins there will be more markets for more things I think actually the case the bull case for ethereum for crypto is like market maximalism and so I think that is inherently tied to the financialization of things and I think we kind of need to accept that and I think that this is good because more markets implies fairness and decentralization now when we have these new um uh new things new when we discuss cover something on the crypto Frontier what happens first the Apes and the gambling and the speculation Rush there sooner than everything else because there's profits to be made and this is just because of this thing called price Discovery and so like as somebody who's been on Friends tech for almost two weeks now um my my trading volume in days one through five were insane very high and then like the big wave of adoption came in and my my market volume was still pretty good even with these new influx of new people I don't think somebody I don't think a share of mine has been traded in the last two days because the 66 people of that are in my shareholder room we're just chatting we're just hanging out they're asking me questions there's no churn anymore and I think because the speculation has gone away and now we've discovered an equilibrium where actually the value of my shares is reflective of the actual value and time and energy that I'm injecting into my room and so the Apes come first and they leave a real bad taste in everyone's mouth because it's degeneracy its speculation is risk-taking it's financialization but then the equilibrium that sets in afterwards is more or less invisible and creators are just creating and Market participants are participating and so that's the utility phase and so I I think a lot of bad taste comes just because that is the natural order of markets like when markets are established I don't know if you've ever um custom uh if you've ever minted a unit swap Market Ryan or being very very early in a unit swap Market but like you get haircuts left and right unless you're playing the game extremely well because it's so illiquid and it's just Mev Bots and it's just complete like Arbitrage opportunities and then something like uscc ether pair sets in and we have super liquidity and there's no fleecing anymore right and so I think that's just the early days of friends Tech it's just like oh yeah everyone is playing the price Discovery game everyone's speculating everyone's like and blah blah blah but then over time as time goes on the markets mature and again we have markets established which is something that has been robbed for from creators and I would say that that's the the good case for friend Tech or things like it that's the bull case I would say so you think people are just inherently uncomfortable and maybe we can't blame them about this speculation type phase because it looks ugly it does like it's like.com um you know boom and then busty right that's right that's what people are saying like oh yeah everyone's just going to lose their money and yeah if you enter that part of the the of that part of the market before you're ready and you're playing with more sophisticated actors yeah you will lose money yeah but if you also just buy a share and just hang out in the room and don't participate in the speculation game and you're just buying a share of the Creator because you want to be there and get the utility then you're not going to get fleas so I think that's a broader point I think that's important some people are just not comfortable with the speculation phase of of markets right because like the rest of their life isn't kind of like that so they see things that go up and then they go down and level out and they automatically call those kind of like I don't know two tulips or scams and like everything productive has gone through that cycle hasn't it right yeah well so like part of part of the crypto world like icos oof not great like nft mins oof not great but we have to remember that like that part of the market cycle for financial assets exists before and after crypto and the reason why we don't see it in the in the traditional world is because by the time a traditional Equity IPOs on the stock market all of that speculation by early VCS the first round of financing the second round of financing that's not available to the general public yeah and so this is the naked truth of markets and now it's public and the public is reacting to it but that's just because they finally have the option to react it can actually see it they can actually see it for the first word for it right yes yes exactly we can we can exactly see how degenerate humanity is as a whole but previously we were never even able to have these opportunities at all because VCS were able to have have like the 10 000 X gains before anything would go public this this Market maximalism that you said is kind of inherent with with crypto like I agree that that's the take and I also go back to kind of the the deeper thing and this is the best encapsulated in our episode with Molly white like she hears what you're saying and you're basically like uh trust me bro once we get through this like a financialization cycle everything's going to be net better right and she's like yeah by net better you mean you get richer you know what I mean you and your friends get more powerful and more Rich right and um you know gotta say on the back of 2022 touche yeah all right um and also I just don't think that that like I do think that free markets and the ability to own digital property is a net good that is worth going through these painful speculation phases and um that that's almost like I don't think we've fully seen that yet right I think we've seen it in in fits and starts right now there is a thing called Bitcoin it actually has some liquidity now there's a thing called ether it has some liquidity anyone can spin up a uniswap market like we are helping communities in Africa communities in Argentina get out of their repressive government systems get access to a public open internet native banking system like that is those are some of the net good that we've created but like to the point I'm not sure that the net good yet yet outweighs some of the net bad experiments that we've seen and it's almost like an article of faith that it will at some point I I think probably for me it already outweighs but like the the bad because I put so much value on freedom uh like markets and I see like um dystopian authoritarian future maybe just coming to this episode David we had uh the developers behind tornado cash they were just arrested by the United States Okay and like it looks like the charges are they developed some privacy Tech code yeah right having gotten into this I'm pretty sure those are the charges we'll talk about it more on the roll-up tomorrow right to me that is a bigger threat to like this whole um living like Humanity experiment than anything the crypto is throwing at us with opt-in you know social Finance type games and so that's the net good and that's the prize I kind of see but not everyone sees it like that and people are very inherently uncomfortable with the speculation phase I think what is really valuable about these conversations is allowing the white the immune system the white blood cells of crypto to raise their head and say I don't accept this platform as legitimate because it's too imbalanced and I think this is I think I'm willing to give friend Tech the benefit of the doubt and say the uh n justifies the means and this is just an important like you said proof of concept to Define what people want and how to get there and the five percent take rate is really high that from the from the platform but that's totally malleable and I mean it makes sense to have like to while there is this speculation phase to try and cash in and get Revenue so that they can be a sustainable platform and then learn through research and development how to build a more Equitable platform that is more inclusive for everyone and so I'm willing as like the the generally trusting Optimist in this industry to give friend Tech the bed the benefit the doubt saying like Okay through feedback through this white blood cell immune response so that is this conversation that people are having on crypto Twitter and elsewhere we are learning about how to build a more balanced um friend Creator economy platform um and I so I'm willing to give the team the benefit of the doubt that that is where their ultimate goal is going to go yeah I agree with that and I'm um I'm actually kind of bullish on the immune system response honestly like so I appreciate the questioning of this because um I think the bigger threat to crypto is not sort of the the moral virtue here um but it's more the kind of the nihilism that you see everywhere which is just exemplified by like uh you know I'll get rich Fu like and there's no oh you're getting rich fu yeah and everyone is playing this game and no one has any like virtue or or morality and no one's playing this game in in like a way that is kind of um net creative to the world we're all just a bunch of selfish bastards I that nihilism is I think very counter to um why I'm here and what I believe so the fact that there is a immune system a social layer trying to like hold us to account actually is is a good thing because it pushes back against this this nihilism that we see in other areas of crypto and I think I I do also see the point so I think it would obviously be a mistake we don't do this uh and we wouldn't do this but if um let's say bankless or you know any other and kind of the you know influential leader in in the crypto sphere just waited as such they were talking about these types of applications eighty percent of the time or ninety percent of time and talking about like the things that really matter the values and the public goods and why we're all here only like 10 of the the time and so I think the community is right to kind of call people out when if if these types of things become the only things that we talk about and care about right so um obviously for Bank list we want to continue to maintain our portfolio of like talking about um the values of this industry and the why and the things we care about and spotlighting the bright projects you know closer to like 70 of the time or closer to eighty percent of the time right right uh and so getting that balance right is is honestly uh very important uh to me and I think is a lesson out of this for sure yeah I agree David I've heard you've got a meme to tie this off though what are we looking at uh yeah just to end this episode on a light-hearted note we have a meme of the episode so this is the Pepe with glasses writing on his piece of paper who's saying who's apparently on the phone with the IRA yes because hello yes IRS so my client brought friend Tech shares for Kobe and some and synthesis for two point four point two each and proceeded to sell clients for three ethies to invest in their own shares client proceeded to get the revenue shares from trades on their shares and now has bought wrapped fubars can client deduct gas fees on wrapped fubars and bridging to gays I'm looking forward to talking to my accountant about all my friends Shenanigans well I mean there's that there's also like the question of like what does the SEC do with these things they're they're not shares the keys like I mean what are we like there's going to be uh an interesting nation-state reaction and this is maybe the last thing I'll kind of finish on um even if you don't like this app I think the one thing we have to preserve across um crypto is a big tent all right and here's why I think that the biggest threat to crypto is remaining a niche of a bunch of weirdos using defy and using like privacy tools like tornado cash and we never get the legitimacy or voting power to actually change the laws in our like the biggest threat is we don't go mainstream David right and we're just relegated to this Niche our best defense against that is to onboard the world and so um you know even if this isn't your jam I would compare just all to be open to ways that normies will actually use our applications that um you know we're we're not entirely crazy about today on the note of um whether or not all of these shares keys or tokenized Securities or not are you familiar with the concept of a lock-on or a sleeping Dragon no a what Snapdragon sleeping Dragon oh okay no it's a it's a protest maneuver so imagine two uh protesters and they handcuff themselves together but inside of PVC pipe or like a metal tube and then they did so you can't remove them you can't undo the Handcuff because of the pipe oh wow they basically like chain themselves together in a way that they are make it difficult it's like there's too many of us who can't arrest us all sort of thing like you can't we're we're all we're all tokenizing ourselves legal Securities what are you gonna do arrest every single influencer I think right I thought that was kind of funny all right well because that goes back to the like with one of those articles that I think I wrote like in 2021 after the nft Mania came out it was like what are you gonna do Gary Gensler you're gonna make my flaming Sword of Fire uh security like what are you gonna do bro you're gonna come arrest little Timmy yeah for his item drop after he beat the boss for not like registering that yeah I don't know it just kind of shows the fix that the SEC is like walking towards and we'll see what they do about it there you go bankless Nation hope you enjoyed the episode risks and disclosures of course uh both David and I have friend.tech apps I think David Shares are up a lot more than mine right now uh so you should know that but of course gotta let you know as always crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
