what do you say to concerns about centralization on b and b chain or about finance having too much influence or these sorts of concerns that people have first of all decentralization centralization is not black and white number one is a spectrum if we look at any particular aspect and there's multiple aspects we got to look at for example if we look at bitcoin bitcoin i do think is by far the most decentralized blockchain but if you look at bitcoin mining it's quite centralized like you know the top two or three mining pools will control more than 51 percent of the mining power and also if you look at binance.com yes but.com is a centralized exchange how many users do we have we probably do have the largest user base in crypto now the most decentralized manner would be like everybody working for themselves no company no organization in a decentralized world any two people can choose to work together when they choose to work together that's centralization but if we all work independently are we able to achieve the maximum impact that we can achieve today probably no if we didn't start an organization if we didn't hire people to work on common goal then finance would not be able to onboard so many users into crypto
