because of inflation these stocks are going to get cheap because of the interest rate backlog they're getting cheap but the ongoing adoption of technology is relentless so therefore they're getting cheaper every day so we should be looking at entries exactly the same we did with crypto we look at these markets and if you've got spare money then you want to be buying this kind of stuff and not selling this stuff because it's the same adoption model it's the fastest pace of change the human race i think will ever go through i mean it's an extraordinary period of time and you don't want to get knocked off that game because of the volatility in markets you know these things are inherently volatile but you can't get knocked off your game for this because you're missing the big picture which is why it's so important not to use leverage in these network adoption models because you don't want to get washed out at the wrong time
