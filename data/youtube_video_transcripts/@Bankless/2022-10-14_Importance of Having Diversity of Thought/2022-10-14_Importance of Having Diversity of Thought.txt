would you say that critical theory doesn't have diversity of thought that's a loaded question to ask within my major there was no diversity of thought it was very very liberal and woke I definitely still hold some of the beliefs that I did at the time I really took the initiative once I started learning about all these other things like I was never exposed to Tech or Finance or any of that once I started exploring that I started challenging my own assumptions because I was like wow everyone else around me has been saying like Tech is bad capitalism is bad like all this stuff is bad so we shouldn't engage but I was like no this is awesome I also started realizing like okay what things was I sort of taught or expected to believe how much of that actually resonates with me right and so I think for me at the moment like I you were in a very polarized system and there are some of my beliefs that would fall far on one side and some that would fall for on the other and I'm comfortable with that
