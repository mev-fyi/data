[Music] all right bankless nation i'm here with hugh carp of nexus mutual uh not too long ago some unfortunate piece of news came through the news cycle regarding uh a very rare exploit of metamasks that hugh was unfortunately the the victim of uh hugh can you kind of give us a little bit of the backstory as to what happened um and and we're gonna get into some some takeaways as a result of that a little bit later but like tell tell us this this story give us give us the story in just a little synopsis yeah i know thanks david great to be here i think um i just want to get on here and at least make it known kind of what happened and so people can learn from it mainly because you know we everyone's trying to learn how to do this stuff in the in the best way possible so hopefully that's the main point of me being on here um so yeah i think a little bit of background on setup and stuff and then kind of go into the details so i was on a windows pc um running a hardware wallet through metamask so that's kind of the important stuff and i guess what we kind of discovered was that um some some time before the hack um i opened a docx file um from um via email from somewhere it's a microsoft word file yeah microsoft word file um it could be um it doesn't have to be like a docx file it could be a pdf or something like that um and that essentially exploited a vulnerability in the microsoft um operating system um i'm not super technical so i'm just gonna i'm just kind of going through what i know but um it exploded the vulnerability in the microsoft operating system and it effectively gave um the hacker access to my computer um and so so sorry was the docx file the malicious file or did that open up the a malicious route um it opened up um there was another file connected to the docx like embedded within it um so it's like a file within a file type thing and then once that happened it um it allowed the malware to be placed on the pc exploiting a windows vulnerability and that effectively gave the um attacker or the hacker remote access to my um pc so the entire pc was compromised um and so then what happened sometime later was they um essentially because they've got entire access to the pc they switched chrome into developer mode and then essentially altered the metamask extension um and so essentially i had a malicious metamask version um on my on my pc which is fine because it well it's not fine but at that point um my private keys and stuff are okay because they're on the hardware wallet um but the metamask extensions com is compromised and so um at that point um what they later did was when i was going to interact with a smart contract so just do a transaction i was actually just claiming some rewards and instead of when metamask pops up and says yes you want to approve that it says yes you're claiming some rewards and then what happens is it pushes a a fake well it's a spoof transaction so metamask is showing me a transaction that it's not actually going to do so that's the fake metamask and so then what it does is it pushes that transaction to the hardware wallet and um and i was tricked into approving it because it has on the hardware world it shows you what to do and in theory you can decipher all of the hex hex code but it's a reasonably challenging thing to do unless you're really really quite technical um and so i just clicked through and and um hit approve and instead of claiming the rewards what i was actually approving on the hardware wallet was sending the attacker a large amount of nxm um and so then they started converting it to wrapped an exam and started cashing out on various places converting to btc et cetera and at that point you know discovered that i'd done the wrong thing and we went into um emergency response type mode and kind of went from there well hugh i i can imagine that that was uh not fun news to discover and so i'm first off sorry i'm sorry that this happened to you uh there's this always this funny quirk with public permissionless blockchains especially with that you know bitcoin created that transactions are final right it's it's a one-way street unless there's some unique specific case where you can actually do a reversion but you know 99.99 of transactions are final um and so this is this is an unfortunate reality about the world that we we live in is that if there is just one way to get through one way is enough um and so just to just to recap um the the hacker sounded it sounded like he targeted you specifically with a docx file a microsoft word file that had a an internal file embedded in it that allowed the attacker to hot swap chrome into developer mode which allowed them to install a fake version of metamask which was probably a clone of the real version of metamask the only thing that it did differently was that it instead of doing the transaction that you wanted to do it would do a different transaction and what was interesting is that it sounded like he cloned metamask he or she cloned metamask to display the transaction that you wanted to do so that up to that point the functionality was working but then when it sent your hardware wallet the transaction it actually sent the transaction that the hacker wanted which was a simple send of erc20 tokens from one wallet to another and so they were specifically targeting you because their version of metamask must have been coded up to specifically send nxm tokens right how oh yeah so go ahead i i don't actually think so so there's probably two stages to this so the the first and i think this is important because i think um some people might come away with the impression that um i guess i'm a bit more of a public figure so i'm more likely to be targeted and therefore if they're not then perhaps they're a bit safer however um the docx file etc um was a that attack up into that point that could work on anyone and so then they've got access to your computer and then they've and then they have deployed a specific um version of the breach so now that they've got access to the computer they can essentially work out a targeted attack for you based on the tokens that you actually have so they can compromise any computer or anyone and it's only if it's worth taking the extra step because maybe you've got a decent amount of funds that they can take it then so um yeah so any i guess anyone is potentially um vulnerable by opening these files and i think i think it's important a few things there one is that these files could just be shared in discords um relatively easy to click the secondly the top the um the title of the docx file that i opened was on a particular topic that we were discussing in our community and within our team at that point in time so it was um so i guess the the hackers and stuff are frequenting the discords and the telegrams etc to work out what the topics are being discussed to get increased likelihood that you will open a file um and so at that point um your computer is compromised and they can take the next steps so how do you feel specifically targeted by this one attacker or was this a random chance that you were actually the victim of this one exploit i think they were targeting but they were definitely targeting um victims within um like nexus because it was a topic that the nexus community was discussing at that point um i guess i'm more likely to be a specific target just because um i likely have a large amount of tokens of nexus um and so that that's that's probably there but but i i i caution to say like you know i'm sure the particular attack can be expanded to just general people in in crypto and that are in these communities so what what can you tell us about the attacker because i know nxm er nexus mutual has a kyc process and i believe that the attacker actually went through the kyc process does that mean that notes that somebody knows the identity of this individual um no so well yes there is a kyc process on nexus um but the tokens my tokens was can own nxm can only be sent to within members so my tokens were sent to another nexus mutual member address um but it's believed that that um member address was also um compromised earlier um so they um so that the kyc doesn't help us there because um it was compromised already um and so essentially that means that um once they've done that they've got control of the tokens and then they shift them out interrupt nxm and then it's just a standard erc20 that they can do what they wish with and then at that point it's it's into the ecosystem it's the cat's out of the bag there yeah exactly um and so you know they they wrapped them and then started selling um on various exchanges etc um they actually still hold a chunk of um wrapped exam um probably about a quarter or twenty percent of um what am i still okay and then and then i believe they also transferred some into ren btc and then i'm i'm presuming exited into the bitcoin blockchain what do you what do you guys know about that yeah i mean we tracked the funds um the funds dispersed very quickly very fast um obviously you know what they're doing and i've probably done this before i'm guessing just based on that um but they've yeah a lot of them have exited to um to btc well again uh hugh i'm i'm sorry that that this happened to you uh nexus mutual is foundational in the realm of defy for providing insurance for people who are um trying to use contracts that could be exploited by uh more additional more more typical attacks economic exploits things that we see in d5 all the time this one is a little bit atypical um what what have you done now now that this has happened how have you changed your behaviors like what do you do now um yeah so i threw out that computer for starters it's cursing out okay i'm never touching that again um but then um so i got switched operating systems um and then also got a specific um other computer that i just used for signing transactions so it basically just goes to a very small handful of sites and no email no nothing else on it um and so that reduces the kind of attack um vector i guess there i'm noting that you can't actually nothing here is foolproof it's all just a matter of um levels of security really and i guess the other thing i do quite religiously now is make sure i know which contract address i should be interacting with um whenever i do a transaction um which is painful at times but um i've got into the habit of looking up the contract address and then checking on the hardware wallet that i am interacting with the corrector address right okay so this is actually a really good tip for for people and this is something that if this had happened to me i also would have lost all of my money right because when i press accept on meta mask i immediately go to my ledger and i just scroll to the end and i and i hit accept right which obviously i'm assuming is what you did and if if if we had if we are looking at this we can actually extract details out of like for me it's my ledger for you whatever hardware wallet you use but there's information there for us to verify it's just hard to do that right can you kind of go through the the process that you go through now when you verify the address on the hardware wallet with what you're doing on your browser yeah so what i do is i check that um i check what metamask shows is the address i'm supposed to be interacting with the to the send to and then i look that up i need to scan and then check that that is the right one um i've probably got a few key ones memorized by now so it helps but um so so i know which address the two addresses should be um and then um and then if it and then when you click confirm on metamasker pushes it to the hardware wallet and then it you can see the the scrolling um to address on on the on the hardware wallet and you can approve it from there um i think you know there's a there's a time limit on signing the the um the thing on the hardware wallet otherwise metamask will timeout um i guess the point is just don't be afraid to just let it go just take your time do it do what you need to do don't feel rushed about it um it's it's more important to be a bit more secure about things um i think the other thing that helps and i believe more um solutions are kind of coming in the space uh you know if you want to send for example usdc on a ledger it's actually instead of giving you just contract address stuff that you can't really interpret it's pre-filled information and actually says oh you're sending 100 usdc here um and so some of the more popular erc20s have that and so hopefully more and more of the popular interactions will start getting pre-filled with human readable information um rather than i'm just straight kind of hex code yeah have you have you uh looked at different hardware wallets that are more uh are that provide better ui um other than like a ledger or a trezor yeah so um i have looked at some of the others i mean i think one of them is the is it the lattice but i'm good plus i think that's that's got a bigger screen so you can um there you go he's going in the background very good um and um yeah so it's got a bigger screen and so you can put more information on it i think the challenge with all of these is that you need it needs someone to pre-fill the um the actual information like the information the human readable information is not natively there on the blockchain so someone has to go in and input the basic information and so if you're interacting with a new contract that no one's pre-filled the information for then you know you've still got to do the hard kind of tech work so you know um which isn't so hard but for someone who's been in this space for a while perhaps but um but it is a pretty steep learning curve for a lot of people yeah so i i think ranking the levels of risk here the the people that have a high amount of value in tokens and ether that are making a high number of transactions you know you know one to ten transactions a day uh which i would imagine as the the ceo of a d5 protocol that that's what you are doing you're making a high number of transactions per day i feel like those people are the most at risk but it seems to be that uh with this kind of attack the cost to um try and make this attack happen aren't actually that large right if you are just trying to get somebody to download a docx file um that seems like a pretty it only that sounds like a potential spam attack where somebody could just be going into discord and i get i get discord dms all the time saying hey join my discord group like hey blah blah blah it seems like the cost of sending that that kind of file out to like thousands and thousands of people would actually be relatively low right and so this i mean you are a very public figure head of a one of a very a very core part of the defy ecosystem and so maybe listeners are saying well that won't just happen to me but i actually think that this attack could be uh going after anyone is there is there anything wrong with that analysis no i don't believe so um i mean obviously you know there's there's the extra time afterwards that the hacker's got to spend to kind of craft the specific um malware for you like um to make sure it sends the right spoof transaction um and so that there is that extra kind of step i believe um but um but that's going to be worth it once they've got then once they know that they've got access to your computer so right um you know i i think yeah i mean unfortunately it's uh as crypto becomes more and more popular more and more people start using it we like this type of stuff is going to become more prevalent and um i guess yeah we all need to be aware of this stuff but i think the simplest thing that most regular users can do is probably get a different um just basic computer that signs transactions that doesn't do anything else um and so and i think that'll help a lot what could a could a multi-sig address like could a gnosis multisig address fix this problem yeah i mean obviously um someone else has got to sign the the transaction right um and so you know there's obviously there's we're always in this trade-off of usability versus um security and so um it's it it's the question of how you've got that that multisig the second or third or whatever um signature how's that set up and if it's going to someone else that has to view it um and can can actually see oh no that's not what you're meant to approve then yes of course it's going to help a lot um but yeah it depends how you got things set up okay all right so so now now on the other side of this attack you use a dedicated computer that you don't check emails on you don't you only go to very few number of websites it's a basically a signing computer and you only use that to sign transactions and now you also verify the contract address that displays on your hardware wallet we're also looking for out of the industry improvements in uh ui design for hardware walls to be able to actually consume data from ethereum and tell you will give you in human readable terms what your transaction is about to do and then i guess another another fix that is more dependent on the ecosystem is just like um just infrastructure around naming contracts right like what is this contract a you know a yam contract or is this contract an unknown contract i feel like these are the safety nets some safety nets that you've taken concretely and then some safety nets that the industry and ecosystem also needs to build out just for the betterment of the industry is there anything else that we that this industry could be doing better or anything else that you do differently now that that to make sure that you stay protected um no i don't think so i think that's a pretty good summary of things i mean i do i do believe that we should be moving more towards a multi-sig world um often it's quite challenging to interact from multi-sigs with d5 contracts not all of them kind of work too easy so um like the metamask ledger pattern is kind of pretty popular um and so you know um to the extent that we can get the usability higher on some of those things i mean it's still it's pretty good and we're going definitely going the right direction i'm not i'm not not saying we're not doing the right stuff but it is just probably a matter of time until we can um build those things out a bit more is has the the nexus platform been impacted by this at all or was this just something that impacted you personally no it's just impacted me personally i mean obviously there's a bunch of tokens out there that started selling on the market and stuff but um which does impact nexus members and you know that's not the greatest thing the world does for sure but um but the platform is entirely sound it's operating perfectly fine it's just there's a um another token holder out there basically well hugh thank you for coming on and and helping share this story and i think a lot of people will find this valuable when they try and you know learn how to protect themselves um if people uh want to help out nexus mutual or help out is there any anything that we can do to help with this with this uh this unfortunate event um no i don't i don't think so i think it's more just about um being aware of what this firstly be aware for yourself um i think that's the first thing and and secondly i mean i think the ethereum community in particular is really good at coming together and backing kind of the public good side of things and i think you know there's probably solutions some part of the solution here is going to be um particular projects and stuff but other parts of the solution are more public good oriented and so um where there's an opportunity to kind of um fund those or help that stuff out then yeah please please take it and you know get involved that way well hugh i always kind of give this similar metaphor in various different parts of the crypto world but there's the the first through the door metaphor where you know the the we're we have a revolution on our hands we're trying to build out a new financial system and sometimes some of the people that first get through the door first take the bullet take the first bullet well uh thank you hugh i guess for taking the first bullet for us and again i'm i'm i'm sorry that that this happened to you it doesn't no one deserves this to be happened to to anyone you've put a ton of sweat and toil into building out nexus and it's become a prime foundation that a lot of defy infrastructure sits on so you deserve all of the reward and upside and whatever upside we can we can give you that has been stolen from you i think we are going to do our best to make sure that that you know hugh the founder of nexus mutual uh who built something really really awesome and powerful uh gets that that upside somehow uh thank you very much yeah let's just just get out there review your security practices i mean it's it's a pain it's painful takes time but it's well worth it awesome well thank you for coming on and sharing your story go cheers hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to banklesshq right now to
