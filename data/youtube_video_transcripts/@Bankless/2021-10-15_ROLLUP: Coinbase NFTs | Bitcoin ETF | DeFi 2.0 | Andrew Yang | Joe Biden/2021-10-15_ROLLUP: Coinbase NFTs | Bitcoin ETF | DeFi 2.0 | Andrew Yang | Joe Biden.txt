hey bankless nation happy second week of october david what time is it it's roll up time ryan where we roll up the whole entire week of news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we do it every single week here on the friday bankless weekly roll up yeah we've got some crazy headlines for you one coinbase is rolling out an nft program what's that about we're going to get into the specifics also hester purse regulator who's been on bank list before just dropped a a fire piece absolutely loved it we're getting into the details of that and there's also rumor this week that biden is going to issue some kind of executive order maybe for crypto probably against crypto possibly we're gonna dive into what that could possibly mean it's a rumor now but there's lots to dissect there all of this and more that's what you're getting on the weekly roll-up but david i get i got to ask you before we dig in man how's your week going i feel like we've had a great week how has that just been me or did we have a great week i had a fantastic week uh there's a podcast that i listened to called yang speaks uh andrew yang shows up every now and then and it felt something similar like that this week but it felt it was a different format i was somehow involved with this one i don't know yeah dude guys we got andrew yang in the podcast is what david's saying and it was a fantastic episode we recorded this i believe on tuesday and you know we don't i generally don't get nervous about doing podcasts anymore but like you know some some guests who've never done before a little bit nervous prior to that not you know i was a little bit nervous going into the andrew yang conversation and uh there was absolutely no reason to be about like a minute in it just felt like talking to uh to a regular person and uh we definitely had a great discussion with him that podcast is now by the way isn't it out it's out for premium subscribers yeah if you pay for bank list if you pay for the newsletter it is out on the private rss feed so it's on your phone it's also the videos on youtube as well so you can go watch that right now uh and he dropped a fire line which here it is what is there for you know uh the crypto community in the forward party i want to make the forward party the crypto party truly that is awesome guys and that is just a taste of what you are about to listen to with andrew yang when you get that podcast beamed into your ears so we're excited to release that we're also excited about the permissionless conference david so a new tranche of tickets just went on sale if you recall we've talked about this on the roll-ups every two weeks a new tranche of tickets sell for permissionless this is going to be the largest defy conference i think that's ever been thrown and you still have a little bit of time because it's not until 2020 too but you also don't have time because these tranches sell out fast and every single tranche the price goes up i think the price is now up to like 364 dollars something like that number start it started at 15 guys all right so every two weeks this thing is increasing and if you don't do it now fast probably as you're listening to it probably this morning tickets will sell out so if you want to come to that conference dave and i are going to be there more than that we're actually helping to plan the entire agenda for the event covering defy covering the metaverse recovering regulatory landscape it's gonna be hot a bunch of speakers have been listed have been named but we have a lot more to come as well so make sure you pick up your ticket if you are a bankless premium subscriber you also get 30 off of that ticket so we'll include a link to that in the show notes another perk of going bankless premium it's been a ton of fun working with the blackworks team to organize this and we are trying to make this the cultural event of 2020 the crypto if you have ever gone to a crypto event before you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't you should definitely experience it but these events are festivals they aren't conferences they're closer to something like festivals and so uh not only is there going to be the conference but there's going to be a bunch of satellite after parties uh we are going to throw an after party uh and that is going to be a ton of fun uh and also um we are looking for specifically defy apps and dows to help sponsor the event we are holding back the floodgates of the cfi companies and the centralized exchanges of the world to get their sponsorships lost they they all want them but d5 companies d5 teams dows they haven't had this opportunity previously with able to sponsor events so if you are a dow be on the lookout for governance proposals in your governance forums about perhaps sponsoring the event so stay on on the lookout for that because we want daos and defy teams defy native teams to help sponsor this event and push them before all the c5 teams come and eat it all also last thing guys before we get into the meet today our our friends the sponsor pull together they are back and they've just released the fourth version of their product the fourth version the best version of their product pool together is a no-loss lottery guys it's one of the first defy apps to go tell your friends about because it's super easy like look at this interface incredibly easy to just join a pool and the best thing about it is when you join a pool like you can win the lottery david i have won the lottery before okay i've won a pool together lottery you know not a lot of money but i won something and it feels good to win all you have to do is put money usdc for example into the pools and pull together takes care of the rest it incentivizes you to save so it gives you a prize based on that there are some pool tokens that you can earn as well as yield and their version four is really hot because there's now more prizes than ever they're also releasing about a million dollars worth of additional prizes and you can do this all on layer two with near near-zero gas fees transaction fees and what they've done is they've combined the pools across like polygon and ethereum mainnet so if you deposit on polygon it's the same as depositing on mainnet now that is all new in version four so really hot we're really excited to introduce pool together to you guys and their fourth and greatest version and uh important to know that when you win the lottery you also get the cost of the ticket back so this actually has a very important point is that you aren't actually risking spending and you're not spending your money you're not spending your usdc uh you are getting you putting your money into a pool with a chance to win but you can always get your money back out that's why pool together is so cool that's the no loss part guys so if you want to check that out go to bankless.cc slash pool together and uh you'll learn more about that all right david you ready to do this man it's market time market time yeah that's a fun fun day to talk about the markets it is a fun day to talk about the markets okay let's let's talk about bitcoin bitcoin cr crept up to all-time highs close to all-time highs this week am i right about that yeah pretty pretty crazy right started the week at 53 700 which was also the low for the week and then it crept up to the high of fifty eight thousand five a hundred dollars where the all-time high i think is a little bit over sixty thousand dollars uh and then we are currently at fifty seven thousand two hundred and twenty dollars overall up four percent on the week a nice week for bitcoin how about ether ether was lagging at first but it seemed to have gained some ground over the last like day over the last 24 hours or so at the time of recording because just in time to get into the weekly rollout yeah it knew we were gonna talk about this you know so it's pumping for us so where did it start where did it end yeah start of the week at 3 430 which was also the low for the week and then it is that currently at its high for the week which is at three thousand seven hundred and eighty seven dollars we did touch uh a little bit right over three thousand eight hundred just a moment ago but that's where we are right now one of those up ten percent days you gotta appreciate that in crypto um also how are we doing on the ratio so this is the ether to bitcoin ratio always tells us a story what's it telling us this week yeah painting a higher low over last week the low for the last week was .06 ish and we are currently clocking in at .066 and so again still in that range-bound area that we've been in for the past like half a year now um but like i've been saying a a pretty high in the grand scheme of things versus bitcoin yeah it'll be interesting to know still the the rumor of the bitcoin etf continues to heat up you know people are saying october still might be the month for this there's rumors of that i'm not sure what i think yet but um that's why bitcoin it seems to have have led so much you have to wonder what's going to happen to this ratio if bitcoin comes out with a powerhouse etf will that leave every other asset in the dust and take all of the energy out of the the other crypto asset markets yeah funny story i'm in a just a group chat with all my friends from college and i uh dm them i was like guys i think the bitcoin etfs might be approved in october so i'm going to go long right now and then they're like you're going to buy bitcoin i'm like no i'm going to buy ether because bitcoin gets the etf like eth is also gonna pump yeah and it just it just might take some time so i wonder if that happens you think that happens immediately or do you think there'll be some sort of delayed effect where bitcoin has its run and then that cycles back into ether and we get the you know same thing we've seen hundreds of times already yeah i think if bitcoin gets the etf it'll have something like a 15 pump day eth will have maybe 10 it'll definitely lag behind but i think then right after the bitcoin etf people then speculate it's like well why not the ether etf and so the etf won't be far behind well if uh the sec is flirting with etf approval which i hope they are total locked value in d5 is also flirting with a hundred billion dollars locked we're at 95 billion so we can't yet celebrate david um it's got to be like any time now right just give it a day and that 100 billion mark might be reached so close to all-time highs on that anything else to say god if we have if i see a nine at this number this time next week in the roll up i'm gonna be angry i'm gonna be upset deserves to be higher d5 pulse index how are d5 tokens holding up and the this is of course are the top weighted defy tokens by market cap those that have been around for six months or larger longer there's some other criteria that go into this how are we looking on the week yeah start of the week at 336 dollars for that dpi hit a low of 305 hit a high of 352 and we are currently clocking in at 337 overall up half a percent on the week defy tokens just cannot catch a bid man do you know what's interesting though because there's this whole narrative of like defy 2.0 right we talked about it this week in our our tuesday state of the nation with um jay from rory capital this this whole concept of d5 2.0 or zoomer phi some people say this is just a new packaging for a narrative for a new set of protocols and it's just nothing more than narrative you know this is just sort of an evolution others say like j was making the case no this is where we defy 2.0 reevaluates uh token economics and puts on the accelerator on some growth things that the old older d5 has not what's your take on this because defy 2.0 tokens called the rari capitals of the world or the ohms they are not captured well in the d5 pulse index and they have been absolutely flying lately do you think this defy 2.0 narrative is a thing and a thing that's important and lasting i do think it's a thing and actually there's some bits of content that's coming down the pipeline to unpack what this hell that this defy 2.0 thing is i had a hour-long conversation with uh scoopy trooples from alcamix who talked about um this new primitive for yield farming that doesn't uh create toxic liquidity of people that just farm your token to death and then move on to a new farm instead there is a new primitive a new yield farming primitive which is being spun up by olympus dow who we're having on the state of the nation on tuesday zeus from olympus dow to talk about this new primitive which is being spun out out of olympus pro so alcomix is changing its yield farm primitive to this new mechanism and i talked about that with scoopy and so that show should be up on the youtube sometime soon-ish i think this weekend perhaps tomorrow and then we're going to unpack the whole entire thing with zeus from olympus pro on the tuesday state of the nation so tune in to that we are digging into this defy 2.0 thing so yeah stay tuned to that if you want to make up your own mind and whether this is a thing or not uh let's check out the the dpi index versus skip it skip it we can't skip it we're below 0.09 now david oh god what are we looking at this week oh god yeah point zero eight nine just a straight linear chart downwards like again can't catch a bit at least versus ether yeah all right well we don't have to believe at that point um let's move on to the bankless bed index that is up on the week i believe yeah so what's uh where did we start where'd we end started at 153 hit a low of 143 hit a high of 167 which is roughly where we currently are right now overall up five percent on the week so global crypto markets at in in medium at in mean average of five percent of the week never got it got it in the end layer to beat calm that's where we see this is kind of the the new total locked valley this is the new d5 pulse in some ways at least this metric is going to be super important it's at all time highs there's over three billion dollars locked in layer two we're not talking about side chains we're talking about layer twos that are actually secured by the ethereum network now at all-time highs it's pretty phenomenal great news yeah and i think this chart is just going to continue marching up and to the right it's arbitram uh it's dydx these are the over performers um optimism hanging in there but arbitrary dx just crushing it recently with with some of those numbers it's great to see um david let's talk a little bit about burn numbers eip 1559 because we just hit an important threshold that is 500 000 eth not 500 thousand dollars worth of beef 500 000 eath it's billions of dollars worth of youth have now been burnt okay we are just over two months into this thing and we're talking about like half a percent of the entirety of the east supply so listen to that again two months into eip 1559 and we burnt just about half of all the eat supply in existence already what does that make you think uh bullish i mean that's only there's only one answer like we're not even at proof of stake yet right man we're burning way more heath than we ever thought we would uh and we're still in our proof-of-work form which is issuing a ton uh and and yeah it's absolutely insane and like i i've even have of the opinions that like gas fees on the ethereum l1 are kind of like always up like it's always going to trend upwards over time uh and so like we are only going to burn more and more eth so congratulations to ethereum wow that we crossed five hundred thousand ether this week we're at 531 thousand ether yeah that's crazy that's crazy i mean it's just eath burns every day eath burns eve every day right like i feel like people need a reminder of this david right because like we're in crypto so often we want to chase narratives we're just like oh what's the new bright like shiny thing uh defy 2.0 oh okay it's uh eat killer which eat killer this week where's the hottest yield farm and that's cool if you have time for that like go do it go pursue it go try to make money that way but in the background what's happening with these core reserve assets what's happening with ether is it's just continuing to burn eth according to usage and it keeps getting used more and more and more and you know i had to fit this meme in david because i like this meme i was gonna fit in somewhere well my eyes went to the alpha that's in your dms right now oh shoot let me just close that real quick i love that you waited until you're done to say that yeah you know got some alpha that's only for youtube viewers though people in the podcast are going like what what just happened yeah well they're they also weren't able to look at the meme either so true okay well let's explain the meme it's good guy greg okay people don't remember this classic meme but it's good guy greg and he's taking your uh eath for gas but then what's he doing he's a good guy he's burning it yep giving it back in a roundabout way all right david this was an interesting report still in the market section of course uh report from coin shares and they asked the question of a whole bunch of fund managers so i'm not sure how much uh money these folks managed uh 400 billion okay you know respectable 400 billion dollars which digital asset do you believe has the most compelling outlook this is based in a september 2021 study uh number one ethereum over 40 number two a distant number two right bitcoin under 20 and then we have multi-asset which i don't know and then what surprises me is like twelve percent cardano yeah see like well while there's percentage while it's this great it's a great number forty percent like it believes for ethereum's gonna be the the most growing platform it just really just like takes the wind out of the sales when you see cardano collecting at ten percent well you know there's there's always some core fund managers who just have no idea what they're doing but here's one of the takeaways is what would this graph have looked like a year ago at this time david right yeah what do you think it would have looked like well it was in the middle of defy summer a year ago so maybe it was not east summer though do you remember at the time like uh even three era's capital were like d5 is great uh right yeah okay sucks is talking about everything bitcoin we are talking about the asset and i think that the script and the narrative has completely changed over the last 12 months particularly with institutional funds right eth is now an institutional grade right um asset i was i was thinking about bitcoin and eth they're now in in part of the same sentence uh every time when you see it listed some investors is buying it and that's a total change from where things were 12 months ago hey sometimes it's just ethereum there's plenty of instances i see where it's just like people i think ethereum's really awesome that's the full stop yeah full stop how many people own crypto i don't know if you've looked at this article yet david but i have but i'm gonna so i'm gonna ask you i'm gonna get your guess what do you think is the total population that owns crypto worldwide right now um close your eyes over 300 million did you just read that all right what percentage in america because you can't see that uh what percentage of america yeah 10 10 yeah about right nice uh the numbers out now you know different different groups have different numbers i've seen the numbers for america at about 12 percent but what's interesting about this is is sort of uh ranks it by by country right so 300 million people worldwide 10 of all americans own it say it's you know somewhere between 10 and 15 or so um look at all of the people in india who are crypto users wow do that sort of 100 100 million people in that's great that's great like where's bankless india david yeah we've been missing something that exists bengals india exists it does yeah yeah i think so who does that i think at least it's an instagram account bankless india pretty sure we didn't even know i mean like stuff like this pops up and happens and can happen without us which is absolutely awesome but i'm just saying global movement it's incredible to see the adoption and across all countries we're hovering at about 10 percent which is really good when we get to 20 when we get to 30 percent right these are population sizes that uh governments and population and you know those in power can no longer ignore because then to ban krypto do something against crypto you're actually like you're uh impacting the lives of millions of your citizens and potentially in india's case hundreds of millions of your citizens yeah i would like to know how much of these percentages are people that own bitcoin and ether versus what i would call fake crypto but i'll leave that topic for a different day well we don't know you know crypto put it in a big bucket there um eath held by miners david this is an interesting chart do you want to explain this yeah so this is a chart saying they're looking at the supply of ether held by known minor wallets and ever since the july of 2020 so a little over a year ago it has been on a very steep incline so it started in july 2020 at 8 million ether held by miners and now is basically climbed in a relatively linear fashion all the way up to 22 million that's a really high number especially for when the total supply of if there's like 120 million so there might be some interesting ways that coinmetrics figured these numbers out they might be inflated but overall directionally i think is really what is the important takeaway here is miners are stacking each which makes sense because they all know the the merge is coming and mining will be defunct at some point and so they need to retain their business and how do they do that well they stack as much eath as possible so when it comes time for proof-of-stake they can just stake their eth and go from a minor to a staker and actually not have to lose their business uh this makes a ton of sense to me this is another reason why i've always thought the the argument that hey miners when you switch to proof of work miners will just fork right well no they won't like they've known that this is coming and many of them are highly invested in proof of stake at this point right they've been they've been handling their eth for the day when it switches to proof of stake and it looks like they're continuing to buy continuing to hold their eth for that eventuality so they are part of the new community the new staking community they'll just some of them will be stakers rather than minors of course um david can you explain this one from justin drake oh he's throwing out the ultrasound stuff what's he showing us this time yeah yeah so this is a distribution of the average gas price for inside of blocks and so that the blue line is the average gas price um the red dashed line on the left is the ultra sound barrier as in how much gas prices need to sustain in order to be ultrasound money during proof of stake once we are at proof of stake so gas if gas is higher than 27 gway we are burning more ether than we are issuing currently the average gas price for ethereum is 77 gway and so justin drake's math is that we are at mach 2.8 as in we are burning 2.8 uh amount of times the amount of ether that we are issuing when we are under proof of stake so fun little graph right there so what that means is once the transition to proof of stake happens once the merge happens likely early next year maybe you know impartially slipping into the second quarter of next year anytime gas weight price is above 27 percent ethos deflationary or 27 excuse me eath is deflationary i haven't seen eath at below 27 gway in like a year right it's been several days do you remember that it's not it's not going to drop either because you know roll-ups are going to consume it obviously we've had other you know nft boom all sorts of things will continue to consume it's not going down um that's for sure all right david uh that has been the market section guys we will be back with news we will be back with releases meme of the week all the stuff that you cannot miss but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defy apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use d5 and now it's live with over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on the ethereum l1 sucks too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrom have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization that's why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrage if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage many defy applications that are on the ethereum layer one are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrage and some are even skipping over layer ones and deploying directly on layer twos there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.albertrum.io and start bridging over your ether or any of the tokens listed and start having a defy experience that you've always wanted all right guys we are back to tell you about the hot releases of the week david let's start here nft avatar support on ens profiles ens of course is like the domain name for ethereum lots of people have dot eth addresses now they've added nft avatar support what's that mean yeah so um you know those whole like generative little icons and metamask for your wallet just to let you know like putting a little color or image so you know what wallet is what ens is allowing you to put in a link to a file so that you can have a file represented as that little like icon of what your wallet is uh and so if when you type in an ethereum address a nice little icon can show up on uh wallets that support this so that's pretty cool this is why i think you know profile nfts are not going anywhere and they're only going to get stronger because we're going to find all of these new use cases for them because people want them everywhere if you bought one you want it everywhere right you might even put it on the wall behind you as you're recording a podcast oh that'd be weird yeah that'd be weird um let's talk about this flashbots protect someone's going to protect us from the sinister mev that is front running from miners and other entities tell us about that yeah so if you have ever logged on to a different evm network via meta mask like by dragging doing the whole drop down pointing to polygon or arbitrarily or a test net this is one of those it's an rpc endpoint and a few other things as well but i feel like the most relevant thing is the rpc endpoint so you can select a different rpm or pc endpoint and so it'll be routed towards this whole flat spot flashbots protect product which will allow your transaction to be protected from some of the monsters that lurk in the mempool and so that's pretty neat there are this is new so definitely do some research before you do this and i kind of do what i do which is i just wait for other people to do it first but overall there's uh there's also a few other things as well such as an api that developers can integrate into their applications to have the same sort of service um so if you want to learn more check the link in the show notes that's a pretty good resource though you know may try it sometime and uh and but yeah i like you i'm kind of waiting for it to cook a little bit more um speaking of cooking starkware has been cooking some things up starknet alpha is coming to mainnet you like that segway david um so what this basically is is kind of a holy grail that crypto has been waiting for and hoping for for a while at least especially the layer 2 community and that is the ability to have general purpose smart contracts on a layer two and this is a zk roll up layer two and starkware says they are shipping this in november okay they got alpha now when they ship it my understanding david is it's gonna be kind of a permissioned type of shipment so similar to the the roll-up of uh the rollout of optimism where it wasn't like everyone's here and you know it's just kind of an application at a time but still this is earlier than i thought and we are going to have the the starkware fork folks on sometime in november to explain this in further detail but i think that's what we're looking at here is the potential for smart contracts on a zk roll up layer 2. i don't think it's going to be super seamless like drag your app from maynet into into starkware and it just kind of works like that it won't quite be like that is my impression but the fact that we are this close to these functionalities is super exciting to me yeah and we're actually going to be able to see how easy it is for developers to get their application on a zk roll up which is um a little bit more involved than an optimistic roll-up um so that will be an interesting thing to watch and we will definitely watch it and look hey man the tech the tech is out there it's already working star wars tech is what powers um dx for instance right um many other exchanges as well in this space okay arbitrum is dialing it up as well i i feel like this gif kind of summarizes you know this is like this guy in a race car and he's you know he he's got wind resistance and his cheeks are flying back and it says my transactions after the arbor trim nitro upgrade i think this upgrade what it's going to do is just like drastically improve um you know transaction speeds transaction times transaction volumes and decrease prices on arbitram is that what's going on yeah that's exactly right they are just upping the juice with arbitrum and that's the cool thing about these layer two roll-ups is they actually come on to ethereum and they have their uh their own in addition to already being scaling of ethereum they have their own scaling roadmap in addition to that so layer two's only scale even more that's not here yet and tbd on when that date is but look forward to arbitrary nitro when that uh when that comes also david this is kind of cool tell us what this is is this some kind of a new d5 wallet yeah yeah it's a it's a perhaps a meta mask competitor or overall just a new wallet plus ecosystem a wallet ecosystem called xd5 which is now claiming to be the fastest wallet in d5 i've been having a ton of like trouble with my metamask lately so i could definitely use some alternatives there there were some grumblings in the great air community about how this wallet is not um their code hasn't been open sourced which is kind of against the ethos and makes it hard to verify what is actually going on under the hood but the team said that they will be ultimately releasing their code to be open source in the future just not yet overall uh if anyone has tried this out uh ping us bank list and let us know yeah more more wallets you know all the better i i do think our existing wallet ecosystem could use some improvements some user interface improvement um yeah i know some of the troubles with metamask have been like browser-related as well which has been somewhat frustrating like you know chrome changes a few things and then you lose support in chrome like i've had to use metamask with uh with firefox for a while now but um so much work could be done to smooth out the wallet experience across the space so it's glad someone else is joining the fray here um also another options d5 protocol joining the fray what's this david yeah pods pods finance on twitter says we are thrilled to announce the release of pods on the ethereum main net so pods is an on-chain options protocol to that aims to bootstrap markets for any erc20 token using an algorithmic pricing and specific options amm basically you can buy and sell puts and you can also use pods for a yield you can actually provide liquidity and get some yield and that is now live on the layer one which is interesting i kind of would expect something like this to be to kind of deployed on layer two first um but uh here it is on layer one so check that out at app.pods.finance pause for puts guys there you go nice clear down uh it's going mainnet what's that happening going on polygon yeah cleveland out and they clean the token go live on the polygon main net on october 18th that's this coming monday and so you can check out the announcement post for details we did a meet the nation with klima dao they're basically a fork off of olympus dow but focusing on having carbon credits as their collateral and so trying to sequester carbon using defy so a very noble cause and so if you want to find out more there's a link in the show notes why is this defy 2.0 sir i don't know what do you think i don't know i think it is i have no clue maybe we don't know what d5 2. i don't think yeah and we're in the process of discovering it uh binance chain is not d5 2.0 by the way i do know that but they have just binance has just launched a 1 billion that's billy be a billion with a b growth fund for binance smart chain and this just reminds me that um the tr the treasuries and the war chests are very very deep when it comes to the crypto banks particularly when they are trying to make their way into d5 and they are definitely not going anywhere binance chain is not going anywhere not because it's decentralized but because it has the support of cz and binance behind it um what do you think about this david yeah they're just like brute forcing the defy side of finance smart chain like it's uh it's it is what it is ultimately they're just innovating on the evm so all the value ultimately flows back to ethereum yeah hopefully some value will be produced here and it'll be a good thing i don't hate it i just don't love it i do hate calling it defy though and this like bastardization of the term like seedify just uh really annoys me but it's a large ecosystem and if you don't like it just ignore it don't use it last release of the week optimism has just updated their website and showcasing really all of the cool things they're doing this is the optimistic roll-up on ethereum called optimism david what's uh what are we looking at here yeah they just have a little like a scroll or carousel of all of the applications that are you can play with on optimism so it's going to be fun watching this number grow quinta i think is the newest one as well uh i did a meet the nation with cuenta which should be up on the youtube right now uh to let you know that quinta is actually doing its own thing out of synthetics and so that is worth watching as well and they are on optimism uh and that's that's the news uniswap synthetics uh lira rubicon cuenta and one inch one inch is a recent one as well very cool to see that growth uh raise time consensus is raising so these are the makers of metamask and many other tools uh they're kind of ogs in ethereum they're raising 65 million dollars i believe um at a three billion dollar valuation so a big race for them big valuation for consensus i guess good to see more money come into the space i i wonder how much this 3 billion evaluation rise on the back of metamask just absolutely printing money with their swap feature because they are just like raking it in with that one application right there's definitely other applications that are definitely making a lot of profit for consensus but like the they while they consensus kind of was critiqued with like spinning out a thousand projects all at once uh like and then five of them being successful those five have been really really successful uh so congratulations to everyone at consensus on that three billion dollar valuation yeah it's it's like the the baby turtles you know rushing towards the sea before they get eaten by the birds right you know you have tons of tons of turtles so hopefully some of them will make it to the scene some of them will survive that's sort of consensus strategy look also if you want to go long on metamask speculation that there's going to be a token which there's not yet but the the native swap feature for metamask is an on-chain footprint that metamask can find its users by so if you want to speculate on whether or not there will be a metamask token go use the swap feature i want to speculate on that david nine billion in trades through metamask which is absolutely blew me away that that feature would be so popular as well as he said i used to use matcha and i love matcha and i use matcha all the time but i've been using the metamath swap feature just on the speculation really yeah it's just quicker more convenient no no they're they're it's basically the same same price i kind of actually prefer the matcha ui and the engine they have more features but if there's a token at the end of my metamask swap i want surface another big raise this week gelato just raised 240 million dollars uh led by insight partners a lot of money what are they doing big number yeah gelato is smart contract automation as a non-developer this has been kind of confusing for me but basically there are some smart contracts that need to be poked or interacted with in order to make them execute and gelato's doing smart contract automation kind of feels like smart contracts for smart contracts um if i was a developer i wouldn't be able to explain this a little bit better but i'm not so i the way i think of it i have no idea if this is if this is right or not is like an if if there's then that sort of system for smart contracts you kind of wire these smart contracts together but do not know there's a lot of money they're doing something big here we'll see yeah congrats paradigm just raised 1.5 billion dollars too we've had people from paradigm on a number of times really smart investment shop i think one of my favorite vc shops in the space they just from a thinking perspective and the value that they add their portfolio um 1.5 billion dollars okay this is on the back do you remember was the a16z their crypto fund they just raised 2 billion 2.5 billion dollars something like that okay so much private money venture capital is going into crypto at this point in time so people are looking at like the private market for these deals like the private market is absolutely crazy like buying some of these uh investments before you know they tokenize or before they go public uh the valuations are sky high it's because all of this money is pouring in anything else david yeah the great thing about paradigm is that they use this money to fix some of the most core fundamental problems about this industry they uh you know dan robison apparently built uniswap v3 himself i don't know if that's true but they are also working to solve mav uh and some of these just core hard problems so when i see a 1.5 billion dollars going into paradigm i see 1.5 billion dollars of like just problem solving and defy so yeah that's awesome it's really good who else do they have david um uh savior of defy um white hat oh sam samson samsee's son of course yeah he works a paradigm as well but money into into him man him alone i mean that's like you know that's worth a third at least 500 million dollars in terms of protection for d5 um all right let's talk about this merit circle they just uh announced the closure of a seed raised round a 4.5 million dollars so this reminds me sort of of like ygg sort of one of those gaming guild type of concepts so i think they uh provide scholarships to maybe many axey infinity gamers so this is another play on crypto gaming i think we'll see a lot more in that space to come too um this next one david moonpay this is a crypto payment startup they're just valued at 3.4 billion dollars and this is after their first funding rounds you guys said these private valuations are getting absolutely insane if if you think coin market cap is crazy right and you know the top 20 list the private valuations are are getting similar this is a 400 million dollar round and i think what they're doing is um is this sort of similar to um ramp we were talking about their raise last week something like that yeah i think that's right i think that's right fiat on-ramp to crypto yep which i mean it's it's important is it 3.4 billion dollars i i don't know oh i don't know i'm sure you know somebody has thought that through it right david yeah right right definitely definitely the market would never be irrational that's right zora is its centralized open market place so i think this is maybe a bit more of a decentralized open sea although what is decentralized even mean in this case right but uh one thing that they're doing is zero percent fees on all of the nfts that they sell inside of their marketplace and it is entirely permissionless and also on chain sources it's how marketplaces should be but that zero percent uh fees thing is is certainly very interesting and very attractive so this is maybe a bit more of an open system um pushing against open seas massive dominant market share and i am happy to see more competition in the space the thing zora did recently is they only used to have these zora items right things that were launched inside of zora and now more recently they've added the ability to add all of these other collections like art blocks and you know everything from super rares and me bits and board apes and everything else that you find you could purchase it without a commission fee so it seems interesting openc is a great platform have nothing against them except for the fact that there's only one of them so having zora open up this world into having some competition and it's actually not the only one this week we'll be talking about another one here shortly uh but yeah congratulations uh to zoro let's also talk about uh trading view david um yeah that's a charting platform i know like you're a you're a power user right you do your ta you do your triangles i've seen you from time to time draw some shapes here and there you know yeah it's looking great so uh they just raised 298 million at a three billion dollar valuation i guess everybody's the unicorn now who cares about unicorns remember that remember unicorns that was a big deal it's a billion dollars anymore what's a billion dollars another billion uh anyway this is kind of cool i guess this is all about amateur traders you know the amateurs are becoming the professionals i think yeah and tradingview has an increasingly high higher and higher percentage of people that are looking at crypto stuff um and so they've been pushing up the crypto to the front you know more and more to the front of their offering and so uh trading view is kind of just becoming like crypto view trading view equals crypto view because you're doing all your trading in crypto these days if you're anything like us if you're also like us you probably want a job in crypto this is your weekly reminder weekly reminder tell them get a job get a job it's better whatever i'm sure your job is great but your future crypto job will be a lot better uh it's just the vibes are better the work culture is better you probably get to work at home you probably get tokens depending on what job you apply for and so go to palette dot x y z list slash bank list slash jobs or go to the link in the show notes to go get a job ryan what are some of the jobs that we got on the board today we had a cto on the board today from e uh our our grand nominal um sorry eo granum that is just difficult for me to say cto role though that's a premium role right there general counsel at smart d5 also finance and operations senior backend developer at smart defy you could be a technical cto for six months at merit you could be a community manager at argonne you could be a founding blockchain engineer a founding one at that highlight senior software engineer popcorn community lead popcorn senior front end web developer here's what crypto needs okay it needs developers and it needs community builders those two skills it also needs by the way like managers you know operators project managers that's what you see represented on the bank list job board and these skills are probably skills that many of our listeners have you know i know we have developers listening to this i know we have people who are highly organized ability to put together projects um they're looking for people who quite frankly listen to bankless david i've heard people like in job interviews this has come up like what do you read about crypto how much do you know what information do you consume and when you tell them bankless it's going to get you positive marks so you're already doing part of this by listening to bank lists right now so why not take the next step and see what's out there in the job market um i don't feel like i'm working anymore do you no no like what is it it's not work what do we do here well for some reason i'm i'm like doing whatever it is i'm doing for like 12 hours a day but it's some combination of work and fun and that is the quote the whole point about working in crypto is like it's more of just a vibe it's a definitely a work hard play hard environment and it's not ever work and it's not ever play it's something in the middle yeah it is something in the middle and there's got to be a new term for that but i don't know what it is but vibe yeah vibe five and a half five for now all right guys we're jumping on the news we got three big things to hit first coinbase nft second hester purses speech third what about biden is he going to crush crypto let's start with the first david coinbase nft it's coming soon they're starting an nft marketplace you can join the waitlist brian armstrong tweeted out they've got one million people already who have joined the waitlist excited for what coinbase is going to do in the nft space what's happening here david yeah so they are making a competitor to ftx's uh nft platform so this is a centralized nft platform with you know that's hooked right into exchange where you already have your your crypto monies uh and so now coinbase is basically making a competitor to open c that is much more centralized i guess custodial open c um and i think that's actually it's just going to do a lot of uh onboarding efforts right and so actually so david we don't know whether it's going to be purely custodial or not do we i mean to be fair at least i don't um it doesn't say yes i would guess that it is definitely i i understand that assumption but we don't know for sure right right this could be also non-custodial and they could be like minting on layer two they could be minting on ethereum it could be through their their non-custodial coinbase wallet one thing they will have that openc doesn't when we talk to to to devin about this um finzer from openc is coinbase has a fiat on ramp right right and openc is just you start with ether you know you can't on-ramp so coinbase has that advantage of the gate but um i'm actually excited to learn about how this is going to be built because we don't know all the details yet yeah if you can put an nft on a credit card via coinbase that would be kind of cool actually do you remember so dangerous some people are saying this this feels like um when coinbase first listed eth back in 2016 right it's kind of a mainstreamy moment i suppose for ether as an asset i'm prior to that had been bitcoin maybe some other assets um coinbase is definitely jumping into this because nfts are here to stay and they are mainstream and um and you know coinbase wants a big part of this market so we'll have to see actually brian armstrong is coming on the podcast yeah we scheduled it that's great so we're going to be talking about this i'm sure we'll talk about this i'm sure we'll talk about regulatory matters a lot to talk with brian about we've never actually had him on the podcast so um excited about that anything else good timing to talk about that with him uh post launch of this nft platform it also looks like it's going to be a social media platform too so you get a profile with a name and you can follow people which is interesting so coinbase not only getting into nfts but also getting into social media that's a big move yeah it's a big move very cool uh over a million people signed up now of course another big move is hester purses speech so hester purse um sec commissioner one of the mom is one of five sec commissioners uh seven five or six to the seven you keep talking about it well david just called her crypto mom and you know she would be fine with that we we actually asked her when she came on the podcast and the reason she is crypto mom and the the industry has five then david's saying five sec commissioners the reason the industry has deemed her crypto mom is because she has been supportive of the values that the crypto industry is trying to provide she has engaged with the crypto community not treated us as outsiders and scammers and children children yeah not patronizing actually like digging in and so we had around the podcast i guess earlier this year and i think this was before we knew it was definitely before we knew what gary gensler how what his reaction was going to be and i was back when everyone was optimistic about gary gensler we asked her and i remember it's like we're kind of like trying to feel around uh you know uh commissioner purse do you think gary gensler is going to be helpful to this industry or not and she i i don't think genuinely she knew right and she didn't commit and she said we will get clarity that's one thing we'll get i recall her saying that i kind of miss the old days now you want the non-clarity part i know i'll come back i'll go back and take it back let's get to the speech though because this speech was fire like absolutely this is at the texas blockchain summit she came there she talked and the analogy she used david the west going west we are headed west um she talked about a book that she read called the pioneers about the early i guess uh you know settlement of of the west um and how people moved from the east you know what i'm just going to read some quotes here because i think it's that good the settlers who moved west came not only with high expectations but with a whole range of talents and professions they cultivated other skills by necessity after they had arrived the society was rougher than the one they had built but nevertheless it was governed by the societal norms they carried with them by law and by mutual concern heightened by the difficult conditions in the early years and she goes on she talks about how the people who are headed west were headed to escape kind of the the paralyzed stifled stymied east coast elites basically where there's no opportunity for them that's why they were going to greener pastures and and settling new lands and establishing cities okay so she paints this whole story and she says i am you know part of that story ohio uh that that's where i live that's where i kind of grew up that's where i went to school that's what america's tradition has been and then she pauses and she says guess what crypto's doing the same thing it is the journey west it is the modern journey west that the crypto industry is on and she says sure it's home to a lot of code slingers she says and speculators and some hucksters too this new west has all sorts of fights friendships are forged and uh she says it's just like the the west of the past is rough and tumble but so much value and so much good is being created there and then she goes on to say do we really have legal clarity around digital assets i think some in her you know in the regular regulatory bodies would say that's perfect legal clarity right i've heard these statements like of course we know what what a security is in crypto right 1946 howie definitely it's obvious should be obvious with the security and she said i don't know do we really have legal clarity then she says are we enforcing rules by settling or settling for ambiguity so what we want is clarity are we settling for ambiguity she poses the question are we fighting for investors or fighting for jurisdiction wow that's powerful she's asking the question this is a regulator are we protecting investors or denying investors opportunity okay right these are the speech headlines okay you guys have to go read this entire speech um are we going to pretend everything is centralized so we can regulate it hitting hard yes this is so awesome it's amazing are we catching bad actors are we creating a catch-22 are we creating conditions where it's like impossible to identify the bad actors where everyone's a bad actor and she goes on her conclusion okay the best part her conclusion actually the whole speech is the best part um but she ends with this to paraphrase to paraphrase the standard closing words of a popular crypto podcast uh which follow an appropriate warning about the riskiness of the space we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone dot dot dot and she says thank you for allowing me to drop in on your journey west that footnote if you go and click there oh who she quoted bankless weekly roll up youtube last week wow dude i have chills right now wow right that is crazy commissioner purse if you or your office is listening this is why uh we are so appreciative of the work that you're doing you are asking the questions that other regulators have not been willing to ask of their agencies and of their approach on this space and we sincerely appreciate it i sincerely appreciate this speech you were saying far more eloquently everything we had hoped to say to um to this industry in the regulators and this is posted on sec.gov as a speech a commissioner's speech powerful stuff sorry david i i wanted to go through all of that it's just it's just such a such a hot speech i just love it yep you know it it it definitely feels like like the the whatever we talk about on banklist is coming out of the words of hester purse in one of the most important rooms in the world when she was giving that speech and i think my my one comment about this thing it's it's not just arguing about the technicalities about clarity and like rules and these catch-22s it's also talking about the the the culture right she's talking about cryptoculture and why we want to go west in the first place i wha why are these why are there these motivated groups of internet code slingers which is a great name and why why are they motivated to be crypto people at all why are they motivated to go to the metaphorical frontier of wherever that frontier is which is no longer anywhere except now it's on the internet why are these people motivated to escape the the perils of of already instantiated society this is because we're no one feels free anymore everyone has this motivation to go westward uh and and escape the the the problems of eastern society of rules and regulation and tyranny right and so she she gets the the culture cultural aspect and talks about like i i hope people listening to the speech ask themselves the questions why are there these deeply motivated people who are going on this westward journey because if they can answer that question maybe they can come to terms with um some of the better strategies to regulate this industry well said well said you know uh there's more we could say but i think what you should do is take some time to read this entire speech uh david third thing of the week is biden going to crush crypto i guess that's a question outstanding i can't pull up the bloomberg article right now but um there has been talk of an executive order that biden and the white house are are creating um to provide some oversight on everything in the crypto markets everything that's going on what this executive order might be people are speculating perhaps it's sort of an executive order to uh all agencies to go do some more research uh and go you know ask some other questions but one of the issues that they have identified is there's no overarching you know crypto czar as they called it in this bloomberg article somebody that spans all agencies and can look at this industry and what's going on in crypto holistically right and what's interesting is this comes on the the backdrop of a lot of executive branch regulatory agencies that have been particularly aggressive to crypto uh lately at least it seems that way coming from the sec um coming maybe from other agencies as well treasury with um uh the uh the recent bill injecting that language and the infrastructure bill for instance right so we're you know those those in crypto are kind of bracing themselves for like some not good news now it doesn't mean there's going to be immediate executive order to to do all these things they'll probably be research first but you know it was crazy what struck me uh from this uh this article david let me let me read the paragraph because i know where you're about the paragraph okay because this is this is crazy okay so the paragraph is tim wu a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy has knowledge in the area the area being crypto but is recused from working on crypto because of his personal holdings which included between one and five million dollars in bitcoin and as much as a quarter million dollars in file coin as of when he filed his financial disclosures earlier this year so there's one guy in the white house that owns a bunch of crypto and he had to recuse himself from even being a part of this conversation as to what this executive order might look like the one person in the white house that holds and their probably understands crypto can't partake in the conversation whoops uh oh this is what's hilarious to me this is the irony right because the article concludes with that it says basically that the trouble the white house is finding is we can't find anyone who knows anything about crypto except this one guy tim and tim can't do it because he knows about crypto and he's and he's bullish because he knows about it nobody else knows about it the one guy who knows about it of course he owns crypto right because he knows about crypto the most thing about crypto is to be understood the guy that understands it is bullish and can't guide legislation talk about catch-22s because if anyone actually understands crypto i would argue that they are they therefore become bullish enough to actually own some to actually buy some crypto and if they buy some crypto they have to recuse themselves from the process of being a crypto czar and actually informing policyholders over because they're biased the logical conclusion of this is just hilarious right and so like if you just extrapolate this out like the only people that are allowed to like make policy are people that are invest in dollars right like you only have dollars in the bank account and the banking system the existing banking system these are the people without bias yeah crazy absolutely backwards well you know uh you you and i none of our listeners could ever i guess do this job because we are all uh we all own crypto assets and so i think they're going to find a increasingly shrinking pool but i guess the tragedy of this is what they have to do is is find someone who doesn't know about crypto or like i guess feels like maybe they missed the boat on crypto and you know some people get bitter in that experience right and um it's likely they're pulling from that pool of candidates the person who's going to regulate crypto somebody who maybe already hates it right oh you guys got a 10 000 x gains on your crypto well i and i didn't i'm gonna regulate that until it goes back down to zero this is the problem guys so i i don't know how to solve that i understand there are things like conflicts of interest you have to deal with but to know crypto i would argue is to be bullish on crypto and what are you going to want to do you're going to want to have some allocation your portfolio in it so what do we do about that this is why government can't attract talent because if you want to express your talent and like generate wealth and capital you government is like well no no no no crazy yeah absolutely crazy all right let's get to some ethereum stuff those are our leaders but let's talk about german auto firm is becoming the first european uh eu to eu auto firm to use the ethereum a blockchain to finance cars what's what's going on here yeah so in the press statement the germany-based firm noted that the moved aims to eliminate all the paperwork in facilitating its core business of car financing which is interesting because this is a you know defy crypto ethereum actually executing on the original vision of the internet which was totally to remove pen and paper from all offices except like that never actually happened and the reason why that never happened is our because we didn't have crypto we had our traditional pen and paper based financial system and so the internet never actually made offices paperless anymore but now we can with crypto and so i think this is just going to be the first of many companies to start to use ethereum smart contracts to finance stuff they're not using d5 they're using custom um smart contracts but the point is is they're using smart contracts in the original like a way that they were intended as contracts between two parties two counterparties yeah it's so true david like all of the all of the you know pen and paper stuff that that we see nowadays right um that's going to be uh programically driven in the future it's going to be smart contract driven right so like we think right now what's a digital contract well that's a pdf you receive on docusign and you can sign digitally no not in the smart contract world in the smart contract world that document doesn't even exist because the majority of it is code and is actually executed on a blockchain somewhere so it's cool to see somebody getting back to to those routes um polygon is hitting its minimum it's increasing its minimum gas price by 30x and this is in a bid to foil spammers is the article title what's going on with polygon the sidechain yeah last week was the monolithic blockchain week and this is another tip of the hat to how if you just have a juice up blockchain you ultimately are going to collapse back down to a database or you need to increase fees and so you have to increase fees if you want to preserve any amount of decentralization and so that is what polygon ultimately was forced to do because you know if you have very very cheap block space spammers and people can just throw in trash into your chain because you don't actually have any way to meter consumption and then if you want to do that and sustainably you have to go back to a database or you increase fees to make actually spamming the chain really really expensive and so polygon has chose in the commitments towards staying decentralized by increasing fees and i bet you this is actually not the last time that they actually have to increase fees i think we're going to see this happen again in the future my understanding is actually they're going to turn this over to a mechanism so this time they did it sort of manually by increasing gas price fees but they're going to have like a mechanism like eip1559 that's going to sort of mechanistically increase or decrease gas fees based on demand so it'll get smarter in the future but yeah i mean you have to increase gas fees or else these systems do not work in the long run this is an interesting conundrum that maker is starting to ponder as well um where do they pay taxes where does the maker dow pay taxes what jurisdiction does it belong to the maker foundation has dissolved of course what's left is this protocol geography unknown geography internet so they're having this debate david in their forums about how do they address kind of the tax issue right um do they just get ahead of this and say yes we are a an american registered a c corp right or an llc or something well then they'd be subject to the laws of the u.s and the laws of the u.s don't handle daos very well they'd be treated as a partnership do they pick another territory and try to get ahead of it that way do they wait for the jurisdictions to come to them and say say you know 10 15 different jurisdictions say oh yes i see you have members in france and and you know the spanish government comes in spain and the irs comes and says you have people in america and they all claim territory and they all try to extract tax from maker dow so what does it do about this and the form force is interesting because they don't really have a clear answer because there is no regulatory clarity or regulatory status for this new internet native institution that they are running right now quite the conundrum listeners might be asking themselves why does a d5 app even want to care about paying taxes like isn't the whole point supposed to be like you're actually not domiciled anywhere you're domiciled on the internet maker dial is a little bit of a different case because maker dao wants to include real-world assets into its collateral into its faults right and so if you have real world assets somewhere well those exist in jurisdiction so maker dao has always had as part of its just like vision to be integrated into the real world which then kind of lends itself like all right well where and so that conversation shall continue yeah it's definitely a conversation that many of the dows are starting to have right now in maker dell because it is most mature as having it first um more good news from the devs the the protocol devs of ethereum what's uh what's this news here david yeah i was joking about this with anthony cesano this is just that that time of the year where all the ethereum developers get together and they make all their uh clients speak to each other we talked about this on the roll-up uh last week um for the non-technical people the the vibe is just like oh yeah you see all the developers smiling and clapping and looking at code on a screen so like hey yay the developers are happy the developers are doing things and they're happy and also this is just a really cool picture you have all these different client teams uh all looking at the same screen all like taking photos just clapping being happy it's like it's like a nice like you know cultural event and then you also of course have vitalik right in the middle uh doing the classic vitalik metallic pleased clap metallic it must be pleased and he should be pleased this is happening very fast looks like it's going very well and this is all the march towards the merge which is ever so important for ethereum visa in other news moving beyond ethereum they are launching an nft program as well what's this yeah so they are not sending nfts through the visa payments network that's not that's not what's going on it's more it's more of like a nft incubation studio yeah they're trying to just help support artists and and you know celebrities and people uh do nft stuff which is an interesting like divergence from their core competency their core business model but i'm i'm into it i feel like one thing visa is trying to say is like hey guys we like crypto we're serious about it right they just like buying a crypto punk you know releasing white papers about new crypto interoperability protocols they're just like hey we believe in crypto we think it's the future we want to be part of it uh so good positive vibes coming from visa these days positive vibes yeah uh what about this crypto startup cb no crypto startup strikes a deal with uh viacom cbs wait that could lead to spongebob and south park nfts yeah dude yeah so we talked about this i think two roll-ups ago uh steve cohen uh that billionaire is invested in this nft uh platform and apparently this nft platform got linked uh you know billionaires they tend to have connections yeah they linked them into cbs right yeah and so uh the studio that owns the rights to sponsor and south park might issue nfts importantly and this is this is where i'm gonna get emotional here they they uh don't they're they brand themselves the nft studio brands themselves as a multi-chain uh studio right we'll issue nfts on all the chains if they i'm gonna swear so turn turn off you have kids if they list the spongebob nft anywhere that's not on ethereum i will actually die i will because i'm if the spongebob nfc gets minted and on ethereum i'm literally selling unreasonable amount of my ether to buy that spongebob nft and this is how nf teams works right right you don't everyone is skeptical on nfts until nft some nft comes that like they actually really really want you must list the spongebob nft on ethereum or i will die someone whoever has a connection to this nfc company please get me in contact with them because i want that spongebob nft and it needs to be on ethereum how are you gonna die are you just like gonna die of a broken heart you're just gonna give up on like it's just hard like yeah broken exactly broken heart yeah it'd be shame if they did that if you're if you're gonna do this do it right so maybe uh somebody from vicom is listening to us right now don't kill don't kill a man don't kill david okay he's he's a valuable co-host we need him for the bankless revolution that is coming all right uh just issue your your nfts in the right place ethereum or layer two my mom was very strict about no tv at the dinner table um but she always made the exception for saturday morning spongebob and so like yeah spongebob has a very close place in my heart there you go all right uh some of these nfts are launched in tokens though board api club why are they doing that what do you think about it yeah the the why are they doing that is probably just financial incentives right so like if you have a community of board apes or you have a community of like the cyber cons and these things become really really valuable what can you just mint a token and that is like the currency for this nft thing and how does that leave a governance token though like maybe it could be whatever the community does next can be whatever it wants right and so like well so like imagine if all these board apes or these cyber kongs all collectively had like a currency that had like a 50 million dollar market cap that therefore is their treasury to do stuff right uh and so yeah there's also nft projects are issuing currencies yeah uh and so i have a take on this later in the show but more or less it's like well we're kind of creating like our own like civilizations right like we have our people we have our societies there are the profile pictures and now we have the money uh what happens next aboard ap nation board uh society basically yeah uh yeah it could happen erc721s they can't resist the erc20s can they no one can matt hogan says the new york stock exchange just filed for a bitwise bitcoin etf that's cool a bitcoin etf new york stock exchange all right and it holds not futures that are settled in some other currency it would hold actual bitcoin and that goes through why that's important in a 100 page analysis of course uh well done bitwise theme new york stock exchange all right again the pressure's mounting right can the sec continue to deny some of its favorite institutions on earth possibly the banks now coming to them fidelity uh saying hey we'd really like a bitcoin at nft it's time new york stock exchange saying it who's against this at this point oh my god i got two of the letters right i guess yeah so i mean i it feels like it's over everybody who doesn't want an etf at this point right who gary gensler might be the only guy just gary all right so he'll do it he'll do it this is interesting david i think this is uh there's a couple stories about this but um bitcoin mining crackdown of course in china in summer these miners moved somewhere some of them moved to kazakhstan i believe but a lot of them moved to the us and so a lot of this mining institution is now us-based what's going on here yeah the united states of america has the largest share of bitcoin hash power clacking clocking in at 35 of all bitcoin hash power now domiciled in the united states which is nice because that makes it easier and easier to make the case for adopting bitcoin into the legal system the financial system all all the things that have been resisting bitcoin the more and more it becomes domiciled in the united states the more and more united states regulators are happy about that and uh more and more infrastructure more like one of the big things that has been allegedly holding the atf back is that btc price discovery has been happening offshore has been more and more moving onshore so the more things about bitcoin that come to the united states the better uh and in the united states now the number one uh domiciled hashrate uh operator of bitcoin yeah that's been holding the nft back all this time uh you know what's cool about this is this is actually a prediction that bitcoiners made and i think they're right about it's the game theory of like trying to ban bitcoin in your country it doesn't work because some other jurisdiction just adopts it yep and becomes more powerful so it's to your disadvantage to go and ban cryptocurrency and adoption interesting thing is happening with d5 as well as china continues to contract its regulation and squeeze its vice grip on defy and crypto writ large it just moves elsewhere or it goes underground and becomes a secret and that's china's disadvantage the us did the same it would be to the us's disadvantage david interesting story this week in forbes i think it was the cover story i think uh sbf sam bankman freed made the forbes magazine banquet emphasis emphasis on the bank i guess um the guy's worth 23 billion dollars now and he made this all in crypto over the past three years so you know that takes some doing but one part of this story that fascinated me was something i'd always kind of expected but i didn't really go into detail about sbf because uh you know he has me blocked on twitter even though i've never interacted with a guy really yeah did you know that are you blocked on twitter uh i don't think so maybe i might be yeah i don't know i've never interacted with uh sbf you know i'm you know fairly nice on twitter i don't like i don't get into scuffles very often and i'm blocked but that's a side aside the point interesting thing oh yeah i'm blocked i'm blocked yeah i'm you obviously said something to him oh yeah it got us both blocked uh here's a quote from the article beggman freed is no crypto evangelist he's barely even a believer he's a mercenary dedicated to making as much money as possible he doesn't really care how solely so that he can give it away he doesn't really know to whom or when okay that makes sense to me it all makes sense there are people who are in crypto for the mission there are other people who are in it because they're mercenaries and they're trying to make the most amount of money possible and then leave they don't actually believe in the values that we talk about in bankless or they value those things very loosely what they prioritize is making the most money possible maybe if you give sbf the benefit of doubt he's going to give it all away and that would be an act of altruism and that would be a great thing possibly not a great thing for crypto at the end of the day david i believe many of these people are short-term rent extracting entities i believe some of the crypto banks will end up being that way as well and i don't like i do believe in this industry okay right like you can make money in this industry and that's fantastic i hope we all make lots of money there's tons of opportunity we should make money where we can but we should not sacrifice our values in order to make that money like i am here for a larger purpose than that and i think many of you listening are but it's important to note that not everyone else is and i don't judge sbf i'm just i appreciate that transparency okay it's not my life like not my life choice we're going a different path many of you are going a different path you're here not just for the money you're here for the greater purpose of crypto which is to decentralize the world to create a better open money system for our kids and for our grandkids hopefully to unscrew all the broken institutions and protocols that are so freaking screwed up right now that's why you're here maybe some people aren't okay but like what pisses me off is when people like they go to him for guidance on the layer two or the layer one of choice for instance right spf's backing of solana quite frankly for me is a huge turn off of solana right okay so a mercenary backs your project right that's not what we want who cares right the the self-admitted non-believer of the values and drivers of what makes cryptocrypto is backing solana like i'll just i'm not no comment after that like you you take that before what you what it is let's move on well you know what spf you should unblock us and you should come on the podcast and we should discuss it and we should talk about it turns out i'm not blocked yeah it's just you yeah it's just you thanks for that just me uh you know what's interesting this ties into our earlier conversation senator lumus actually just disclosed a bitcoin buy of a hundred thousand dollars you learn about crypto you get bullish yeah i mean senator has has always been bullish he was the first senator to put laser eyes on uh so she's always been a bullish individual um but uh i mean don't don't stop buying yeah i mean yeah it's interesting though right it's like the question does that bias you or not it's a longer discussion is people think that no one in congress should actually own stocks i'm like i i don't know what okay so cool you're just going to drive away all of congress so they can be wealthy i guess right i mean stocks are america's savings account you want to put their money in the bank like what you're asking them to i don't understand anyway longer discussion maybe there's a debate there at some point in time so rare is under investigation as a gambling platform what does that mean david yeah yeah so so rare is that fantasy soccer platform also expanding into other fantasy leagues as well and so because you can make like predictions about the future outcome of things and make money off of that they are being deemed a gambling platform by regulators uh statement in response to this by so rare that says we are very confident so rare does not offer any forms of regulated gambling this has been confirmed by expert legal opinions at every stage since the company was founded so um something to watch uh no real you know breakaways other than that uh we'll see what unfolds all right we're going to burn through these next ones a16z they are coming to washington and pushing crypto policy big venture capital firm uh they have some connections behind them the calvary is riding into dc i guess what that that's what that means and i hope they uh they're able to convince some people uh stripe is hiring for crypto which is neat uh stripe the payments company the the company that disrupted a bunch of other payment providers by just like something like 10 lines of code is now helping trying to build the future of web 3 payment so if you want to work at stripe and you want to work in stripe crypto go apply i guess do this one too yeah oh alchemix yeah alchemix says uh out of the twitter count the future isn't written stone but rather arises from the cumulative blood sweat and tears of dreamers on a mission we proudly present our roadmap to transmute alchemics and defy along with it get a sneak preview of the future in our article tldr alcomixv2 is coming also tune into that conversation with scoopy triples on the bankless youtube uh it's coming sometime this weekend and also take a peek under the hood as what's coming in this document that they have very cool last one for the week a report in that blockfi they released a credit card their customers spend at a rate five times of uh other like legacy traditional credit card holders so what's interesting to me about this is because they all got crypto rich okay but what's interesting to me about this story is like when this is about the time where the banks uh wake up and they're like oh all the crypto people that we kicked off of our banking system we didn't support we didn't provide service for oh uh our time instead supporting the wealthy and the rich uh oh these crypto people are rich now and like they're going to start trying to incorporate crypto back into the banking fold and krypto is just gonna be like yeah basically and crypto's just gonna be like nah we don't need you guys see ya i'm closing my wells fargo account mm-hmm forever yep going bankless block five is not paintless but you know it's it's on that path yeah it's it's a yeah right uh-huh guys we'll be right back with the takes of the week but

v2 and to get involved in governance all right guys we are back with the takes of the week david let's start with this hot take from davidhoffman.eve at christmas state great guy all dows are ultimately steps to become digital nations i feel like you said something like this earlier in the episode what did you mean yeah yeah i think the logical conclusion of digital organizations is to have your own currency your own perks your own infrastructure your own like reason and values for being i think you know what starts off as a doubt the logical conclusion of where these goes are digital societies digital civilizations digital nations nations in the cloud so each dao is its own country its own digital nation uh and it's all just trying to grow its nation together with the community and when you say nation you're talking about like a community right so these could be like tiny nations your nation could be like 100 people in your dow if that's what it is right or could you and you could be part of multiple nations as well totally yeah each one is its own civilization with its own purpose and it's going to grow its you know nation as as much as it can that's why we call it the bankless nation don't we who's this guy you know he's he's a turtle so he's got to be someone important okay definitely not got to listen to him yeah sure comment this turtle turtleman says this isn't the 1990s for crypto this is the 1790s we've just written our own constitutional protocols and we get to build our digital nations hey digital nation yeah i just think and somebody should write an article about this i just need to school up on my us history before i feel confident writing an article about this but i feel like this is very much um like just you know at the kind of the the end of the renaissance sort of that time period where revolutions were happening right so existing uh tocracies and tyrannies uh were being called into question and people set out for freedom it reminds me of the early american republic and the like the founding fathers of the american republic i mean they were you know learned people they sort of knew what they were doing but they were like in their early 20s man like many of them some of them were 19 like alexander hamilton was like 21 years old or something right in the revolution when they came to write this document this protocol for governing a new nation state that's exactly what they were doing right they were writing a new protocol and i feel like that's what we're doing in crypto right now and we're at the very early stages of it we have the skeleton of this decentralized the set of decentralized protocols and now we're starting to build everything on top of it um unlike the analog world this is gonna happen so much faster all right so you know we've done the revolution part i guess that was the you know the bitcoin now we've written some of these core constitutions and we're going to you know spin through the 1800s and 1900s and pretty soon i think crypto is going to have an economy that rivals the largest nation-state economies in the world but it's kind of what we're building is this new you called it a digital nation a new digital nation for uh you know freedom of expression for property rights so it's the 1790s it's not the 1990s uh that's the take very in line with the whole crypto renaissance concept that uh we had that one podcast on the the 1990s trope just for people who uh i don't want to miss that the the line is that like you know we are going through the evolution of the internet but now we're doing it for crypto so people say oh we're in like the early 90s of the internet evolution and that's what that's what ryan is referring to and i've said that before too to be fair i think that's and both both are true both are true yeah but but what you're saying is the whole like we're at the genesis of a nation take is less appreciated and that's why it's a take agreed agreed uh tim swanson so okay well actually this is a take that vitalik buterin has maybe we should go straight to the source i'm gonna read it this is a reddit post he made i think this was on a something about uh buchelli so somebody was speaking out against mckelly and uh his support of bitcoin and bitcoiner's support of him this is of course the the president of el salvador and um vital computer in response and says nothing unpopular about that opinion making it mandatory for business to accept a specific cryptocurrency is contrary to the ideals of freedom that are supposed to be so important in the space additionally this tactic of pushing bitcoin to millions of people in el salvador at the same time with almost no attempt at prior education is reckless and risks a large number of innocent people getting hacked or scammed shame on everyone okay fine i'll call out the main people who are actually praising him shame on bitcoin maximalists who are uncritically praising him and of course if anyone else had said this this would have just passed by the wayside but because vitalik buterin said it you know publicly in a form i think bitcoin maximalist went crazy i saw this headline just about everywhere vitalik speaks out and you know people angry and i'm calling him a hypocrite and all of these things so that's what actually happened david what's uh what's your take on this yeah the bitcoiner reaction to this was that this is just vitalik like talking badly about bitcoin and being upset about bitcoin adoption right and so they they really turned it around and made it about bitcoin not about the authoritarianism of bukele which is exactly what vitalik is talking about right like deflecting the whole authoritarian thing is like no no no vitalik you just don't want bitcoin to be adopted because you have like bias against it and you want ethereum to be a and which is completely beside the point we saw alex gladstein who i've had my tussles with on twitter because i think he is a bitcoin maximalist hiding behind a human rights advocate in disguise and he says on twitter andres didn't even bother uh criticizing bouquet's human rights record v vitalik's harsh words were against bitcoin adoption because he doesn't like bitcoin not because he cares about el salvador that's what vitale's point is that he literally is only caring about el salvador and bitcoiners aren't which kind of just proves the point it totally appears the point you know what they're also totally wrong against about vitalik if if this had been the ethereum community and this was ethan instead no question in my mind vitalik would have been calling out eth and probably like 10 times as harshly as this and you know much more publicly about the same sort of thing so people who think this is just like bag bias or anti-bitcoinerism they don't know vitalik and you know i mean they're just spinning this for for their own narrative so it looks a fair point from vitalik i don't know what do you think about it david what do you think about b kelly's move um and this whole bitcoin adoption thing is this actually good for the people of el salvador is this even good for bitcoin we asked this uh same question to nick harter when we had him on the state of the nation to help unpack this el salvador knows and he i think said it right where he taught said it this is a fair critique this is a fair criticism uh and so there are some bitcoiners out there good good ones like nick carter who i think are on the right side of this whole debate um and well the cool thing about what el salvador did is they went from one legal currency to two legal currencies that's like that that's one more option but what they could have done is just removed the one legal currency at all and had zero legal currencies and make them all legal and that is more in line with the ethereum ethos right like pick your own currency there's a bajillion tokens on ethereum you can pick whatever one you want you want usc you want rye you want die what like what do you want like pick your favorite and and so like opening up more freedoms rather than just adding bitcoin i think is the right approach here and on that note uh vitalik tweeted out in some sometime in 2017 something along the lines of like if and this was in the middle of the ico mania where there was like terrible ideas getting funded bunch of money thrown around he tweeted out something along the lines of like if this is all that crypto is which is token speculation i'm out of here and like when i read that tweet i was like oh god like he's serious like he's actually going to leave oh and i remember the comments david i got everything everyone was angry at vitalik like you're gonna you're gonna pop the the market like what are you doing like why are you saying this everyone was angry right yeah but no if if ethereum went against vitalik's ethos and values he'd be out he'd just leave all of us should be like that absolutely yeah this is not protocol maximalism this is values maximalism yep and um yeah anyway anyways good take blitz scaling okay in web 3 blitz scaling will be replaced by good vibes and community building don't underestimate the impact and value capture of a well-coordinated community this term vibes david good vibes i heard you say it often in the peter pan the episode you did with peter pan who is a real person with the layer zero uh you know and what does good vibes actually mean because people hear that and they're like well like you talking about like you going to a party you're just feeling good about things what are you actually doing what are you building where's the work that's getting done so like the the metaphor that we use in the layer zero podcast was like a dj his their job is to establish a vibe right and like have that be like a call and response with a crowd right then they want to generate a vibe and then sustain that vibe throughout the life of the party you have something there's a cradle of life here and he wants to sustain that vibe and these same vibes are defined in circles of friends you and your your five friends the reason why you guys are all friends is because you guys have a vibe uh company company culture company culture that is good is a vibe and you want to carry that vibe of ambition and progress and i said this in the dow season two of the banquet style season two launch that all a dow really is is a vibe and we also talked about on the gaming panel that we just had that the gamification like the what game phi is or the crypt intersection of crypto gaming is that gaming is becoming a little bit more like work because you can make money but work is also becoming a little bit more like gaming and vibe isn't just play a vibe is a feeling it's an emotion and when you have a dow which with a bunch of people in it that are all vibing that is the energy that upholds a vibe uh and so it's some combination of work and play you need to work because you need to generate economic resources because you've got to put food on the table and once you have food on the table you can then play which is establishing the vibe and so blitz scaling this is this web 2 for verb which is like can you scale out your facebook or myspace as fast as possible aaron wright says blitz scaling will be replaced by good vibes and community building because if we if what we are doing here in the crypto world is to do anything is to allow the world to just vibe more uh and i think that's pretty cool yeah and it's your point i i think earlier that you made people think that um when you're vibing you're not working but like if you're vibing well you're vibing well you're working right yeah and work and vibe kind of equal the same thing so which is why people love the bankless friday weekly roll up because all we are doing is vibing for an hour and a half you know what this isn't work this doesn't work to you no not not at all do you know um i guess it's all about economic vibes that's what we've created encryption that's a great way to put it economical here we go okay seneca says there's one thing all the most successful nfts projects have in common and what is that one thing zenika we need to know time that's it is it that simple david just time that's all nft's need yeah so he what he's saying is that nft artists and mt creators they need to balance scarcity right they want to you need to issue nfts because that's how you make money but you can't issue a million of them because then each one's worthless right so what zenika is saying is that nfts are going to be valued by some function of the time that an artist puts into that nft and that is what makes these nfts scarce right like you only have so much time in your life you only have so much like skill and labor and time you can commit towards an nft and so nfts are going to be our art basically is going to be valued as a function of how much time an artist put into the nft there you go all right next take what what was this somebody got hacked by a pirate what's happening here that's happening this is just something you will only ever see in crypto and so robert miller says imagine being hacked for one million dollars and having to negotiate with someone role-playing as a pirate to get it back and he has a screenshot of somebody's comment in discord who apparently is the guy that like you know black hat attacked this protocol and so captain hook is in the discord and goes ahoy i feel bad about plundering your vessel and would like to talk about returning some treasure chests would you remind me acceptoring me matey offer friend request so we can discuss this is the hacker saying this thing this is the hacker just acting like a pirate saying like hey i stole your money if you want it back send me a friend request oh that's hilarious best that's awesome so how did this resolve did he get his money back or did you have to pay the pirate it doesn't even matter how it doesn't even matter robert but that story is hilarious sorry for your pirate troubles robert um all right what's this take yeah i i had this uh tweet earlier today uh i just noticed that you know you know how like gold global supply chains are broken yeah yeah there's just like deflationary goods everywhere and so i say global supply chains are broken and can't deliver deliver physical goods meanwhile nft volumes are breaking records coincidence i'll just leave that up to the listener sorry kids daddy's getting you nfts for christmas this year because the supply chain is broken did you know they just um presented or they're just like recommending a new christmas tsar in the us to help fix this there's like one trillion dollars in uh products that won't make it in time for the christmas season the us wants so they're trying to figure out a way to appoint someone to go take care of this so you might actually be right maybe there is some like boom coming to nfts because we switch from the physical into the digital what are things after all what do we really need when we have the essentials right you know we're looking for some status we're looking for some fun some collectibles maybe nfts hit all of those boxes for your christmas gift wish list i don't know over like i'm a little bit like facetious about like oh you like you don't have your physical goods you got to buy nfcs but i also like the broader commentary is we're moving into the digital world like physical stuff is hard now apparently but you know what's becoming easier digital stuff it's good i i mean that could be good that could be good for a lot of things could be good for the environment could produce consumption i i don't know what are you excited about though david that time of the week oh what do you think man so i volunteered for the andrew yang campaign for the 2020 election campaign sadly he did not get elected president um but i remember going to his uh seattle event in gasworks park shaking his hand in 2019. i have a little clip from uh of mitch was shaking his hand taken by my buddy michael wong uh and then in 2021 i get him on the podcast right this is kind of like a nice a to b like 2019 just volunteering for the campaign 2020 getting him on the podcast uh so that was a nice little like life check mark and i have to uh tip the hat to you ryan for actually getting out there and then scheduling that with him hey that was awesome and that that was all because of i think the bankless community is because we actually have people that listen to the show and watch the show and so we are getting like large you know politicians with the following to come on the show we are getting like lots of different names who would never have previously known that david and i existed or cared about crypto to come on the show so it's all thanks to you guys as well and uh yeah what an exciting episode man big milestone for us and uh fantastic episode too so i i feel like we feel that enough guys uh if you're a premium member you can listen to it now if not on monday the episode drops and uh let's just say yang has some good things to say about crypto and we might have a politician in our camp to help us fight this fight which is what we've been wanting for i don't care if it comes from the right or the left right crypto if remember what we said last time if we get them to adopt crypto protocols then they adopt crypto values so we win in the end and that's what the mission is to get them to adopt crypto protocols 100 there's that line about like don't meet your heroes in the sense that like you know your hero you have some vision about who your heroes are in your head and then when you meet them you realize that that's not actually who they are to it yeah yeah that was not true about andrew yang he is he is the guy that he advertises himself to be yep meet your heroes have podcasts with your heroes just overall have good heroes have good vibes with your heroes have good vibes with your with your good heroes yeah economic vibes if you hear us it's getting weird i don't know where this is going next ryan what are you excited about uh hester purse i mean she crushed it and you know we we already went over kind of the speech and um she quoted bankless which was which was i think huge for us and you know another great thing that happened this week and i think for me it was just another reminder we have so often we kind of paint um regulators as kind of like oh that you know the evil regulators like you know we are the the mannequins they are the puppeteers they just you know pull the strings and you know these are people like these are real human beings these these are people they're just like us okay except they're regulators many of them are caught inside of the system okay and uh they're not machines i mean this goes back to like what are we fighting for at the end of the day we're fighting for hearts and minds we're fighting to convince people in government that crypto is a valuable thing and that it matters and that it's good for the country and then it's good for the world and that is good for our fellow citizens and so i mean that's just a reminder to me i think that's just uh that's just huge um she quoted us from a weekly roll up is really cool and i think just to humanize the the people in government i mean is uh is an important thing for us to do because it allows us to focus on our mission and that mission is always was and it will continue to be a battle for hearts and minds if we win the hearts and minds we cannot lose this crypto revolution this crypto battle if we do lose it's because we haven't convinced enough people it's because crypto hasn't done enough good in the world to make them believe in our narrative and um yeah that was just a reminder for me so cool thing it was cool it no it is it is very cool and you talk about how it's important to humanize these regulators because they're humans too i think one of the cool things about hester purse's speech is that she was trying to humanize crypto people right yes they're they're not shadowy super coders elizabeth warren like i'm just a guy like i'm kind of i feel like a kid sometimes like stop calling me a shadowy super coder like that's me i don't like it it'd be awesome though are you going to dress like that for halloween shout out to the super creator uh i'm gonna dress like my crypto punk oh really oh that's right spoiler is that happening god i gotta get together my uh yeah because you can't get my girl can you hey that means i'm smoking a cigarette am i you know i have a hat on my turtle no i if i want to be like my turtle i do apparently all right guys uh let's get to the meme of the week what is the meme of the week what are we looking at here let's see it ryan right click save right click savers yeah so people who are taking pictures of our at the museum of modern art in new york and uh this reminds me of uh some one of my friends that i saw on my instagram story who was taking a picture of a fedenza at the texas um art blocks conference i decided to send a message like you are literally right click saving a picture of a right click save just go download the videnza yeah it gets very meta but look this is uh this is human culture right you know this is what we do we take pictures of things it's a good example though just because you took a picture of that um is that van gogh yeah yeah just just because you took a picture of starry nights doesn't mean you actually own starry nights right okay right it doesn't work like that and everyone in the museum knows that is the case and i think they're you know right click saving is dead we've talked about that before but like it's obviously true in nfts as well um that's it man wrapping up ethan's risky defy is risky bitcoin is risky you could lose what you put in none of this has been financial advice but we are headed west we are on the journey let me quote hester purse now from her speech uh this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on
