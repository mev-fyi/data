team is that the right word to call it um sure harvest finance team sure why not yeah what do you guys call yourselves um me specifically um i'm a community manager i'm not a developer the developers are anonymous so i'm here representing them in the project but there's about like eight to ten of us um community managers who handle various sorts of tasks um within the project outside of just like the pure coding um aspect of it um and that's probably one of the cool things we'll dive into a little bit later on the project i think that's one of the core strengths of the project but there's about like eight or ten of us that do things like either you know talking on a podcast but we have some people that are various contests that we have um there's some people that help with the community-built tools and just kind of vetting some of that information maybe before it goes to the developers so we're kind of like the middle management um if you will of the project we try to fade a lot of the common questions and a lot of the loose ends that can be tied up so the developers can really develop and focus on strategies and things like that well that's really fascinating to me i always find it cool when projects especially bottom up projects like harvest generate some sort of structure or some sort of um you know system for managing their community which we all know how important community is and then also just being uh you know having customer relations or you know user relations i think that's a really awesome sign of maturity before we you know go into conversations like that however maybe let's get our listeners grounded what is harvest and how did it come about sure so um harvest finance is an automated yield farming platform so to kind of step up take a step back from that yield farming is basically going out to places that offer rewards for providing liquidity or initial bootstrapping of their project so if you think like a uniswap or a curve if you provide liquidities to those prep platforms they'll give you back some more tokens that you can collect over time you can either keep those tokens or you can sell them um you know to whatever else right and so what harvest does is try to make that a like a kind of a one-click simple solution for the user so they can simply deposit something like usdc coin and we will make sure to place that into the best performing strategy that's available to users that's also deemed safe right so um as an individual user you can go directly to a curve yourself again deposit liquidity start earning some tokens but to actually accrue like true compounding which is apy percentage which is what you see advertised everywhere you can't actually achieve that percentage unless you compound so that means harvesting those rewards selling the rewards to another currency we're depositing that currency and then gaining rewards and they're repeating that cycle over and over again that can be time intensive cost intensive for the user so harvest finance again not only does this automatically forward you it tries to jump around to the different barrier strategies that might be out there like you know idle finance is the the new one that kind of propped up and that's popular we were farming that um almost from the get-go and i think we might have been one of the first projects out there farming it right so you know being a part of harvest allows you to jump into those strategies um very quickly and and earn true apy on your money as opposed to really having to to learn in depth about crypto and maybe um having to be a lot more knowledgeable before you can do some of these more complex strategies so again harvest tries to be a one click solution for users so how did the harvest team kind of come together was there one central like inspiration for the project or how did like the uh how did the code develop and and who developed it um so the the developers are anonymous so again my role is as a community uh manager and semi um anon again we try to act as that that middle management so i you know as far as their background i can't really speak to that um again because our early interactions really mainly um through discord chat but as far as the intent of the platform again cryptocurrency just getting into it itself can be kind of very difficult and complex right and then if you want to earn a good return on your money or if you kind of just want to experience this realm of defy that can be very intimidating right because you hear about quote-unquote rug pulls or just scams or it's just even very hard to dig in deep into projects and understand their legitimacy and what they're all about before you kind of miss the bandwagon of the bootstrapping of the apys or the rewards or whatever it is right so i think harvest is really just trying to say you know crypto can be for everybody it can be for grandma and matilda um so let's try to lower the barriers so they can get in they can feel safe they can use something as simple as stablecoin or they can advance up all the way up to you know y w btc ren or you know whatever the combinations are right so again it's so for the very easy noobish user all the way up to the advanced user um the ideology of harvest is crypto can be for everybody it doesn't have to be complex and you don't necessarily need to spend the time yourself researching all of these various strategies we can do it for you so would you say there are a number of different yield aggregators in the ethereum ecosystem yeah wired and pickle come to mind would you say that that angle is harvest unique angle uh trying to get down to just the the basic users and make this uh make the concept of just achieving yield as as just simple and bare bones as possible yeah i mean again i don't want to like over simplify that right because it makes it sound simplistic what we're trying to accomplish um but you know things crypto doesn't have to be you know this crazy complex you know crazy string digit that you have to send your your money to and then you have to make seven jumps through different currencies just to again get these apys right so there is very much mainstream mainstream doesn't want to go through that and everybody talks about on crypto twitter hey we really want the mainstream we want these you know big time investors to come in here but again they don't want to have to jump through all these hoops and barriers to get into it so i think yes definitely that is the angle that harvest is trying to take to say we'll do all the complexity for you just deposit relax and that can be accomplished right and again it's all on chain so the user can see everything is happening it you know it's it's hybrid um decentralized right so the devs play a role in deploying this stuff but then once again it's all on chain you have that decentralized part so there's a lot of trust in that as well right so i think um again it's just trying to merge the complexities but make it simple for anybody to join in what else would you say would be harvest like an important differentiator from the other yield aggregators on ethereum so for us community is like the number two like uh foundational cornerstone of the project or you're not even number two it's just like the other main thing right so aside from having this really awesome platform created by the developers it's its own unique uh code it's not some food fork or whatever the rage was right and then aside from that and the simplicity goes into it it's the ground up community involvement and that starts with me i was just the dude that wandered in the the door from day one and i said i'm tired of chasing all these different farms um this one sounds awesome it's automated let me you know let's see what happens from here and i learned about the project i kind of stuck around on the discord i was helping other people which is some of the basic questions and i'm like wow this is really getting popular um and i've done some moderation work i actually help out monolith project i've been a moderator with them since they're actually their ico so they've been around them a while so i decided to offer just some help with the project as a volunteer and now i've just stuck around and pretty much every other community manager is a volunteer right they have no association direct association the project so all of us are just a a bunch of guys or gals again pseudo-anonymous so i don't know so but we all just kind of stuck around and hung out through the love and the passion of the project and the project itself or the developers have empowered anybody who wants to help out whether it comes to ux building community tools the the dashboard that's built directly into the harvest website is a community built tool the calculators that we have we do community comp uh was a creativity contest because we're collecting art or different art perspectives say hey what can we do to upgrade the website what is what is the community what does that really collect with the community we have a developer contest and a ux contest that we took various ideas um from the community and said okay this is what you guys like the the look of the community we just recently updated there's brand new artwork on the website there's new ways how the the different various strategies are structured within the website and all of that comes directly from the community right so as you were kind of saying uh before it's how it's very interesting how we have like this kind of middle management this is really like a huge organization a 500 million dollar organization in a sense based on deposits or 600 million dollars now and so there are a lot of things that need to be done other than just building out direct code well you know they can't necessarily go out and hire people per se or that's not necessarily the best way to do it what's the best way to really get buy-in from your community especially in crypto and that's really making sure that people feel like they're participating in the project itself as opposed to just waiting for like a monthly newsletter that that's telling you very specific information that's probably not telling you really anything right and so how many of the 2017 icos that exist out there today are following this like old school road map ideology and again just one way information flow whereas um constantly in harvest finance it's give us feedback tell us what you want to see and that also includes strategies hey have you heard about a new farm that's deployed that we haven't heard about tell us about it and then we also have this really amazing program called council of 69 which is specifically looking towards like developers and projects and saying hey are you in your seed round or your kind of growth phase what can we do um as a as the company as a project and defy um to help you realize your potential does you know does that take some money it may be some kind of partnership or we're going to use utilize your platform so perp fi was the very first example they're going to be launching here i think at the beginning of the next year we've made a collaboration with them where we're specifically going to work with them and bench is another one where we're going to begin launching strategies on both of them which may also be allow us to expand just kind of like be on yield farming rewards when you have 500 600 million deposits you're almost like a huge hedge fund right so what can you do with these collaborations with the community that can take you beyond just what you initially started or your initial vision right and how can you kind of grow into something else and i think that's really where the strength of harvest finance come from comes from it's partially from the developers again their idea and their ability to build this product but then their allowance for that product to evolve with the community and all their different ideas and i think that's what really makes harvest finance unique and truly organic right we use all this like farming um themes and like farmlands and stuff like that within the community but like it's funny i just commute constantly here in my head organic organic organic because we're not paying shills to talk about us right we're not doing all this like plastering ads or things everywhere it's truly people are interested in about our project and we've empowered them and it's really taken off so any uh listener of the bankless program should know the value of community behind a project or ecosystem or anything really in the crypto space uh and and garnering that bottom up community inspiration is really really important but also at the end of the day i do believe that it's extremely important to have concrete raw incentives how does harvest actually like financially incentivize its own development does it compensate developers who add strategies or how does the financial compensation component work around harvest that's a great question um you know from end to end harvest is is very open-handed um you know starting from just the simple things as the creativity contest right because we really want to inspire people to give their best and we want to pay them for their time you know especially if we can use that art or that creativity for the benefit of harvest so i think we've given out like over twenty thousand dollars in farm um two through four or five various different contests that we have out there the developers pay for work that's been done within the community so we have a specific developer channel and there's kind of like a backlog of tasks that they're building up and wants and needs from whether there's the developers or the community and anybody can go out and fulfill these tasks and if they kind of fulfill the parameters or set up the devs will pay out for that work you know we have a bounty program i think that's going to be announced this week that has various rewards associated with it so um again there's just so many things and opportunities out there with that operational fund so it's part of like the initial launch phase or i guess coming out of the market cap there's a 10 of the supply basically goes to an operational fund right so there's funds specifically set there um to grow the project i've mentioned council 69 if somebody from the community brings forth like a project idea you know because it may not be the project itself directly coming to us it may be somebody saying hey i've heard about this project here's a strategy that kind of laid out how i think you could work with this project and if that actually gets launched and turns into a profitable association that person receives 10 percent kickback right so very rewarding to be part of the harvest ecosystem just from that one respect and then just farm ownership in itself um has its own um benefits because it's a profit share token right so this is one of the very uh rare tokens in cryptocurrency that actually the cl cash flow profits associated with the platform hit the token right most other tokens that exist are kind of just like speculative tokens kind of vaporware or hey there's a printing press behind it and it just prints more tokens as rewards to you but the the profits that you can see on the front page of harvest finance they're true profits that have nothing to do with the farm token itself it's actual profits generated from going to farm you know crv or uniswap or sushi or whatever it is and then the user gets or the farmholder gets a 30 cut of those profits so you can actually do and we were talking mainstream earlier well the mainstream investor guy from wall street he's used to p and e and analy analytics and cash flow so when he goes and looks in the a token the crypto sphere 99 of them don't have cash flows how does he apply a true valuation of that but on farm if you can see 30 percent you can see 25 million dollars flowing through that token annualized you can do a p e and so that's very attractive to you know not only developers wanting to come and build with us and getting paid in something that actually has true tangible value it appeals to other people outside of you know cryptocurrency as well if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earned system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well let's talk about the trust or trustless vectors of harvest what parts are centralized and trusted and then what parts are decentralized and trustless um so i would say it's kind of like a hybrid system i was kind of mentioning before right so the devs are basically building out this code um you know there's new strategies that come in you basically have to trust initially that the devs are looking through the code of who they're interacting with right because we're doing the whole money lego thing you need to go and interact with curve or you need to go and interact with idle so before these the strategies deploy deploy out they're having to do vetting of this other third-party entity first right then they have to build their own code and see what that stacks up into that right so you know essentially that's kind of like the the trust in them deploying and building out the system you know the website and the ux and all that ultimately then it gets deployed to the blockchain which any user then can see what those contracts are doing and interacting right and that's really becomes where it becomes trustless and the most important part is trustless right because that's where the money is stored so when you're depositing a harvest finance all the vaults all the codes are completely within the blockchain you can see them you can audit them they've had multiple audits go through them before and then there's also 12 hour time time locks on there so if the the developers decided to go rogue and say oh i'm going to take all the money it would actually take 12 hours before that could be implemented enough time for enough warning bells to alert the community and then there's also like a governance portion to the farm token which again is kind of a hybrid as well so the the developers when they're going to deploy something say like through council of 69 and they need to allocate operational funds towards a project like that that's something that's going to be brought to the attention of the governance committee and then everybody's going to be able to vote on that through a snapshot and then there's also discord sentiment boating as well so then there's kind of a balance between the two because ultimately a whale can come and wreck voting on any snapshot right so um we're really big in the community our discord community um and so when we look at the snapshot and the participation and the people the the discord we want that to matter just as much as somebody with a really big wallet you know just clicking and moving on right who maybe he's not even in connected into it they just saw some oh here's a boat let me vote and then move on right so um there's to me it's kind of like one of the best systems because pure dowels are extremely hard right like so much stuff gets thrown in the wall gets very messy hard to find quorum it can really slow down and cause a lot of red tape for a project so if you almost have like i hate the term but like benevolent dictatorship right everybody cringes when you say dictatorship but you know ultimately when you have just this really trusted party um and then they're kind of balancing with on-chain code validation that you can do that's almost like the best system because it gives you that nimbleness to deploy strategies really quickly without having to jump through all this red tape and multi signatures and all yadda yadda yadda and they can apply and then before you decide you throw your money in there you can on chain verify everything they've done so you can have that measure of trust very cool yeah i'm definitely bullish on the uh trustless at the center and trusted on the periphery type type model where as things tend to get integrated they become they only get integrated if they are indeed truly trustless and there's like this kind of emergent vetting process as well that definitely makes a ton of sense to me let's talk about what is coming in the future for harvest what do you guys have lined up that your community members and potential customers of harvest would be interested in um so i would say just be on the the lookout for things like pertfy and benchmark again really trying to grow i think beyond just pure like yield farming um you know i don't know how long that as a fad is necessarily going to last right you had icos they kind of petered out for a while and then you had some things in between and then now you may have like this whole fair launch or bootstrapping through yield farming so but ultimately if you want to be a viable platform like beyond you know these six months or a year or whatever it is you need to be able to grow and evolve right so i really think for what's next for harvest finance is is continuing to grow um with the ecosystem continuing to partner with projects like badger right like i think we're the one of the only um like super sets um that you can deposit with badger right so and that's a hot project right now so it's just showing that um you know the potential that we have that we want to build a diverse ecosystem like to do organic growth not necessarily like acquisitions and mergers and making this huge conglomerate but recognizing that like each individual project can work together and still be this synergy and still to be independent and have like their own ideas right and still be you know very nimble um you know because like you know for instance like uh wiring or urine however you want to say it you know acquiring all those different projects oh huge big news and the things um that really like got everybody excited and crypto twitter but like ultimately can that slow you down right when you just become too gigantic and then i think it was just news a couple days ago well then two like the main pickle devs quit well how does that put any strain on resources now um at wiring right so you know just thinking on those lines of expanding but not necessarily um like the size of harvest per se but expanding those like relation relationships and partnerships um to utilize the extremely smart people in crypto right so um again i know i didn't necessarily reveal anything too specific there but um one i think because it's just kind of the end of the year and i don't want to announce anything necessarily right now but again i think the two big things that are really in the horizon that are known about are pert fly um and benchmark so i really just suggest everybody kind of take a peek at those projects as well because i think they're going to be very interesting and then again just being able to leverage new strategies with those both of those platforms is going to be something very cool and if somebody wants to join the harvest community or just learn more about harvest where should they go so definitely i would say come to our discord um just an amazing community we try to be welcoming we answer every question possible and this community is very much not the win moon trader money money money kind of community i mean we have a channel for that but it's pretty much like our least chatted channel like our most popular channels are the strategy discussions um the general channel where we talk about all the cool things that's happening in crypto um and then definitely like the artistic side of things where people really wanted to submit their artwork so if you're not a chat room person we definitely have reddit out there we have medium that we release updates every tuesday so today you're going to probably get some cool news today and the tuesday update because we always try to have some cool new tidbits in there um so there's just so many different ways to get involved and then again i encourage everybody even if you're not in crypto or you're kind of just hearing about crypto the first time hey maybe you're an artist a writer poetry you're good at making intro videos cr community content whatever it is we pay pretty good money for that kind of stuff right so we definitely want to invite everybody who's interested in crypto again i was just a guy off the street love crypto i love chatting about it like chatting with you about it and have the opportunity to kind of be part of a project and grow with them hey we want you as part of harvest right we definitely want your abilities and talents so come on now yeah that actually i started to answer the what my next question was is like what sort of uh niche are you guys looking to get filled by the community is there any like untapped or or uh labor that you guys are looking for like in addition to the creative side like what what are you guys looking for when with new community members to help them fill gaps um i would just say i mean we're actually looking for everybody right because ultimately we're still trying to spread the word about harvest right like myself i i like to write content if you go to redemption r-e-d-m-p-t-i-o-n redemption without the second e dot medium.com written several articles um about harvest my most recent one was like an intro guide um into like installing metamask buy something from coinbase and then get it over to harvest right so you know looking for people that can think along those lines we're always looking for user guides we're always looking for translators right that's one thing that's really popped up that's really awesome recently we've got like five or six people doing translations in chinese spanish french so all this really cool stuff because again it's not just english out there in the crypto world and i think you know majority of the information gets to spread that way but there's so much untapped potential out there especially the the china market there was uh something that's really cool is there was kind of like a negative thought about from the devs about mobile a mobile website and so they are very resistant to mobile just because of security concerns but we have a very big chinese contingent and one of our moderators like no in china we use a lot of money in our mobile wallets and this is very important to us and it's very important that we get a mobile harvest website going and so that it totally changed the devs outlook and they've recently deployed the mobile version it works great so you know those are the kind of things that we're definitely looking for for feedback from the community to say like no this is something that it's really untapped and um you know we should really go the angle so you know again anybody in the community like i don't want to limit you to say oh just want devs or we just want this like literally if you have a great idea come in and let's talk about it because um you know we're only 15 16 weeks old right there there's so much stuff ahead of us that we can do but we're only limited kind of by what we know right and there's so many other people that are you know so talented out there and they have so many abilities we got guys creating rap songs right brian divisions you gotta you gotta see this rap song they're so high quality and awesome if you haven't heard it this guy is really legit and good and you would think off the top of your head oh some rap song about harvest finance but it's they're actually so well done and awesome and those are the kind of people we're bringing in right so i don't want to give you a limitation say this is the kind of people we're looking for because everybody at harvest finance is welcome whether you're a developer or you're a hip-hop star as somebody who got their start in crypto kind of just doing free labor for maker dow which ended up turning into an actual real gig like this is how you break into the space like for the listeners who are trying to like are interested in getting a job in crypto like you start by just being a volunteer right you start by just contributing because like you resonate with the project or you will resonate with the community or something but like the fundamental thing that everyone needs to do is you just need to start contributing right and so if you're looking to break into the space like uh harvest appears to be waving a flag saying like hey like we have like opportunity for you here so i would say i would tell the listeners to make sure that if you are looking to get yourself into the space like there are ways to do this and this is uh seemingly a very obvious one yeah and i mean such a great point and you know like i am literally like a perfect model for that just in that sense of like i just love crypto i love to like again have like the beer chat session and we're just randomly bouncing stuff off of the walls well that's pretty much what happens in like every discord um or telegram out there about crypto if you can kind of get rid of like the spam price stuff and so if you're really authentically interested in helping other people and and not just for the money aspect for it but just the true like share of information i've literally for three years i've been a moderator for monolith never got paid a nickel it's like it's an entire passion project kind of thing they were my very first ico um they did fly me out to the project and i got to meet everybody so i don't want to say that you know they haven't been very grateful and all that respect but again it was all just a volunteer thing and me writing information and spending like 10 hours a day in that chat room doing everything i could and so it was that same mindset that i took that over to harvest i was really just trying to you know help people out and then again i filled that need right and and that need is huge across projects all across crypto there's so many times that i come across projects where their documentation is very lacking and so it's hard for me to get in that project because i can't find the information i need so you know content creators video makers translators you know there's so much stuff out there if you kind of just you know put one foot in front of the other and start talking with these projects right so i'm glad you said that because it's been a very cool um journey in that respect for me personally and just finding harvest is just been like this perfect fit and it's so cool just to see how open-handed and rewarding they are to even the non-deaf people because to me i don't think a lot of projects truly appreciate how important keeping your community connected is right like a lot of projects especially the icos they raise so much money and then they say okay we're going to go off and develop and then but only so much time can go be by before you get this restless community that's expecting something to be delivered or or whatever it is but these projects like link i mean that's kind of just taking on a life on its own with its community and it's a kind of whole meme army um and so those kind of projects it's not just about the product itself right like sex sells right and especially in crypto and that mentality so there has to be a little bit of incorporating that the community in addition to the product you're developing or i i don't think you'll be success successful in crypto yeah totally agree totally agree all right bankless nation the links to the harvest discord and website will be in the show notes uh red redemption thank you for coming on to the meet the nation to introduce harvest to to us and all and all the listeners cheers i appreciate you guys having us thank you
