defy is the same as wall street you crypto people you're saying that this is a new thing it's more democratic finance that it's here for the people that's not true what would you say to this criticism any new technology has people that want to speculate on it right but there are probably 100 million people that actually use crypto in real world situations every day you know transmitting money across borders or whatever and then there are some people that are speculating on it and that's just you know the nature of a new technology people who believe it are going to want to invest in the future of it so you're going to see that and we've seen that already for 12 years right there's been bubbles there's been busts but blockchain prices normally end up higher than they began each cycle so i don't think the fact that there are speculators isn't anything new or in any way negative it you know happened in the dot com boom it happened and you know all kinds of booms that we've had over centuries basically so the fact that people want to speculate is not any of itself a negative
