hosts of bankless podcasts raising 35 million crypto Venture fund hey that's us I think what's this about yeah so Ryan you and I and our friend Ben lakeoff are starting bankless Ventures bankless Nation it is the first Friday of March David what time is it oh Ryan it's the East Denver version of the bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire league Weekly News in crypto and so much of that news is happening at East Denver so much of the announcements that we're going to talk about are being announced at East Denver so if you don't have coffee grab it because you're going to need it to get through this weekly roll-up I definitely am okay so uh you're in Denver right now I am not but um the conference per usual as is tradition the conference hasn't officially started though yet has it so it's different this year uh the previous years at 8th Denver it has been held in this venue called The Sports Castle but we outgrew the sports castle by a wide margin last year so we had to go to the ethereum uh excuse me the Denver Convention Center so the official canonical ethernet event does start today but so much has already happened already there are so many side events there was this interoperability conference that was Monday and Tuesday uh there was wallet con yesterday so to say that Heath Denver hasn't started yet is missing like the forest for the trees because so much of other events have already happened and have been ongoing all week so East Denver week has definitely been a very big thing plus a hackathon has already been going on so the the canonical ether event starts today but so much is already underway as well that's because when people talk about ethanver it's really a shelling point for getting a whole bunch of crypto people together so yeah what's the vibe like on the ground what's the vibe how are people and by the way by the way we're recording this Thursday morning but this goes out Friday so the official Denver event will have started by the time you guys are listening to this but yeah what what are The Vibes like what's kind of how are people feeling so uh the it's very much more diverse in in subject matter uh last year eth Denver I think there was like 13 to 14 000 people that came and the venue only held seven thousand so that was an issue and last year was in February when the market was like just riding all it was nice it was very very close to highs yes okay uh I haven't we haven't gotten official head counts yet because it's really hard to get an official head count because there is no official head counter but people have been giving me estimates of 15 to 20 000 people are you serious dude I was at uh what was that the ZK day and it was it was all about zero knowledge the room was absolutely packed the ZK day the one day event about all about zero knowledge was more than eth Denver 2020 as a whole it's just a bear Market if you told me back in 2019 that there would be a single one day conference specifically about zero knowledge stuff happening in 2023 I'd be like well I mean I guess I would why I'm here in this industry I expect that to grow but like it's crazy man yeah so like it's so large that people are subdividing into different uh streams different talks different tracks uh the energies is very very large and it's hard to keep track of everything it is literally impossible to go to everything you cannot you have to pick and choose what you want to do guys as far as content goes I know David is going to bring us back a ton of content we've got a bank List full bankless media team on the ground at ethanver and uh we're calling this like a virtual conference pass which is basically what we're providing and I think I I like to think David you're doing this partially you know in service to people like me who don't go to these events and uh you go and you record you get some of the highlights you talk about the takeaways and we publish all of this on the bank list newsletter and of course on our YouTube channel and for premium subscribers we package this all up into some RSS episodes that you can capture as well so uh I bet you're coming home with a lot of content that that's exactly right I go to the content Ryan so you don't have to uh at the interoperability Summit I recorded I think eight interviews uh with uh sriram from eigenlayer with um with uh Sunny from from Cosmos uh people from the axillar uh layer one which has peaked my interest interestingly uh so many different people in specifically outside of the evm ethereum ecosystem the the rest of the non-etherian world all about the interoperability Summit also Ledger from up only uh he was there as well so I got to meet him for the first time and so that was eight interviews at that event uh Luke and the rest of the bank list media team and I are gonna go to the actual canonical Ethan Revenge today and tomorrow and probably do that again so Brian I might have like 16 interviews for you rest back voice rest that voice do you hear it a little bit and I'm worried about you like so I I've been told that what you what you have to do in these uh look at me armchair quarterback I didn't even go to these things but what you have to do is like you speak with a lower like like a lower voice so comes more from your throat and that tends to yeah yeah exactly it's totally normal it's totally normal David in person he sounds like an octave deeper or two uh anyway we got a lot of things to cover too and we got a short amount of time to do it so topics of the week Gary Coming Out Swinging against crypto Gary Gensler of course he thinks everything is a security but not everyone in the rest of government agrees with him neither do we what else we got David uh things not looking great at silvergate uh the main bank of crypto looking pretty distressed uh so we have to talk about that and then the big news which got announced yesterday metamask everyone's favorite wallet has released an SDK to go with the unity game engine planting a very firm flag that gaming is going to be the next big wave of adoption uh servicing 2.7 billion people uh Robin Hood released a mobile wallet and I was actually able to try that out so we got the details as well but then there's already so many other announcements as well Devcon gets announced in 20-24 account action is live on the ethereum layer 1 but I thought you needed a hard fork for that we'll talk about that Yuga Labs is doing ordinals uh there's a lot to talk about and Ryan I have to go in literally under 90 minutes because I have a talk at shelling point so we are going to race through this weekly roll up all right let's burn through it and before we do we want to tell you about our friends and sponsors at rhinophy respect the Rhino is what I say this is a really cool uh interface on top of D5 there's all sorts of what Dave and I call Money verbs that you can do here you can trade you can swap you can invest pools tell us a little bit about rhino fight David rynify is a multi-chain aggregator so all of your different layer two opportunities are being put into the same interface so whether you want to trade whether you want to stake or pool or invest or you know access some vaults or whatnot you can do this all on app.rino dot f i this is built on a stark X technology and so if you want to just have all of your cool defy layer 2 stuff all in one place check it out there's a link in the show notes again app.rino.fi guys now is the time to go explore things while we're in the bear Market in the build Market of course so go check it this is just like banking interface 2.0 it's like go like go look at your dumb old Wells Fargo you want me and then go look at this and tell me which one looks more fun this looks way more fun I hate my uh banking user interface hasn't changed in the past like 15 years um all right let's get to markets speaking of new cool interfaces again all crypto interfaces are way better than all previous Financial interfaces what we're looking at of course is the Kraken charts where we're going to look at the Bitcoin price starting the week at 23 300 exactly flat on the week yeah exactly are you just doing that because you didn't want to look up the numbers David you're just ah it's called Flat no it's literally flat Ryan that's hilarious man okay how about eth flat two um flat-ish starting the week at 1600 ending the week at 16.25 up 1.5 on the week I'll call 1.5 pretty flat that's yeah it's that's a bull run for ants who cares about this how about the ratio ratio well I think you can do the math on that one even I can uh we are up 1.5 at .0697 well thanks for making it clear and thanks to Kraken for these uh fantastic charts that you can find at pro.cracken.com because I'm a pro I'm a trading Pro David I don't know about you but uh these charts make me feel like it when I think Ryan Sean Adams I think trading Pro I know you do it's uh that's a meme that's um you know real life too uh okay Global crypto market cap are we above a trillion above a trillion one point one one trillion dollars in total crypto market cap down two percent in the last uh uh week or so you know uh let's talk about a few stats going on in the crypto markets I I kind of skipped skip fed this week David because like nothing's really going on in macro at least this this is what I feel like the state of macro is there's a lot of uh Doom and Gloom types of of things like a lot of doomers out there and um is in right now yeah there are a few people who are predicting a glorious recovery right but like I don't think anyone really knows it could go one way or it could go the other so it's really impossible to talk about this week but I do know that the Bulls and the bears are in Perfect Balance right now yeah that's why we're flat on the like the last couple of weeks it's been flat um all I know is I zoom out whenever I don't know the answers in the short run look at the long run and the government is going to continue to print money crypto is going to continue to eat the banks and uh this is a decade-long long bet so who cares about the short run uh noise who cares about the week-to-week prices that we bring you every single week on the roll up it's all noise it doesn't matter but let's talk about crypto David let's talk ethereum it just had its highest month of earnings ever ever we love talking about ethereum we love talking about its earnings but I I thought that this chart was really cool I'm just seeing it depicted all the way from back in October 2016. this is the monthly ethereum earnings and you'll notice here David it's been negative right ethereum has been unprofitable from October 26 yeah proof of stake makes blockchains profitable so really when I see this chart I just see proof of work versus proof of stake uh and so if you want to have a expenditure positive blockchain you need to have proof of stake uh and that is what we are seeing and so this is another way of saying the burn so instead of talking about instead of being on the website of ultrasound.money instead we are at this one and we tricked you well it's a different way of looking at this thing right and so burn is at all time high monthly ethereum earnings is at all-time highs as well uh but this chart is just really putting it into perspective as to what that means in in comparison to ethereum's history yeah what's uh what's also in stark contrast is a lot of earnings reports are coming out for equities and securities and they're all kind of down like profits are down this is funny because ethereum profits are up when you look at issuance as kind of the cost and you look at transaction fees as the reward ethereum is profitable right now even in a bear Market um David this was a really interesting take from Hilda about nft royalties that we've been talking about for a while and this is somebody who dives into the the data there are a few discoveries here that I think bankless folks should know about um what is Hill Dobby saying here so Hilltop is walking us through the royalties stats on doing analytics boards by the way shout out to hildabby and all of his their amazing uh dude analytics boards a lot of the time when I go to Dune and I find a board and I find a good one I go look at who made it it's always Hill Dobby not always data always also comes to mind so quick shout out there so Hill Dobby is walking us through some data analytics about Creator royalties and and the the big theme lately has been the royalty Wars and how royalty percentages are going to zero as as a result of this fight between blur and open C and so while what's interesting here is while percentage of royalty pay is going to zero so like oh the percentage of what is paid on a nft transfer is going lower and lower and lower because margins are getting compressed total aggregate royalty payments are actually at all-time highs surprising right how did does this how do you square this well it's because even though percentage on a per transaction basis is getting compressed total volume is going up so while royalties are getting compressed total actual royalty payments are at all-time highs and that is a result of competition between these two major nft trading platforms so an interesting alternative look at the the royalty Wars yeah it's great news for creators royalty revenue is actually going up which is uh cool to see David we got a lot more coming up what's on tap Gary the Destroyer is absolutely unhinged uh right we have the uh the bankless uh Meetup uh yesterday and yeah no Mike sell like the the our our nice uh Securities lawyer yeah a couple times with there he dropped some comments into my ear so I will share them after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last 12 years

into the world of web3 Gary the Destroyer he is on the attack it seems like he's on a mission to destroy crypto I don't know what's up with Gary but what's he doing this week David uh declaring everything a security uh so in every New York in the New York Magazine he's made some statements which basically summarized as everything is a security except Bitcoin every company in crypto out there is in violation crypto is pointless but blockchain is kind of neat uh and this is this is a summary from Alexander grief who finished it up hard to argue you're acting in good faith if you're admittedly trying to stamp out an entire industry I saw another tweet I can't remember who tweeted it but it was basically like the meme of the Wright brothers discovered planes and flights and every other plane after the Wright brothers is illegitimate as in like Bitcoin is decentralized but every single other chain after Bitcoin is not legitimate exactly what it is but it's like is Gary a Bitcoin Maxi or what he's acting like it he's acting like a Bitcoin Maxi regulator and I'm not and I'm and I'm not saying this to like to say that this is what Bitcoin Maxi's belief but like if you were someone who only wanted to like fence and protect Bitcoin and attack everything else if that was your agenda that would be Gary genser's agenda I don't understand so I was bored yesterday well uh you guys were at the the party so I went on a terror okay uh did you see this tweet threat that we had the team dinner last night and we were all like guys let's ride up who's doing this so I was just in a parking lot somewhere I was waiting for uh one of my kids to get uh done with something and and so I was just like going through all of the potential things that Gary might consider in the real world unregistered Securities here's a Chili's gift card for 25 that you can buy in any local gas station David if the paxos busd stable coin is a security I ask you my friend is it Chili's gift card also a security that's a question and I would post here again I say yes yes it is okay we got a security here's another example Pokemon cards are they saying you're 100 a security oh profit profit on the upside yeah yeah efforts of others big time how we test yeah Pokemon cards must be a security here is a a sword I think this is a Diablo sword to me yeah uh King sword Noble sword uh you know an item drop in your favorite video games got to be security right yeah oh God yeah do you have Chuck E cheese did you go to Chuck E cheese when you're a kid these tokens not exactly this looks like an erc20 token to me yeah they stole it from Chucky and those are also Securities classic cars classic cars that appreciate and value off uh well is that the effort of others well somebody else built it well um Taylor Swift she's got kind of a you know a songwriting artist a signed autograph that's reputation of others how about hotel points unregistered security or no yeah well I mean the value of a hotel Point has to be determined by at how much that hotel wants to make those things valuable and they can inflate that at anything they can inflate those away change the value of it what's the supply schedule of a um a hotel Point well it's not deflationary let me tell you that uh how about a human organizations [Music] fortnite V bucks definitely right a puppy I don't know like you can buy a puppy there's a market for like puppies you can breed cattle and cattle can produce dividends and that's an effort of that cattle milk the milk is the uh yeah it's fungible it's a profitable Enterprise I get it yeah Kohl's cash uh like man this is my Canadian upbringing Canadian Tire dollars the Canadian Watchers will know what these are I do not know what these are yeah it's a Canadian thing anyway all of these could be Securities that's what's so ludicrous about this whole thing there's no Rhyme or Reason other than does Gary hate it if yes it's a security that's the way it seems to me yeah and the point that we're making like rather than talking about specifically what Gary has said is that this is the implication of like yes everything other than Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain is not decentralized and is totally a security all crypto exchanges are complicit off probably bankless is complicit because we talk about these things uh so tight uh and and really that's the news of this week is that this is the stance that Gary's taking publicly it's a really hard line stance and I don't understand it uh this is a take from crypto lawyer Jake travinsky what's he say here uh Jake says chair Gensler may have a prejudge that every digital asset aside from Bitcoin as a security but his opinion is not the law the SEC lacks the authority to regulate any of them until it until and unless it proves its case in court for each asset every single one individually at one time which is why we titled this section Gary the Destroyer right because he's coming in he's doing the whole like chilling effect thing which is unconstitutional uh and trying to make scare everyone and just being a megalomaniac dude he's just doing the power grab thing like it's becoming clear and clearer and clearer that Gary does not care about his job or his role but is simply trying to grab power yeah well Mad King Gary that's uh King Gary yeah this is Logan Bollinger what's he say uh Logan says friendly reminder that Gary gensler's opinions on what is or isn't a security are not legally dispositive oh good we don't have King Sierra right this is America that's right in this country judges not SEC chairs ultimately determine what the law means and how it applies doesn't mean his thoughts are irrelevant they are just not dispositive that's a new word for me just positive yeah uh they're just not just positive what's he say Gabe Shapiro uh one of a very well respected lawyer in the crypto space now says that now that Gary Gensler has made clear he regards every single token including stable coins other than Bitcoin as Securities under us law can we start asking what's the plan here that's a really good question I'm sure you come and come in and talk to us on you this has got to be part of uh operation uh choke point and so David I guess the good news is this goes to the court system but I'm not so sure this is good news like it depends on whether we have reasonable judges in the court system this was a take I saw last week so a federal court just ruled that these emojis this is the rocket emoji the graph going up and the bag full of money the chart yeah the chart emoji and the bag full of money objectively mean one thing a financial return on investment um I believe this is from the um and be top shots legislation that the judge says this in their ruling pointing at an exhibit of NBA top shots tweets each tweet promotes a recent sale or statistics of recent sale of moments on the marketplace and although the literal word profit is not included in any of the tweets the rocket ship emoji in quotes stock chart emoji and money bags emoji objectively mean one thing a financial return on investment if you are doing the rocket emoji or the money bag emoji David you are giving Financial advice on Twitter whether you know it or not according to this judge absolutely ludicrous takes David and I like I don't even understand if these people don't understand how the internet works like you can't just say an emoji is financial advice can you I mean they're not wrong that's why they're putting the Emoji in there though the the problem is that this is the official NBA Top Shot account I think if they throw us a random user of NBA top shots that would be that would be ridiculous I think I think I do kind of think like yeah well if you're putting the upwards chart and rocket ship and money bags emojis into your platform and you are that platform like yeah we kind of got it's a bad form but what do you think it is about to do what are you going to do are you going to regularly yeah this is the stupid thing if I do a Pokemon card rocket emoji what am I like and I'm the issuer of Pokemon I guess that's an illegal tweet right like what is that I don't understand what's going on here is kind of the bottom line take and I I just I don't know that the courts are going to interpret things uh in a reasonable way maybe this yeah I think you it's hard it's hard because like you're there are like promoters laws right if you don't want to buy a freaking movie of an NBA Top Shot don't buy it like I I I I think people have to have a bit of responsibility when it comes I think that's really like there is confusion in gray area and so what do we do in this environment we push power and control and responsibility back to the individual rather than by doing this to the issuer like yeah you're not Taylor Swift tickets rocket emoji like that's going to be a thing too it isn't yeah yeah it is a thing you're not going to like filter kind of the internet from these sorts of things and uh I think doing so is a dead end um but there is a chilling effect that's going into place Robin Hood received a crypto related subpoena request from the SEC and it's basically just saying the SEC saying to Robin Hood hey there might be Securities on Robinhood The subpoena concern among other things uh list Robin Hood's cryptocurrency listings and custody of cryptocurrencies and platform uh operations so Robin Hood clearly doesn't have Clarity from the SEC um coinbase is suspending binance USD stablecoin so that's been delisted on the back of the SEC and um I believe Financial regulator in New York New York um doing this MasterCard is holding up their crypto plans they put that on hold uh there's a report out that Visa was going to do that as well but then Visa put out a statement I think from Kai Chef field who's been on the podcast saying the story isn't inaccurate as it pertains to Visa here's the reality and he talks about how visas continuing to partner with crypto companies anyway there's this like chilling effect on the industry and that's a result of of mad Gary's actions here yep nope that's all come out and so this is this is uh Gary Once Upon a Time being like a crypto hardliner and now this is why we're calling it Gary the Destroyer okay Gary the the megalomaniac like and and so like this this is going so far that this is actually starting to get pushed back from people outside of the crypto industry yeah and so this is news saying a new Congress body to come to hold a hearing on the regulatory attack on crypto so they're starting finally to get pushback from Congress Congress yeah so walk us through this news Ryan if you will yeah Congress David is holding a digital asset subcommittee within the house Financial Services they're scheduled to hold their first ever meeting on March 9th and the hearing is titled this coincidence or coordinated the administration's attack on the digital asset ecosystem I think we would say this is certainly a coordinated activity but it's really congress's job to Reign Regulators in when they go after power vacuums and are seem intent on killing an entire industry it's good as well that a lot of the blame is being pushed back on those that are responsible for it namely the SEC and Gary gensler's leadership over there Senator Tim Scott called this the elephant in the room and said and Warren Davidson called Gary gensler's selective enforcement on the crypto industry I think referring to that as as troubling so that's specifically what this meeting in Congress is going to be about yeah and this is how this has to end um Gary has gone from being a hard ass to being absolutely unhinged so this we're we're gonna this is going to be a fight and now we have to fight him and Congress is picking up wind that like Congress doesn't like Gary necessarily like Congress has no interest in supporting Garrett he is a rogue actor and a rogue agency um Brian Armstrong put a fantastic op-ed out in CNBC and this is let me just read a quote from it this is part of the pushback and fight back yet while other jurisdictions progress he's talking about outside of the U.S the U.S seems more focused on Turf battles between Regulators no other country in the world has spent as much time and energy trying to convince its citizens that crypto assets are securities let's remember this whole Securities thing it's not even a topic of conversation in Europe no I mean we're just talking about Europe is laughing at us dude we were just talking about legislation which is like you know decently like folks we talk to give it like maybe a B minus it's reasonable it doesn't it it is completely sensible on uh its its interpretation of what a security is and what it's not this is a rogue agency in the U.S I'm not sure why Gary and others are are making this such a big deal it's um absolutely stupid and I I think in general the context for me is this this U.S anti-crypto posture is uh is crazy it's a complete self-owned right I mean you've seen it like the US has the talent we have the entrepreneurs we have the capital to lead in crypto at the end oh yeah and yeah our Regulators are saying to the builders yeah go build somewhere else we don't want this here I think America is for you America is forgetting that has to compete right on like it has to out build the rest of the world if it's going to stay competitive and um those in government just don't understand it yeah this is like my worst favorite thing about Humanity about how like one bad person can it up for like billions of people yeah and thank you certainly some of the the class of 2022 scammers certainly gave him more uh fuel to be able to do you know who doesn't care about Gary or anything that he has to say all of these scammers of 2021 and 2020. they just don't give they don't care about this at all yeah yeah I know it's frustrating it's frustrating uh some other news too that is somewhat related to silvergate bank what's this David yeah so silvergate Bank as of this morning stock tumbles 45 uh after a growing concern about the solvency of silver Gates uh and so silvergate reported a one billion dollar loss in the fourth quarter and this has caused a sort of run on the bank uh there has not there's not been any actual symptoms of insolvency yet there have been concerning murmurings from actually silvergate itself as well as other indications as well uh coinbase has no longer accepted or initiates uh initiated payments to or from the Silver Gate and has rerouted customer deposits to a different bank they were using silvergate coinbase was yes they have they have other Banks but they have started to Route payments to a different bank just that they stated as an abundance of caution uh and so it was stated that silvergate sold additional debt Securities to repay debts this year uh and they have said that further losses would mean that the bank would be less than well capitalized is what they said um so uh this is one one part of this is like okay Banks take risk that's what they do that's the part of their business model crypto is risky there's not that many banks in the crypto industry therefore the few banks that do serve crypto bear the general risk of kind of the entire industry we all know what happened with the insolvencies of 2022 uh and so that has impacted a large amount of silvergates clients which makes them unable to pay back their their loans to silvergate which means silvergate has to eat some losses and then in addition to that operation choke point has really reduced the interest in investing in silvergate or making Silver Gate uh like a credit worthy bank and so all of this Con has like led up to this moment right now where like Silver Gate stock tumbles 45 coinbase doesn't want to use silvergate out of an abundance of caution uh and so this is one part like kind of a cell phone out of the crypto industry then like magnet like blown up because of operation choke point because of thanksgary they can't get they can't get banked anywhere else basically and it's it's Gary so the entire Administration that seems to be involved in operation uh checkpoint and uh the stock is certainly taking a tumble as you mentioned silvergate stock as a result the question is where are crypto exchanges going to actually Bank in the US there's operations this is not the banklessness that we want this is yeah this does not help liquidity inflows into into crypto and it cuts off a way for people to become more bankless that's the bad news this week the good news though David is good news from here on out good news from here on out all right we got through the worst of it uh metamask is now in the unity store David do you know much about Unity the gaming platform yeah it's a very well adopted very high profile game engine that many of your favorite games if you are a gamer is built off of metamask has released an SDK for incorporating metamask into Unity uh what does that mean web three games uh asset powered games sign in with ethereum in your unity game anything that you can think of that has to do with your private key on ethereum into a unity game engine so like their topic of what that means is massive but simply think of a more seamless injection of private Keys into Unity games and all the positive second order effects that come with that did you know David uh there's 2.7 billion users and developers that use Unity for a game or a set of games do you think two point did you mean 2.7 billion user who are playing with Securities inside of their games run oh God I hope not don't tell Gary well just DDOS Gary you know 2.7 billion with all of the gamers like everything's a security is like all of the gamers are playing with unregistered Securities Gary go get them a court case for everyone I can't wait to take all the 12 year olds on one by one uh enjoy that this is the unity asset store David they have a whole section called decentralization here that's where you see this so if you scroll down asset store that doesn't mean crypto assets that means like uh gaming assets right right like like it's not a crypto asset Gary no no don't worry don't worry or is it sorry no there are assets in the store like games that sets like download this package or whatever right yes yes because Unity is is a but I don't know maybe Gary's like oh I can regulate that it's an ass did you say asset did you say asset a pop scary no this is a different type of asset all right it's a software asset anyway Unity is a technology platform for for gamers I didn't realize how big it was holds about a 50 market share the only other like next biggest um gaming engine is the Unreal Engine which um you know and oh Pokemon go by the way that that is built with unity so can you imagine like oh metamask wallet inside of uh Pokemon go to collect your Pokemon can you imagine that I can imagine that yeah I know you're a Pokemon go player aren't you I haven't played in a while but yes yeah uh I mean anyway watch out for those uh Pokemon Securities but um it's pretty cool I think this is gonna be huge this is gonna help bring crypto mainstream and I think crypto has some work to do with the Gaming Community can we just say that like they don't like it this is that they're digital Collectibles they're not nfts though it's totally different thing uh all right what do we have coming up next coming up next oh my gosh so much uh Robin Hood wall is out we got the Deets scroll ZK evm soon TM uh Oasis you like that one right uh Oasis clawbacks money from a hacker to give back to his rightful owner but was it the right thing to do and Devcon is heading to Southeast Asia in 2024 which I don't they didn't announce a specific City so I don't have my flight yet but you know I will soon all of that and more but first a moment to talk

rest of the bankless team in the Inner Circle Discord only for premium members want the alpha check out Ben the analyst Degen pit where you can ask him questions about the token report got a question I've got my own q a room for any questions that you might have at banklist we have huge things planned for 2023 including a new website with login with your ethereum address capabilities and we're super excited to ship what we are calling Bank list 2.0 soon TM so if you want extra help exploring the frontier subscribe to bankless premium it's under 50 cents a day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord Robin Hood has a non-custodial crypto wallet now they said they were going to do it last summer now here it is it's available on the IOS app store David did you have a chance to download this and check it out can you give us the the details yeah amazingly in the middle of the Thunder I did have a chance to actually download this uh okay so uh here's the deal it's an ethereum only wallet at the moment and polygon you can deposit and outbound and send tokens on the ethereum layer one you cannot trade tokens on the ethereum layer one you can only send in and out if you send into the polygon Network on the Robin Hood the wallet you can trade and the trades the trades that you make on the polygon side of Robinhood wallet are gasless that's the full extent of the wall it's just like when you say trade you're doing it on a like decentralized polygon protocol is that right yeah or something this is a collaboration between Robin Hood polygon and zero X and so 0x has this relayer API that's used to swap and so the Robinhood wallet calls the Xerox relayer API uh swaps the tokens and that's all gasless and automatic and basically synonymous with the ux that Robin Hood users are used to in their normal wallet no other blockchains are supported no Solana no Avalanche I mean I'm sure they probably have plans to incorporate them at some time but like right now it's a pretty constrained uh limited functionality limited limited functionality I'm sure they are going to add more but right now it's just like on the ethereum layer one it's inbound and outbound transfers and then on the polygon Layer Two it's inbound and outbound transfers and swaps via zero X how is that haptic response though remember that their CEO telling us about that I did not notice any haptic response like like when you hit a trade it like vibrates in your hands I haven't been able to trade because I sent in 25 uscc to the ethereum layer one and I was like okay swap for eth and I couldn't okay but I'm sure they are going I'm sure this is just the first debut I'm sure they've got it I love that they're doing it the ux is great if you are welcome to the uh Robin Hood app it is almost the same kind of ux and UI layer so it's great and why do we care so much about this is because it's bankless non-custodial yeah super cool to see Robin Hood uh developing this and building this out using their research so I did it in just expediency I did uh save my private keys to the cloud which is a native feature in there and I'm like oh I hope hope they got that one right you can also save your own private keys to yourself the normal way you could also trust Robin Hood to save it I think that's fine as long as people know what they're like getting into right for 25 how much do you care well I did 25 other people yeah right yeah yeah in the future I know you as long as they have the option I'm content with it it's a great person to have the option they do have the option what's going on with squirrel another first of all what is scroll scroll is a zkevm that is trying to be evm equivalent which is an ambitious Endeavor to use my words at the start of every weekly roll up uh but they are going all the way down into the byte code making circuit things to make the evm azk evm uh but also ethereum equivalent very ambitious very bullish if they can get it done they are getting it done uh the last I checked with them they had they had like a 600 gigabyte RAM requirement in order to run their approver and then they drop that down to 200 which is a huge order of a magnitude of improvement but still have a long way to go to make that accessible to more and more and more anyways uh they have announced that their ZK evm is live on a gorley test net 100 permissionless uh and so this is the last major step that they need in order to go to the scroll mainnet this is way faster than I thought it would be davidm stuff is happening very very fast so it's 100 open sourced uh scroll has even Frozen some of its code base to pass to Auditors for review uh so like the the scroll the scroll zkevm mainnet you can see it on the horizon it is not that far off so congrats to the school team uh Ryan and I are Angel Investors in scroll you find that on our disclosures page always this this coindesk headline ethereum says erc4337 deployed tested and the beginning of the era of smart accounts David what is this ERC what does it do I can tell you're bullish about it I'm so glad you asked yeah erc4337 it what's the difference between an EIP and ERC well an EIP is something that gets hard forked in an ERC is a smart contract standard that's not technically the difference but it's good for these purposes like an erc20 is just a standard that everyone agrees to it's not something that needs to be forked into the code of ethereum that's exactly right yes so erc4337 was deployed to the ethereum layer one what does that mean uh somebody just wrote a smart contract there is erc4337 which is the account abstract and standard that has been worked on by yoab Weiss who is the man that we are looking at in this picture here and many many others uh it is account abstraction inside of a smart contract so typically the way that people have thought about account abstraction is needing to enable it at the protocol layer yeah that's honestly going into this that's how I thought it was going to happen it needed to be forked in yeah so that is still the long-term conclusion but in the meantime we have erc4337 as a smart contract to enable account abstraction as a smart contract and so you can start to do smart contract wallet level stuff account instruction level stuff on the ethereum layer one starting today instead of at the protocol native level it's just a smart contract that you can use but this has now been deployed this caught a lot of people by surprise because I think you like you Ryan and me it was like oh you can do this with your smart contract that's pretty cool yeah and so uh smart contract wallet enabled capabilities is now on the ethereum layer one and this really is just like a middle step between native support at the protocol level and but it can also hasten that because we can have more iteration more development more experimentation and more Innovation on the actual uh protocol standard that will eventually get incorporated into the ethereum layer 1 at some future date and time and the Reason by the way guys we're so excited about account abstraction is it enables a new era of smart contract wallets which is basically like if you think about the you know the user experience of fintech a mobile app like venmo for example or um revolut in in the UK and in Europe This enables that right like many of our wallets right now they do not have seamless user experience right you're signing transactions you have no you have no idea what you're signing smart contract wallets will smooth all of that out make it incredibly easy to use this is a big ux upgrade in the future and this is the infrastructure for that ux upgrade the metaphor that I've used to explain this is that all of your wallets your meta mask your Ledger anything with an ex it's called an externally owned account anything with a private key that is a Bitcoin of a wallet a Bitcoin version of a wallet it's it's not programmable and simple and not programmable account abstraction smart wallets like kind of a hard word to understand it's the ethereum of wallets it's a wallet with a chip in it it can you can program your wallet to do anything and that is how we get over a lot of ux and UI hurdles yeah it's like people have uh coffee mugs but there's an ember mug which has a chip in it which you can heat at any time that is the equivalent has a chip in it I don't know about that metaphor [Laughter] I think my metaphor is a little bit better not to sponsor the podcast I'm a fan uh board Apes they are doing things on the Bitcoin blockchain what are they up to yeah Yuga Labs so not board Apes sport Apes parent Yuga Labs um people know the board Apes but yoga Labs is the software company behind board Apes said Monday it's planning to release an nft collection minted on the ordinals protocol the 12-fold collection will feature 300 generative art nfts created by UK labs in place on a 12 by 12 grid which serves as a visual allegory for the cartography of data on the Bitcoin blockchain it will include 3D elements as well as hand-drawn features uh interesting kind of Divergent from what eucalabs typically does this new collection does not come with any extended utility or has any affiliation with the if ethereum based collections out of Yuga Labs cool I I'm I mean this is what we're looking for out of ordinals is adoption by players who are here for the long term uh is is we talked about ordinals usage being up for a month straight uh ordinals demand is down for two weeks straight but yeah I mean there was a hype Mania it's it hit a peak it could hit a trough and go back up but we are down two weeks in a row on on ordinal usage Yep this is good for Bitcoin whether Bitcoin Maximus know it or not they need blocks-based demand in the future and this helps with that um David there was a bit of a controversy in D5 circles last week as well uh Oasis exploited its own wallet software to seize crypto stolen in the Wormhole Hack That is the title of this article can you tell us what happened yeah so Oasis dot app uh it's a defy app um it sees assets it claw back it's cloud back assets related to the 140 million dollar exploit of the Wormhole bridge if you remember that one last year and then returned them to the authorized third party Ryan after being ordered by a court to do so so a defy app was ordered by a court to seize assets that were stolen to return them to the rightful owner who was that rifle owner by the way uh that was jump Capital so the my favorites back our favorite people uh got sent back sorry to all the good people that jump but you guys have done some not some great things um and like I'm not afraid to admit that and neither should you uh anyways uh so uh so Oasis thought app Claude back assets that were stolen from the Wormhole bridge that were jumps uh assets gave them back to jump after being ordered by a court so like the instance is like cool we gave we stole money back from a hacker and gave it back to the rifle owner uh but what precedent does this set um what are your thoughts on this Ryan well first of all it's a surprise it shouldn't uh Oasis not be able to do that I think that's the first thing if it's truly decentralized then the makers of the protocol or the application shouldn't have the ability to go claw back funds to go reach into a multi-sigger into a smart contract and take those funds out so can you talk about that side of the story because right we always say is it's not um don't be evil it can't be evil like there is no ability to change an immutable code but what happened in this case yeah so the contracts for Oasis were upgradable which meant there was a hole for Oasis to upgrade their contracts to get that money back this goes back to my philosophy of if you can be regulated then you ought to be regulated and if you can't be regulated then you won't be regulated and I think this is the case of an example of an app that could be regulated because clearly a court was able to order someone to do something to get the money back and that puts Oasis in the category of can be regulated now if they want to not be regulated they shouldn't have upgradable Smart contracts I feel like that's a pretty safe claim to make however I do understand the utility of having upgradable smart contracts because you can you know prevent from exploits you can you can protect your software you can protect your users plenty of reasons to have upgradable Smart contracts but this is the tug of war the push and pull between decentralization and centralization what does decentralization get us immutable money which is great also comes with a cost and so this is just an example of where those two ends meet I think it's a reminder that there are many D5 protocols and even layer twos and other things that you think are maximally decentralized and immutable that still have these upgrade hatches and so we should be conscious of that now for many of these protocols they they are temporary but that temporary period of time could be months it could also be years so people should be conscious of that it's also like people are pretty upset with the ways slabs developers saying that it sets a bad precedent one thing I'd say though is put yourself in the shoes of an oasis developer you have you know you have this escape hatch and by the way this wasn't an intent here's an important point this wasn't as I understand it David in an intentional escape hatch there's actually a bug a flaw in the way that the code is written that the Oasis Labs devs happen to know about anyway they received this court order and it's just like well you have the ability to withdraw the funds and if you don't do it you're going to get in trouble with the authorities authorities metaphorically go to jail if you don't do this right yeah it would be so much simpler if you could just be like we can't do it right there's no ability there is no access point for us to withdraw this and that is maximally decentralized so you're not put in the place where you have to make that decision but as far as like like morally ethically should they have resisted and gone off to prison and I mean the money was stolen right so I'm not very upset at the Oasis devs for this um I you we just don't know what happened behind behind the scenes uh the calculus is simple um hey your app has stolen money in it uh give it back or go to jail I'm like well personally I'm like okay I'll that's I'll fight another day exactly I'll give the money to the right person and I won't go to jail that's a win-win uh and then maybe burn the private Keys later right yep I you know that's just where we are as an industry and I think we should we should admit that's the case David uh coinbase had some scheduled down time this week but I don't know if that's the story you wanted to get to no this is this is really just the lead into the next story coinbase has uh upcoming planned scheduled down time uh so this will be on Saturday for eight hours upcoming yeah I don't know how frequent this is uh I think this is perhaps like a longer than normal but this is totally like a normal thing for coinbase to do what's not a normal thing to do is have unscheduled downtime for a layer one blockchain uh so 19 18 hours and 20 minutes of down time the Solana Foundation set is still investigating why the network went down during the outage the network the users could not process transactions including nft and D5 trading and so I was asking uh some of the the analysts who pay attention to Solana D5 on the bank list team by the way the analysts on the bank list team play attention to much more things beyond the ethereum-centric nature of you and me Ryan uh and there and so I was asked him okay so did this like impact any like defy apps did anyone get liquidated when they shouldn't have like what happened and they were like well there's not much tvl left in Solana T5 really yeah I guess I guess now it's more based it's uh nft it's kind of cultural I I guess it's more it's become more that and less defy yeah and it's like I we said this Ryan the last time Solana went down it was a good while ago it was I don't know six nine months ago the last time Solana went down but like man you really not need to start building up Lindy and you have to reset the Lindy o'clock now your chain went down for 19 hours imagine if the world of Finance was built on this like where the whole point of crypto is to have 24 7 365 immutable smart contracts and D5 Services if your layer 1 chain goes down you get to that puts that gives certain people power and other people not have power because some people can process transactions when other people can't and they will be able to have God mode over defy over all defy on Solana in that one moment of time while that network is down and that you can't do that and so we have to set the Lindy clock back on Solana once again and so like it's yeah I know but it's gonna sound like we're kind of over like Solana bashing but like I just I just this is so important I totally believe that um certain things disqualify you from the race of player one right and you frequent downtime long periods of downtime or you have to do an offline coordination to kind of restore it's one of those things so so I know Solana the the community is um is working hard on this and building and we wish them the best uh for this but this has to be fixed uh during this bear Market you need to start building Lindy every time you reset it you go back so far yes like the Lindy is at zero like other even non-etherium chains have better Lindy than Solana not uh to harp on Solana too much but apparently the Solana stores in New York City and Miami are also uh closing as well so sign of sign of these bearish times I suppose David uh the FTX ex-engineering Chief nashad Singh pled guilty to criminal charges so I believe he joins Gary Wang and it's Caroline and some of the other FTX criminals still outstanding is Sam bankman freed but with all of his Executives pleading guilty he can't be too far behind is there anything else you want to add to the story yeah same thing free at least not that he had many friends left if any uh but another definitely one off of the list of potential Sam begman freed friends uh this guy I'm assuming is going to work with the authorities uh to settle his case in a favorable as way possible which is not going to help Sam bankman freed meanwhile sandbankment free this 29 year old youngest dude just living at home with Mom and Dad just watching football on a VPN after stealing 15 billion dollars yep uh strange David this is the Defcon news tell us about it Devcon 7 has been announced coming to Southeast Asia in 2024. uh no specific time no specific place other than southeast Asia a very large place um but keep your calendars open for 24 for 20 24. to go to Southeast Asia if you're interested in Defcon yeah are they doing these every two years now or is there every 18 months because the last one was in 2022 right in Bogota uh yes that was 2022 in Bogota in October so I've talked into Joseph Schweitzer about this there's no hard and fast rule for what they're doing um Dev connect is the smaller sister event to Devcon and they are the F has committed to doing Dev connect every single not every single year uh on a reoccurring basis and so I think the vibe here is that Dev connect and Devcon are like this binary star system that rotate around each other to use a metaphor with one star being bigger than the other devcom being the big star Dev connect being the small star uh this is just and one of them has a faster orbit right which is different no no I think every nine months is like one one every nine months you get the dev connect which is the smaller one and then nine months later you get the dev con which is the big one hey southeast Asia always interesting places that they host I guess I haven't got I haven't gone to Asia yet Ryan this is gonna be my first trip to Asia oh there you go get ready book 2024 so you so David this is some uh bankless news and this is under our raises section I'll read the headline hosts of bankless podcasts raising 35 million crypto Venture fund hey that's us I think what's this about yeah so Ryan you and I and our friend Ben lakeoff are starting bankless Ventures uh we are still pretty early in this process uh and but we are starting up a venture capital firm why are we doing this well as people who listen to the bankless podcast know Ryan and I do a bunch of Angel Investing we also do a bunch of advisory work uh and we enjoy supporting Founders who are helping explore the frontier of crypto in the frontier of what it means to go bankless uh and so all we're really doing is now we are putting all of that effort that we're already doing into a structure that we are now calling bankless Ventures uh and so I think this really this conversation really got started Ryan we were like hey man we're doing a lot of Angel Investing like we should hire an analyst uh we should like help just like like make this a lot easier for us it's a lot of work and and so then when the conversation continues like well that just starts to look like a VC firm so we're really important point of emphasis we're already doing all basically everything that it takes to do a VC firm uh private Market investing angel Angel Investing advisory work and now we are putting that inside of a structure the only thing that's really new here is now we're doing adapt with outside capital for LPS uh and so that is kind of that's the the really the thought process behind this nothing changes with respect to our schedule still coming at you with uh all the content that that we always have and of course our disclosures are always updated so if you want to get a feel for the types of Angel Investments we have been doing and the types of things uh that we'll be doing in the in the fund itself you can head on over to bankless.com disclosures click the link there and you'll see all of these things and the reason why they honestly need to be organized in some sort of a different structure but David I don't know if I trust a guy uh in this kind of a jacket here and it looks kind of like a crypto Rebel here if I give this guy my money was this taken last night I would say that was at the bank list Meetup yeah uh and the first question that everyone probably like asks is like all right how does bankless Ventures affects the media side of things and the very big and easy answer is that it just doesn't change anything at all and intentionally so um when we first thought about doing bankless Ventures our first exploration was a long conversation with lawyers I was like what what would we have to change on the media side of things to do bankless Ventures because we don't want to change anything on the media side of things we want to preserve media to the maximum degree and so after that conversation with lawyers like because we have literally the industry's best disclosures we also never do any paid content ever on principle and we already have an editorial policy that makes all of our personal Angel Investments not impact our content decisions like we just learned that everything that we are already doing on the media side of things doesn't impact uh Ventures and Ventures doesn't uh impact media and so when we have been chatting with potential LPS at the very beginning of these chats we make a very firm statement at that at the very beginning of our call that bankless media in no way will support bankless Ventures if any portfolio company wants to come on the podcast and we've gotten plenty of questions or like requests from our portfolio companies that come on the podcast before they will always have to do it the old-fashioned way which is by building something worthy of covering and sufficiently interesting to the bank list audience and with the investment funds that's flowing into crypto all over the place of course crypto is always hiring you can check out the latest jobs on the bankless jobs board that's bankless.palot.com jobs uniswap Labs needs a senior software engineer bankless is hiring some writers analysts social growth leads consensus wants a director of engineering there's still that Adidas rule a global head of web3 strategy and planning a whole bunch more go over to the jobs board and check that out that's bankless.palot.com jobs David what do we got coming up next coming up next we got the questions from the nation got some good ones as well as what Ryan and I are excited about as well as the takes of the week so don't go anywhere we're gonna get to all of that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make sure possible arbitrim 1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of Arboretum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to Arbitron Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop got some questions of the week for you the first from the bankless nation Discord Simon Bruce 1974 here saying using bass as an example if a chain is built on the op stack that's the optimism stack does it still require a bridge to move assets to another chain built on the optimism stack or optimism or is it as simple as sending the asset as a normal transaction that's the question what say you David the answer is yes and no um right now the answer is yes the idea about the op Sac is in the future that answer will be no and the answer will won't be ever perfectly no but the answer Trends towards no why is that such a confusing answer so the idea yeah well the idea is that base and optimism are both on the op stack because of that common denominator the bridge between these two chains has less risk and less less dependencies and more standardization and so the bridge between base and the op stack is less bridgy than it would be it hadn't been to like I don't know base to arbitrum or base to polygon or something because of the common denominator of the op stack a lot of complexity is removed and as further Innovations more Innovations come to the scene a lot of that complexity becomes abstracted and obfuscated away and so yes there will always be a bridge right now that bridge is pretty bridgy to use a very technical term and then in the future it will become less bridgy and that is also true for all op stack chains and so the bridginess trends towards zero however it will never hit zero but the idea is that with additional Technologies uh you can you can obfuscate and Abstract a lot of the bridgingness um I made an OP Stack video If you go to YouTube and type in bankless op stack there's my face next to a thumbnail that's titled op stack if you want to learn more click that video it's it's all part of the same kind of I guess Nation security apparatus if you will it'll be more like traveling from New York to New Jersey than like New York to cross the border to Canada or something like that right yeah so imagine it's like okay we're in we're in the United States in the 1700s you can get from New York to Washington State pretty easily well not pretty easily you can do it without crossing a passport control but you still gotta walk and then you fast forward 300 years and then you can just fly really really fast the bridginess gets less bridgy no high speed rail though yet which makes me better every time I think about that not yet yes come on America uh okay here's a question from Captain Randall wall I think I said that right sorry Captain uh apologies if that has already been covered but what are your thoughts on the eigenlayer and the potential impact of eth staking and price do you see this as helpful to alts in terms of securing validation that first question of what is eigen layer first maybe you have to Define that and what's the potential impact on eat staking and eth price yeah so eigenlayer is just absolutely swept the world of crypto by storm just because of what it is and if you are curious about this answer to this question it would behoove you I think to listen to the interview I did with sriram at the interoperability Summit that I went to a couple days ago where we talked about this subject in particular what is eigenlayer eigenlayer is taking normal ethereum staking and adding on additional like additional what I'm calling like mods if you will and so like not only are you staking your East to ethereum for all the normal reasons but you can also use that ether stake that you've already staked to also secure something else so rather than having when you say secure the idea is like a bond right it's like Economic Security yeah so that's what you mean by modding you're like I'm gonna secure this ethereum main chain thing but then for some additional risk and reward I'll also do this other thing right so imagine like chain link you stake the link token to do the Oracle network with eigenlayer you can stake your eth to ethereum again for normal mistaking reasons and then also have that same stake also secure an oracle Network or a data availability Network or generally anything that needs Economic Security and so the idea is that this produces additional yields for East Acres because they can secure more things but with additional slashing penalties if you lie or do something wrong for whatever additional thing that you're doing so the question is what is the potential impact on e-staking and price um it for all of the there was a tweet that we talked about forever ago I can layer enable Halal alt layer ones for each Maxis sure which which also deserves unpacking uh so I'll do my best the idea is that like all of these alt layer ones like Celestia uh subnets on Avalanche like all of these reasons to produce different alt layer like layer ones that would trigger The Descent the decentralization Maxis now you can just use ethereum staking normal ethereum staking to do all of that same kind of services without having to have additional tokens or additional like chains or all that kind of stuff and so it produces additional yields for your eth and it really imbues a lot of the reasons to make additional outlayer ones and imbues that value into ether and ether staking so in the pendulum I talked about this with three ROM there's like a pendulum between polychainism mesh network of many many chains and bridges that's one end of the spectrum and then the other end of the spectrum is like single one dominant layer one chain there's always a spectrum of like where we are in the pendulum and eigenlayer really pushes this towards there's really only needs to be one dominant chain and everything else is is less necessary um there's going to be a tug of war between these two things but eigenlayer is definitely pushing towards like all you really need to do is take ether and then sign up for additional uh yield opportunities if you want I think to the question the captain is asking about uh impact on price oh it's bullish this this is incredibly freaking it's incredibly do you remember the idea that um we'd come out with a couple of years ago about ether the internet bond which is the idea that ether is an internet bond for the ethereum ecosystem that's what happens when you're staking you're actually bonding it and it accrues monetary premium in the way that uh a bond might um this is now ethereum being able to export ether the asset as a bond to other foreign chains or foreign protocols and that is incredibly powerful because these kinds of monetary premium games like bonding type games are all power law games right so why would you bond with some other chains native asset when that is far less liquid and far more volatile than ether the internet Bond so this is like if eigenlayer really picks up and that's still an if right we don't know for sure but if it picks up it is incredibly bullish for ether the asset as that the meme that we you know predicted a couple years ago as the internet Bond ether the asset really becomes a bond for securing things economically on the internet and wow that is a powerful place to be so that that is why this technology is not just bullish for more chains more experiments more scalability more expansion but it's also incredibly bullish for ether the asset and I don't even think we've come up with a model for that yet yeah the most bullish way to articulate this is that go to coin gecko uh filter out all tokens and only do layer one chain lines and as you go down the market cap stack think of like all of those things those special purposes things that those chains do and eigenlayer allows ethereum to eat all of them that's like the most bullish articulation about what eigenlayer does yep it's definitely possible crazy right yeah all right some takes this week this one from Ann Olsen that's a-n-e Dot eth may 2016 ethereum Launches on coinbase May 2023 coinbase Launches on ethereum my how things change this uh to me is a perfect that deserves so much more likes this is a a part well I look at me I didn't even give it a like there you go um this is the perfect articulation of the protocol sync thesis I think which is yes it does yes yes uh the most credible neutral Technologies sink to the bottom of the stack and become the basis in the foundation for everything else coinbase was started before ethereum and yet now it's building on top of ethereum that's incredible to me and uh yeah a perfect articulation of what we've been talking about when did we develop the protocol sync thesis that was like 2019 I think so four years ahead of it pretty like I'm pretty sure this was one of the main articulations you said like eventually coinbase will build its own chain yeah and it will use its own chain to produce its products and services that was a prediction I had no idea at the time we had no idea it would be on a layer two the concept of delay or two wasn't really didn't even matter that is a as an aside detail the idea is that protocols slip under Banks and that was the always the articulation uh and so like this is what this is what it means to be a thesis-driven media company man yeah sometimes sometimes we get things right right sometimes we do here's something else I think we'll get right David this is my tweet why don't you read it Ryan Sean Adams says the secret to success in any bear Market one learn two build three accumulate that's it walk us through this Ryan yeah I think um that's really your job in the bear Market you're listening so this is a bear market for you um and you got to do those three things learn build and accumulate number one like learn find people that are smarter than you in this space tune in to informational resources that are trusted that are long-term oriented that have ideas and Theses and back those things up with research rather than kind of the pump and dumps use as many D5 protocols as you can travel in a pack in a community rather than a loan you'll learn faster that way join chats join discords follow people on crypto that you respect and want to learn from that is what learn means and you have tons of time to do that during the the bear Market um secondly build this is applying your talents your skills whether you're a podcaster maybe start a podcast or come on a podcast if you're a writer write something if you're an artist uh create art if you're a musician do music experiment with nfts if you're an engineer my God there's so much you can do with that skill set if you're a front-end designer if you are an organizer you can go you can organize things you can govern things there's so much that you can do by apply applying your talents in this crypto space I know David that's very much what you did when you kind of entered in that you know 2017 2018 eras like you're really good at communication and I'm like talking about narratives and so you did these things and um that progressed from kind of like you know part-time type work to it became your full-time gig there's a massive opportunity to build so much needs building and so much is getting created right now and you have the opportunity to be on the ground floor and then third don't forget to accumulate don't forget to buy this is important don't forget to buy the assets that are going to appreciate if your ideas around learning and kind of the building phases are successful you have an opportunity to get a piece of I'll call this Equity not in the Gary Gensler security Equity uh line of thinking but more in like in the upside of this entire industry sometimes David I I see people that um they've been in crypto they've done incredible things they know all sorts of things about it and they've built it but they've made the mistake of not accumulating along the way right so they don't get to share with the rest of the community and that upside make sure you don't become one of those people so whether that means dollar cost averaging in uh again don't risk more than you can afford to lose but the percentage will vary depending on like who you are at your stage of Life your risk tolerance all of these things or lump sum I mean now is the time it's still a bear market now is the time to accumulate you don't want to accumulate during the top of the next uh Pico Bull Run you want to accumulate now so that's it like anybody else who's selling you other things of like 10 secrets to getting rich on crypto in like 90 days it's just that's all garbage only three things you need to do this is proven this is tested everybody who's doing well in crypto that we know David has done these three things learn build and accumulate and the last thing I'll say is um these things are all on you it's stuff you have to go you're not going to get spoon fed this stuff you have to go pick up take some responsibility in yourself and and do it your own uh there you go this turned into um you know RSA dad talk but um I I love it it's so important it's so important and you have time right now you're listening you're here you can go do these things don't wait okay and I'll just add this isn't necessarily easy to do these things but it's also not necessarily hard either and it is fun and it has fun to do it along the way and so like it's just a very simple road map don't overthink it um and make sure you have fun along the way there you go uh that's what David always reminds me of to have fun along the way this looks fun I'm sorry I missed it what are we looking at David yeah yeah so we had the first ever bankless Nation Meetup the bankless nation manifested in real life uh sometimes Network states of what this is certainly becoming Ryan uh how to manifest it in real life at a brewery uh man it was awesome Brian it was also packed look how many people there are there was like over 150 people there yeah it was it was the end what's the vibe how's the how's the bankless community doing how's everyone doing it was so many different people from so many different walks of life that all had like different reasons for like what why they like bankless and why they listen uh and so like there are people from from Asia talking about like people from Korea talking about hey like I do a lot of translations of bankless content into other podcasts and other newsletters uh the bankless Brazil guys were there they're always there oh man that's amazing every single time Anthony cesano was there yeah we had a ton of previous guests uh we had the Alfalfa boys my friends from uh from San Diego uh it was just a really cool time uh I I realized like halfway through was like oh yeah there's a microphone in a stage I'm not used to going on a microphone alone but like I gotta say something uh so I had someone say thanks everyone for coming so yeah thanks to everyone for coming and then I kind of told the story of like yeah Ryan and I just started the podcast and newsletter with the intention of making content uh but then we hired a few people and then then we hired a few more and and then I said like hey if you're from HQ everyone raise your hand uh and then introduced the HQ one by one by one uh and uh just it was able to make a big thanks to all the team that was able to support this because like we I would not we would not be able to organize a Meetup without the actual team behind us and so this particular East Denver is the the event where the bankless HQ team has showed up the most uh I'm we're currently in an Airbnb that we're calling the bankless dorm six or seven other people here uh so we got Luke and Dave helping me record content which is why the in real life conference interviews are going to be the highest quality high production interviews even though they're there and they're still going to get you this roll up out yes yes right here I'm looking at him right now God bless him over I mean giving me a wave and then there's Chrissy who is uh handing out all the poapps and like talking to everyone in the bankless nation uh so uh this is uh I think the choice Ryan to move Beyond just a fun little uh lifestyle business and grow this into what is becoming a network state of sorts uh I think was a good move that's really cool I know like so I haven't met as many of you guys bankless nation in real life as I'd like to um but the the the times that I have it's always felt like just like instant connection like kindred spirit like a different place in the world maybe different language all sorts of differences and yet we're all kind of like one group that is going west together um it's the most diverse group of people from all around the world from all these very values like different interests interest interests and like meaning and purpose for being here that everyone just like gets along so well it's amazing I love it yeah really cool uh all right well that's that's what I'm excited about is that what you're excited about that was yours what's excited about okay cool yeah um well David I'm excited about how uh this this bear Market is shaping up like I don't care what anyone says this is my favorite bear Market ever maybe the best ever uh and that's because the tourists are gone the settlers are here they know why they're here we have product Market fit we're not going to run out of money this time I think we're like fairly well capitalized this was not the case in 2018 and 2019 the Riff Raff and the scammers are quiet they're either going to jail or they've fled to you know places where they can't get caught and the builders are building and I think that's what you're seeing at youth Denver is just a whole bunch of Builders getting together more than ever during this bear Market they're not dismayed by what's going on they're not put out by The Regulators they're just heads down building and so that's why this is one of the most exciting times honestly I've been in crypto and um I can I can say that like I don't know that I mean 2017 was exciting it's kind of like Discovery 2018 2019 were kind of a grind of figuring this out and finding product Market fit 2020 was exciting because it felt like some of the thesis was coming true 2021 uh things were starting to go off the rails obviously 2021 was great second it was great 2021 was a slog totally and then 2022 I was just like it sucked I was very disappointed with um with 2022 and all the shenanigans that that went on 2023 it just is feeling like it's shaping up to me my favorite year in crypto yet because we got the settlers we got the product Market fit we've got a little bit of money we got funded uh and so now we can we can head West and build out this movement and be ready for uh the next wave of adoption so that's what I'm excited about this week yeah the only thing bad about 2023 is Gary Gensler but there are so many ways to turn that evilness that Gary Gensler is bringing to us is into something like really really good like it's we're banding together we're learning to fight in the Capitol Hill uh and I I think he's gonna level up his lemons that eliminated he's gonna level us up man it's one boss it's not the final boss still but it's a boss fight and so okay bring it yeah let's do it like everything else in crypto is coming together yeah yep uh David meme of the week I haven't seen this yet but uh I did see the parent tweet so this was you and Anthony cesano it says caption this that's even this jacket and Anthony you guys uh together eat Denver so um I think we're about to look at a caption yeah yeah yeah so this is the third time I've met Anthony cesano in real life uh it like I first saw him at ZK day and gave him a big hug but then had to run off I was like oh that's my one of my best friends that I haven't seen in so long but like I gotta go talk to this person but then I gotta come back to him uh but it's just like so fun like how casual it is like oh Anthony in real life now uh but it's always so good to see him so he took a photo and I I put out this uh caption this uh header on the photo yeah and we're about to look at the winner this is the winner okay let me look at this okay this is Gimli of course Lord of the Rings thank you you told me I'd like this never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf that is uh Gimli saying this and of course give me is of course Anthony because of you know the beard the big Vineyard I get it well you guys are not opposing tribes you guys are same tribes so you're both yeah but we're just super snarky with each other yeah we're like we're like we're like brothers who who fight all the time yeah all right give me and his brothers uh he has a lot of big dwarfs I'm like a loss and he's gonna leave uh that's awesome I'm an elf apparently of course you'd want to be legless I I understand that um sorry sorry for that Anthony David loves you though well Anthony was a big fan of this response as well that's good all right guys that's been it the eve Denver Edition I guess next week we'll be talking a little bit about youth Denver too but um David's because the conferences actually started right now I am literally about to run off to his shelling point to give my talk and then East Denver conference for the rest of the day so you boys gotta leave yeah we'll get some content to you guys though pretty soon so you'll feel like you're there um risks and disclaimers gotta let you know none of this has been Financial advice it never is it's not legal advice either who knows what a security is I don't even
