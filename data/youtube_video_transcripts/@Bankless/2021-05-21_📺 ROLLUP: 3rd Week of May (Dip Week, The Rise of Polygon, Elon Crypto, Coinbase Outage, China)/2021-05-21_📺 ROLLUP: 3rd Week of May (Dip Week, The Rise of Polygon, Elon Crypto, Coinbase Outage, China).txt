[Music] bankless nation it is the third week of may and it is a friday morning that means it's roll up time and this is dip week david dip week david roll up time too are you excited dip week david also all-time high week and dip week all in the same week yeah ether hit his all-time high in the the friday after we recorded the last week of the rollup and then crypto also crashed all in the same week guys we're going to be talking about all of that that's going to be in the market section that's what we do here every friday morning we try to cram as much of the week that was crypto into your brain where we cover markets releases news takes and we end with what we're excited about except that we don't end there we actually end with the meme of the week so stay tuned for the meme of the week this comes at you every friday all right david before we get in we got to talk about consensus big cryptic conference coming right up people can get their tickets this is the last chance though to get their tickets david you're going to be speaking what are you speaking about ultrasound money on monday still working on my presentation but it's going to be hot ultrasound money gets its debut at consensus and then i'll also be speaking on a panel about the current state of defy and of course how to live a life without banks so bankless also getting its debut at consensus uh really excited for this particular year of consensus because so many of ethereum things have gone mainstream as we expected them to for years and years but now they are finally here now they have like the front stage at consensus defy nfts so much to talk about really excited to talk about all those things and listen to the other conversations that are going on ray dalio's going to be there michael saylor's going to be there anyone who's anyone in crypto is going to be there so you should be there awesome yes i'm definitely going to be there and bankless listeners you still have a chance i think two more days from today to get your ticket 20 off with the bankless codes make sure you do that there's a link in the show notes david also this is no longer an opportunity we uh the bankless dow that is issued a uh an awesome shirt and this is based on our april's april fool's day joke where we said like bankless was getting acquired by wells fargo psych that'll never happen right and anyway the bank livestock created community created this fantastic shirt to come commemorate that it's the first i think in a future apparel line it's all sold out now that was a limited edition sale i think you got one yeah uh from what i've heard hundreds of sales there it went really well yeah so the thing to do guys is next time don't miss out on this go to cryptoculture.substance.com sign up get your email address there that's where the drops will be dropped so you are first to know i think future drops david might have a set amount and you know sell out might be time limited but it might be also uh number limited like scarcity in one form or another and that is really the through line with bankless apparel is in the non-crypto world the non-cryptoculture world apparel is not scarce and there there is the world of like scarce apparel and just like you know street wear that some people are into uh and we want to emulate that culture in crypto apparel there is uh uh there is a through line about fixing fast fashion like bad garments that just cost two dollars and you wear them two times and then you never touch them again no we want scarce apparel that you wear for life because it has that premium price tag it doesn't fray it doesn't wear out it's a dope design done with an intent the cool thing about this is that we didn't mass produce these shirts and then sell them we took the orders and now we are making one shirt per unit of demand so there's no excess there's no uh you know environmental uh issues it's about changing the culture of the world around us using scarcity and scarcity tools uh and also rug pulling the wells fargo logo and making it our own oh that's just exporting crypto culture and that's just the fun part i'm wearing one of these which is ritual bap design only 50 have ever will ever be made really fun guys so get in on that okay david you ready to get in we got to start with markets this week and with markets we have to start with the dip but before we get there let's describe it for folks bitcoin what happened this week in bitcoin price sir yeah bitcoin fell from 58 000 of the high of the week all the way down to 36 500 or so at the deepest part of the dip which is a level that i don't think anyone saw coming slight rebound up into the low 40 000 range but bitcoin has really been having a tough number of weeks ryan if you uh zoom out all the way until until april uh it's it bitcoin has been in this consolidation period which everyone was hoping would break out from because it's a bull market you tend to break out in bull markets but no it broke down and it's been having a real tough time uh with you know and just overall in in the news cycles it's the elon has just been pounding it like environmental issues blah blah blah china fudd uh bitcoin having a really tough time lately we're like this is definitely three months low lows it's not quite year-to-date lows but it's getting close man getting really close year-to-date lows um yeah i do think there's a case to be made that the current risk adjusted return risk profile is really really strong with bitcoin right now like ooh interesting we'll get that back to that too but first let's talk about what happened in ether because that went down as well the price of eth went down after as you said we hit all-time highs so tell us about the highs and then let's go to the lows yeah ether hit an all-time high of 4 390 which wow really really high and it kind of makes sense as like when things are that high like you can it's easier to go in the down direction and that's definitely what happened again no one really expected this level of downness and that's really the through line of the markets this week is like holy like i kind of thought the the this was the only thing that i can remember of a move like this was black thursday in all of my years of crypto it has never really seemed to move that much that quickly uh and ether went for after after it topped out of its highest four thousand three hundred dollars it came down to three thousand seven hundred dollars it then went down to three thousand five hundred dollars and held there it kind of seemed like it was going to make a nice basing pattern but then the floor just fell out and it went from 3500 all the way down to 2 000. i know all the way down to 1 800 on some exchanges think about that 4 300 down to 1 800 dollars really quick right 55 drop really quick i've got some hot takes on that but i'll reserve that uh for now let's let's take a look before we get to those takes on the dip it was dip week guys uh you know buy the dip maybe we'll talk about that to you but first let's talk about how the ratio held up this is the ether to bitcoin ratio it's something david we've been monitoring since the first part of this year when ethe was really gaining on bitcoin how did the ratio hold up last week yeah the ratio peaked out at just over .08 which again really really high and then and and then historically when dips happen the eth btc ratio quote unquote it gets slaughtered consistently every single time you know when bitcoin sneezes if ethereum just gets absolutely wrecked uh and to some degree like the ratio did uh pull back a little bit but like it's still really strong and that's kind of the in sentiment around crypto twitter right now is the ratio held up between ether and bitcoin which is something to take note of people don't remember but do you know could you remember another time it held up david was 2017 like when we saw this kind of action and like i feel like this is maybe a theme when we get into talking about the dip but like so far dude 2017 2021 feels like a fractal of 2017. it's playing out very similarly definitely 2018 2019 when bitcoin sneezed uh eth got destroyed that was not the case in 2017 and this is reminding me a bit of 2017. we'll get to that i've been kind of thinking about like the what what it means to go a full cycle and i got into crypto and ethereum after ethereum pumped all the way up from like 10 up to 430 dollars and that was crazy and that's when i started paying attention to it and then after ethereum or ether hit 430 dollars it crashed down to 135 and that's the moment that i got in and i that feels like a this feels like a fractal of that now i know a lot of my friends who have just gotten into ether in this brief moment of time and so like oh a lot of my friends are just now getting into ethereum and you know price is a great marketing tool and it feels like that time when ether ran up to 430 dollars off of this insane floor of like 10 to 20 dollars and then fell down to 130 oh dude that's exactly it look and the numbers are similar too like i remember those days this is why i feel like this is like 2017 right so that was 66 off of all-time high and i remember that drop david it was like 420 the memes were about 420 eath price 420. and then it all the way to 130 it was like mass panic bull market's over eth was a bubble this whole time the entire platform's like worth nothing like i told you guys all of this talk and it happened very rapidly like in this move it was like in the flash of a day two days all of a sudden 66 drop feels very much like that right now all right dave let's take a look at this chart because i think this really nails at home this is one ugly looking chart or at least one strange looking chart green candle up spike green candle down spike what are we looking at here yeah this is the weekly chart so each candle is one week for the dollar price and there's a famous line both in markets but especially in crypto uh where you know stairs up or escalator up but elevator down right and so you know markets climb a wall right and so we were all we were all super euphoric when ether hit 4 300 and then just one week later it spikes all the way back down and retraces one two three four five six seven eight weekly candles are erased in two weeks right and so this is a lesson in a just being in zen about this because like this is going to happen pain comes in markets if you feel pain it's just inevitability and so this is also a lesson in leverage if you were on leverage and you got liquidated i'm sorry that's the pain it's a lesson to be learned if you didn't get liquidated good job um and the the take here is that you know perhaps as you know crypto becomes more mainstream we always thought the markets were becoming less volatile perhaps as these markets become bigger the volatility actually gets bigger yeah i i still think volatility is going down with a long like over the long term if you like cycle all the way out a little bit but yes absolutely we're not over the volatility days and i actually think volatility is a feature not a bug at some level right like so people are so afraid of volatility but you only have to worry about volatility if like holders don't have to worry about volatility right like i'm holding yeah traders do beholders don't i like uh the market gets and i feel like the news cycle david gets gets all hung up on crypto's volatility and they think that volatility is like a proxy for risk right but like the fiat markets are a lot less volatile but i think they have a massive like a whole lot more tail risk here in in fiat markets right so it's just a different it's it's it's almost a more honest market right if you will right like there aren't people tinkering with the dials and so you get this this craziness and of course less liquidity too at these earlier phases but let's talk about everyone's asking what happened right so when something like this happens you get a big drop uh everyone wants to know what was the cause of this so we have to talk about this what was the cause of this here is a trader's perspective this is uh dylan leclair had a great tweet thread about it let's go through some of these david so first off dylan says bull market corrections on the general of 25 to 30 percent are completely normal and expected this has happened in all previous bull runs that's his first point his second point he talks about elon musk here throwing a molotov cocktail into the mix here also elon musk talking about energy consumption of bitcoin so that's one other possible explanation for it uh where else does this thread take us in in terms of dylan's explanations for this uh downturn david yeah he looks at some utxo analysis where like who is sending uh bitcoins this is a bitcoin focus trader who is sending bitcoins and at what prices um and he draws the connection that you can uh do this thing called the spent output profit loss ratio i'm not familiar on this metric but the conclusion he comes to is that there was a ton of leverage in the system it's all about leverage and this is where these normal 20 to 30 percent drawbacks which are healthy turn into violent immediate cascading quick drawbacks and so he goes on on his next tweet ryan uh he he looks at um here's what he says following the 64 000 all-time high the market started to sell off during the sell-offs funding flips negative which means that you are actually uh incentivized um i think this is right correct me if i'm wrong uh listeners i guess uh if when funding flips negative you are actually paid to go long and so each time traders quickly leverage back up so like bitcoin hit 64 000 it dipped down to 55 000 and people are like there's the dip i'm going to buy it and i'm going to leverage up and so the leverage never got flushed out of this system right underwater longs kept adding to their leverage right every dip they added more to their leverage and at some point the this guy claims that on the next tweet that a bunch of whales saw this opportunistic whale saw this and deposited into exchanges and began relentlessly spot selling knowing that these uh knowing that how many leveraged traders were going to they were going to forcibly make them underwater and forcibly liquidate them right and so the this uh you know in theory uh wales looked at all how much leverage was in the system and they're like if we dump the market we can buy like discounted bitcoins right uh and so that's the conspiracy is that there was way too much leverage that was identifiable very much like the gme debacle right like people just noticed how much short position there was and so they bought a bunch of dme and then all of a sudden we had the squeeze this is the same exact thing which is in the inverse right and so now there's a ton of leverage that's flushed out from the system if you get liquidated your leverage goes to zero and that's what happened to a lot of people we had 27 billion dollars of open interest at the uh i believe uh the 64 thousand dollar mark and now we got that cut in more than half the trader finishes by saying this is nothing and should be treated as a huge buying opportunity i i feel like that's a great trader's explanation of what happened it's just like there's so much leverage in the market downturn caused cascading downturn because of leverage and the leverage was flushed right that has to happen periodically as part of a bull run which is why you've seen this pattern in other bull runs you know what's also interesting david that that's kind of the traders take of why this happened but of course like crypto media and like the narrative side of crypto wants to take two here were i guess a few popular takes i heard for why this happened one router's china banned bitcoin routers reported that china banned bitcoin um i don't know if you saw this circulating but it was in fact not the case china did not ban bitcoin this i don't know how many times this has happened like more than dozens like honestly a ceremony at this point it's like oh yeah this week yeah it's it's going to happen it's going to happen every three months or so just like clockwork uh elon musk tweets his tweet that tesla uh was dumping 1.5 billion bitcoin stash of course tesla was not dumping the the bitcoin stash although elon's pretty erratic these days in his tweets about cryptocurrency which we'll get to okay so some people said that was the cause it was elon's fault uh over leverage which we talked about other people said it was tether so tether published a breakdown of its reserves not super cash centric i don't know if you saw that david like uh also very little ceremony is fud we always get it yes yes also tethers compilations like when you buy a tether you're definitely not buying a dollar in the in the bank account you're buying a lot of other things but it's already [Music] yeah plus like treasuries and bonds and all sorts of things anyway separate discussion that was uh a reason given also broader macro economic trends inflation warnings right what was the reason okay maybe that's led like a correlation with with stocks maybe that's led to growing fear and uncertainty investors are getting skittish you know all of these things are given as explanations but i almost feel like they're they're always like narratives that sort of retrofit the data and i just i'm not convinced by any of them right i just think like in bull markets this sort of thing is going to happen and then people will look back after it happens to be like oh here were the causes very clearly right it doesn't actually have to have a cause it could have been anything that happened i think holistically we can say like oh yeah all of those things like overall it just made everyone just really down like our hero elon turned against us yeah people are just down about this tether fudd like china yeah gosh maybe it made people pessimistic right holistically not really any one of these things but overall people just like oh there's so much to fight the energy debate is relentless nick carter is getting swarmed uh and then also at the same time we have this these over leveraged traders in wales which really just like lights the dynamite like that i feel like is a more rational explanation for sure and i i guess i feel like you could swap this set of headlines out with any other set of headlines in a given week or two weeks in crypto and it would be the same thing like the net of this david is i feel like a reckoning was needed a rectangle people needed to get wrecked after this after this bull run like it had to happen and dips happen um i tweeted this out david right so like people are stunned by the um the drop the sudden drop right right and i get that but like also feel it we feel it we feel it we feel it like but also guys like zoom out right so the prices that you just quoted right ether all the way down to 1800 it was 1800 45 days ago like just 45 days we only lost 45 days at the lowest of the low now ethan's is recovering a bit but like oh my god man like if if you bought 45 days ago you might have lost anything on eth like let's zoom out a little bit and realize how much this asset class has been growing right rather than focus on the dips like it is true when in doubt zoom out like you have to zoom out uh and realize that we're sitting at a price right now that we were like 30 days ago less than 30 days and as low as low is only 45 days ago from a price perspective um there's a there's a tweet response on on my response that just made the point that uh david you and i were talking about that the same thing happened in in 2017 from the 420 mark to the 150 mark so dips are going to happen it could have been anything i feel like this was just destined to happen uh at at this point in the cycle yeah and again this feels like the marker of the second half of the bull market that's what it was in 2017 i feel like that's what this is now good take um springtime it's it's funny it kind of happened around the same time in 2017 right um let's go to raleigh paul i thought i thought this was interesting too so raul paul does a chart comparison the first is bitcoin now versus 2013 where he's comparing the two and in white you see current price of bitcoin right in this navy color you see bitcoin price 2010 2017. um the lines kind of line up yeah i mean it can't chaotically line up yeah totally fractally line up mm-hmm um let's go to 2017. right yep perfect and this is this is exactly what we're just talking about like the dips almost yeah exactly what you you just said like it's seasonality is actually the same the dip amount is pretty similar like i guess this is just the ceremonious halfway through the bear the bull market like whales whales are getting more bullish and they have more resources to liquidate markets who are over leveraged maybe this is maybe this is it i think he uh did uh eath somewhere too in the thread yeah someone asked him hey dude um here it is yeah or ethno versus btc in 2017. is that what this is yeah you can wow so ether in the bear market 2018 to 2019 was lower than b btc in 2017 and right now it's higher and i feel like that's just a perfect indicator of just like ethereum and ether's narrative was getting just absolutely slaughtered in the bear market and now finally people are starting to figure out and so it goes from underperforming to over performing really quickly that's interesting that is interesting what's what's he doing so he's doing one for eth uh well that was what we just looked at okay i would love to see like eth now versus in 2017 but i'm sure that's out there anyway like these patterns are all super similar so there's that uh while this chaos was going on of course crypto exchanges went down i think a number of them david i think the record number of them coinbase doesn't help i mean it usually goes down uh finance u.s u.s went down kraken went down gemini went down bitstamp went down that's all the exchanges that's all of them that's everything didn't go down what didn't go down david d fight didn't go down didn't d5 did not go down ethereum did not go down 99. gas prices went up though guys presented kind of a proxy of going down if you can't afford a gas price is it really is it really up for you um yeah it's a bigger bigger conversation yeah uh did not go down though all right david let's let's talk a little bit more about um what happened in d5 so total locked and defy almost 90 billion dollars and then it got flushed out too below 60 billion dollars we were almost we were almost celebrating that 100 billion mark and then all the way down um so that's total locked value in d5 how about how did how did defy tokens hold up this week let's see d5 tokens have been doing okay right like uh ave still 460 dollars unit swap 26 dollars um impressive it's pretty impressive as like generally flat i mean they definitely took a hit of course but as far as things go defy tokens didn't really get the run-up that ether got but also didn't get like the slaughtering that ether got either that's super impressive actually i didn't realize d5 tokens held up uh they did okay this week they did okay d5 did okay let's uh take a look at this and look yeah look at it dpi versus ether again called the bottom last week a little bit uh so roughly ten days ago called the bottom of point one three you did sir eat per dpi we are at the level of 0.161 we almost got up to 0.18 down to 1.161 but yeah east versus dpi bottom still in pat myself on the back maybe i'll become a trader you know that's actually impressive david because i actually would have would have predicted that um a dpi would have gotten slaughtered uh relative to ethe in this in this and that didn't happen so maybe that bottom will hold sir um i think so i like this i like this chart too this is from this is good alternative i mean it's the fear and greed index right i think they measure this based on various social media sentiment other sentiment scores but right now we are on the extreme fear side of the spectrum i think the other side of this spectrum is like you know jubilance exuberance rational exuberance right we are now tokens are going bajillion x's yeah last week and then also eth maxis are gloating about the ratio yeah yeah exactly wait wait who does that no one does that no one does no one does that no one but but let's say hypothetically they did gloat about the ratio they would do that in the exuberant phase they would not do that in the extreme fear phase and now we are in extreme fear phase i'm reminded of this warren buffett quote where he says be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy right like so what are we working on when you dial into the extreme fear phase when we're over there that's when you got to be greedy right right when we're in exuberance that's when you feel like like your lizard brain tells you it's like oh my god it's going up it won't stop going up i gotta leverage i gotta leverage i gotta get more worse right that's worse when you lever lever up to even get like increase those gains um that's when you should be fearful like you should look around and be scared um but right now we've swung into the extreme fear and i think that investing adage buffett's investing adage holds up you got to be uh greedy during those times i will say one thing back to your comment david earlier about margin you know the the thing that gives you confidence during the extreme fear times like confidence to be greedy like the ability to be greedy is if you don't have margin it's a lot harder to be greedy when you have margin like during that times of extreme fear because you're just like right you're feeling flushed you're flushed yeah you got nothing on the first so how do you be greedy when others are fearful it's no leverage fam like if you want to do that have the dry powder ready don't over invest long-term time horizons all of these things are important i think it's a it's also a practice in mindfulness if you can be zen about the dip and be like yay i get to deploy capital uh everyone else is scared i'm scared too and i'm buying anyways that's a practice that's a practice in mindfulness and that's how you survive long term in crypto position yourself to do that you have to position yourself to do that too um this is a good take from hassou man he's he might be more eip1559 bullish than we are david and uh that podcast guys if you haven't listened to podcasts we had with haseo on eip1559 go listen to it um but he did a thought experiment imagine if eip1559 was live today david what did he say here every single block mind during this big dip had 30 eth in fees or more that was the basal level of eath feast per block during this crazy volatility times all of that would be burned and retroactively paid like via buyback and burn to ether holders like 30 east just deleted every like 12 seconds by the way because that's how fast ethereum blocks 30 eth paid every 12 seconds uh i don't know what that is annualized but it's a really big number um and then of course if proof of stake goes well uh stakers receive all of the extras fees right uh one day fees of uh 80 billion dollars i uh yeah 80 million excuse me uh i bet you i bet you it was over 100 yesterday i forgot to check it yesterday um but yeah i'm sure 80 million dollars of revenue per day like think of ethereum as a business 80 million of dollars per day in revenue with no overhead like that's a profitable business that you want exposure to and ether is how you do that dude also look at uniswap i was like paying attention to uh ethereum all week on fee revenue but like look at uh look at uniswap man 10 million in fees sushi swap 8 million in fees this week uh decentralized exchanges have really hit their their stride and they do best in bull markets uh sorry involut in volatile market whether that's bull or like bearish volatility so here's a new member on the uh the crypto fees uh pages uh quick swap which is the uniswap fork on polygon polygon yeah units what foreca polygon is the number one two three four fifth the fifth largest revenue generating application in all of crypto and it's on an ethereum l2 that is markets guys we are going to be back with some hot releases some news some takes of course meme of the week stay tuned for all of this but first we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com balancer is d5's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-vi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bat t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange all right guys we are back with releases we've got to talk about unit swap v3 at the start of this v3 released two weeks ago maybe three weeks ago now it is already the second largest decentralized exchange on ethereum trailed only by uniswap v1 and it's fast catching up v2 excuse me yes and it's fast catching up so at this pace it might actually surpass uniswap v3 or sorry v3 might surpass v2 by the end of this month uh absolutely are you surprised about that uh i mean no because unispot v3 is straight up a new paradigm in amms where amms to begin with are already a new paradigm but v3 is a new paradigm inside of a new paradigm uh and so i like to use the word paradigm um it's also interesting to note that uh you know uniform v2 and v3 are not uniswap right there is no one there is no uniswap there's unit swap v1 there's unisop v2 and now there's unit swap v3 these are all different things they just are under the same brand right and and technically shelling point social consensus around the same token um yes and we all everyone expects big things out of v3 uh and so uh and v3 has been adopted in very specific niche circumstances and but now people are coming to learn how to use it uh the ui is getting better uh people are getting more strategic with their liquidity look man there was always a chance that that it could fail i remember like you know um because because it's such a new paradigm right right um so like you know you hit a grand slam and then is the follow-up going to be as good it kind of reminds me of like you know apple released the iphone and then they released the ipad and analysts were like uh what was that right yeah like is this going to do well and this kind of felt to me like this it was it's definitely a paradigm shift but also risky some level you're changing the core way unit swap v2 worked are you changing everything about it and so it felt risky to me but like it's uh working and it seems to be working really well so congratulations to the uniswap team absolutely uh slingshot let's talk about that what is slingshot david you used it this week yeah slingshot is a amm or a decentralized exchange aggregator on polygon uh so this is a new polygon release uh i've traded uh on it and god damn are the fees absolutely awesome it literally feels like a centralized exchange and this is very few and like non-existent right sorry awesome as in non-existent fees yes as in point zero zero zero one matic which one might be like two dollars right now and so point zero zero zero one matic is basic basically zero call it zero uh and also basically instant finality right and so block times are really really short in polygon i think they're like two or three seconds and they always gets through on the first block because there's so much extra extra free real estate it's a suburb it's an ethereum suburb right and so the the great thing about uh polygon and specifically slingshot is like polygons still relatively new even though that they have been being adopted very very fast there's actually really decent liquidity on polygon but there can always be more and that's what slingshot does it's a liquidity aggregator it's a dex aggregator much like one inch much like matcha um but now it's on polygon uh and so uh really just adding liquidity into polygon making polygon a very um hospitable place to live that's cool that there's enough liquidity on on polygon for a dexa aggregator at this phase i think we're going to be talking about polygon some more later because it's had a big run-up and a big week um so we'll deserve some attention yeah um coinbase is excited to announce they say in this tweet a new coinbase wallet extension a wallet extension to more easily and securely connect to apps and defy on your desktop david this sounds like coinbase is rolling out their version of metamask is that what this is right yeah there's people just gotten used to using a browser extension uh to interact with defy and so coinbase is getting into that game they already had this metamask this coinbase wallet which i don't think many very many people will be familiar with if you have downloaded what is canonically known as coinbase this is not what you have downloaded this is coinbase wallet which is a self custody you control your own private keys uh defy enabled wallet with defy apps involved and so you put your own ether there you put your own tokens there you pay for your own gas it's non-custodial non-centralized and so now they are trying to really finally double down on this infrastructure which they've basically had in the back pocket forever now and finally trying to get that thing integrated into defy uh because they finally know finally recognizing that defy is the place to be uh and so hopefully coinbase just expends more and more resources into the coinbase wallet because we could definitely use some diversity of options in defy yeah i'm i'm very excited that metamask has some uh competition to make them better and you know another reason i think uh coinbase joined is because metamask is absolutely crushing it on fees like they are generating real revenue it seemed for a while like well is metamax going to be sort of a public good does it really have a business model but they incorporated some decentralized exchange aggregation added a layer of fees on top of that uh people are using it for convenience reasons and they're just crushing it in terms of revenue so coinbase is like business opportunity what are we we're a business right we're crypto business so we're going to go where the business opportunities are and i think that that's part of their expansion of the space too which is cool let's talk about this david miso miso on sushi swap what is this yeah so this is interesting this is a really interesting conversation and this is a kind of i feel like very much in my in my camp because i came in during into the crypto during the ico boom and icos leave like a bad taste in people's mouths just because of what they turned into but as a primitive all an ico was was a token launch and distribution pla or mechanism slash mania permissionless permissionless right and it was very very like i said rudimentary primitive bare bones uh and also too early uh we are returning to the concept of good token issuance or just token issuance at large so like this is basically a rebranded ico platform but maybe we should stop maybe we should leave the term ico behind this is a token launch and distribution sale infrastructure platform and so they have a bunch of different mechanisms to get your token out into the wild and so here's where i'll read this from the the launch article miso is a suite of open source smart contracts created to ease the process of launching a new project on the sushi schwab sushi swap exchange miso aims to drive new capital and trade it trade to the exchange by increasing the attractiveness of sushi swap as a place for token creators and communities to launch new project tokens we need to aim to create a launch pad for both technical and non-technical project founders that will allow communities and projects to access all the options they need for a secure and successful deployment to the sushi stop exchange choose from crowdsale dutch or batch auctions and as well as how you would like to manage participation so it's basically a suite of tools built on top of sushi swap to launch your token this is exactly what binance tried to do with their ieos which was just an iteration off of icos i remember consensus how they had the foundry spin-off that didn't really do well that tried to capitalize on the token issuance sushi swap getting back into token bootstrapping tools uh and i'm really optimistic about that because while icos were corrupted that doesn't mean that token issuance and token creation is bad and i think we could just have more optionality and expressivity with how we launched these things and now that we kind of as a community i'm more self-regulating i'm very much bullish on open more permissionless easy launch tools because i remember i wanted to launch my own token back in 2017 because i was a i just wanted to why not and i didn't really have any help to do it i had to learn how to code if this is allowing just random people to just launch their token ways they see fit people like garyvee who just wants to launch a token doesn't really care about the technicals or any other community member this is a tool for them that makes me really bullish awesome yeah awesome it's it's it's really exciting and like with binance chain or with binance ieos they sort of got corrupted right like you had to pay binance a fee they wanted their cut of the process this is really open permissionless uh like you know saki and miso is not taking a a inordinate cut out of this this whole process so it's uh it's really different and really accelerates that idea the other thing that struck me david is like what a perfect project for a pseudo-anonymous team to capture to to execute on right there there are many other teams that wouldn't want to even touch this because of 2017 sec securities type pressures but where is where is the sushi swap team i don't know all over the world outside of jurisdictions right this is a dao pseudo anonymous project great launch public infrastructure more tokens are coming some of these tokens will be terrible absolutely terrible as they were in 2017 but this is a new primitive mechanism for us to experiment on like it they're actually they're also launching with this sake token so they have their own internal project and sake literally it's a token redeemable for a bottle of sake and what yeah right so they've partnered they've partnered partnered with like this uh you know very uh craft sake i guess you would call it i don't know what to call it but very premium sake and there's only gonna be i think 800 sake bottles so like don't even think that this is just like a you know a defy token launch platform like literally launch your token for whatever like we could have launched our bat tokens uh with this as well um literally you're it's it's up up to you to use your imagination to how you want to use this infrastructure and also it's really bullish for sushi because they make they help people launch their tokens and naturally they were going to people who launched their tokens on sushi swap are going to be so inclined to keep their tokens on sushi swap and keep liquidity there so it's a really big play by the sushi swap team the last take on this is remember when sushi swap was just a fork of unison swap right man has it evolved right not evolved into its own thing uh doing a separate direction really cool to see the community uh build new things around this all right david let's get to the news of the week i think there are two big stories of the week that we need to cover the first is erratic elon what is elon musk doing again to the crypto markets we got to talk about that in a second is this this theme that we've talked about elsewhere which is the rise of polygon what does that mean for layer twos what does that mean for side chains like finance smart contract chain so let's talk about that first erratic elon what what f why is elon picking a fight with pick and fights left and right with michael saylor of all people right so you know uh uh peter mccormack made this big thread trying to like help elon like guide him down the rabbit hole of crypto and then elon was like annoying maxi threads like this just won't want to make me ape all my money into doge uh you know michael saylor made a comment and then and then and then elon musk made a meme of of some guy looking in the mirror pointing at himself in the reflection and goes no you are a genius everyone else is wrong um it's not the bull market you really are a genius uh which is poking fun at michael saylor who you know bought a bunch of bitcoin and then bitcoin went up in price and so now everyone loves michael saylor he's really just picking fights left and right right like he picked a fight with chain link god and so like really has no friends in the crypto space because he picks fights with everyone except doge's community and and then goes and chills doge right um erratic elon yeah and so probably probably contributed to some of this market decline because again it's just like it was just demoralizing for everyone like elon like it's just ceaseless it's endless like why are you even doing this it makes no sense like why are you concerned about bitcoin's energy now why did why didn't you care about it two weeks ago that's like god damn it just shut up elon just shut up delete twitter but of course he's never gonna do it do you know here's the thing david it's like i don't care though i feel like so here's here's the mistake that uh i feel like the crypto community made and this is i understand it right like when somebody with a lot of clout says something good about an asset you the community wants to put this person on a pedestal and that's what that's what bitcoiners specifically but also crypto in general did with elon to two months ago when he added bitcoin to the balance sheets like elon loves bitcoin now he's a supporter he's our hero we put him on this pedestal right but like now he's turning on them and like this was all we didn't have to put elon on a pedestal in the beginning i look here's what i feel like david it's like billionaires have been last to crypto except maybe the gemini are the winklevoss twins of gemini but like they've been last to crypto this entire time it's been the nobodies who've really adopted crypto and understand where the puck has been going right like very beginning of bitcoin it was the nobodies like ethereum very beginning all of the vcs turned down ethereum didn't buy any ether in ico very few of them did anyway and it was the the regular people the crypto natives who got in first it was like it was the people was the nobodies like why are we even taking advice from billionaires like we don't need their clout who cares dude i don't care what elon says i don't care in the slightest what he says has elon ever used uniswap has used ave does he know anything about like using metamask and non-custodial wallets and d5 right if if the answer to those questions is no he doesn't really know about crypto yet in my opinion like okay here's another mark cuban different different situation billionaire he's gone deep like he knows what he's doing and deep down teaching himself solidity we had him on the podcast right different story he's informed i don't think elon's takes are informed right now maybe someday they will be but uh why do we care so much i think there's i think there's good reasons as to why we care uh elon it's not elon musk is just one man happens to be the richest man but he has influence and so who cares about elon but i care about the people that think of him as a leader and are looking to him for information right because the guy landed a rocket and stuff on mars i think he did that like he's he does stuff right like he does really good stuff he like basically memed electric cars into existence and forcibly changed the entire automated uh industry the guy moves markets like crypto markets aside he moves mark he means he's got a ton of clout and following and so it's not just this one guy it's like if he legitimizes bitcoin that's really powerful if he's delegitimizing bitcoin uh oh like a lot of people are gonna take what elon says at face value and be like well if elon doesn't like it like like you know the guy lands rockets on mars like who am i to disagree with this man so this is why we had this we had this um uh podcast we did with udi wertheimer right and this was kind of like i actually i expected that to be sort of a you know kind of a troll fight back and forth but udi actually had some good takes about this one of his takes like one of his takes was um yeah he does but good take here one of his takes was like hey you are crypto natives are dramatically underestimating influencer coins yeah and what is elon doing is he's propping doge up as an influencer coin it's kind of like his elon coin yeah yeah and like the market doesn't necessarily care about like bitcoin maximalism or decentralization they very much care what elon buys and what he says so they're gonna go to whatever he says i don't know what what's your take on that do you think uh we're we're underplaying in crypto uh influencer coins do you think they have a huge future here yeah i mean at the end of the day crypto needs help going mainstream like we can't do it ourselves we can try and bootstrap our way into existence and like it'll work but really slowly and we all want crypto to be here like tomorrow right so we do need influencers to come and say like oh yeah crypto's dope um and and elon musk is perhaps the world's biggest influencer and right now he's saying crypto's not dope and so we're all like yeah that's that man that's right that's elon here's mine yeah there you go not a kid-friendly show not this week sorry let's go to another take um oh this is elon again i'm scared yeah we're done with these so many so many doges yeah all right another take polygon rise of polygon what does this mean sushi swap passed 500 million total locked value on polygon this week that's just that's just one delphi digital released a report about polygon as the swiss army knife of scaling solutions and emphasized how fast it's growing how well it's doing how many defy apps have migrated to it this is what the polygon ecosystem looks like we've got to talk about the rise of polygon david so what's happening here yeah so there the swiss army knife of l2s is a really interesting take and uh my buddy michael wong the chief of culture at uh at bank list made this really good take that you know there's a reason why loopering has had really troubles trying to trying to get out the door and all and it's because like sushi swap can't build on loopering loopering has to build its own it's not open it's not it's not open right and so sushi swap comes into polygons just deploys itself on polygon and like oh like we take this big project on a l1 and just we put it on the polygon and all of a sudden that makes sense that makes a lot of sense shout out to michael wong here he is what uh hey mike hey michael wong what are you doing is that real did that just happen that that really does happen he's in the back um and so and that's kind of like this this gets into a broader conversation that's what really polygon is right it's not like an a specific l2 it's a swiss army knife of l2 so it's well i got to stop you here i got to say here though okay because l2 we've defined this before sure l2 is secured by an l1 sure so an lt1 ethereum would be secured the economic security and the underlying asset of the l1 of eth and polygon is not quite that it does checkpoint back to ethereum but it is more like a side chain at least they have a plasma version but that's that's not really what's what we're talking about here it's their proof-of-stake version which has like a set of validators so it's almost like similar to maybe cosmos uh similar to a more i guess distributed version of binance chain even right right it does checkpoint to eth so there are some differences but like you you were saying layer two would you like would you amend that is it's not because it's not really a layer two is it yes uh you are technically correct and that is the correct way to view things and that's the informal way to view things i will not amend this because i'm going to put on my first cycler hat and my crypto novice open like like non-informed perspective and which is going to be the mainstream perspective right so they come on to ethereum and they say like oh gas fights gas prices those really suck how do i get rid of those some people got rid of those by going to binance smart chain uh and which is a different chain other people are going to get rid of those by going to polygon and this is where the question of does decentralization really matter can actually i think be much more fitting because the difference between optimism and arbitrary which are like holistic complete uncompromising l2s and arbitra and polygon maybe that act that difference is less and maybe we are ready to sacrifice decentralization not because we're sacrificing it at the base layer but we and we but we're okay with sacrificing it at the l2 layer the l2 layer and so to some degree if polygon is not a true l2 and it's actually just a side chain that check points to ethereum to some degree if it just works and it's not maximally decentralized in the way that you know other l2s could be if it just works and everyone gets their funds back and nothing breaks that's great that's fine call it another two at that point okay okay i'm gonna take the other side of this for a second would you say the same about binance chain right binance chain has had definitely some transaction volume there are definitely some applications on um finance chain that are doing well definitely lower gas fees what's is there a difference between binance chain and polygon in your mind yes there's two main differences one you have to go through binance to get the binance smart chain so that that is a big change like the process of actually moving your funds there actually literally goes through i think that's true literally goes through a centralized service well let's say there was a bridge yeah okay so they say there is a bridge okay one one is about the incentive misalignment between binance march and ethereum and on in stark contrast the attempted uh incentive alignment between polygon and ethereum uh the polygon team mihalo sandeep ethereum bulls like want to help ethereum they are politically aligned with ethereum and polygon is trying to become constructed in a way that's politically aligned to ethereum on a technical level that's involved with checkpointing to ethereum and that kind of removes that centralization vectors over time not perfectly but over time it removes that centralization vectors by checkpointing but also just uh there's a conversation of allowing ether to be a gas on polygon and so there's the matic token which you stake to be part of the consensus level 2 matic which is what separates matic from ethereum and makes a division but what they are considering is using ether as the consumable gas asset on polygon and so they are and i use this metaphor yesterday when i was talking to mike it reminds me of like two kingdoms back in the old times and one kingdom's bigger than the other and and one kingdom owns the smaller kingdom and makes a smaller kingdom pay taxes to the bigger kingdom ethereum is like oh do you want our blessings you use our money as the the native fee payment currency on matic right like you better use our money like and so matic is giving up it's like oh ethereum please like us we want we want you to like us you know how we will get you to like us we will use your money as the consumable transformable asset and we will give up that role of the matic token to ether the the token which just is making a and so really what matic is doing is optimizing it's it's making a hybrid bullish position between matic bulls and ether bulls and trying to blend mata community in in ethereum community and that's is starkly different than finance smart chain and those things to tie this off yeah main difference between matic and polygon and binance marching is political alignment with ethereum and as we say at the end of the day everything it all collapses down to layer zero which is people so you're saying even though some of those things haven't happened yet like if being used as a native fee for instance and i know by the way polygon has other plans to roll out more uh layer two like solutions right so polygon is kind of a swiss army knife proof of stake chain is just one approach they plan to have kind of a roll-up based approach in the future but what you're saying is those plans even though they're they're in the future um like because they are socially and politically aligned with ethereum then uh that's why you trust polygon more than you would binance chain it's like cz is not socially or politically aligned with ethereum he is socially and politically aligned with finance right the company yeah and bnb token holders maybe but like if that's the case david is this you being like and again i'm playing devil's advocate right i'm like i like what's going on but um is this you being tribal about things like some people are some people would say david's saying polygon good but finance smart chain bad just sh like there's uh a contradiction here what would you say to that i think the contradiction is is not there and i think polygon good binance smart chain bad is that you know binance is is bankers and polygons polygon is attempting to be as aligned with and be an extension of the values of ethereum as possible i don't i think there's uh something to say that the absolute insane rise of manic token over the past month has occurred simultaneously with the rise in ether the asset over the last month people rotating into matic is a fractal off of people rotating into ether and it was a political rotation both ways right like people understanding that ethereum's a place to be also matic is the binance smart chain killer and so while may perhaps they are fundamentally constructed similarly even though checkpointing is actually a very big point about there are some differences for sure i totally agree but the difference is is that binance marching is a banker's chain through and through and and i'm pretty sure consensus is permissioned whereas mata consensus is not permissioned with with a manic token and overall they are committed to ethereum values and that's really what the through line of polygon is and so that's a very big difference the big take here is something that we've i think predicted on bank list is actually uh coming true that's that side chains like binance smart chain aren't actually competing against ethereum they're competing against other ethereum side chains or ethereum's layer two that's what they're really competing against and we've seen this massive rise in polygon as it's kind of got its its feet at the expense of not ethereum but at the expense of finance smart chain right like a lot of that activity is starting to leak over to to polygon and you know at the expense of binance marching so it's like two layer twos two side chains competing against one another and ethereum is uh polygon is starting to capture that flow from ethereum now all right i think we have some takes on polygon a little bit later that we'll get back to but let's get to some other ethereum stuff speaking of billionaires mark cuban this dude on twitter has been stalking mark cuban's eath address which is kind of cool that you could do that i think like also mark cuban didn't really know that you could do that when he first got into ethereum that's true i think he knows now though right yeah i don't know now but what's mark you've been doing well maybe he's listening to bankless podcast maybe he's reading the newsletter because he's fooling around with alchemics which we're big fans of right after the uh never sell plan which uh have alchemics front and center look at this he's staking um hedgic wow look at that dude nice cool good job good job mark cuban proud of you that's how you do it if you're a billionaire sorry sorry for stopping you but we're going to keep on doing it someone's going to if we don't all right uh let's talk about this too speaking of big money all right arc invest massive fund they've been primarily bitcoin focused to this point but it's the fun chris berninski came from yep they have finally started to purchase it is official eth small increment now 20 million worth but david i remember not too long ago we had people on the bankless podcast who were debating us ryan selkis was debating us about um institutions never purchasing eth like funds like ark wouldn't purchase eth um people like companies wouldn't put it on their balance sheet wouldn't hold it in their treasury and like now not less than six months later it's starting to happen i feel like arc is a big move in that space now they're not cussing it they're buying it through grayscale but that's how they purchase bitcoin fine as well uh so it's happening man and it's only 20 million dollars but i mean the bigger signal is that it's at all right um that's really the new paradigm shift here i think it is uh we should have kathy on the podcast be good discussion kathy please come ebay opening up its nft opening up its platform to nft sales this is like og web 1.0 meets crypto kind of cool to see it's slightly disappointing that they didn't pick ethereum and they picked a wax blockchain which is a totally different project but uh you know if they're getting into nfts uh if if you got if you're if you're if you believe in the protocol scene thesis you end up at ethereum so i'm just happy they're getting into nfts there you go um let's talk about this this is some bitcoin news ish bitcoin news this this is crypto news block five botched some promos with an outsized bitcoin reward payment here what what happened with uh with block five right so block fi crypto bank crypto lending platform like compound or ave where you deposit assets and you get yield on them uh they pay out uh they pay out uscc payments obviously in usdc something got messed up and when people hit the withdraw uscc button instead of getting usdc withdrawn they got bitcoin withdrawn so instead of one usdc they got one bitcoin uh and that's a big difference in value uh and so i think they i some people got two bitcoins some people got seven bitcoins like a decent number of bitcoins accidentally got sent out by blockfi and there was one post on reddit or on 4chan i saw of one of the recipients of one of these bitcoins and they're like not your keys not your crypto like thanks for the bitcoins and i and which are like not recommended if this was if one of you guys got bitcoins like you're don't send those bitcoins away like the meat space nation state regulation police are coming out i mean to get on blockchain those transactions are getting reverted yeah yeah you're right kyc is on block fight they know who you are you know that they know where you live yeah like this is a i think an interesting example of just like this is going to get rolled back not at the protocol level obviously but at the meet space level like those bitcoins are getting sent back yeah yeah like unless you want trouble with the nation state which which you don't like they have your passport on file um anyway too bad for block fi on that one uh i think it'll get resolved just a little snap through there let's talk regulation um the through line here is that protocols don't mess these things up protocols yeah ave doesn't accidentally withdraw bitcoin when you requested to withdraw usdc that is true that is true it's uh as long as the code is written well they don't mess this up all right so this is part of the china flood i think david so this is regulatory three self-regulatory organizations within china reiterated a 2017 stance on crypto here's what they said these are bank regulators in china um basically they said that crypto is here's the quote severely damaging the people of the safety of people's property and disrupting financial stability what's interesting about this is not that this is coming out of china but i think that this is something that bankers in all nation states will say the problem with crypto is it's damaging safety of people and it's disrupting financial stability we're going to hear that reiterated over and over again when nation states and bankers take a negative stance on crypto so it's coming out of china wouldn't be surprised be here in other jurisdictions too if you hear headlines like that what you should actually hear is we have all the control we don't like these things that take away control from us please here's some reasons why you should keep us allowing to have control over your lives exactly that's what's that's what's really going on but they'll say they're protecting you let's talk about some more banks david bank of america leaned into blockchain to speed settlements what's the quick take here i love leaned into blockchain as if blockchain's a thing what they actually mean is ethereum uh that is actually what's going on uh and and so they are actually selling uh settling securities on the ethereum blockchain uh so that's pretty cool pretty cool yeah what's cool this is a they partnered with the crypto bank to do it paxos to do it so it's like i think this is what's going to happen it's legacy banks they'll partner with coinbase's the partner with paxos and they'll roll out something cool this might be cool security's on chain um we've been promised that for a while maybe maybe they could do something in this space let's go to wells fargo our favorite they wells fargo uh is instituting some some onboarding to crypto for class yeah i think they have some bitcoin fund uh offerings or or and the the thing is like it's only available to wealthy clients which is just peak peak banks peak banks bitcoin only fund for for wealthy only wells fargo customers nice job wells fargo two trillion in assets but but only for wealthy clients like as if we need wells fargo to help us buy crypto yeah right like too slow too slow sorry moving on wells fargo bye bye you think they heard about our t-shirt david oh i'm sure they're sweating and they are just corporate wells fargo's are sweating at the t-shirts we had some bad stuff's happening on binance smart chain by the way i haven't kept up with all the technicals here but uh here's one bad thing it seems like the network is increasingly unstable what's going on here yeah so uh we have crypto ultron who says he runs a bsc node he says the network is constantly forking uncontrollably for every block that is part of the main chain there are around five uncles so five accidental forks going on before the blockchain can find consensus again several validators are running subpar hardware and cannot keep up with the rest of the network uh this is first off just a tweet so unverified but we've been covering topics like this of the massive amount of state blow over the last few weeks and so this was predictable and so that's kind of why i feel comfortable talking about this here even though it's unverified it's like this is the predictable logical conclusion of what happens when you just fork geth and the ethereum one client add 50 million gas instead of 15 million gas and and cut block times down from 13 seconds to 2 seconds you just block changes grows too fast and so now everyone is having consensus issues because there's too much data being going around and no one can keep up with things this is the logical conclusion of the binance smart chain it's finally coming to a head cz if you're listening here's how you fix this i'm going to tell you how to fix this come up with a checkpoint where one single block that was perhaps like yesterday's block is just the new genesis block of binance marching delete all of the history and go from there problem solved you're just all you have to do is do that every two months uh and come up with a checkpoint and then you can keep going and and every single two months you're going to lose consensus but you just checkpoint delete the history and keep going problem solving is this d5 sir send it send me my b tokens please it's funny uh the developers of geth predicted that this would happen here it is it's happening um shocker let's do some speech i'm gonna i'm gonna start with this one david let's go back and forth microstrategy has acquired another 10 million in bitcoin another week another micro strategy dollar cost average in from michael saylor no wonder he is the save savior of bitcoin right now uh that's drive by one what's this one urine finance sees at the dip and buys back 1.47 million dollars of yfi tokens doing the same thing uh as as michael saylor and the funny thing is they have these same similar announcements about like your urine bought the dip you know added to the treasury the other cool take on this is that yearn is at the uh you know kind of the team layer the team behind yearn is now executing on a maker dow style tokenomics value capture mechanism where they're using funds generated by urine to buy back wi-fi off the secondary market and withhold it from the secondary market it's a buyback and burn model just like make or dow cool community there let's go to the next one alchemix audit it finally came so alcomix has been a really cool protocol but i gotta be honest david i was i was sweating it i don't think i have to tweet up but i was sweating it when alchemix was was uh getting all of this total locked value locked inside of it and there hadn't been a completed registered audit right now it's come i think that will give some folks uh we'll help them breathe a sigh of relief although an audit does not mean that the thing is unhackable uh it is a a good sign that they are now audited what's the next one here david usually we wouldn't really report on audits but literally everyone was like waiting for the alchemics audit so that's why i reported the next one is one billion dollars now stored in argent wallets congratulations to argent uh they have also been innovating at the transaction level i think uh pooling transactions together either via mining pools or just other user customers together i don't know i was talking to mike he knows about it more than more than me but they have some innovations with reducing gas fees out of argent which is always helpful because they're a smart contract while therefore gas fees are always higher in smart contract wallets and then they say yeah they'll end with layer two is on the way hashtag eath summer i like that hashtag yeah i think that's because maybe it's coming in summer we'll see diversify five million dollar round diversify is a defy exchange they are built on starkware's layer too this is a true layer two solution they're closing some more um funding which will will help them build out their exchange i love the work that they're doing congratulations to that team next up in the funding round d5 dashboard zapper raises 15 million dollars to build on platform app store app store what are the plans coming from that wow interesting uh first off the zapper is absolutely fantastic uh that that's where i see the just a report of all of my uh wallets and all my little dj activities they also have polygon interacted with there uh and so uh they also just ship so fast uh so really excited to see what they can do with this 15 million dollars excited to see what an app store is yeah absolutely all right guys we are going to come back with some hot takes and of course the meme of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uni-swap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think

with the takes defy summer round two this is andrew kang with this take what is he talking about here what is defy summer round two how's it gonna be different right so d5 summer round one was all about uh yield farming liquidity mine token distributions events two people that are using these protocols and so what andrew kang is talking about is the game plan for defy summer round two we're not just going to repeat history because that you know that's not how it works we're going to rhyme history and so the way that history rhymes with his upcoming d5 summer round two that he's trying to illustrate is that instead of applications on ethereum doing you know yield farming instead it's going to be l2s doing liquidity mining incentives distributing tokens on l2s that's currently what's going on on polygon you can get uh you know matic rewards by depositing liquidity into ave you can get manic rewards by depositing liquid into sushi swap so many different ways are being subsidized and incentivized by the polygon team via matic token distributions and so just go use matic stuff you get manic rewards and that's just to and and they got me with this i i put my matic matic l2 deposited into ave realized that the yields were insane so i deposited matic into one side of ave borrowed matic from the other side of ave redeposited that just kind of kind of wound up the position it's actually not leveraged because my borrowing is denominated in what i'm lending and so that's much more safe again do your own research getting a decent amount of matic rewards and now i just find myself with a decent size of my portfolio on the polygon l2 like they got me like they got me with the incentives like i got got and we're about to have optimism and arbitrage probably they're probably gonna have a token because why the hell when you have a token how else are they going to incentivize people to come on board and use their stuff they're going to and they also need to distribute their tokens who's funding these incentives david is it is it the lt's themselves or is it the lt's plus the protocols like is it like ave plus right it works both ways right and so the l2s are incentivizing the apps who are and the apps are incentivizing the people it all works it all works out and so like you thought defy summer was crazy with yield farming opportunities what happens when you add a whole entire new dimension which is the l2 right so the d5 summer round two is going to be underpinned by just yield farming out of the actual base layer the l the the l2 itself not just the application and then also the applications right absolutely crazy really interesting take from andrew kang guys i think this is one of those alpha takes this is one of those opportunities to get ahead of things because what andrew's saying what david is saying feels absolutely right to me as well right the reason we saw d5 summer last season was because compound issued a governance token and it worked so well that all of the other d5 protocols did by the end of september una swap didn't what didn't even have the intent to to launch a uni token this is what hayden adams said when we had him on but did anyway why because crypto economic incentives worked so well now you've got d5 protocols who continue to have this incentive to push users to layer twos plus you have the layer twos themselves that are locked in this uh competitive battle to gain traction gain liquidity and gain users so optimism arbitram polygon they're all going to want to incent users and incent liquidity so token summer it's about summer time too i don't know that that feels like a great take and a little bit of alpha for you guys get prepared absolutely for the possibility of d5 summer round two um let's go to this next take david this was dave portnoy man this almost got overshadowed by everything else as the the market fell out but like is this the top signal he ju he introduced what he calls his coin announcement and he got behind this coin called safe moon has a whole video about it he did kind of funny yeah yeah so you didn't see this no i didn't see this oh my god yeah i'm like i almost feel uh conflicted about actually talking about this because it gives more attention to the thing that he wants attention for but he's basically saying i am uh behind safe moon now i've bought it you should buy it to jump into my influencer ponzi scheme right to like it's it's like his version of elon's dogecoin is his safe moon here and he put this out this tree out on the 17th and then we just absolutely had the most violent dump two days later perhaps perhaps that was the quote-unquote top here's my take on this man like i am not here for meme coins like i'm just not here for this like so being a meme coin and by by this i mean like just being sort of an influencer coin or like not having any value proposition beyond the value proposition of somebody else is going to buy this thing in the future right which i don't discount there's some value there right only if it's underpinned by fundamentals there's just it's it's it's not enough for me anymore right like i feel like everybody chasing these meme coins by the way bitcoin included at some level it's the most successful meme coin i mean they're playing in the kiddie pool and like we're out here exploring the ocean dude like i what it what is ether it's so much different yes there's a meme coin aspect to it but it actually generates transaction fees it's a capital asset right which is the meme by the way which is the meme it's making the world more decentralized it's making the world more bankless what is safe moon doing is safe moon doing that is doge doing that right like dude generating just buying an old doge right like it's not enough for me it's not why i'm here i'm done with meme coins i'm done with influencer coins i'm still bullish on bitcoin right like because there is a place for some of these successful meme coins but for me it's totally not enough and this market and this whole industry will be hollowed out by meme coins if if that is the only thing we're producing for the world fortunately we're not it's just the thing that media likes to uh shine its light on and give attention to at this moment in time but it's kind of kind of annoying kind of frustrating like i don't hate it like people can do it whatever they want it's free open market people can buy meme coins if they want i don't hate it it's just a shallow pursuit to me and it's not enough right not enough you got to have substance at the end of the day there has to be something real when you collapse down and kill the meme there has to be something real there good memes are built on real foundations absolutely good memes have to be validated um elon musk is now blowing up the wall street case for bitcoin here's the take uh here it's basically that um if elon's tweets can evaporate like hundreds of millions in crypto market cap right it's not an institutionally ready asset institutionally grade that's basically the bloomberg take here that's a fair take that's a fair take but also that is kind of the future the future in my opinion here's a standing outside of crypto the future is chaotic the next 10 years is chaotic the next 10 years is volatile uh and so you got to learn to play in the game like this is not your world anymore institutions we are finding new institutions so like you better get with the change but also what does a statement from jerome powell do to markets yeah jerome powell can make a statement of world's biggest influences right are institutional influencers really that much different i know jerome powell has this power and people think it's normal it's just like yeah jerome like let's let's watch everything he says just a different set of influencers yep institutional influencers approved institutionally approved influencers what are you excited about david i am excited about the second half of the bull market i said it earlier in 2017 i got into the world of crypto after i watched ether go up to 430 30 and then fall down to 135 and i was like whoa i gotta buy now and that was my first entrance that was my first real buy of dip a dip uh well i also bought the top earlier don't have that um i'm a crypto novice i'm not automatically buying the dips i'm definitely buying the tops the first time around so i would like to just put myself pat myself around the back so this is my crypto birthday i went i went one full cycle around the crypto markets you know for four years around i feel like i've got one one full crypto revolution uh and so here's a cycle around the sun yeah and so i i kept on talking about like how there's first cyclers and technically i was still on my first cycle as of this dip this massive dip i now consider myself a two cycler that's what i'm excited about happy birthday second birthday sir thank you happy happy second birthday first awesome man first birthday because i was i was zero yeah you were zero years old yeah you're one this is what i say like it's like crypto is like three-year-olds teaching two-year-olds things like we're all so early ryan what are you excited about uh i i i want to riff off that man i'm excited about the dip like sharing a dip with all of you fine people is actually exciting right like this is where you earn the crypto that you hold it's it's very much a battle against like your lizard brain against all of your emotional reactions like builds character wallet it does the volatility in crypto will throw you for a loop if you let it right but if you can take a long-term mindset if you can hold through these dips and think about like long-term horizons right um i don't know it's actually kind of a zen-like experience yep there's a little like chris berninski out there you know like that guy's always zen and um you know he's zen during the dips he's zen during the bull runs he's zen all of the time and uh you achieve that with practice and i'm excited to go through it i know many many people are on their first birthday they're unicyclers and uh like this is all part of the game guys this is completely normal it's all part of the game yeah it's really a lesson in how well can you control your brain how well can you control your emotions because marketing investing are emotional markets are by definition emotional and when they are so incredibly crazy and crypto that's by definition crazy emotions and i remember when i was first getting into crypto i was like oh that token pump's got to go chase oh that token pumped gotta go chase fomo fomo fomo fear fear of fear oh dip is it over it's like i don't know uh and then this this time around i'm like like congratulations to whoever won on that on that pump i'm gonna wait my turn like no i'm not gonna pay that gas fee i'm just gonna sit back i got my bags i'm comfy uh oh a dip oh wow you know ouchy that hurt um let's let's keep going though uh you know much more zen this time around and so i hope all the people while who are going through these crypto markets are also practicing mindfulness at large because in separate from crypto it's a good skill to have but it also is a very strong skill to make you more money in crypto markets if you can be mindful well said all right with that let's go to meme of the week david meme of the week first meme emotions this is awesome it's not it's not even a complete meme because the text is in the tweet itself yeah it's so good here's here's narage i don't know what gm he starts saying gm i don't remember don't know what that means but he goes remember you can't spell crypto without cry and he's got a teary-eyed sad with a thanksgiving yeah sad sad kitten it it's so good oh my gm sounds for good morning thank you mike okay good morning remember you can't spell crypto without cry that's awesome i was feeling it this week a little bit all right what's this one documenting ethereum great meme account yeah second meme of the week you get two of this week uh two now we're supporting our listeners we can't give them two too many times we have the we have uh the uh the grid of gravitational uh you know waves right and so we have the sun and it's pulling down the gravity of the gravitational uh you know grid we have a neuron starts even more and then we have the eth price just going absolute tanking and then back up and that's what a dip looks like and that's sometimes how you can try and call a bottom very good ending on a happy note of course guys none of this was financial advice was this just the dip was this the end of crypto there's no way to be sure but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey
