we should be empowering the user to be a participant in the conversation so they can add value to the nfts they're holding their entities can become more valuable and not just in a way of like being like devs do something but literally there's pipelines there and bridges that exist that they can add value to the narrative and content creation process welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero we're talking with marguerite de corcell which you might actually know as coin artist coin artist has been around in the crypto space for a very long time before there's even been as much room as there is today for the intersection of art games and crypto uh uh coin artist is definitely an artist type hence the artist in the name uh and she's focused on crypto gaming but not in the way that you probably are hearing crypto gaming with what you think of it today with games like axio infinity where you have nfts and they do stuff uh marguerite is focused on uh a much more cyber cyberpunk version of crypto games as in like how do we uh how do we have interactions of the nfts in our wallets how does like if a two nfts of the same game end up in the same wallet and interaction happens something a little bit closer to conway's game for life or just something about embedding data in the blockchain rather than just having like a normal game that has crypto assets embedded in it um so you'll hear us unpack what that means uh and it's this very untapped world of gaming that has not yet been built out that i hope does eventually become built because it sounds really really fun and marguerite coin artists is one of the people building out this world over at blockade games uh then we also talk about um the physical center of the metaverse which is new york city and what's going on with new york and what it means to be social in the world of crypto in this day and age uh so all these conversations and more are coming your way right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users control your digital footprint with built-in privacy and ad blocking inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web 3 crypto browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web3 your crypto wallet the brave wall is different bravewall is built natively inside the brave browser no extension required which gives the brave wallet an extra level of security versus other wallets with the brave wallet you can buy store send and swap your crypto assets and you can even manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave at brave.com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your default trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list

for sponsoring bankless what's up marguerite how's it going hi david how are you oh this is fantastic i think a lot of people will actually know you as your other name coin artist i think that's kind of where i want to start this uh start this uh this talk is where did coin artists come from so coin artist actually came in 2014 um when i was just discovering bitcoin and i discovered that there was this place called crypto twitter which was yet to be you know called crypto twitter but it was all where these industry thought leaders were expressing um their opinions about bitcoin and it was the first thing i thought of because i was an artist as a fine artist and i was like okay i'm making a twitter handle what is it going to be and i was like well coin artist it's really generic and not a cool story at all but um but at the time actually also my i was known as yt instead of marguerite or coin artist um and yt came from if you've read snow crash it was like this superhero like how could i make this um character persona and so i was i was that person anonymously basically until about like 2016. like people didn't even know as a woman um making crypto puzzles and playing around with creative technology uh the intersection of crypto art games uh it started really early on before you discovered bitcoin what i want to unpack the art side what uh what kind of artist were you were like a painter or or a digital art or what's up yeah i was a uh i was a traditional painter and uh and drawing and for me i did so there was a lot of magazines at the time that needed art cover art um like even just like i remember doing a picture of andreas antonopoulos for bitcoin magazine um for one of their articles and it was in that process of making those uh portraits that i started playing around with different concepts so one of the projects with amir takai and cody wilson they were working on something called dark wallet at the time and dark wallet was all about obfuscating bitcoin transactions like acting as a little bit of a mixer as a wallet um so i was like i wonder if i could hide something in this you know to like play into that obfuscation and uh that's when i realized that a bitcoin like private key with the the numbers and characters could be turned into all kinds of pattern making to equate to uh to that information you know how you can take binary in binary can then equate to ascii um so so then like how could you make these different patterns into the art and like basically hide things in plain sight um embed it into the artwork so that's when i had that like little aha moment and i shared it on bitcointalk.org the um satoshi nakamoto's forum and people just loved it it just became like this big viral thing and as an artist i was like what did i do so like i i kept um so i teamed up with people along the way and and we continued to make these pieces um and it only became more gamified and more complex over the years but uh but that's how it started so when people talk about the let's combine art and crypto if you if you tell them those words they're going to think like oh yeah you're talking about like nfts and web 3 in 2021 or 2022. but you uh were an artist that got inspiration from crypto back in 2014 before ethereum even existed like before we even had smart contracts and there's like one level of crypto art where there's crypto and then you can illustrate things about it but you you jumped right into a a deeper connection behind like the ethos and values of crypto and being an artist with like the integration of like you know private keys in actual art can you talk about just like what you saw in the early days of being coin artist as the potential intersection behind crypto in art yeah absolutely so um i'd say initially the creative started looking at blockchain like a new uh a new medium um and how can we interact with it and there were some fascinating things like you can just decentralize ledger but you could store all kinds of information on on it and so when it was cheaper people had images they had ascii images they had all kinds of information and how can you interact with the blockchain in a creative artistic way there was a lot of people you know it's i can't totally recall at the moment but there were a lot of fun experimental projects and rhea myers is someone who i worked with uh early on and they were a part of that exploratory group um now as the head architect at dapper uh but so anyways there was just a lot of like like what can and i think we all loved the idea that the technology was so new so people had to like in the hiding and plain sight thing and just a satoshi nakamoto like his his lore so it was really inspiring for us to think about how could the blockchain be this new medium and like bitcoin itself was maybe as as a transfer of value was a little less interesting as far as like the unit but it was more like things you could embed on the blockchain that was that was pretty cool um and and like using hashes uh as and pointing like we did things like make fake addresses um to make like trails digital trails that led to information that if you put it all together you got something so it was just kind of this neat process because of the fact that there's no third parties involved and it all just exists out there so understanding decentralized and distributed networks um it was really a fun playful time and i think that's actually a big missing piece right now like for example a lot of the creatives and artists just skip that step they are now with these the interface and um and making like minting an image that they feel like is an nft but you're missing the whole like deeper meaning and how that ties into the networks that could be way more creative or like artistically driven um as an entire process i think i think you have some people making those steps but you know it's interesting you saw this back with different cryptos that people didn't really care about that like how interesting the technology was they really just cared about the user experience so it's interesting to think about to these artists that are making extra effort to make um like for example josie bellini today just launched uh cyber brokers and it's all on chain using svgs and my cto at blockade games is a part of that like he helped with that launch but just this deeper conversation about these assets being on chain and what and what this art project is i don't know i just feel like there's a huge gap in education now um and i wonder how we're going to recapture that or if we do recapture that i i actually don't know everything's so financially driven um and that's maybe the bubble that everyone feels but i don't know if it come this conversation comes back to the the interesting innovation of the technology behind everything you know like it's it seems like people are just more excited about making money in new ways yeah i think with what you kind of just described where you you kind of laid out this easter egg like mmorpg like art hunt using by embedding data straight into bitcoin where you had like fake addresses that meant something and lead you down a trail that felt very gamified that felt like the intersection of like art and games but using data inside of a blockchain to be the board on which this game is played whereas whereas like now in the nft web 3 world it's really just like very external to the blockchains like yeah we just use ethereum to mint our nfts but everything else is external um it definitely has to do with like the rising transaction fees and we can't really play with data on the blockchain in the way that we that we once did but uh is my intuition right that you were really interested in kind of making this like this shared ledger that we all have that can host data and turning it into like some sort of like artistic game rather than just like you know sending bitcoins around like how important was the gamification of it yeah absolutely i mean i think all the projects that we participated in since 2014 had some sort of magical moment where we're playing around with blockchain technology to kind of demonstrate something that otherwise wasn't possible um something that we did in 2019 was called um i forget the actual title of it but it was a humans versus zombies headless game in which we sent nfts we airdropped nfts and half were human nfts and half were zombie nfts and then there was this um score scoreboard website all it said was how many humans there were and how many zombies there were if you sent a zombie to a wallet that had a human in it then you didn't like transfer your zombie what happened was you minted a new zombie asset into the human's wallet um and it then turned their human into a zombie and so then on the scoreboard the zombies are you know gaining a zombie um and you could use an antidote and then the human begins frozen what the human uh nft gets frozen well the nfcs are non-transferable so yeah so they're in your wallet and then it's like basically a virus and um it's an entanglement yeah and it doesn't use a central application um and so anyways we just launched this out of hackathon i think it was like um am i maybe harvard harvard hackathon i can't totally remember but um just this idea that with smart contracts you can make this entire game just using smart contracts uh didn't you don't need to have an actual game like uh application and that was really interesting because there's so much more of that that could be done but do people care about that like do they care about that game experience it seems like everything is monetarily driven um so how do we actually how do we actually inspire people to play in ways that just like with traditional games like how many people just sit down and play games because they're awesome and fun and interesting um their social how do we bridge that gap with where we are today um with this financial motivation which is really turning off a lot of gamers like actual gamers they think this whole space is going to be a complete scam or is a scam and then you can see it already that the games that are trying to launch are already angling at that those pre-sale items to have the highest prices as possible to price people out and then build this toxic community and then you're going to be turning off all the gamers and then will you ever launch a game i don't know but that it feels very ico in that way it's just like icos but with extra better marketing because we brought in all these 3d professional you know artists now from the game industry because these nfts are selling um so how how long is it going to take for us to actually or will we ever get over this probably bad reputation we're about to spin up just in the same way icos like icos never came back um they just rebranded they came up with all kinds of different you know acronyms to basically be the same thing as ico but they they really did that stigma stuck and i think that games and nfts are at the same risk right now i totally went on complete tangent there but anyways no no it makes a ton of sense i think what i'm hearing is like there's this uh domain these this category of crypto games which are very very foreign to like the tradition that tradition traditional like the typical crypto games that we see today like the the wolf sheep game or like uh axe infinity which are very just like devout driven by the value of the assets but i think what you're alluding to is like there's this category of like on-chain games that are crypto that are uh where the playing field is ethereum or l2s or just whatever is in the blockchain rather than just like you know nft assets and and something like that like how how big do you think the world of just like on chain how what do we even call this this category of game that if we're not calling it crypto games because that's been co-opted by this whole like nft number go up toxic value movement like what do we call the the versions of games that are like on chain like the virus type games that you just explained is there uh have you thought about a name for this no i mean but that i was using nfts right and i think at the time we were all saying blockchain games you know and if we weren't using nfts no one thought nfts was going to stick as far as an acronym so it was really interesting that it did because everyone was thinking this is terrible we shouldn't use nfts we should say something else so we are all trying we're like blockchain games crypto games like trying to explore other terminology but nfts is what's the um and maybe the mystery because people didn't know what it was um and i i don't know if you're gonna be able to differentiate uh it's assets that decentralized assets and the different models um because well if you think about gaming you have all kinds of different types of games like you know you have an rpg you have a uh you have a roguelike you have a there's just like different ways to label games i don't know if crypto is going to really be able to get more finite than than um than just and if i don't even know what do you think about when you hear games like crypto games you the first thing you think of an nft game or do you think of crypto yeah we also like to uh the virus example is actually something that i have like uh pondered about or daydreamed about is like what happens when we can have like assets like like can you have like this virus asset that just like naturally people like accidentally run into like damn it i caught the zombie virus now my now my wallet is a zombie wallet like it doesn't meaningfully impact my wallet like i could still do all my things but now it's got the zombie token in it like damn it now it's i got caught by the virus and like there's stuff like that i just have always wondered about like is there this world where just like there's this these assets in our wallets that have meaning inside of a particular context kind of like kind of like uh you know the game as in the game that everyone just lost because i brought up the game sorry like stuff like that on ethereum i feel like does how big of an arena is that because like there's a few examples that i can think of but i'm also not the most creative person but like and and i take your point is like how how like how niche is that like if everyone everyone needs to be good at like using block explorers everyone needs to be able to write their own transactions uh like it's this isn't up to the wallets this is up to like ether scan and stuff like that and so it's a lot harder of an audience but it's actually what feels like the new thing as we're actually using this technology in ways that we could not have used um this technology in different ways like the you know you can play axia infinity without having assets right in theory but like with a zombie virus wallet game like that is brand new that is something that like and i think something that's similar in this category is uh the dark forest uh that zka roll-up game i don't know if you've played that um uh so maybe this is one of those things where it's kind of a concept now but maybe maybe we need zk roll up technology to make these transactions super cheap and and instant i don't know do you have any thoughts on that so there's like different types of games on different networks that are people are playing with and interacting with but uh yeah i think that the cost of playing so for example like in with so i work with with uh so i'm with blockhead games and our one of our missions was to make a free to play game so how do you put everything on the back end so the players just having this experience interacting with decentralized assets um that could become valuable over time based on their game play and how do you build for that and it's true like even on polygons we and we launched on polygon it's becoming more expensive now is is it scalable and gonna be sustainable for us to continue that way and so it's gonna be in our roadmap to explore what are alternatives and what is the cheapest way for us to keep that free to play experience but um yeah i guess like the different types of games so there's all kinds of things i think like remixing of content for memes for example let's say you make a meme and it's like it's some it's got composable layers and it's in your wallet i could see someone sending another like meme to you and it affecting and changing your me like we can remix media and content based on our interactions across wallets and i just think of this as like being a fun thing to do and for nefarious purposes as like trying to you know if you want to bomb your friends with something like i just i want that to exist and i want to know how i can and i love the idea of sending a bomb to a friend almost like um like you're trying to sink a ship and they have assets in their wallet what does this mean what can you unpack that a little bit yeah so let's say you have nfts that are susceptible to some sort of a bomb that i send and i could blow them up if i send it maybe it just cost me maybe there's some sort of mechanic there that makes me really consider about sending this bomb like maybe you have something in your wallet that if i do this it's actually going to blow back at me you know and awesome and i don't know and like maybe there's like there's just ways to think about that um and these different crossovers of nfts and projects that could exist um and yeah and like just playing around with your friends in ways like that where it's not a big deal but there's almost an element of permadeath but it's also just kind of funny and then there's some sort of retribution that can exist and reward systems that could exist and badge systems that could exist um all on chain and i think like i think there's a lot of room to play there and everyone's so focused on trying to make like if you think about it everyone's like the next big triple a game and it's gonna have the coolest art and these assets are gonna sell for so much money but really the fun is like very much more accessible than that it's just how do you inspire people to want to play um because even even if you think about it these blockchain games no one's actually like playing them for fun there's a grind component of can i earn and like manipulate and exploit the system and make some crypto and then go sell it but no one's actually playing crypto games for fun at the moment and what is the differentiator between a crypto game versus just a traditional game as a game company or as a creative why would you do one or the other if you're just trying to do something for fun why wouldn't you just do a traditional game so if you're going to use blockchain mechanics or game mechanics that are new and exciting how are you going to leverage them to actually inspire people to want to interact in that way and will they want to interact with an app go outside of openc you know spend time on a third-party website um we haven't seen that yet and i don't i'm i don't know if interactive nfts are going to be the answer where you can play the games directly from the openc website um so you can play things like like a mind sweep there's things that exist right now using iframe support in directly in openc is like playing minesweeper you could have might anyone could play with this particular nft that's owned by one person and then it's you could be signing the winner and having a leaderboard that of everyone's interacted with it and like with the leaderboard of this particular interactive nft's like output if that makes makes sense and you can do all kinds of like from that basis you can do dungeon crawlers i could host a raid i could put assets up for a bounty without people ever leaving open c for example um if you think about most casual crypto nft collectors they probably do not leave the open c website very often right right because that's not where number go up is right that's that's kind of the trap of where we are right now right so uh with your i want to go back to the the bomb nft so i think that's really cool and just just for listeners who are fearful about their like board ape or their crypto punk getting exploded this wouldn't work like that all the assets that would interact with like this bomb thing would only be part of the same ecosystem so it would be an opt-in thing it's not like your nfts are going to go explode but like the idea is that like you could have an inventory like you do in a game and you have assets in there and i don't know maybe this game is about um how many of your how many assets can you destroy by sending a bomb but like you could also in theory have like an anti-bomb shield and you could not host that in your wallet but you could make a zk proof that you have one and then if you get bombed you can uh like show your zk proof that you actually have a bomb shield and all of these things are like technically possible with with cryptography and the cool thing about ethereum or blockchains in general is that you know these things are inherently turned base because they go one block at a time so every single block is one like unit of time in this like blockchain game because there is no middle time between blocks and so like the substrate on which we play on these this these block chains are so conducive to like this turn-based strategy game uh and and no one's really been able to like fully tap into that power yet totally like i think like making factions and alignments and playing around decentralized identity and like exactly what you're talking about is is so fascinating because people be like what what just happened i also love the idea like you said your board ape would be safe but you could allow people to opt in into like wrapping their board ape or like you know making it so like they could submit assets with the fact that the higher value the asset and some sort of scoring generating system would allow them to have more weight when they hit you know versus um and then also reward system and payback if they if they're successful and defend their their base i think when you think of your wallet it's really fun to think about it like you could build a tower defense and like defend your base and um and then also like how are you sending resources to help other people hire like teammates and how can like you create this ecosystem which i think is actually like a part of the future here it's just i don't know yet how it makes money and that's the like so how can you sustainably make money because even just a crypto payout reward it's not really tied to any anything valuable right like but i would like to say this is a big difference why gaming and nfts took off on ethereum versus bitcoin is because of that capability to bootstrap so uh because bitcoins are limited you know developers have to walk into the space and have their own bitcoin and then they're holding on to the fact that bitcoin's going to keep going up but they had to buy into it whereas in the ethereum space you can start your project you can come up with your own tokens nfts uh your own like your erc20 token and you have this whole economy you can just bootstrap and launch and with value generation and then um then ride on your reputation and and you're like if you can deliver so that is such an advantage so like it is potential that you could have these kinds of ecosystems in the ethereum or similar networks um it's kind of sad to see bitcoin not actually take off in that same way but it's also maybe okay that bitcoin's one purpose is to be sound money and i think a lot of bitcoin enthusiasts have a hard time with that i think early on when vitalik was interested in colored coins and counterparty um i was really listening in that in that time period because it was creative use cases that i wanted to see happen on bitcoin but there were so many challenges because of the fact that a lot of decisions would affect the end goal of does this make bitcoin sound money and if it doesn't answer that question then they generally said no um and so even with lightning network there's potential here to get creative on top of bitcoin but the rate of adoption on ethereum and other places where you can bootstrap faster and you have more users that don't need to be as technically inclined has a faster rate of adoption but the downside is that nobody is as technically inclined um and also like there was like a natural schism right like all the all the sound money people got i guess for better or for worse got pushed out of bitcoin i guess some people saw that as a disappointment where um like we could we um do you feel like particular alignment with bitcoin like to say because this crypto world's very very tribal and when people get into the space the timing of when they get into space kind of impacts um how they perceive this base right so like people that got in in 2013 generally are bitcoiners more than they are ethereans and fewer people make that the the pass over to ethereum later and later in time like do you wish that bitcoin was a good substrate uh for um like gaming type activities there's a few there are a few bitcoin gaming projects um gosh i can't remember it off the top my head but like uh i i just don't know if i think most of the bitcoin gaming efforts are like playing traditional games with like a bitcoin kickback almost like a right like a satoshi every now and then yeah you know how like lolly rewards work where you have that one through plug-in and based on your like purchases you're get earning bitcoin as a reward um it seems like they're mostly like that where you can get this reward of bitcoin um based on gameplay which is pretty pretty interesting i think that's that's interesting still um but it's not as interesting in my opinion like creatively as what we can do with you know just the different combinations of smart contracts and interacting with people and um the mayhem that could pursue across decentralized networks but it is uh you said the word permadeath yeah uh and i wanna i wanna go into that can you talk about the role of what permadeath is and talk about the role it plays in gaming well permanent can actually mean a few different things but um in this particular case i mean well are you familiar with like eve online i know the game i have not played it so in eve online i asked hilmer who is the ceo of um uh of c what is it c c c p cg i can't remember the acronym of even mine um and he i was asking him about how he was going to fix botting so they have a real economy and um what happened was they decided to flag players that look like they could be bots and allow everyone to come and harvest so they get flagged and everyone nearby gets a notification and can go over to them and like acclaim all of their assets it doesn't blacklist the player it just allows their assets up for grabs by the larger community who can get there first which is a really interesting thing because you can't like necessarily defeat defeat bots right but how do you make them a part of the core part of gameplay i also so in in that case like permadeath is not necessarily your account dying but you've lost all of your assets you've experienced you know huge loss in nft space i think it would be so exciting i don't know if you've ever played dark souls where you i it's my only gaming series that i swear so you die and you totally die and you have to start over at the very beginning of the game which is really infuriating for a lot of people and some people hate it so much they throw their controller but at the same time they love it so like that for me sounds so exciting because um i can imagine so even in in our current game that we're thinking uh that the design that we are building thinking about horizontal opportunities for people that want to play at a d wrist um in more of a d-risk fashion and then a vertical where you know you horizontal dungeon crawlers and then imagine you have a vertical like dungeon crawler where the higher you up you go in social class the higher risks you take the more you're putting up to lose and if you lose you like you drop you socially like basically kicked out of society to a certain extent could go all the way down to like the street level but the time that you put into the game is deleted yeah well to some capacity you have to figure out like what would people be willing to do and also what assets would they want to put in escrow to to lose is it characters is it gear is it you know like what parts of this is going to be acceptable for people to experience and honestly i feel like since people are so emotionally attached to their nfts that like putting like losing them would be very like for me i'm thinking about this for me like i would love that i would love the risk of losing my assets and and gambling in in that sort of capacity but like with a skill-based gambling so like playing magic the gathering imagine you're playing a magic the gathering tournament and you're playing with your deck and then everything you're playing with is going to be up for grabs by the person that wins the game um that would be pretty cool like because then you can even have this ledger of let's say someone is just crushing everyone they're gonna have this history of all these nfts and who they took them from and that's like that's such a flex that doesn't really exist today right i i think um the the one of the reasons why a lot of people just hate call of duty is because as soon as you die you just respawn and then you just go and do it again so you have people like throwing themselves in call of duty into just the middle of just a firefight in ways that we i mean it's a video game obviously but just there's no death penalty because like if you die you just go do it again but then there's there's versions of call of duty where there is a death penalty where like you actually die and you have to just sit for 15 seconds and people's behavior in the game changes because of the penalty of having to wait 15 seconds like people are just like approach the game a lot more carefully like they really don't want to die they're yeah they don't want to be in timeout that's a great way to put it uh and so like that's like but that's just 15 seconds that's just asking you like here your your penalty is you waste 15 seconds of your life before you wait to respawn and like the i think an amount of just like emotional engagement and emotional captivation that comes when like if i die here i lose my nfts which are like a part of my wealth that starts to like mimic a lot of like real life right like people never will run into call of duty in the way that they would actually run into a war zone because that's just not the right behaviors but then but then like if we start talking about like metaverse games like blockchain games if you actually have something to lose which is why people love and also hate dark souls at the same time like if you have something to lose while you go and play and there's real value at risk and you actually are putting the time and energy in like blood sweat and tears on the table while you play these games human behaviors around these games are likely going to change yeah well and i also think it makes it really exciting to think about how you could so there's something else i'm thinking about is so for example the game we've been building is neon district it's a 2d game what if though as you go up in society and you're having these tournaments and this permanent experience you have the opportunity to start collecting 3d assets for the future game like a future expansion of the game and like and it's like you're creating sinks of the current assets the 2d old school game but imagine this progression instead of having like you know the first version of final fantasy one two three what if it was more of a like linear where they're all connected and fluid and you're like progressing out of one game and earning your way into the second um into different types of the experience and different types of the game modes based on your achievements within the certain like construct from the start and everyone has to go through that funnel um or you buy into that funnel but i think that's where you can really protect the integrity of the free to play game with people that put in the work to grind at the beginning but then also if you want to buy into the cooler versions you can but you have to you're buying from people that played through them so i don't know like there's a lot of interesting ways you can think of game progression and the fact that these nfts can have multiple file types associated with them and the game like game developers have the ability to to update if if they design it this way update all the metadata and the different files in different ways to create those additional experiences so it really is a whole new like that's where i get interested and i feel like those are the places where we win gamers is like because they've never had that imagine imagine playing all of your dark souls franchise games in a way where your past work mattered for future experiences for you especially when we think about decentralized identities and how important those are gonna become um i think that's where you win loyalty uh with that hardcore fan base yeah you you've definitely seen a lot of like nft and cryptogamer hate coming out of like the gaming industry the gaming community and all the nft anti-nft community uh is kind of what you are what you're saying with the ethos of which you're building at blockade games is that like something that you're hopeful can like win over the hearts and minds of these people that currently mostly hate our industry i think like i don't want to say that we're gonna single-handedly prove to all gamers in the game industry that um there's value here what i would like to do is seed the ideas and the creative ideas that uh with other developers that there's other opportunities that resonate and that people will enjoy for example when i did um my twitter account right i hit 50 000 followers and i worked with this company called link drop to whitelist all of my followers up to 50 000 followers and if they were whitelisted then they would have the ability to claim for free their first nft ever and the response to that was huge it was like a 90 conversion rate of every like of everyone that clicked it they it was a brand new wallet essentially um so like if you think about that how many people are lurking out there and waiting for invitations and wanting to like participate if you make something friendly and inclusive people want to participate so um it's more about seed and i've had a lot of people talk to me afterwards that that was a really powerful moment for them it was either their first nft or they realized that you know you didn't have to participate a lot because it was this so in this in this case it was this um compilation of all of the followers they were part of a um an image that you know that was like of me and like my history but like i had all my users of the followers on twitter that were part of it you could zoom in and find yourself and they were part of the story so i think like that's something that we have to realize and like everybody is a part of the story and how can you appreciate them and honor them and not make it a cash grab because the minute you have that um separation you create a toxic environment and so that's the i think anyways that's the largest challenge i see right now and i do think that exceeding creative ideas showing people that you can have inclusive activities that it doesn't have to be high value to start that you can have a gradual value creation process um is going to be the way to have that that loyalty long tail revenue and also ways to unlock our our users to have ownership in the entire universes that are being built that's something that i'm really passionate about is you have so many creative developers artists um just how how can they participate in this ecosystem if you're waiting on the developers to ship content chips and the storytelling and the users just to get to consume there's no active participation back there's no conversation back then that's like basically the same model that exists today with game companies which is the difference now with um decentralized networks is that and these open source communities that we've all a lot of us have come from is that we should be empowering the user to be a participant in the conversation so they can add value to the nfts they're holding their their energies can become more valuable and not just in a way of like being like devs do something but literally there's pipelines there and bridges that exist that they can add value to the narrative and content creation process yeah i definitely want to go into that because that's a big theme that i think we see across the board is that the whole concept of like tokens and communities tokens can allow communities to have a voice in ways that they didn't prior like in the trad world you would have the artist on stage with a one-way flow of artistic creation out to the consumers of that but then when you instantiate a community inside of a token or nft or some sort of commute group or dow or whatever uh the community gets a chance to reverberate what they see as value back to the artist and it can become a a two-way conversation we're seeing this with um people-pleasers new uh project uh shibuya i i don't know how to produce it um that was it no i mean i don't know if that's uh yeah i know what you're talking about yeah but but like the community gets to dictate the next chapter in like a story of a of an animated series right like it's actually up to the community to determine what happens next can you just like paint a picture of like the you the utopia that's created when we have a world of games and arts and communities that allows the communities to be a role in its creation well so like even okay so this is a actually huge vision that i have right now um everything from in real life experiences right so think about um dungeons and dragons and you have a game master hosting an event and everyone playing this board game and having this experience right like i honestly feel like we're in a place where if you open up the opportunity to have something like a star wars franchise that everyone gets to participate in the core part of the storytelling which has potentially multiple different veins of that storytelling happening that's like maybe um canon it's like star wars canon in this case but then you allow people that who are super fans to have guidelines and ways to participate and add on to their own like they understand enough of the context there's a big enough wiki people can contribute to the wiki and building outside stories inside experiences and then you have the in real life experiences so currently today when everyone gets together for nft events it's like tv's on a wall and drinking and a dj and like that's the best we can do for in real life nft experiences but honestly what we could take that is um things like with a slight game of like you could have kits that include gamification inner life and of teammenting how it fits into the overall like universe that everyone has kind of agreed upon and and being able to host these parties like i think about even the joy that people had in the almost complete pyramid schemes of like makeup companies or other products where people get together and they just love getting together and hearing their friend talk about some sort of makeup and everyone buys it you know and they have these like it doesn't need to be totally pyramid scheme like that but we can do better than this complete disconnect that's happening right now and i do think like the universe and the shared vision of this like place of lore is a is a unifier and i do think like some core game rules are unifiers so even just like conway i was just showing a friend this yesterday conway's game of life is this simple rule that existed before computers even existed and then it today is still proving out new permutations that are possible within this game um which is very simple it's like this grid where there's these cells and cell is alive or dead um and like people from this simple rule set came up with things like factories and spaceships and other permutations that are really interesting and excite the entire community but i think like to peel it back from there with nfts and art and storytelling content creation empowering people around the world to participate in a place where all they need to do is show up have a little bit of skill and have fun that like we can we can access something that maybe we've never done before you know like imagine magic the gathering being a little bit more decentralized a little bit more accessible allowing their users to have a little bit more input you can have your tournament cards which are official tournament cards that you know like these are the ones that we will accept and then you can have the creative sets which magic has always done the different creative sets and seasonal renditions so anyways i think like that community participation and empowering the world through uh these decentralized technologies is where we all win together because of the fact that we've never been able to onboard everyone in the world into an economy and this is the first chance to do that and doing it through a creative lens and a lens that's easy to understand like game rules is the best way to get crypto into everybody's hands and when you do that then you have an entire empowered world that is not dependent anymore on the like the success or failure of a nation state but rather as like a global like humanity as as far as like what we think is exciting what do we want to collaborate towards in the future so i think it's like this we're really early but i think the vision is there and how we can bring up everybody together based on simple shared loves and talents well the the passion is clearly palpable palpable so i'm already a big fan of this of this whole vision slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that combines the performance and ease of a centralized exchange with the openness and transparency of d5 slingshot aggregates liquidity from all of d5 in order to find the best price on thousands of crypto assets every token on slingshot comes with a price chart and trade logs to give you insights into

you bridge your assets to polygon arbitrary or optimism go to app.slingshot.financetotrade and use the chatbox to share your trades with others and find other tokens to ape into arbitrom is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use d5 and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitram and arbitrom's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nft projects building on arbitron many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrom.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitram using bridge.arbitrom.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since i got into crypto i use gemiini to both buy the dips and also manage my regular automatic monthly purchases of my preferred crypto asset on gemini you'll find over 50 different cryptos including many of the top defy and metaverse tokens like wifi and axiomfinity using gemini earn you can earn yield on your various cryptos including 8 on the gusd stablecoin gemini is available in all 50 states and more than 50 countries worldwide so if you're looking to upgrade your crypto exchange sign up at gemiini with gemini.com go bankless and get 15 of bitcoin after you trade 100 or more within the first 30 days that's gemini.com go bankless one of the other themes that i think that that you're touching on that i think is pretty core to crypto is um emergence and pretty pushing complexity towards the edges conway's game of game of life is like one of my favorite metaphors to kind of explain defy i used it in a relatively old article called um ethereum the money game landscape uh which was a uh eventually a prelude towards yield farming where we i all these like defy apps we're all competing to get points and what are those points they're ether and they have these good conway anyways i use conway's game of life for that conway's game of life like ethereum is a state machine as in it progresses one state at a time and what you were saying was like even though this game of the conway game of life was before computers but enabled by computers much more expressive because of computers you could do more things but it's it's such a simple rule set there's only like six rules for conway like if this than that statements for conway's game of life and it creates like this immense infinite playing field for other people to play on it and they get to create the structures that you listed off the factories the spaceships the gliders the floaters or whatever um and and it's and it wasn't the the what was created is not in the rules it's a it's a it's a manifestation out of the rule set itself kind of in the same way that bitcoin is supposed to be maximally simple yet you can manifest so much more on top of it and ethereum is supposed to be just a very simple expressive state machine but so much can be expressed on top of it uh and so i think what you're you're leading into is there's this world of of games out there that could in theory just have a very relatively simple rule set but when you design it right it creates a lot of emergence and allows people to create the stories rather than the stories being creating and creating the stories is this all right yep absolutely and i think like the emergent quality there that you're touching on is the most exciting that's the thing that sense of discovery and i'm actually contributing like as a user that's participating in this rule set in the universe and i can there's a discovery being made and contribute to that i think that's one of the most exciting things that i could experience um and i think that's why i also focus on that idea of a magic trick as us being using blockchain technology to show people and seed ideas and be like look what you could do though like this isn't this interesting and inspire people but when you do drive people to being like oh wait we can create these entire ecosystems that perform a certain way that maybe wasn't the underlying like like point but it did come about and how do people organize around them and continue value creation around them is going to be so interesting and i do think that's where we get it like things get exciting it's just we're stuck right now in the very early stages of just understanding you have to understand that digital art wasn't transferable and wasn't even a viable like unless you were being caught like contracted it wasn't a viable means of income really to be just be independently a digital artist you need to have some sort of job like even just being an artist it was always difficult but so now that we've unlocked the store that digital art is transferable that was really exciting and i think people are are hung up on that but the deeper meanings of where this could all go it's just how how do we bridge that gap and i think that's up to a lot of us that understand the magic points and these different connections like you're talking about the emergent behavior like ways to inspire people inspire to play um it's just i think i think dark forest actually maybe is touching on that more than a lot of other projects but that in that specific way there needs to be more of that more of that genuinely driven like i want to show people what's possible blockchain i want to show people what's why is it more interesting and not it be about just monetary only and bottom line only so with that i think it's it's finally time to dive head first into what is going on behind the scenes of blockade games uh so can you give us the pitch of what block games blockade games is and what you guys are building yeah so uh blockade games was a is a game studio that we kicked off january 2019 2018. sorry and um it was it was actually um the when crypto kitties happened we i had been waiting for a non-fungible token type so a meta data token right something that could um capture a player's experience in a way that um translated to value and that didn't exist really until that moment or at least it wasn't clear that it existed there was things like colored coins there's things like metadata coins but they weren't you could always uh like wash them for say they weren't like binding they wasn't using the the smart contracts in a way that this was a whole journey progression that creates value over time and so when that when crypto kitties happened we were like okay we're going to launch the game company now we're done with our side projects educational side projects we're ready to go like build this rpg we wanted to make a cyberpunk world of warcraft rpg and use users interactions and their choices and specializations to create assets that became more valuable over time and we wanted to be free to play so we had a lot of wants and it was actually pretty difficult to figure out um but anyways yeah so we did something called plasma bears which um a lot like garyvee is really excited about a lot of people are pretty excited about except for the fact that we launched it on the loom network which was early layer 2 type it was like layer 1.5 type network that died and um so what happened with those plasma bears is we made this complete free-to-play game and then we built a bridge from loom network to ethereum so everybody that had uh plasma bearers and transferred it over to ethereum had their bear but there were millions of bears made and crafted and they're composable they're like build-a-bears um and we worked with people like x-copy who's now very famous like maybe one of the highest-selling nft artists today which was just because i liked him back in 2018 i was like oh we should work together and we made this game so anyways of the 1200 bears that were transferred transferred over to ethereum now they're you know an x copy bear cell you can't buy one cheaper for 100 eth um but it was completely free to play game you know like that wasn't the purpose so so we took that tech sack and we innovated on it for neon district which is something we're still focusing on which is that so it's similar in that build-a-bear concept where you can compose and create a character and then you play with a party of characters and you take them instead of in plasma bears it was a text adventure you know as a means to not worry about the game mechanics or animations or any of that but neon district it's definitely more about that turn-based battle experience and then the outcome and then how you are accumulating what's called neon which is an in-game currency that is non-transferable that you use to funnel into your nfts to progress them and turn them into higher level characters so anyways um i guess at blocky games it's still that vision everything i'm talking about in this whole conversation is how do we create this experience where people get really excited about what's possible with nfts and um yeah i guess just like it's it it doesn't need to start at a high value you can start with a zero value asset and it can evolve over time to become more valuable based on your choices your input so then it becomes a conversation it's collaborative and then your decision makings when you go up another player you can build any deck essentially you want with your characters and how do they perform against another party's you know characters so i don't it's just like it's a little bit different than what exists today it's not as complicated and deep as what it could be with a aaa game like you know a dark souls game but it's still trying to prove that the user can have be a intimate part of the conversation of the um progression of their assets and then where does the value come from yeah i it seems like you're trying to build an ecosystem a game that uh uses this is very very true to the ethos of crypto and also not trying to cut any corners as in we have this technology we have this way of imparting meaning into this game we have this a way of allowing individuals to have control over their assets and and them be uh the admin of their own story in the game and that's very admirable and not cutting corners in crypto is such a difficult thing to do because every time there's a mania whether it's the ico mania or the nft mania or now the crypto gaming mania is because people found a way to cut a corner and like skip to the end where like the assets are trading for fifty thousand dollars on openc like that's like the end goal then some and some people just realize that they can actually just skip right there via some sort of like scarcity security ponzi game and but that's not what i'm saying out of you what i'm seeing out of you is is a commitment to the bare bones of of the what this what the technology has what how this technology can enable a game has that has it been like enticing have you felt have you felt like the pull to like sell your soul and try and do some of these like nft game shenanigans hold on let's not forget that i made a crypto puzzle back in 2014. where i seeded that wallet with five bitcoin when bitcoin was worth like 250 per bitcoin and then that particular puzzle wasn't solved until january 2017 um maybe in 2018 i can't totally remember and so the puzzle was worth a thousand a hundred thousand dollars at the time of being solved and so the motivation this is the same puzzle that you talked about earlier this is different i i made a lot of puzzles this is one of them and made a lot of puzzles i mean a lot of puzzles and this is one of them that just took a longer time to be solved and the motivation wasn't like oh well i should pull that money out because obviously it's cooler no it was really cool to put that money in at 250 like 250 and it to be a hundred thousand dollars and to see people like get inspired to solve that and if someone did win it um like the motivation there is just to like do it it's it's it's it's not like the money and this is where the artists really come into play right like the creatives and artists they're not necessarily like driven by money you have a lot of artists that exist in the world that just want to do cool because that is like what they want to do with their life it's not to have a ton of money um and that to me was like a powerful moment and i had a lot of people be like why didn't you take the money out because it was like cooler that i didn't think so and seeing it solves and someone pull like i'd like to describe it as a sword from the stone is so exciting and validating i did something and it became more valuable over time someone took that money and it was an experience for everyone i want that same feeling with the game and the game assets i want that same like i started with nothing i'm walking through i'm creating value and like all of a sudden i have something epic and amazing and it's a part of this huge story and it will only get bigger like and i'm a contributor to that like that's that's what i want because i want that to exist in the world i don't feel like that exists i don't feel like people have the opportunity to really go like in a way that's pleasurable or a way that feels meaningful i don't feel like it exists and i want it to be more present how often does uh this this metaphor is just abused to death in the crypto world but like ready player one where we have all of these people in this world and the world actually matters right the the the universe the oasis universe is like where people like live their lives and they they play their games and whatever but then there's the meta game that like the willy wonka i can't remember the name of the guy in ready player one but like he's basically willy wonka he leaves like the meta game behind where like if you can find all the easter eggs and if you can unlock all the puzzles you get the k keys to the kingdom like how much of this like uh inspiration from or just like acknowledgement to like something like ready player one have you thought of oh i read ready player one around the same time i read snow crash and some other sci-fi books like gay men and freedom in 2014 when i was going being red pilled uh into the crypt of space but honestly if you were a gamer it made so much sense that with bitcoin it was internet money and if you understood internet money you understood like oh okay this transcends all these applications it's going to be like a tren a currency across the internet so i would say that those narratives though are inspiring in the in the way that you think about um when you think about the metaverse i mean like snow crash coined the term metaverse with neil stevenson but like diamond age is another one that's really actually more of a hopeful story um and how education could it could be so i don't know like i guess like i the digital treasure hunt easter egg component of what could exist is definitely like something i would like it's just the reality is most people and most people in the world it's such a niche audience i think games that are more um inclusive in a way where it's not just only a few are going to be good enough to get this one prize that exists out there it's more like your time and value and how you participate can equate to value based on just the fact that you're contributing is that is more of the narrative that is inspiring as opposed to this race to get something at the end that's going to be potentially life-changing um i what happens is you just have too much of a fall off so actually i was just talking to a friend the other day about satoshi's treasure which was this digital treasure hunt that happened and it had a massive prize but you just can't inspire people to move travel around go to great lengths at this like chance of success i think the chance of success needs to be way more clear that the fact that i'm giving in some time i'm definitely gonna leave with something more valuable than what i put in because not everybody can afford to just have an educational experience so like if we're gonna have a blockchain game that actually like on boards a million players it's it can't be something that requires like a 20 000 nft to enter or soft and and you're also saying it can't like require uh it has to be has to offer some sort of like prescribed path for people to engage with or some at least some very clear set of rules and it probably also has to be like free to play right uh because you can't you can't ticket entry um i'm assuming these are are these all like components of how you lead your team over it absolutely and also like whales want to get beaten like they don't want to be cool because they have money you know they like having money is cool but they actually want the like guy that is really skilled to come up and challenge them the people with all the wealth and power want to be dominated so like and and um and they want it to be fun they want it to be like okay i had the money and look really cool but i also i can defend myself and i'm awesome because strategically i'm still amazing it doesn't it's not about the money the money just made me look good they want to have that narrative and um and the person that has nothing wants to have the narrative where they went and like challenged the person that did have all the money and they just like took it to them so these are narratives that the we want to exist when you silo your whales you're like this is a whales game to be honest they're like super bored like no one cares like i mean so great you've got a high valued pfp now what like that that's what that's what always happens is like what do we what do we do now so now we're gonna be a part of board apes and we're gonna have a rolling stones like article and then we're gonna have this like concert and you have to get in based on if you have a board apes but honestly you can tell it's not this intermixing of personalities and like the thrill of having the high valued assets is that's not being leveraged right now and sure access is one thing and access is in community-based access is one thing but it's actually the thrill of being just a stand-alone individual that's talented or skilled for your own your own individual reasons that allow you to be a participant in lets you plus your asset it's not just the asset right and that's where you get to leverage that sort of like passion that's that's really really cool what that made me just think of is like we have we have all these like blue chip nfts right we got uh crypto punks and board apes and i guess those are maybe there are probably some other blue trips up for interpretation but then then there's like the side of the nft world that like rotates all the time so like right now we're on to like doodles and azukis and like a few others uh and like i wonder if the game is like because as soon as some nft project gets like higher than like one eath it starts to price out like 90 percent of people and so then as soon as it goes gets too high uh the 90 of people have to move on to a different nft because they got priced out and then the whales probably try and figure out where all the small fish are going and then they buy the rares out of that pool and then it turns into another whale game and then the other people have to move on and so like i think what i the the realization i just had is that like it's this trap this like this there's never any sort of like stable equilibrium because there's always people segregating because we haven't been able to generate a platform where the small frys and the big whales can actually exit co-exist at the same time in the same place yep no totally and you have your people that are spreadsheet kings masterminding their way into the ecosystem and participating and like trying to start from the ground up right so like that's how do you do that process just make it more fun yeah amazing it's really really cool uh the the other thing that came to mind is i think it's actually really uh interesting that we've been using dark souls as a metaphor here because like the lore of dark souls is that you are one of an infinite number of um depending on the game the most recent one is uh ashen you are ash and you're made of ash and there's millions of you and you guys are you guys they're basically like zombies and if you are the chosen one it's like a chosen one type story you will be the one to like rise up the ranks you will grind through the levels you'll get more powerful uh you'll find a better sword and then you will kill the boss at the end but like in the part of the lore is that there are millions and millions and millions of you and you are just a speck of dust inside of a sea of other other ashen ones other tarnished other other chosen ones whatever uh but like it's all about the story like rising out of the ranks and being able to grind like being on a platform that is equal and and accessible by everyone and it's up to you to actually grind through the ranks and destroy the boss at the end of the game so i think it's funny that we've been using the dark souls metaphor to talk about this and it kind of is like a similar thing yeah no no totally like i think that's it is it ever it's the hero's quest yeah ooh the hero's quest love it love it um uh margaret do you want to talk about any more game related stuff because i also want to talk about new york at some point in time but i don't want to close the book on the close the book on games too soon no i mean there's a there's just a ton of like games i i just want us to be able to be proud of our space and and what we're doing as game developers and i want to see for example it would be so cool to see blockchain game developers at gdc giving retrospectives on like making a blockchain game and what went wrong and things they learned what's the gdc is the game developers conference there's it's coming up actually here at the end of march but the thing is like you don't see that you don't see that in our space you don't see game developers being like taking that sort of like the same level of honesty that a lot of indie game developers take there's that that game developer conference is so great because it's like salty crusty game developers that like have died really hard like you know big deaths of their game and this is what they learn and they're sharing the story with you and i would love for us to get beyond this marketing hype of trying to be like the best project out there and like sugar coating everything to being like making games is hard and this is this is what we learned and like this is what we were trying to do this is actually what happened and like let's take it to that place of comfort um where us as game developers in the crypto space could actually like learn and thrive and i don't i don't know if we're gonna get that i i don't know how long it's gonna be um but because of this immediate monetary injection that the games experience it feels like people can't talk honestly do you think um yeah do you think that we are just early and this is the golden age of blockchain games is ahead of us or do you are you concerned that there's like a fundamental values misalignment that might not be overcomeable yeah i um i think it attracts i think what we have is some an area that attracts a lot of bad actors and i think it's going to ruin the integrity of a lot of the people that wanted to play with the technology and it's gonna be hard to differentiate the two um and i don't know i don't know how it's gonna go like i wish i could say well obviously we're gonna go over it and like blockchain is obvious in decentralized assets sort of the obvious answer but i don't know if that's true like i i truly do not and i've known a lot of things i had a lot of north stars in my life and i don't know that we're going to make it through this time period because it's going to be incredibly exploited well i usually leave the call to actions at the end but if what people want to come in and try out neon district or any of the other games i don't know if you guys have developed more games other than neon district what's the right call to action for people to get a taste of what we've been talking of today well so neon district the mvp that was launched in january 2021 is still live but it's getting a massive update right now with the v2 and then we have the larger game that's coming out with it this year so it's like if you're interested in a free-to-play game and playing around with nfts definitely neon district io um and you can you can see what that's like but it's definitely a work in progress um and it's it's definitely not user friendly at the moment but still people are motivated enough to like figure things out um but yeah it's it's so so definitely check out neon district audio and there's going to be other free to play games that'll pop up i'm sure um it's got so sky weaver i love that development team um horizon games as the people have made sky weaver and similarly very they're very passionate about building these experiences with decentralized assets it's not necessarily about this money grab um so there are some different existing projects out there that are worth checking out and and i think like also inspiring each other to build and create you know like you don't always just have to wait for the next airdrop you can also get creative and playful and small teams well we will definitely get links to those games in the show notes um margaret i want to i want to talk about new york because uh about a couple months after i moved to san diego you text me that you messaged me and was like you should move to new york after i think it was after like nft nyc or something and i was like margaret i just moved to san diego guys too late but then then like six months later i actually do end up moving to new york because of how all the crypto people are there can you give to the listeners just the pitch of the crypto pitch for new york like why why might somebody be interested in new york yeah so i thought about this before i had moved here uh last summer and it this is before i fundraised for blocky games um i really thought about if we're going to build a metaverse for for web 3 where is that going to happen and i thought about miami i thought about la i thought about london and honestly the the highest concentration is here in new york we have a nifty gateway here we have uh gemini we have open sea we have um a ton of the brooklyn artists uh that are they're really experimental and in the coda's art uh genre and i think like this is a great place to come and get centered grounded network so basically the new york community is so dialed into international communities um and also you're in this like vc land right of people that want to invest in you not necessarily do you need vc money but it's like even vcs have a lot of knowledge about startups and things that you know can go right and wrong so the community here is just very friendly it's concentrated um just in the manner the the fact that manhattan is super concentrated and it's very welcoming so also women here uh the women community it's i love like the boys club which is happening and i know you've probably done some podcasts recently with the boys club but i love the edge of it it's not about like being a woman it's not like the women's club it's just like the super edgy like we're getting together we're gonna trade some assets and like guys can come to you but it's a friendly space for women that are um very entrepreneurial and i i don't know if you get that anywhere else um so i'm really excited about this space in new york in general and also nfta nyc this has been an ongoing development for a while i am personally moving to denver but that's for different reasons and also the engineering space over in denver is really great but um as far as like launching a startup connecting with content creators people that want to actually build the metaverse this is this is the hub um contenders would be london for gaming for blockchain gaming there's you know there's quite a few people out there la if you're a content creator you just want to be more social or if you're into that sort of party dj culture which is still viable even if it's not like you know building games um so yeah i would say those are the hubs and but new york is the serious the serious grind and people here are not going to waste your time you're going to get connected you're going to contribute and you know this is so this that was my pitch uh i i've in in my head i've kind of uh categorized you as uh one of the crypto socialites uh and because i saw you at all the conferences and you were you were being a crypto socialite before even i got out of my apartment during covid uh but i wonder if if that if you were if you would consider yourself a crypto socialite before even crypto is what it was like today like what about 2017 2018 what was if if there was one what was like social in real life social life like back back before covid back before like crypto is what it was today because like the generation of 2020 to 2021 crypto is very very different than the 2017 2018 crypto i'm just wondering about like your the history of crypto socialization because i really only got into it in the 2020s yeah no so actually it wasn't like that um i actually was terribly afraid of even doing podcast public speaking i just wanted to hide in the background and like make my art and like put it out there and let people experience it and i didn't like i told you i was anonymous basically until 2016 2017 i wasn't wanting to be an individual in the space i wanted to just participate um and then i would say like in 2017 i started public speaking more um what was i going to say i forgot i forgot what it wasn't going to tell you but like no the scene what was socialization like back then versus how it is now i mean the part it wasn't about the parties right it was actually about the technology so uh you'd go to events in 2016 2017 you were learning about the tech and i was seeing artists and what they were doing the parties the party culture really didn't pick up until maybe that first really great bull run in 2018 with that big consensus conference in new york um and like i was on a yacht anthony diorio's yacht he like helped launch the ethereum ico and he had this huge like yacht party and that's kind of where it would like shift it but then you had this massive bear market that happened and and um and then the party culture came back with the nfts but it's like it's you still have like for example eat denver it was still a really cool experience in the fact that it's so concentrated with developers um which is why it's one of the most popular conferences so if you kind of look at that the fact that people are really hungry to go and participate in the in the developer conferences versus like bitcoin miami which is coming up um and it's exhausting i like i don't want to go to those things anymore they're they they clear me out and so like no i'm not i'm really not a socialite like i just like i was trying to figure out and connect with all the people um to but it's it's not the path like i if you were to sit back and be like did i enter and make these choices because i wanted to go party all the time or did i like want to go and make something really cool um you know i think we're just a little lost right now in that conversation because everyone's just really excited and that excitement just translates to parties yeah um one thing i always uh i always notice about you when i see you in real life is you you always have the most um maybe vibrant is the right word expressive is definitely the right word expressive outfit on uh your fashion sense is like killer and so it's it's funny to hear you say that like you were kind of shy in 2017 2018 because i don't get any of that from you now uh and it's it's just funny to watch like because you you kind of like you you like straight up sparkle in your outfit when you walk around whatever conference we're at wherever a party we're at can you kind of go into just just a little bit of that just like how you decide to like curate an outfit yeah well so in the same way that like i think the technology should surprise and delight i think it's always fun to lean into the fact that you know you can play as a character you can have um bring a little extra sparkle in a way that surprises people and i like to do that because it it breaks this like expectation of different stereotypes um so there's times where i even like wear cape and we saw this in denver too people like teams of people wearing capes around and it's kind of like this let's let's be a little different let's think outside the the the mo this um what what people would be expecting and like for example i have like these glitter sparkle boots and they always light people up when i wear them um and i think that's the kind of thing that people want with their applications and their experiences in general in this space as well so honestly at east denver um i so i have little boys and i was i was allowed to bring them in to the vip and we were all told to wait there for just a little bit and then the denver organizer walked in and he's like i have a surprise for you just one second and so then comes in the buffalo right and the buffer corn is there and my little boys are playing with them and for listeners that don't know buffy the buffer corn is the unicorn buffalo mascot of east denver so think of just like a guy in like a football mascot uniform right so and the little boys are playing with him and then i turn around to get like a glass of water for someone and he turned back and he's taken off the head of his costume and it's vitalik and his metallic there in the buffalo court so i can say that i'm not the only person that like wants to surprise and delight both with technology and also just in your in real life persona and who you are and the joy you're bringing to the world like i think it's just a narrative about and also it's like it's really good to to remind yourself that we're doing this for each other so collaborative um what are you bringing to the table how are you contributing and i think that that just that story is more than just walking to a party with a vap pass and being cool right there's a difference between doing that and what we have today and then what we want for the future and i so i think like so yeah that's probably a lot of what i do what i do is because i think the surprising delight just carries over uh one of the lines from the architects and podcast that stuck with me is uh web 3 has made the internet weird again which was like a big relief to chris because web 2 just felt so stale to him but web 3 is like weird and weird stuff's happening when you tell me like people are wearing capes at east denver teams are wearing capes that eat denver and you like to like dress as as like an avatar of sorts and kind of like stand out in a way that you kind of want your internet avatar to stand out it kind of feels like we're trying to bring the metaverse into the real life like we're trying to make the the physical world a little bit more like the digital world while we're also trying to make the digital world a little bit more like the real world um see that seems to be a little bit of what's going on yeah absolutely and i think there's gonna be more like i want more playful how do you play like inspire people to play and absolutely i think that's something i'm actually really focused on right now is um how do we fix some of these in real life problems in a way where we're so disconnected by the work we're doing online in a way where we're not taking away from our real life experiences but where the technology becomes complementary to it so yeah i think those are all the next big questions to solve all right margaret the last line of topic that i want to to go on involves uh a sort of a pseudo-borja test uh so i'm just gonna say one word and i just wanna see what comes out of your brain after i say it um curation oh uh is the aesthetic law it's the aesthetic law okay now can you unpack that from me i say this because i'm just bringing on into blockade games the lead cyberpunk curator and in his descriptions i labeled him as aesthetic law of kind of the quality control of the company um and in that like if it's we're not hitting his curate like curation like acceptability meter then it's not good enough and as a company we're failing we're below bar so like aesthetic law meaning this is what's acceptable and we should be striving above so and um in other curated experiences i like i'm sure this this is the same thing as aesthetic law like are you are you gonna make the cut for whatever this criteria is um so yeah for us internally we've brought in someone that's an expert in cyberpunk uh cyberpunk curation how about um inside of the context of just like your friends your loved ones the experiences that you want both in the metaverse and outside in the real world how does the how does the how does the importance of curation impact these things um so i think curation is a form of art right like uh you are it doesn't necessarily have to be exclusive but in this context you're thinking of a flow of an experience you're like how one thing relates to another and how aesthetically all together it's this cohesive um space or level that resonates and i think curation has a place so like in regards to like what was the question with my friends and other people i i mean you can allow yourself to feel left out by not being included in a sorry particular storytelling version of a curation curated experience but honestly the curator's job is just to pull the things together they think all belong together and to tell this like experience or offer an experience or tell a story um in the best way possible and that's usually by like threading connections across the mediums and how how do you do that in your life is that a fair fair is that too open-ended of a question how do i do that in my life uh what what experiences do you try and curate for yourself and what kind of experiences you try and curate for others yeah um i guess like uh even just with so i am a queen of making playlists um so uh i may i love making playlists and i curate them and i think about the flow and i like get rid of songs so i don't like that song there and then and then i like to share them with people that i think like would experience them in ways that i like you know like i so in curation in my life like that's something i think about i also think about quality control my friends i think about people around me i think about um projects i involve myself in um who am i advising um yeah there's a lot of curation as far as you know curation is just another word for filtering and filtering for what lens um and what sort of desired outcome so yeah it's just like so yeah margaret what makes you optimistic about the future am i optimistic about the future you should think about that like how you like just said i wasn't i don't know about the future i just kind of assume everyone in crypto is um what makes me optimistic is the fact that i honestly think we're going to be able to create tools to allow people to be creative in environments in which maybe they otherwise would have not had these opportunities i think that i think if we look at the inclusive nature of if you've ever been to an east denver event if you've ever been to one of these web 3 events you'll see that this is really like how can i help you how can i empower you sort of ethos that exists and i think that's going to extend and spill over to a lot of what we're building um i think it does already do that and i think as we do that heavy lifting for people we're going to just create a better future because the more voices at the table more talent the more skills the more empowered and educated people the like the better problem solvers you have in the room and the more people that are going to say no to stuff that they don't like or things that are against that positive outcome so i think like that shift and um becoming having autonomy is going to be huge because once you plant that seed you can't take it away like people will not forget what it feels like to have like to be autonomous is there any bit of advice that you followed that has been immensely useful to you that you think is worth sharing to listeners that is a good question um i guess something that i thought if you were shy like i was really really shy um and you feel like inferior like you don't have anything to contribute to you know the best thing you can do is especially if you have a skill set like being an artist it's really hard to get a traditional job in that capacity finding ways to contribute and building up your reputation how can you support others how can you bring value is a great way to get started with that reputation based uh background which will allow you to have this foundation to build this individuality on top of it doesn't need to start all at once um it can be slow over time but just being a contributor actually is what has unlocked for me some of the best opportunities and also you contribute in a way where you showed up and you did something magical and people remember and then they give you better opportunities so looking for those opportunities where there's space for you where you can contribute where you can win and allowing that reputation to build to lead and design your own career it can seem scary but honestly it's it's so much more freeing than i think trying to work underneath like a corporate structure where things are way more restrictive in this sort of economy that we have in space that we have it's like the more you show up and the more you deliver and where you prove yourself the more doors that open just left and right and you get to choose like which one is best for you whereas you don't really get that in the like traditional corporate structure so i mean maybe to some extent but i've really enjoyed that as a creative and it's like the minute you trust yourself is when you really start to unlock your potential and stop living out of fear um so what's surprising is i've been in this space for so far so long that i take that for granted that i see a lot of talented people really struggle with that and struggle with that fear and like the doubt and belief in themselves that they can actually catch themselves and they can find ways to create value so look at people that are successful people that are doing things that you're attracted to show up contribute and like take a leap margaret thank you for joining me on layer zero thank you david cheers hey we hope you enjoyed the video
