welcome everyone to another episode of state of the nation david and i bring this to you on tuesdays 2 p.m eastern you can catch it live on youtube then david what's the show about state of the nation is the weekly show where we grab a headline title a headline event a current event in the news cycle and we grab a guess who can speak about that and today that guest is eric voorhees eric voorhees is the ceo of shapeshift which is a company in the crypto space that has done a number of pivots which they are just about to do again they have pivoted into the world of being a dex aggregator and while that is a cool topic in of itself and we definitely go into the details behind that choice with eric it also is a reflection of the changing landscape of crypto the current events of crypto are perhaps incentivizing uh this sort of decision to leverage uh decentralized protocols in order to run a company there is a lot of conversation to be had there and that's what we get into with eric in this podcast so we get to into shapeshift we get into d5 we get into protocol sync thesis we get into uh regulations we get into this topic of de-platforming and we finish with something like i think eric is uniquely positioned to talk about and that's like crypto market cycles because he's been through almost every single one so he's got some great advice near the end especially for those of you that are looking at the current prices feeling like that 30 drop and getting a little worried so stay tuned for that some announcements too we've got some things going on in the bank list nation community as we usually do the first is this so you may know that we roll out nft badges for pure for bankless members who sign up they become full subscribers to the bankless newsletter there's some perks that go along with that and david we are actually releasing a new badge design for the 2121 edition let me uh let me show it here on the screen but what we're looking for is a slogan for the top of this token badge so you can see it right now if you're logged into youtube uh insert slogan here and we are beginning the process of collecting slogans i submitted mine in crypto we trust maybe that works as a slogan but we want to hear from the bankless community what uh slogan they'd like on the bankless badge this year yeah the bank list badge is a one of the few tokens out there that is not a money that is not a digital piece of art yeah it is still a token it's it's a pretty uh unique way to leverage tokens in ethereum uh and this one uh fits into a kind of its own category it's more of an identity slash i i mean it's a part of the proof of attendance protocol system and it's a it's just a different way to run a token where it actually uh identifies members as being part of a cohort and that is what the bankless batch does for you yeah we think of it as a subscription token almost like a passport into the bankless ecosystem we have big plans for it this year as well and speaking of big plans and the podcast everything that's going on we had chris dixon on this week so catch that podcast if you haven't already we did something new this is for bank list members another member uh member perk is we also included a special episode this is a a full debrief where you and i give our feedback in our thoughts it's unscripted it's kind of raw like immediately after we stopped recording with the guests we did this with chris dixon and this is available for full bankless subscribers right now on a premium feed anything you'd add about this david yeah this is actually a regular thing that you and i would do ryan after we would record a podcast we would just hop into discord calls and just start talking about the podcast that we just recorded and let's not let any good content go to waste and so we are making this more formalized we're doing 20 to 30 minute conversations just with david and ryan's just us our takes after the podcast is finished about you know what was so cool about that podcast what are our thoughts about it just kind of giving our summary of how we thought the podcast went i think that's going to be a really valuable piece of extra content if you are a bankless subscriber we will include a link for you in the show notes of course today but david let's get going on the episode with with eric and before we do i've got to ask you the question i ask every week what is the state of the nation today my friend the state of the nation is riding it out we are riding it out let it be known that we are it's uh 11 days into 2021 and the crypto prices are still higher than the first of the year so we are still green on the year yet we have just experienced almost a 40 retrace in bitcoin ether and other d5 token prices this is like the first big retrace of the bull market we're going from 40 000 bitcoin to 30 000 bitcoin is not something to ignore that is a big pullback uh the people that i'm talking to in my circles are relieved i would say uh we all no one everyone says that you know there's nothing the only thing that you can assure yourself in life are death taxes and 30 retraces in crypto markets we thought that maybe we got out of that uh that law and people as the bitcoin price continued to climb and did not stop climbing but no 30 retraces always come so for the people that are experiencing their first 30 uh retrace of their first ever cryptocycle uh congratulations uh i we we have all been there with you before this is your first uh your first badge of going through a retrace it's not fun it's not easy there is pain involved uh but this is how these crypto markets work and so we are all writing it out together yeah i think that's great and i think that fits in with our next guest eric voorhees who talks about i mean he's he he he talked about near the end uh riding it out from a price of of he bought it five dollars bitcoin this is bitcoin at five dollars it's not ether got to 32 and then riding all the way down a 95 drop and what that felt like so uh we've all been there if this is your first bull market crypto cycle hang in there 30 retrace 40 retrace even 50 retrace does not necessarily end the bull cycle that we're in it doesn't necessarily feel great it's kind of like you're you're on that roller coaster and your stomach just drops out that's it's kind of that feeling but eric's got some wise advice for you at the end so with that david we should get into our conversation with eric voorhees the ceo of shapeshift gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got back into crypto back in 2017 and it has been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets including many of the hot d5 tokens like wi-fi ave uni and also they are one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets having both the option of logging into thegemini.com website or instead opening the gemiini mobile app has allowed me to be able to access any and all exchange

synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or s d phi because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out quenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics all right bankless nation once again we want to welcome to the bankless show eric voorhees who is the ceo of shapeshift he's a bitcoiner he's a crypto maximalist he's a multi crypto cycle veteran eric it's great to have you on bank let's once again how are you doing my friend i'm doing very well so good to be on the show again thanks for having me here well it's timely because there's always a lot going on in crypto and the world we want to get to that but first we want to talk about this is this is state of the nation so on state of the nation we talk about like what's gone on recently particularly past week and something really exciting uh was launched from shapeshift the company that that you helped uh steer and ceo you just announced as i understand it that shapeshift is becoming a decentralized exchange aggregators you guys are are making this this business pivot uh can you tell us about that and then let's get into sort of what it means and why yeah um so yeah i mean basically what we've done is we have integrated uh nearly all of the leading indexes into shapeshift so shapeshift itself is not a dex but we've integrated all the leading ones into shapeshift so people that are using our mobile app and very soon our web platform can trade um on those dexes directly the reason that we did this uh you know i think it surprised some people because we've always in some ways been a competitor to these exchanges we we have been a venue for trading also um but clearly the dexes have the better model and um i have been so just inspired and impressed by by what they have done you know the rise of uniswap in 2020 was i think the most important story in crypto um and really it it provides just a superior model for for trading uh because it brings the the trustlessness the immutability of of bitcoin and ethereum as forms of of payment or as money into a more advanced activity of trading and so when they when a user is trading with these pools with these dexes uh there is no there is no middleman um no one just to censor the transaction no one to block it and because they're trading with the protocol there is no kyc required the the protocol itself would bear the burden of the koac and the protocol is obviously not going to comply so um yeah we we made this decision about six months ago and have been working on it for for several months to get it integrated and just launched that last week on wednesday the 6th awesome well congratulations eric for getting that out the door maybe let's go and dive into some of the the protocols that are beneath uh shapeshift's new aggregator so obviously there's a unit swap uh probably there's kyber too uh what else is there behind the scenes like where what uh the decentralized exchanges does shapeshift now tap into yeah so kyber's in there bancor's in there sushi swap is in there 0x is in there um and probably half a dozen others but they start to get kind of long tail after that and we will obviously integrate more and more over time um and you know particularly in the this quarter the big thing that we'll be uh announcing is cross chain decks very cool okay i was going to get to that in a second as well yeah what about so all the major ones are there what about other dex aggregators are is a shapeshift and aggregator of other aggregators like one inch or are those not included so we actually uh hooked up xerox's aggregator as the main way that we're accessing all these venues um so we may integrate other aggregators also um and then we also may directly integrate some of these because just for redundancy reasons uh so yeah right right now we've found 0x to be pretty excellent i think they're they're aggregators called uh matcha um it's been fantastic well that is really really cool there's a definitely a a conversation to be had in the protocol sync thesis which i think we will get to a little bit later in this conversation maybe we can uh talk about the differences between because dex aggregators are are not new this is not the first aggregator out into the world what is the uh compelling difference between shape shifts uh shape shifts dex aggregator versus perhaps an alternative yeah so certainly um someone should reasonably ask the question like should i trade through shapeshift or should i just go directly to a dex uh two two main reasons why we're better one is you're going to get the exact same pricing that you would get if you went directly to the decks right so like unlike metamask there's no added fee uh and two you actually get fox tokens on all the trades that you do through shapeshift um and three actually because we're breaking the trades across multiple decks is you can you can get better pricing than if you went to any of the single dexes themselves so those are the main reasons uh and then there's just the convenience element which is if you can trade directly from your wallet uh that just makes your life a little easier and better so what are the fox tokens eric that you mentioned is that sort of a a loyalty type of uh token yes yeah so we've had the fox tokens available for around a year um essentially what they do is they give people the ability to have straight pass through pricing um and and about two months ago we also uh added something called rainfall and rainfall is pretty sweet basically every time someone does a trade through shapeshift we pay out usdc to a random other person uh a user of shapeshift based on the number of fox tokens that they have oh wow it's a bit it's basically like a perpetual lottery in a sense but you don't have to pay anything for the tickets if you have the fox tokens then you just randomly get an email that says hey you just got three dollars or 50 or you know sometimes people win hundreds of dollars from these payments and they go out hundreds of times a day um so both those reasons like the the fox tokens themselves have a value and you also get paid uh when you hold them eric this seems to be a return back to shapeshift's roots back when uh back in 2017 i remember using shapeshift where it was it was a place where i could just send it it would give me a bitcoin address and then i would deposit an ether address and then i would send bitcoin and shape-shift would send me back ether immediately very much like an exchange but also non-custodial it was it was like very much a an atomic transaction so in goes btc and out goes ether very easy to use and that seemed to be perhaps a little bit uh too soon because we didn't have infrastructure like uh dex aggregators how does it feel to to kind of go back to what the original business model of shapeshift uh was set out to achieve yeah i mean in some ways we're leaving the original business model shapeshift entirely in order to get back to the original goals of shapeshift which is to provide a simple way that is safe for people to trade shapeshift started in 2014 months after the mount cox catastrophe and it was really meant to be a way for people to be able to trade safely so they would not have to leave their funds at an exchange they wouldn't have to suffer that counterparty risk and also we had no accounts whatsoever so p so we would protect people's data because we didn't take their data in the first place and crypto has has delivered this very amazing way that people can transact online without having to know each other or trust each other and so we didn't want people's information they didn't want to give it to us and it endangers someone to basically take their information over the internet and store it in a big warehouse all day so um that was the original goal just make a safer and easier place for people to trade and uh in 2018 when we implemented kyc it was because we had done a substantial amount of legal analysis by that point and felt that the risk of not doing it um was too great and hopefully someday i'll be able to get into more detail about that but suffice to say it's been a very dark period for us and um you know as we saw these dexes it's just uh it's so heartwarming to see the technology like catch back up to what we wanted to do and we realized some of these dexes you know had massive volumes and were really reliable and so instead of trying to make like decks number 15 we would just integrate all the leading ones into shape shift and bring that spirit of protecting people back into the product i want to emphasize this point because i think it's something that uh you know somewhat unique that i i see in you eric is so people underestimate how hard it is to pivot a business idea right to basically uh to abandon all of the the stuff that you've built all of the infrastructure that you built from like you know the 2014 implementation of the vision right and and make this pivot um you've also been one to sort of um i wouldn't say pivot but uh also embrace other chains other crypto currencies and um crypto networks that haven't been bitcoin whereas whereas many uh of the kind of the the bitcoin maximalist tribe um have criticized you over the years to do it but the common thing i see in both of those kind of moves maybe this goes back to your mental model is um getting back to the vision as you said right so the vision for shapeshift has always been non-custodial owning your own asset while doing decentralized exchange right the implementation of that has changed through the years but that's always been the vision right just like the the vision for bitcoin is a self-sovereign money system right the implementation of that can be in found in other changes under other chains can you talk about that a little bit eric like so yeah why is that important as an investor like why why is it important to kind of follow that vision wherever it takes you yeah good observation um i've been in this industry for one main reason which is to advance the cause of individual liberty and so any tool that does that is something that i'm going to be interested in supporting learning about advocating when bitcoin started it was really like the only tool that was doing that and it inspired an entire world of new innovation and to to appreciate bitcoin i think if you really appreciate what bitcoin stands for what it is doing for the world you have to look at some of these other projects and be similarly amazed and and inspired and um and grateful for them to exist so i have you know i used to be a bitcoin maximalist but that that got washed away as i saw this industry evolving and i realized that like part of the decentralization which is which is core to the ethos of bitcoin is to have multiple projects multiple chains multiple teams people working on things with different assumptions different perspectives so that's always been really uh really important to me and yeah i mean similarly with with shapeshift if i can't if i can't offer a service that helps people and make their life better than the alternative then i should not be providing the service i it has no reason to exist and um you know it got to the point where i realized that like shapeshift's model under the under the confines of of kyc was just clearly inferior to what the dexes were offering and you know two to three years ago when we had made that decision to do kyc these dexes were not ready yet um automated market makers didn't really exist yet like uniswap had just just launched like at the the prague devcon there was no liquidity no liquidity they were not ready to to scale um but that has changed and so as it changed my my thinking and uh my thinking changed and i realized like these are ready and not only are they ready but they're vastly superior and thank god that they're here and i'm gonna latch onto these and help promote them all that i can eric you mentioned this at the beginning of this interview and i want to go back to it maybe you can talk about the calculus behind initially shape-shift integrating kyc and now you guys feel comfortable that you are able to remove kyc maybe you can talk about the the calculus behind that the the removal of kyc talk about that decision yeah so so ultimately we are a company and we have to follow the laws right not only are we a company but we're fairly well established i'm very well known we have an office you know most of many of our employees are known we're not anonymous at all we have to follow the laws and even if we hate the laws or think that they're wrong so um when we added kyc it was because we came to the conclusion that those laws were going to apply to us and that to try to avoid them was going to be too risky and you know was going to put the whole company in danger and [Music] us moving to this model with these dexes we are able to change our opinion on kyc because we're changing the way that the business operates we are ending the regulated activity that we had been doing we are no longer going to be trading with customers we are no longer going to be a counterparty to the trades we are no longer going to be an intermediary of any definition at any step in the process and because we're changing those fundamental facts the legal analysis is completely different and we feel comfortable even though it's not risk-less we feel comfortable with the risk level of integrating these dexes and letting people connect directly to them so th this goes to uh kind of a thesis that that david and i uh talk about a lot on bankless um and it's called the uh the critical sync thesis and the basic idea behind it eric is the most credibly neutral most decentralized money protocols tend to sink to the bottom right and then other more centralized services are built on top of them so we certainly saw that with with bitcoin as being sort of a um an asset and a network that other centralized institutions say a coinbase can build on top of or even a mount gox can build on top of right and now we're seeing the same thing with d5 protocols so the interesting thing is if you can create a um a smart contract system that is as credibly neutral and as decentralized as uniswap that becomes like a bitcoin like thing in that it is um you can't be de-platformed from uniswap right and so other more centralized companies and institutions and groups can then start to build solutions on top of that and i think it's interesting that like we're seeing the the protocol sync thesis playing out with with groups like shapeshift groups like coinbase um other exchanges starting to build on top of not just bitcoin and uh ether but on top of the d5 protocols themselves so this to us is an example of the protocol sync thesis playing out and i think we're going to see it continue but what's super interesting in this case as well is that you were almost pushed into building on these protocols um due to regulators right so being a a central institution with um a uh a profile in meat space right um that meant that essentially you went to kyc and if you didn't then like you know you'd end up in a jail somewhere obviously so you're going to abide by the the rules of the nation state um but it also provides you an outlet to build on top of these d5 protocols what are your thoughts on that it's do you think that this is um do you think that this trend is going to continue in uh in crypto this idea that hey at the very bottom of this whole money stack we're going to have credibly neutral decentralized self-sovereign uh protocols and then everything else is going to be built on top of these things yeah so first i'll i'll say i'm not one of those people that thinks everything in the world will be decentralized you know like there's this meme of like decentralize everything um not everything will be decentralized some things are much more efficient and better when centralized but a whole hell of a lot of things can be decentralized and work far better in that way and what crypto is doing is testing all these different models and seeing like is there a way to do this in a decentralized way that brings greater efficiency um and we're finding that some of those are actually happening and so if you look at like all the i mean anyone who who's in the crypto world knows or in the financial world who who has dealt with a lot of these regulations the burden that it puts on the organization is profound the amount of money that goes into legal analysis the amount of money that goes into compliance the the portion of your staff and the attention of the rest of your staff that goes into these things that is explicitly not serving your customer is really depressing and it weighs on the entire organization it weighs on the customers and it just adds it adds misery and cloudiness to what what people are trying to just do so when you can add a decentralized protocol into this and remove all that burden it's inevitable that that is going to start attracting greater liquidity more usage um and that's what we're seeing i mean uniswap is doing like more volume than coinbase on some days unit swap's two years old i think they've raised like 10 million dollars coinbase is eight years old and has raised like 600 million dollars um that's a profoundly that's like that is a paradigm paradigm change and i think when people start seeing that uh decentralized trading can go work across chains like right now it's all on ethereum when it can be done across change the entire ecosystem is just going to get pulled into that and it's going to be i think really uh really cool and that's really the the power of this technology so let's talk a little bit about um crypto and regulation moving to 21 uh 2021. so um some people think that what's going to happen is just this eric that uh the the front line for regulation is just going to change right so um some people believe that defy hasn't yet had its final boss moment right where there is right so there's some heavy-handed of regulation imposed against say a uniswap for instance or other d5 protocols in general and we almost saw hints of that with the proposed rule coming out of um of mnuchin's office right um can you talk about yeah okay well let's talk about it like let's talk about the theme here right so final boss is is looking around what's going to happen with uh d5 crypto regulation in 2021 and and beyond how how do you think that's going to play out yeah so our analysis and the analysis of any company that's in the space is based on the state of play right what are the laws as they exist and what might be immediately coming because no one knows a year or five years out right and so laws can change and so there is no decision there's no decision you can make that you will know will not be challenged or problematic in the future um but what you can do is look at at least in the u.s the most of the financial regulation ties back into something called the bank secrecy act which came out in 1971 or 72. the bank secrecy act essentially espouses something called an intermediary like a financial intermediary if you are that then the entire body of of financial regulation starts applying to you um if you are not that then it doesn't like that that is its foundational definition that if you're a fight an intermediary then these things start applying and certainly back then all parties that were involved in money and payments of any kind had to be intermediaries because everything in fiat has to have an intermediary it's all the money is always sitting with a party right unless it's unless it's cash um crypto has completely shattered that paradigm there is no intermediary in the bitcoin network there is no intermediary in the ethereum network and as these systems get built more complex we're seeing now higher level order systems that also don't have intermediaries these decentralized exchanges are a great example of this and so the bank secrecy act does not apply to a decentralized system with no intermediary absolutely i think governments will want to apply it they will try perhaps they'll fail but they might just try to change the law itself but changing that law itself is actually a huge burden and a huge task it's a multi-year thing it's not just fincen can't just come out with guidance and change that rule at that layer that's a that is a long-term thing that the government would have to engage in it would be heavily challenged and it could end up becoming challenged under constitutional grounds which i don't think anyone at those regulators wants to even expose themselves to so um so that's that's the battle right now and uh i think people in in d5 need to realize that they have very good arguments right now but the state of play can change and they need to remain ever vigilant so eric we are in the crypto space and and we you know we produce content and consume content to the point where we understand these things at a very deep level we understand the removal of intermediaries and how these things are protocols and that's what gets us all really excited i am not so sure that regulators are going to be able to go as deep as as you or ryan here or me into the intricacies of these details like are you pessimistic or optimistic about the ability for regulators and regulations to actually understand what they are dealing with or or are you more perhaps uh pessimistic about like me like because we saw out of the minutian office just a regulation that did not really uh was obviously not a misunderstanding as to how this technology works like where's your head out with your your optimism optimism or pessimism there um [Music] well i mean we should all be honest that the vast majority of people do not understand this technology deeply even people in the industry it takes a long time even myself who's been in this for 10 years i feel like i'm constantly learning things and there's so much that i don't know it is really hard to really understand it and it's changing so even if you understand it today it'll be different in six months um i think as the as the regulators realize that the control of money itself is being pulled away from them and put in the hands of the entire population of individuals of the world they are not going to be happy about that um they will with time learn about it and try to regulate it more but they move relatively slowly whereas crypto moves at light speed all over the world in in so many different directions my hope is that as crypto grows fast and as it rests control of money into the hands of people there will be a cultural shift where people realize that oh actually that works pretty damn well society does not fall apart when people have control over their own money society does not fall apart when people have financial privacy and as that cultural realization happens the desire of regulators to try to pull it back to how it used to be will will fade with time if it doesn't then it's going to be a perpetual battle you know but over the next 10 or 20 years i think the the culture will change and people realize that this stuff is really a virtuous new system that is superior to the old this is such a great take you're right so i think you're painting the picture eric of um this is a race right it's it's really up to the builders in this ecosystem to create enough winds for the population and heck even for you know other other parties like like on wall street or in government create enough winds in crypto so that they don't uh attempt at some later stage to regulate it into oblivion and you also made the point that with kind of the bank secrecy act right actually it sounds like from what you're saying defy is relatively well positioned because it's very hard for existing regulators to kind of argue that that you know d5 presents intermediaries in the picture right so well they could kind of slow things down these things could be challenged what it would take is is brand new um i i guess brand new legislation to completely put a clamp down on what we're doing this space so that's pretty bullish but i want to get back to this idea because this is important i i hope listeners hear this it's up to you defy and up to crypto to build enough wins for society and people uh writ large that um regulators can't take self-sovereign money and defy away from us it would be too politically untenable and unpopular and they would lose the ability to compete in the global economic world that is coming yeah and hopefully at some point the regulators start to realize that many of their goals will still be met by this technology like to the extent that they want an honest transparent financial system i would hope that the regulators care about that concept there has never been a more honest and transparent financial system than what what we are building here so this doesn't need to be the kind of thing where you know crypto people are completely at odds with regulators forever but certainly there is no there is in the venn diagram an area of tension right there's times right right so the areas of tension to me and we've had folks like rohan gray on the on the podcast for instance the area of tension for to me from what we can kind of decipher it comes from maybe two camps right one that's really threatened by the united states's um position from a world reserve currency uh perspective so preserving the us dollar as the world reserve currency none of them are worried about that yet and they're not right so people like rohan grey are a little bit right there and they're not super worried about that but the other is the the whole kind of uh financial surveillance apparatus who wants to control um like they don't want private cash if they could ban um suitcases full of money and actual physical cash they would right now that seems to be another but like much of government there's a shared objective between open finance uh and and us but in in those two camps i i worry a little bit eric what's what's your take yeah it's certainly to the extent that that any person or organization wants wholesale surveillance and control of money that that's going away right like crypto has ended that because crypto will win because it's more efficient and people will tend toward the thing that's more efficient with over time because money is involved and people are profit seeking so like long term there's no doubt that crypto wins so but the those who want that surveillance and that control how long will they fight it how stubborn will they be in relinquishing that control you know probably pretty probably pretty stubborn i i don't expect that this will be like a friendly you know debate over the next 10 years it's going to be pretty rough um and this is why you know i put a tweet out yesterday trying to kind of get people to remember that what we're building here is going to be very controversial is actually going to change the world we're not we're not just doing this with like a slogan of like oh we're changing the world and we have this revolutionary new technology it's actually revolutionary in the best sense of the term because it's changing the world peacefully but that will that will not please everyone and there is going to be some very hard-fought battles and people should should be very careful they should be thoughtful they should spend as much as they need on lawyers to understand the nuances of this issue if you call your project defined you put the word define your web page that does not mean that the laws don't apply you have to understand the facts of how you actually operate and what the actual laws are in various jurisdictions that's a complicated thing and so people just need to take this stuff seriously and they need to realize that like this will be one but it'll be one in 10 or 20 or 30 years and in the meantime we have a long hard road ahead of us um trying to convince the world to change hey guys don't go anywhere we bring up the conversation of a deep platforming with eric we just watched donald trump get de-platformed from a bunch of different social media platforms we talk about how is the topic of web 3 and decentralization relevant to that conversation and then we pick eric's brain about cryptocycles we seem to be going into a fourth crypto cycle yes eric is one of the few people that has experienced all four of them and so we want to get some advice and some perspective as to how he is perceiving our entrance into this fourth cryptocycle don't go anywhere we just have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith d5 visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of d5 so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com so we've been talking about money and the laws and regulations around money and people that act as intermediaries and money transmitters and and all those types of regulations however something recently has just happened that is also adjacent to the realm of defy and uh maybe more accurately web 3. uh last week we saw a coordinated uh d platforming of the president of the united states from facebook twitter uh instagram uh even reddit the subreddit got banned and even pinterest decided to to ban donald trump for whatever reason i hadn't heard that yeah yeah i did this too eric what what was your reaction to that decision and what does that tell you about the state of the world that we're in right now yeah it's pretty momentous um it's a controversial topic i think the shallow analysis is if you like trump you're mad about the d platforming and and if you don't like trump you're glad about it that like that's a valueless analysis i think a a better approach here is to assess like should companies be doing this yes or no like is it is it ethical or legal that's a fair debate um i think people can do whatever they want with their own private property so i think if twitter wants to de-platform trump that's up to them um but it's also it's going to have consequences and those consequences are going to be people starting to realize that oh decentralization is actually useful in other things not just money uh people in crypto have known that for a while but people are gonna realize like there are these large-scale systems that the world uses twitter being one and it is kind of a shame if it is only a centralized company that is that large and can censor people like that so there is there is serious value in a decentralized social media system there is serious value in decentralized communication there is serious value in decentralized money and i think the events of this last week are going to awaken a lot of people to to the fact that like maybe these decentralized folks have a have a point so you think eric high level this is going to act as an accelerant towards decentralized platforms decentralized solutions yeah an accelerant it's not going to turn overnight you know um the network effects that these companies have are really profound but it's definitely going to make people start considering alternatives building alternatives and being more open to alternatives so there's a deep debate here about whether like twitter facebook these are all private companies private companies get to do what they want um at the same time the the differing opinion is is some of these uh public or private companies are providing infrastructure that almost people can't live without and especially for communication from the president of the united states to the rest of the people that's important to have that channel of communication open which it seems to be that private companies shut down so people are using these things as closer to something like public utilities which offers friction because they are still private companies and i think what you were saying there is well there's that debate and that debate could go on really really really long but i think you're what you're saying is well we could just skip over that debate and just admit that decentralized uh social media platforms or decentralized protocols that offer that same niche is actually the more viable thing to pay to put your attention towards totally totally and and for those who are advocating that the government should come in and mandate that private companies give uh amplify communication of certain groups and minimize communication of other groups that's a super dangerous realm to go down right so whatever whatever you think of jack dorsey's decision making i would much rather have jack dorsey deciding for twitter than a bunch of politicians deciding for twitter that's for damn sure and i think a better way to solve the issue of censorship on these high scale platforms is decentralized systems that's that's the better one where people can't censor it this is uh this also this everything that happened last week kind of reminded me if if such an attack could happen uh if such an attack happened on crypto where would we be so for instance if apps uh crypto related apps start to be de-platformed from the app store google play that's one level and then also we saw things with with parlor for instance where uh parlor where aws actually amazon said we're no longer hosting you so amazon does it google cloud does it then you're out of all of the cloud providers uh and you literally can't get hosting you spin up your own data center right so what what could be interesting is if we ever get into that uh final boss esque type battle we haven't stacked up enough wins eric to kind of like push sentiment uh towards crypto adoption crypto favorable uh protection or legislation at some level crypto could be under such an attack and then what would we do i feel like we should be ready as an industry for these things they could come yeah um i mean people have become so used to hosting on the cloud that they don't realize that like the internet got started and became huge before the cloud ever existed you know like you can host a server on your computer in your basement and a lot of people run crypto nodes like at home on their basement you know i i run them myself many others do too so certainly if there's a coordinated uh assault on crypto infrastructure at these clouds that would be pretty bad you know maybe devastating but it still doesn't kill it for sure if you it the the topography of these networks just changes that's part of their their resilience so eric to our last transition of the conversation is to the conversation of the bull market you are a crypto cycle veteran so i'm hoping to get a glean from you is how does this cycle that we you know this bull market that we think that we're going into you know bitcoin is that well it was at double all-time high prices ether is tickling it's its previous all-time high prices uh how does this cycle feel different to you and then also we'll get into how it also feels the same yeah it doesn't really feel that different to me it's uh each bubble gets bigger than the last each bubble brings in a new new cohorts of people um there's always the skepticism as it rises the entire time you know all through the 2017 bubble people are skeptical they're like is this the top is this top is this you know is this too high you know i when bitcoin hit 2500 um kind of early that year you know i sold a little bit of my bitcoin because i was like maybe this is the top you know the 2500 it went almost 10x higher than that and i knew it would do that long term but there's always like this there's always uncertainty and so you have to just like let that be what is most important is people's long-term thesis on this stuff do you think that this technology is actually taking over the world and that bitcoin is going to be a major store of value form of money for the entire planet or or not if you do then any of these multi-year cycles are kind of meaningless and um just focus on that on that long term now if you're like trying to day trade it's a whole a whole different story uh but that's a that's a dangerous hobby so what would you say to to someone maybe this is their their first cycle eric right so we have a lot of listeners getting into banknotes for the first time this is the first cycle they've been through and hey eric man like we you know bitcoin just did a 2x all-time high and now we're feeling some pain this is today as we record this of like a 20 drop maybe 30 drop maybe it gets as high as 30 plus at the moment maybe this gets as high as 40 percent um people are freaking out what what's your advice to them yeah on some level it's cute [Laughter] so last time i checked bitcoin price it was like thirty thousand thirty one thousand um you know down twenty 25 from just a couple days ago it's it's higher than it was like two and a half weeks ago right so we we've fallen down and my friends and i were all talking and one of the friends was saying how he's gonna buy some more if it stays at these cheap prices cheap meaning like 30 000 bitcoin two weeks ago we were all celebrating and drinking champagne because we hit 30 000 it's all it's all relative um i guess what i would say is in my first bubble bitcoin was five dollars when i first got something it went up to thirty one dollars and then it declined that bubble popped and it declined down to two dollars so like 95 percent drop over six months just like the most miserable disgusting decay of of the whole system and there was it had no adoption anywhere it was this like niche little thing that everyone made fun of um and everyone had every reason to think that it was done and dead and many people wrote that it was so some of us have handled like 95 percent declines because we care about what it's doing we care about why this is here we care about what bitcoin and ethereum and these other crypto projects are doing for the world and so the price is obviously relevant and important but it's not the main the main thing um and you can't beat yourself up over the the price movements you can't stress about eric voorhees thank you so much for being with us on the bank list podcast you are a multi-cycle veteran we really appreciate your advice it comes uh very timely sir so thanks for being with us appreciate it ryan thanks for having me on the show and eric where can we find more about what you're doing and more about shapeshift yeah i would encourage everyone to download the shapeshift app iphone and android or check me out on twitter at ericburries awesome those are the action items guys thanks for joining us for state of the nation take care guys of course our conversation today with eric was not financial advice eth is risky so is defy so is bitcoin you could lose what you put in but this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
