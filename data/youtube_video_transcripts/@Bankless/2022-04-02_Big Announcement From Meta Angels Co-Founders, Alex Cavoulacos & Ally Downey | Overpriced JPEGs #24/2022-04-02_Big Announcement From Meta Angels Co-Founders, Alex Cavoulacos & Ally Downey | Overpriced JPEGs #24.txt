incredibly excited to talk to these two women not only is meta angels a a project worthy of a case study in terms of what they've already started launching in the few short i want to say weeks months that they've been launched i've talked about this project on the show before zenica 33 has talked about this project on the show before because we are both big fans uh ali and alex think about things like true entrepreneurs which is what they are they both have strong backgrounds as serial entrepreneurs and have a lot of wisdom that they have brought with them from that traditional world so just from that alone you will get value from this episode however they are also coming out with a really big announcement for this space in general so if you are somebody who are have thought about

coming out of this this episode and this conversation and with that we're gonna have a word from our sponsors and then we'll get right into my conversation with alex and ali of meta angels it's

and ally downey the co-founders of the meta angels project you all know i'm a huge fan of meta angels we've talked about it a number of times on this show and i'm really excited to dive into it with y'all to learn a little bit more about your journey and also there's a big announcement today that i think we are the first to break and really excited to have you tell us what this big announcement is so we'll leave that in suspense to start why don't you each introduce yourself tell us your your backgrounds really i think you have very interesting journeys to web3 yeah thank you so much for having us this is so great we're obviously a big fan of you and we love listening to this podcast um so you know my name is alex kavalakis i'm co-founder and ceo of meta angels i'm a serial entrepreneur i've been in tech for over a decade and really my specialization is building companies and building products both the operations side and the product side um before this i spent a decade building the muse venture back company went through serious c 70 million people a year coming to get career advice and job search from that company but from it i learned a ton about hiring growing businesses building brands listening to users and i just love that early stage and so after leaving there after a decade sort of thinking about my next move and and got together with ali to to do something different that i think is really impactful which is always what drives me yeah uh and and ali downey i am also one of the co-founders of meta angels i too am a serial entrepreneur this is my third company um i have a background in politics which i know i share with you carly uh and then after that uh i got my mba and then started a company called we spring which is like yelp for baby and kids products um and we were building a community that enabled people to get social product recommendations so i'd say the common thread that has run through my career has been around building communities that are centered on trust and that is a big big component of what we're doing with meta angels as well you have perfectly segued me to my next question which is i think that's a common thread for both your careers in some way when i think about the muse as really a connective platform for companies and and people looking for jobs and also the content you've created around that to help people find jobs find career paths i know you've written a book on it as well alex and then ali of course with you for new parents for parents uh building that community for them do you think that's why for each of you web three clicked early all of us being fairly early adopters here what was that aha moment for each of you uh in this yeah go ahead i think what's what's so interesting is when you're building a company especially as a founder right like you do you get that ownership piece and you bring in and you know i've hired hundreds of people to work at the muse who had equity and are part of building that and it's so fascinating to me to sort of think about this new world of building where there's an ownership component and there's an a direct sort of connection to what you're building um that for me was something that clicked very early on i think also the difference between you know one of one art and buying things sort of that has a direct translation with art potentially that for some people clicks versus not i'm not in the real world an art collector my sister works at a major museum she is very much that kind of person i spend my money on travel and food that's my hobbies but i do believe in community i like to build things that matter and so that once i really understood that world and how nfts could enable much greater things um and the power of building together that for me immediately made sense quick follow-up what does your sister think of nfts is coming from the traditional art world she is very sketchy very skeptical but but i think you know my my sister coming to traditional world there's some people who work at her museum and other museums who are very much into it she's very much an analog person in general she has you know a radio record player she's just always been around an analog person um and so you know she she works in the film side of the museum but she works 35 millimeter film that's being preserved right so it's i think not it's a big leap from that perspective but i think there's an openness in general from people in the space like what does this really mean and i think there's a responsibility for those of us building to show everyone not just the traditional art world how there's legitimacy and um sort of professionalism and maturity to the space that i think some of the early projects did not have or some of the reputation for scams and phishing understandably leaves people with questions okay ally your aha moment for nfts yeah so for me so curious addies was my path in where i really fell down the rabbit hole in a big way um i found venue's i think it's 20 000 word article about nft 101 uh and in reading that like really went along on his journey of going from an absolute skeptic to being a full believer and for me it was seeing that nfts are really an intersection of brand and community it's a personal brand it's it's choosing something that's representing you in the metaverse on twitter and and your entire digital life uh and choosing something that that represents your values and for me starting to think about the opportunity with the project that that became meta angels was around figuring out what is that brand that i want to represent me um you know for me it's it's around like being a helpful human being uh and opening doors for other people uh with with we spraying in the early days um as i said it was a social product recommendation engine um one of our advisors was alexandra wilkes wilson who's one of the co-founders of guilt and she wrote a book um called by invitation only which was about how they started guilt uh around like in an invitation only platform and you know what she talked about in the book with with her co-founder was that you know people are motivated by wanting to feel altruistic and generous um and also by being able to showcase their expertise uh and it felt like such a great opportunity to leverage that in the nft space to give people an opportunity to be both generous and experts in an area that they were a part of um you know i i was looking around the landscape of tokenization and thinking about all these different things that you could tokenize you know can you tokenize your airbnb can you tokenize a textbook uh and started thinking about tokenizing access and opportunity and just started to see all the potential and i i talk about a lot how i feel like we're looking right now at the invention of the wheel with nfts um that we're still at that stage where it's the pottery wheel which which fun fact is actually the genesis of the wheel um this wheel doesn't even have spokes yet uh and people are just starting to use it to move things around and we haven't started yet to see the higher order uses like thinking about a wheel turning into a gear that's in a wind turbine that's pulling down electricity into batteries but i've got a lot of conviction that that is there and it was really ben's article that helped me start to look more futuristically at the space well i will ask you both and pick your brains extensively i think in this interview about what some of those future exciting uses you think might be for nfts and i think it'll tie into a lot of what meta angels has coming up let's talk about meta angels you started to to get into their alley like what the the core of this project is but give us the the meta angels spiel what is meta yeah yeah absolutely so um so so going back to that idea of tokenizing access and opportunity i have been so fortunate throughout my entire career to have access to these traditionally gated networks that have catapulted my career and my life in so many different ways um so you know going back to the time that i spent working on politics uh and then going to columbia business school and having that alumni network uh you know i went through tech stars and that network has been gold to me and then there's another one that alex and i are part of called the list which is a community of women and tech it's how alex and i met a decade ago and these networks and and um communities have opened up so many doors for me and they're very limited and insular right now and thinking about web 3 and the global nature of it you know the opportunity to to blow the doors and the walls off those traditionally gated networks and give people access uh was just really exciting and interesting uh and it's um it you know got the wheels turning for me you know back in november and uh and we just have continued on this path uh at a really crazy pace as well yeah and so for for folks who are sort of curious about the mechanics of it so meta angels is an nft community membership community um and so you know our members connect with each other ask for help find people in other industries we've seen people get jobs we've seen people you know reach out for technical advice when they're doing something get together to do projects ask for personal advice we've got a parent's channel and folks coming in my one of my favorites was um was a pharmacist giving advice was like it's an over-the-counter meds so i'm going to give you advice but really you should call a doctor um right but being able to go somewhere and i think to ally's point around networks you know i i grew up in france i did not i came here without a lot of networks around and then i went to yale undergrad and then i worked at mckinsey company and then i went to y combinator i have the list for almost any question i have in my life i can turn somewhere and get an answer or connection and that is something that a lot of people who have power and money and who run the world have that's the reality of how a lot of things get done and most people don't and so being able to give people more access and help them succeed i think for me is really motivating how are you guys thinking about finding the people who don't have the networks versus the people already have the networks being maybe more likely to be in web3 and find you guys it's a great question i mean i think one of the things one of the things we did up front was sort of focus on being the people who were living the same values as us and so you know our our gold list which is what we called our pre-sale list um was really focused on giving access to people who are willing to help each other but it could be in any way so you know 20 simply you could be a pharmacist who was giving advice there and you might not you know be able to give business advice over here but this engineer could and and so everyone i think has something to bring to the table um and that's really how we've approached it and as a result you know we've been able to find you know on one side you've got an emmy or two-time emmy-winning writer on the other side you've got someone who knows a ton about civil rights law but who wants to be a screenwriter deep down and those people get to connect but if someone has a question about civil rights law that person has something to offer right and so i think it's really thinking about people as not being sort of just on one side of the table or the other but beyond that and we'll talk about it later i think our lending program is something that we really focused on building out in terms of being able to give access to people whether or not they know someone within meta angels whether or not they they are well connected um and we have we have a teenager in far eastern asia who is building a civics dao who's been lentim at angel right and who now has connections people all over the world so for us i think it's really how do we take people who have a desire to do something right they're not they're not coming here to just you know chat with people on the internet they want to build something with their lives they want to do something they want to you know grow and learn um and and to empower them to do that that that's really what gets me excited in the morning ali i don't know if you have anything you want to add to that where i'm going to go next is to talk about some of the features and and programs you've rolled out already within meta angels that i think are really interesting and the loan program will be one of them do you have anything you want to add on that question of of how you outreach how you sort of market or get folks into your community before i go to that yeah absolutely i would say the lending piece is a really big and important part of it um you know we are we are doing a lot to raise the profile of that lending uh we have some partnerships in the works right now they're going to help bring underrepresented people into the community people who have never bought an nft or are just getting into the space um you know one of the things that's so important for us with lending is that it helps avoid the risk of people getting priced out like the people who could benefit most from the community getting priced out um but it's also a great entry point for people who are web through curious and are not quite ready to spend hundreds of dollars on a jpeg uh but but want to be part of these communities and and want inside access we have seen so many instances of people being loaned an angel and within like 48 hours going out and buying their own uh because it it just clicked for them and as we're thinking about you know onboarding the next million or tens of millions of people into web3 you know it's a mechanism that can be so valuable uh one of the partnerships we're really excited about is with bff um you know we're going to be rolling that out shortly to help bring more women into meta angels and and web 3 in general um we're going to be working with that civic style to help bring in more gen z leaders uh really really excited about all the potential to partner with other organizations to help um to help bring more people inside that's brilliant the fact that the lending program also ends up working obviously as a marketing tool for you all because then people are in there they've tested out the product they're like i love this i don't want to ever lose this i'll go buy one um i wanna let's talk about the lending program it's it is really distinct uh i know i don't know that either of you are technical per se yourselves but i am curious alex is very technical okay i apologize okay great so um is this does it is it sit in escrow how does technically the lending component of this work yeah so we basically built a new function so the wallet the angels actually transferred from the owner's wallet into the borrower's wallet using that function and so if you look at it just on openc right not an etherscan you'll see the angel was here and it was transferred and now it's so i'm loaning to you it was in my wallet it's showing up in your wallet as if you owned it but if you actually look in either scan you sort of look in the underlying code it's actually using a different function it's not transfers function it's our loan function and that all happens on chain um and so the transaction keeps a reference in the contract to the original owner on a mapping it's called tokens owner own loan if anyone's curious and that's what guarantees the later retrieval so essentially the original owner is the only person who can make a move so once it's in your wallet if i've lent it to you you can't sell it you can't transfer it we actually had someone newer to web3 who was a borrower who got so while i got compromised actually over the weekend right as i was getting onto a plane and they couldn't do anything it just you know and so what happened is when we realized what happened that it was you know in this borough's wallet and then the owner went on to our back end and kicked a button and retrieved it and it came back into their wallet safely and so what we wanted to be able to do was allow for the borrower to get all of the upside all the functionality that you would of being a member while keeping the original assets safe for the owner and so it means you can blend it to anyone it can lend it to someone you found on the internet and not worry about whether it's safe or not that has allowed for really opening those doors yeah another fun thing that we incorporated in with the lending um when you lend you get a polygon token that displays your meta angel in a gold frame that says on loan underneath it so you still have that meta angel to display in your wallet um and we see some wallets that just have like a wall of lone meta angels so it's an opportunity again thinking about that personal brand to showcase that you are a person who's really committed to bringing more people into the space right now with the lending program i went on was playing around it looks like you have to have somebody specific already in mind and input the the wallet address of the person you're going to loan to are there thoughts down the line where it's more of a marketplace and you can go find folks who are looking to borrow one and you are looking to loan one and that matchmaking happens yeah it's i mean right now we've got some superstar members of the community facilitating that already we have a lending asks and offers channel where that can happen the reason that we can't just pull them and then share them is exactly that safety you want to have only the owner able to send and retrieve but one of the things that's been so exciting for us is being able to say whether or not you actually know someone if you go to meta-angelsonft.com there's a lending program link you can apply even if you don't have discord or twitter you can apply and say hey here's why i'm interested if you do have discord just come straight into the discord jump into the lending accent offers and we've had people say hey here's who i am i'm a queer artist looking to get into the space i'm a teenager who wants to do a civic style i am a mom at home of four and i don't know much about web3 but i'm really curious my friend told me to come here whatever it is um or i'm an engineer who wants to find mentorship like we found a whole range and people will say great awesome which one of mine would you like to learn like come on in and that has been just incredible um to see people come in so right now you do need that one person um to know you know as an owner who you send it to but we have sort of all of that um infrastructure around it to allow people to come in you also in your discord have this other piece that i think is really distinct which is the browse wishes channel or the the wishes in general and wish fulfillment and seems very core to your mission ali i want to talk about what that is and explain that for folks and and maybe where it came from yeah absolutely so um so you know back to that uh that initial thought about helpfulness and building a community where people had a chance to um to help each other and lift each other up i remember we were sitting one of our advisors meredith perfect um you know sitting on her couch uh with our like initial brainstorming team and we were all talking about like what what is the behavior that we want people to take and what is uh you know what is that offering that we want to put out there and came up with the idea of this of this wishing well repost something that you need and somebody just drops in and says hey i can help you with that um so built it out as a channel where people post their wishes there's a make-a-wish channel there's also a make and offers channel uh and that actually came about because we had community members early on you know when we were still 100 people in discord saying hey there's not a wish i can help with yet but i can help with this other thing is there somewhere i can post that um so the offers that are getting posted are things like hey i'm a professional copywriter if you ever need me to look at something that you've written um or if you need help writing something let me know um we just had one on a career a career coach who was like yeah if anyone wants help and they're like four people were like please i would love a chat but that's it's something amazing yeah yeah meditation coaches therapists like all sorts of people are jumping in with their offers to help uh and you know we are continuing to build infrastructure around that to make it simpler and easier to find things that you can help with you know one of our our core principles is that you know people shouldn't need to live their life in discord uh you know they're there yeah there are a lot of expectations around this being a 24 7 space and that's just not realistic as we're thinking about making the space more accessible to more people people who are busy people have jobs and children and other obligations and really building this out in a way that enables people to drop in for five minutes see something that they can help with and just jump in and roll up their sleeves and do that you know we've talked a lot about the the wishing well being powered by dopamine and altruism uh and like that's the truth it feels really good to do something to help somebody else and we want to take away all of the friction to make that possible have you thought about platforms outside of discord like would you consider it's a good question i i mean i think at the moment moving actually all of chat and the communication off of discord um is asking someone to log into another system right and like given that they already are in discord for so many projects you know the friction there is actually i think worse for the user if it was better for our members we would do it i do think there's things we've already built out on our site so lending is on our site you can download high-resolution pictures they're signed by our artist on the site you can you can print directly high resolution for our partners i think there's room for us to continue to build that out to have things that don't need to be um you know synchronous um and have them there i think there's also and we're gonna be rolling out an email newsletter as well in terms of meeting people where they are for people who want to have here's the weekly recap or you know if there's major drops like we got allow list spots for world of women galaxy if there's people who didn't see it within that 24 000 hour window they might have been disappointed but also you don't want to feel like you need to check discord every 12 hours to make sure you don't miss something so how do we make it possible for people to get oh actually i need to go back to discord this one matters at least to me right now um i think that's another piece but yeah i mean i think there's so much opportunity around this into your point alley around meeting people you know making it easy it's one of the reasons we have the browse wishes channel within the wishing well because make-a-wish is all these conversations of wishes being fulfilled browse wishes is just a list of the wishes made and one of my favorite posts is someone saying every morning i get my coffee and i just browse the wishes see if there's anything i can help with right and some days i can some days i can't but i know what people are asking for i might think of someone um there was a question someone wanted to it was interviewing a discord one an insider you know tip and one person raised their hands my friend works there let me connect you and then ali was able to get an article actually that recruiter recently posted on here's what you need to know about the inside scoop of discord in between those two things that person's all set and then we move on to the next set of wishes do you have a favorite wish that's been fulfilled like a favorite story like oh my gosh this was crazy we never thought this would get fulfilled and hearing so many yeah which one would you say yeah one of the early ones that's that's still my favorite um so um debbie soon who is now one of the co-founders with randy zuckerberg of hug uh you know she posted in discord back in january and i actually i i pulled it up in anticipation of being able to talk about the story um so she posted on january 7th um okay decided to give the wishing well a whirl i'm currently in the process of shutting down my current startup and so i'm on the lookout for my next adventure well i've been invested in crypto for a few years now i've been giving it more serious thought over the past few weeks and i'm reaching a point where my wish would be to go full time into web 3. um so a week later randy zuckerberg saw that wish reached out to her and like here they are a couple months later working on hug together like it's we're seeing so much magic like that happening uh where people are just making these really deep and meaningful connections yeah i it's hard for me to pick just one i'll give some sort i know we've seen a lot of job-related ones we've seen entire teams of nft projects just like hired off of our platform um i think i'm going to talk about some more like more personal life ones that have touched me a lot um we had one sort of burnt out social worker who does really incredible work with indigenous populations just like really like i don't i love my work but it's really draining get immediate support from therapists trauma informed care people who have a lot of experience they're able to just say like hear them give them guidance tell them where to start um when they didn't know where else to turn um we also had someone early on ask if anyone in the community had uh experience going through the divorce of their parents at an adult age and said i have no one i can turn to to talk about this i feel like it's a challenging situation and within less than a day they were connected to several people who were like dm me let's hop on the phone let's chat um and so just especially after the last two years that everyone has had because of the pandemic everything else i think there's a need and a desire for connection and it's harder than ever to know where to turn and so you have your own circles and to use that example you may or may not know if your friends have gone through that or you might not want to tell them about your parents divorce in the middle of it and being able to turn and have a place you can ask for that support or share your deepest desire of changing careers that you haven't told your family about right like that is just a place where people can actually be almost more real than their irl self sometimes and get really meaningful connections but for that you need a place where you feel safe and where you feel there is trust and you feel their support that's not the culture of every project in web3 i think that's been really important to us to cultivate a place where you know you can turn um right now it's it's still in the works but we had someone reach out about a really challenging situation and a bunch of angels just proactively are creating a pro bono project to try and support that person just created a thread where like i can help with engineering i can help with marketing like let's figure out how to help you that for me is the magic but it happens every day so it's hard to pick up hard to pick a favorite i'm imagining the early days of discord when i know this like the gaming days i i have my own i was whatever i had my own history history with discord and this is this is like a beautiful definitely not what discord was necessarily picturing when they launched um in in all beautiful ways going to the the asynchronous comment you made earlier it does feel like the browse wishes could be something that that works very well asynchronously on the website or something and i'm looking forward to the day when whether it's on discord or elsewhere you can filter the kinds of notifications you want like i want to know when allow this spot like opens up and basically don't annoy don't don't ping me for anything else or i want to know when there's a new wish but you know i don't need to know other things right now that's such a missing feature in discord there's actually a project there's someone in our discord who's working on a tool to aggregate and try to use ai on it um it's still early days but i'm keeping an eye on them because i think that's a the tooling in the space it's lacking user experience and web 3 is terrible i mean terrible terrible terrible and for new people coming in it's there's got to be a better way and so and i just genuinely believe you can't build products that make people feel shitty right like it's not a lot it's it's not it's just not a long-term strategy for and web3 is building products that make people feel shitty it's fomo and hype and regret day after day and so i think for us to build a really meaningful you know ecosystem there's got to be something else um a better way and we're trying to you know from our mint process onwards we've tried to do it differently and that said like i am a big believer in building lean and using off-the-shelf tools to and low and no code solutions to listen to your customers understand what the product is that they need and then actually wait and invest in building a product that's based on learnings rather than just your your gut um so like that is one of the things that discord is great for uh that we can see what those behaviors are so we can build out a product and really invest in the thing that is going to meet all of those needs there are other cool things that you have going on like the marketplace i want to get to them but i almost want to go i want to make sure we have a lot of time to to get to the big thing here um maybe ali do you want to talk about what meta angels but also sort of separate from that angels but you all as a team are rolling out very very soon yeah absolutely um so we had a conversation um you know like in the midst of the aftermath environment when we were kind of reflecting back on all the things that we had learned and and what we had figured out along the way um you know we were on the phone with gabe alex and gabe and i were on the phone gabe is our cto it's phenomenally talented engineer um who like just really truly the best i found him in the flower girls discord in december we just struck up a conversation there um way over qualified web 2 engineer who has been like building amazing products for a decade uh and said that he wanted to like experiment in web3 so anyway we were having this conversation i um i went through tech stars alex and gabe both went through yc uh and you know where the conversation evolved was like when is someone going to create the yc tech stars for web3 um and that is our announcement that is what we are doing we are building something called angel labs which is going to help accelerate web 3 projects give them the the skills and tools that they need to really succeed and like achieve our goal of up leveling the space overall yeah and when you think about why combinator and tech stars or you know programs like that really they came about to increase the success rate for startups you know most startups fail most nft projects fail um and what they what they look to do is find the best talent identify those look at a pattern create a cohort and help them be more successful um we think i mean there's hundreds of new people starting projects in this space we want to find the very best ones put them together help them not only learn from each other but also learn we'll talk more about it but through programming or mentors all that and be go from pre you know concept to mint in 10 to 12 weeks i love this i almost am surprised it hasn't been done yet and yet on the other hand this space is really like a year and change old in terms of really having people in it so it shouldn't be that surprising but of course it moves so incredibly fast i'm curious for this first cohort you're really specifically looking at nft projects it's not about broader web 3 or other tokens why did you decide to keep it sort of narrowly around folks building with nfts and do you see in the future it may be expanding yeah i mean i think we wanted to start with things that were nft enabled but it doesn't mean that it's a 10k pfp drop i think we're thinking much much more expansively than that um but given that that is where we have today not just the expertise and the mentor base but also a tech stack to go along with it something we can talk about but you know what we're seeing is that people working on nft projects are all reinventing the wheel they are all these different solidity engineers are writing the same smart contract sometimes been better or worse code they're all making the same art generation tools they're all doing the same mint sites and all of that is just to get you to the day you start right like your mint is not the end the mint is the beginning of building a business and so we want to be able to help people sort of get over that hump and learn all the insights and you know a lot of these teams either are have not had the business background but have incredible web 3 or art or other sort of backgrounds that are really really compelling and you just need that business up leveling of hey you should probably incorporate you're going to have to pay taxes here's how you hire people by the way contracts matter like a lot of stuff that that we've done over the last decade or seasoned operators who are like okay well what's this web3 thing and so how can we help the really most talented and compelling projects leapfrog um but it doesn't have to be in the same model that we did certainly we are looking for people who push the envelope so we push the envelope on our art we push the envelope on lending we want to see how other projects push that envelope i really want to dive in on what you're looking for maybe some hypothetical examples of where you would fit into a project but but first ali maybe if you can explain where you see this fitting into this broader ecosystem of education and growth you mentioned hug earlier they're doing mentorship and a bit of a program where does this fit into the the broader space yeah absolutely so um there is such a broad spectrum right now of education and support um you know where you've got projects like addie's that are showing people the nuts and bolts of minting an nft uh and zen academy to learn how to evaluate projects so those are from the consumer side um and then you know group hug which is elevating and accelerating post mint growth stage projects you know you've got nifty gateway that is helping establish artists enter the space there's a really exciting new resource um that is coming out from our mutual friend zenika with his mass academy class to help people really understand and learn how to launch an nft you know from his year of experience watching all these projects launched um and and what we're doing and where we fit in is that we're bringing in tried and true web 2 accelerator infrastructure to what right now really is the wild west we are delivering a comprehensive program that accelerates talented founding teams and lets them focus on what is really unique about their project yeah and over the 10 to 12 weeks we've got basically four prongs of this sort of cohort based learning we've got sort of the business operations piece we've got the community and marketing piece we've got the sort of art um our generation piece and then we've got the engineering and security and thinking about those are things that you are going to need to master and you are probably going to be stronger in two if you're lucky three of them um but not all four and here's the path that you can go through and we will help you along the way it's really hands-on tactical um and also and ally should talk about the mentor program i mean bringing in people who really know their stuff um to be able to help you leapfrog and i mean why see every week we'd have an incredible person come in and give us behind the scenes off the record info that really was impactful and thinking about how you built your your startup but you also had the other founders around you that we're learning and that you could bounce ideas off of this is a space that can actually be quite isolating despite being collaborative and going minting at the same time as other people learning from them um is actually also a huge upside in addition to all the programming and everything else so in terms of how this will actually work for somebody going through the program i think of a yc is like summer camp for like really cutthroat you know entrepreneurs who are just like in it and around each other all the time and seeped in this and present presenting and mentorship whatever and it's very intense and i know they have the weekly meetings where they bring in zuckerberg or you know whoever mark not randy but you know and different people um who are advising folks is that what you're picturing here is this full-time super immersive is it more flexible how does it how does it work from that standpoint yeah so for my i mean go ahead ali yeah so i was gonna say so so yes in that web 3 is full-time and immersive like i have worked in politics where you know leading up to a campaign it's like 20 hours a day i have built a business i have never worked as hard as i have over the past four months in web3 that like it is relentless it is seven days a week it is 20 hours a day um and you know like we know that the companies that are going to succeed in the space are going to be putting in that time and that energy i want to be really realistic about what it takes to launch a project successfully um you know our expectation is not that they're engaging with us in all of that time um but they're able to lean on us in that time and you know you talked about about yc i'm the i'm the tech stores maxie in the group um you know i went through tech stars almost 10 years ago i've been mentoring uh for almost five years now uh and it's it's a different more collegial less cutthroat environment that is really around building small cohorts you know 10 to 12 companies that have a pool of hands-on mentors that are working with them closely one-on-one and that is the model that we're going for not all of the mentors in our program will be doing that type of engagement some of them will be coming in and doing fireside chats and and leading master classes but we've got a pool right now of 30 really amazing mentors and we're just getting started and building it um so we have people like zenika we have people like keith grossman we have randy we have you which we're so excited about um and uh and you know it's going to be a mix of that one-on-one mentorship and you know being available for ad hoc questions um being able to talk to other founders in the space like will and and cass from the littles or ben and mai from addie's uh about some of the challenges and pitfalls that they saw or like how did you think about lore how did you think about your smart contract how did you think about teaching how to people teaching people how to mint who are new to the space are you an llc are you a c corp how did you where did you put your eath after you minted is it a multisig what did you end up doing do you have an institutional account with coinbase how do you pay people like there's all of these logistical questions and there's not actually a right answer for some of them there's a range of choices and so having access to a lot of really great people um is useful and to your question around time commitment i think companies who go through the program should expect about two to three hours of structured programming um and then one-on-one mentorship per week plus the ad hoc help and access to you know experts as they need we know running a company and preparing for mint is a full-time job so it's not school but what it is is saying okay between these four you know biz ops art community and marketing and then engineering you're going to have all of these scheduled things and you know that we're going to talk about art generation and rarity up front and we're going to talk about incorporation and those things up front and then we're going to talk about discord setup and as we get closer to mint we're going to talk about discord security and you know like all of these different pieces so that you know you're getting the right info at the right time um and 10 to 20 you know 10 to 12 weeks later you're going to be ready to mint now not everyone will mint on the same day that would be bad gas wars are bad but it's not a demo day from that perspective but we expect that between the back half of our mint and you know a month after mint almost all of those are gonna in that window um which is which is like being ready you know we did it in two months basically you know beginning to end um and it's possible but having the resources makes it a lot easier so the goal to take a project really from concept strong concept to mint over the course of this 10 to 12 weeks and then and i hope i'm not i think this is appropriate for me to say i did talk to randy zuckerberg and what they're doing with group hugs she's like it almost feels like it could be a feeder because they're working with slightly later stage projects so there's so we talk about this ecosystem that's being built out i think there's something really awesome there about you all being close to each other and sort of i think there's definitely upside to them being able to see both as mentors and also just you know in the space getting to see the companies coming out of it i know they're focused exclusively on women so some of the companies may not be a fit for them since we're sure we're looking more broadly but being able to think that there is something for pre-med there is you know a postman you know program over here um and here's all the different things that you can do i think it's good that the space is maturing and professionalizing um there's a lot of incredible people in the space who are advising companies for quite a large percentage of mint that give a very narrow slice of value and that may be what some projects need is they just need help on the technical side or they just need help on the marketing side but most projects need help across the board um and so being able to make sure that the companies are successful you know with every piece of that which you need all that to be in lockstep um is really important to us ali you should try cheryl as well at some point yeah absolutely so so kelland yeah um so cheryl kellond is the managing director of angel labs um no meta angels is a um is a sponsor of angel labs um but we are gonna continue alex and i and gabe are gonna be continued day-to-day focus on operations of men angels so we brought in this phenomenally talented serial entrepreneur she's been a tech stars um she's been mentoring um she is a mama four she is a three-time iron man like she is the badassiest badass i have ever met uh and you know when we first started talking this about this idea like i immediately thought like this is who we need to run this uh so we are so excited to have her leading the charge on it she has built out this curriculum and is continuing to develop it uh and um you know the companies that are participating in the class are just so lucky to have the chance to work with her as well as those incredible mentors yeah and it's also important you know for us to take angel up seriously it needs to be run full-time by a team and for us to take media angels seriously we need to be giving our full attention and so ali and i are not the type of people to do an after-school special for anything that we do we give a hundred and you know ninety seven percent of the 100 we have to give um and so this was a way for us to make sure that it's going to be an excellent program but of course we'll be mentoring of course we'll be involved in um but that has the full attention to be a you know breakaway success um while we continue to grow and evolve meta angels how does this benefit meta angel holders and the meta angel community great question yes i can't believe we didn't get to this yet so there's two major benefits to angel holders um the first is that their meta angel itself will act as an access pass to angel lab projects so not every project will interest every member we also you know some projects may end up minting 500 because it's a different type of collection right not 10k so you know there's a lot of range in what that will mean but it will be greater access to these handpicked teams and these mints than if you were not a holder um and that it will just be an immediate benefit to our um to our community and you know we're big proponents of listing to our users one of our earliest surveys showed that one of the things people wanted was access to quality teams and mints especially because our community is a range of people who are actually deep in web3 and are all connected and can get on you know wow g's list and people who are not at all um that level of access is important to them and something we wanted to deliver the other thing is that any meta angels folder who applies will at least get a first round interview so they can pitch live um which is a big deal we expect this to be very competitive we expected from so far we've already had you know without us having announced it have people who have come to us for advice we're like this is a perfect feeder and these are the kinds of companies we want to be talking to um but you know and and cheryl and the team there will have independence in picking the projects they believe will be the best of the best but being able to pitch live in addition to the application is a real upside and i know we have a lot of builders in our community um so that is something we wanted to be able to deliver is give them that extra sort of umph in the application plus access to the broader community um and i i expect there will continue to be more sort of symbiosis between the two um as we help really rise up the the quality projects yeah and that's so within our community we have collectives where people can opt in to participate in focused conversations that are really targeted toward their interest and the one that is most active and has the most members is our nft builders and founders collective um so you know knowing that uh in combination with the fact that so many of our members were really passionate and enthusiastic about access to quality projects it just it just made natural sense um that it really is a continuation of the work that we were doing early on with meta-angels to help advance the space bring in lending and and really just help continue to foster innovation you described two examples of folks you think are well suited for this program one is experienced operators and then the others experienced artists who presumably are sort of missing the sort of opposite piece to the to the other in some way potentially though maybe both need help with web3 to break this down a little bit more specifically do you have some hypothetical examples of the kinds of projects or you know you said going beyond maybe just the 10k pfp type project that you guys would be really excited to see yeah so so to give some examples of real companies that that we have been talking to and that cheryl has had conversations with in the last week alone um so you know one example access to educational projects that or products that go beyond web3 um so there is a product in our pipeline that has a real estate investment fund and a cohort based learning program to teach people how to move into multi-family real estate investing so the nft becomes an access pass to the learning and it accrues benefits of the holder is also part of that investment trust um you know another example that we we haven't yet talked to but is one of the things that's on my mind like imagine a language learning app where you get access to a community of others who are learning alongside you so you know there's the the kind of web three enabled learning communities um you know there are loyalty based subscriptions and gift cards to real life products and services like the board breakfast clubs coffee subscription is a great example of one that is doing that really well right now um you know early access online tools and services what we're seeing right now heavily in the space is online tools and services that give you access to nft projects or enable you to track your portfolio um so like apes together floor premiums launching one soon um but imagine the potential for so many other services like imagine buying an nft that you redeem for concierge travel services or an nft that you use to have someone build out you know photo books for you um like so many things where we can bridge that real life and web 3 in a way that's really compelling yeah i mean people are paying subscriptions in web 2 all the time whether you know they're getting varied amounts of um sort of value from and the thing that's incredible than nft so you can buy it once you can get all the benefits and if you no longer need it there is a market for it right and so like that sort of complete changes completely changes the paradigm i think there's a lot of also just thinking about the on-ramps for sort of very powerful web 2 communities and how they come onto web3 is very interesting to us um for non things that that make sense with an nft layer um but where you can tap into an existing computer i think a lot of brands have done it poorly um in terms of just trying to say like we're just going to slap a 10k collection on and like just say that we're going into web3 versus really listening to your user and figuring out what the use case is um there's media companies in our pipeline there's you know an existing vertical community of latino women in business that's looking to use an nft as an access pass um projects with different takes on sort of what they're looking to accomplish with it and i think it's been interesting to see whether it's you know from gaming to to sort of how people have tokenized nfts to how you think about um you know taking something that's actually very physical whether it's real estate and seeing a lot of people thinking about that translation um it's we are really if you are listening to this and you have an idea and you think it's pushing the envelope we want to hear about it this is the short version do you all provide funding or what are pathways to funding in addition to the the mentorship style resource and the you know help with your smart contract all that really important dev and otherwise support i mean we have a lot of people who want to invest venture or angel in the space if that is the question like we certainly can make many many connections people looking to fund companies in the space um and and expect that to also be a feeder which is you know if of the x companies in our cohort this many are looking for funding who would you like to talk to that's certainly something that we'll be able to help with our networks um and i think it's it's some of it is figuring out a lot of nft projects right now are saying we make money from selling you know nfts in a mint and then we have royalties and that's our model and that model is simplistic right like that's unless you are able to continue to to move volume and some some projects can more than others and some projects should more than others then you don't have a long long-term sort of play when i think about runway the same way as you do at a startup in web 2 how many months do you have how many years do you have what's your income and if you're completely dependent on secondary sales you don't control your future and so i think that the companies are really thinking in an interesting way about what that means for revenue then it's not just another derivative drop like that for me is where it gets really interesting and i think where it becomes true businesses um and we're looking for businesses how are you all thinking about that quickly jumping back to meta angels in terms of sustained revenue sustaining the project as a business yeah i mean there's definitely obviously sort of secondary sales is a piece of it we've thought about it in terms of how we spend our mint i think we get a lot of questions like you've sold this much right you have this much in your coffers and we're like well that's not two months worth of spend right like that is making sure that we can build for the for the long term um obviously there's partnerships and work and things in the works that could be revenue driving outside of just selling nfts um and then there's sort of whether it's through angel labs or other things or sort of other projects that can then have a benefit back into meta angels to let it continue to grow from a revenue perspective i want to ask this and you all we can cut it out if if there's any reason you wouldn't be comfortable talking about this but so my understanding is that seven percent of the mint proceeds for projects that go through this program will go to meta angel labs so that's that's how the lab funds itself is through that fixed seven percent take from the initial mint did i say that correctly yes yes is there an equity component to this let i think about i think techstars and nyc you guys can tell me are entitled to a certain percent of equity of the projects moving forward would have been easy for you guys to take some sort of recurring royalty but i didn't see you mention that i would love to hear yeah i mean so i think the thing is with within web 2 when you take this sort of equity you're sort of waiting to to get the payout later and and you're making that bet early on right when you're taking a percentage of mints we're doing here because the model is different we get to to participate in the success that we contributed to i think you know when we thought about equity components or more of the sort of secondary sale of royalties side of it um we thought about the model certainly a lot of people suggested it to us um for me just at the end of the day taking a percentage of secondary cells felt exploitative uh you know that we will have a real hand in identifying great teams and helping their mint succeed but if six months or a year later they do something in our breakout success and they have you know huge secondary trading volumes that will not be in great part thanks to us it will be maybe that we identified a great team and helped them launch but i'm a founder myself we are founders myself if i put myself in their shoes it's a deal i would not want to take and so it was important to us that the value and the values be aligned which is we're going to help you take off and we will take a percentage of what we're able to contribute but go and sort of grow this um and we'll be you know hopefully have happy holders of those projects um but taking a percent of secondary sales i don't know i think it's not i i don't want to see the space be exploitative and i think there's a lot of room for that to happen um so we wanted to set the stage there and to alex's earlier point like mint is the starting line like we are getting projects to the starting line um you know one of the things that really is amazing about the mft space is that it does not take a lot to get a project off the ground financially um that you can bootstrap these projects to mint and then um and then in many cases defer a lot of your expenses until after mint uh and you know the thing that's so different about what we're doing to a techstar zero yc you know they're investing in these companies with their time and their resources that might see liquidity 10 years later you know we are looking at a space where there is immediate liquidity that we can then take and reinvest in the next batch of projects so really using it immediately to fuel continued growth in the space and continued innovation that like that's the thing that's getting us out of bed in the morning on this have you all considered setting up like a meta angel vault where the projects that mint you have the products that go through the lab and mint a few of them go into this vault and then meta angel holders have some sort of fractional share of that vault i've seen this model now playing out i interviewed somebody who's doing that uh carlini's doing it with penelope's seemed like it could be a natural fit here yeah it's something we're considering i think our focus right now is how we can sort of accelerate those learnings of web3 and sort of innovate on the next gen use cases i think what we will see is coming out of the first cohort what have we learned from that what is working for the the projects we went through and what makes sense especially as we start thinking a little bit more broadly than just nft enabled projects what's the right model but we always want that to be aligned like we said earlier right like we want to make sure that yes we will we will have put a lot in to help people be successful but at the end of the day they're the ones driving their projects so the exact model i think will continue to refine just as the space continues to be refined but for this first pass um it made sense for us to just do a percentage of men and keep it clean i know you all have just launched so you're you're just trying to get the the initial program up and running but this excites me because it's it's a concept that like gets my imagination spinning i've had a couple of these i mentioned it was story verse where i'm just like oh my mind goes to all the interesting places you guys could expand into with something like this so i have to to ask in a year in two years where would you want and let's do both both meta angels to be and then made it meta angel labs to to be as programs yeah so i think i mean we want to help the space progress quickly right like we want i think right now seasoned operators are held back by learning just the raw logistics of the space um we're going to keep evolving our model to pull companies forward i think you know the opportunities we talked about to move beyond nfts for sure is on our mind um but i think about you know a year from now for for angel labs i wanted to be the program that companies were doing something really innovative want to be a part of because they think it increases their chance of success it gives them access they wouldn't have otherwise they have a built-in network i mean to this day i can turn to y combinator and send a question and that's the founders of thousands of companies in every possible space being able to go and jump into the angel lab discord and chat with other founders who went through past cohorts who are now you know big you know players in the space like i want that to be something that other people get a chance to get access to and that it also continues to reflect innovation pushing the envelope diversity in the space um and just the best teams right like i think that's there is a lot of signal a lot of noise in web3 and i think there's a lot of talent as well and so if there's something that we've done for 10 years let's hire really talented people and identify great people to partner with and work with um we're excited to sort of bring that eye and and cheryl's eye to be able to really have phenomenal phenomenal teams that we're working with and that's for us it's fun right um and it and it's mutually beneficial i think you know rising tide lives all votes we are about collaboration transparency access in the space and so i want to see that shift the paradigm a bit yeah and on the meta angel side you know we're building a premier brand um like this is the brand that we want people to put forward to convey their values and showcase who they are and and what they believe in and who they want to be in the world um while also building the most valuable membership community period full stop um and you know that really is a focus on the met angel side and and there is um such a strong dovetail into what we're doing with angel apps because of that i guess the last crucially important question on the lab's piece and then if you have a few more minutes we'd love to to go back to meta angels uh how do people apply and what is that process going to look like for folks who want to get involved in in the lab yeah so applications open uh monday april 4th um might be tomorrow it might be two days from now depending on when this airs except it will be the monday after this airs the monday after this airs um and so people can go they apply they'll be in sort of interview process selection process run by cheryl and the team um but you know they'll be about i think two weeks worth and ally i don't think the exact date um april 18th in true web3 fashion we are running this like a bullet train um and is this is it like go to like medi are you guys meta angels dot io what's your we'll we'll put it in not that you have to vote yeah it's um it's angel dash labs dot io um and uh we'll tweet it from all sorts of different places yes um but uh but going there there'll be the application details will be details on the program they'll be the actual application itself um and then you know once the applications have closed we'll be running the interviews selecting the cohorts and then kicking off in may i mean it's like right away let's go these are teams that are already working they shouldn't stop working keep going let's jump right in um and that means it's really looking for you know june july type time which is not so far not at all uh do you worry at all ally do you worry about like a a bear market coming or some major crash a la you know 2000 the internet everything goes to nothing right as you're starting to kick this off i think it's something that everyone who has even a dollar invested in the space uh loses some sleep about um and short-term it you know of course it's a possibility uh the market right now is driven almost exclusively by supply and demand of jpegs uh not any underlying fundamentals like it is quant trading purely quant trading uh and i know that you and i share an interest in value investing and the idea of looking deeply to determine the actual worth of an asset and i've got conviction that the nft space is going to get to a place where we are able to do so uh and when it does that's where we're going to see a lot more stability in the market and less volatility so quality projects with real innovation and utility is going to rise and we want to be behind those teams wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into the multi-chain universe ahead of us available on flo tesos polygon and of course ethereum wearable is the perfect place for nft newcomers profile picture collectors and experienced nft traders wearable has a variety of nft features that set it apart from other nfc marketplaces they have a native messaging function allowing you to dm your friends or haggle with sellers they also have a mobile app on ios and android with a built-in nft portfolio tracker tool so you can easily check the value of your digital art portfolio wearable is built on the wearable protocol a multi-purpose open source and community governed nft protocol that helps build products and services across the nft ecosystem including white label marketplaces tailored to specific nft communities so go to rareable.com and start discovering and trading nfts putting in floor biz to join pfp communities and dm with some brand new internet friends if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect poaps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamask.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 okay back to meta angels for a like maybe like call it a rapid fire round of a couple things i want to talk with y'all do you have 10 more minutes here for us to do it love it okay like we need to get to it i know that my favorite kind this is why i love podcasts i love long form um we didn't get to talk about it earlier the marketplace you all have launched a meta angels branded marketplace in collaboration with wearable you were their launch partner uh tell folks why this felt like an obvious win to you how did you end up as wearables launch partner what's exciting to you about this yeah so the the rarefield team reached out to us not long after a mint about working together in some way um and that ended up growing into this deeper partnership i think they were looking to build upon wearable protocol to launch this new and exciting white label marketplace and they were looking for a project that was really community centric um and i had the experience to pull this off in a short time frame i mean i think the custom build across time zones was in like less than three weeks maybe two two weeks um yeah i got to play pr had a product again which is a role i've had i've worn many times um product managing and keywaying and working with their engineers and their their team is great and so you know for us it was really we had already been thinking about some of the functionality that's not easily available on openc or other platforms how do we sort of align incentives um around buying and selling and what that means for community um and so we had been thinking about things we might be building in the future and when they reached out we were like we're interested here are some of the things we'd want to build into it and they were super aligned um and so it sort of turned into this early conversation and then them turning to us and saying will you be our exclusive launch partner in approximately 14 days including weekends we're like great let's do it absolutely that's the timeline we work on yeah and it's gone so far well how has it gone i mean we've seen some of these new marketplaces that launch struggle to because open c is what we're used to as consumers i'm i'm sure it's probably slow to some extent i mean it's early days it's it's less than a weekend it's really early days i think the response from the community has been fantastic i mean we have less than seven percent of our collection listed there's actually not you know the the the volume actually listed in general is low for this for this um this project but you know what's been really a high response rate has been having a win-win marketplace right where transactions both put more money in the pockets of sellers so it's lower fees it's 2.2 total instead of 2.5 so it's more money in the in the pockets of people who are selling but in classic meta-angels fashion um a quarter of that actually goes back into our community right so rarible really worked with us to make sure that their fees were low enough that we could put 0.5 percent of all the transactions listed on our marketplace back into our angel grants and our angel grants for a quick segue are these notes that's the next fat rapid response question yeah so the grammar program tell us 0.25 in the pocket of one meta-angel holder every week we're announcing the next one i think tomorrow um and it is a no strings attached grant you apply for anything that would have a meaningful impact in your life it could be personal it could be professional we've had people apply to to go visit their grandmother they haven't started since covid uh they haven't seen this coach to pay off medical debt to pay for certification to change their career to buy art supplies like whatever it might be it is you apply you are in the database and every week we give 0.25 youth away um and to help make people's lives better with this marketplace the goal is really over time to have more and more money in that fund so we can do either more grants bigger grants or both and letting that be fueled by the community as we grow is just such a testament to sort of how we like to think about giving back i love it and and you guys are impressed an impressive team because i know everything feeds into everything else this marketplace has features that feed into things that feed into the grant so i know there's there's things you don't want to say and can't say just yet but um it all ties together i think you guys are just thinking i see the way that our i think it's part of it's how our brain works part of it is thinking about you know products and things that layer upon each other we we want everything to be part of a greater whole right and for everything that we're building to be incremental value and to make sense versus it being a scatter plot of spaghetti thrown against the wall and i think especially in a space where there's so much demand for attention and announcements and newness and alpha where you're seeing people tweet like the fact that they're on a panel is alpha and i'm like guys we have got to get away from this world right building things of quality like it's you can we can do a bunch of small announcements we can do giveaways we can do a dollar that we can do all day long building things that are quality building products that actually deliver value can be done in two weeks but like not always right and also what's the next product and does it make sense built on top of that and is it strategically aligned and so um i think for me what i love about what we're doing is that there are just so many layers we're just getting started in how this all feeds together and how our values right of generosity transparency and accessibility are built into every product that we do and connect to each other um that's part of the fun for me like as a product builder like that i cannot wait for people to see where we are in six months ally somebody there was a mention of lord i hear mention of lore in angels is that a whole other vertical here that is coming no more things i can't talk about the lord no no no no um so i remember the episode where you and zenika talked about how much potential there really is in the space around world building and storytelling um and it like went straight to my heart because i actually after college i got an mfa in fiction writing of all things um that i'm quite yeah of course yeah you guys are people who like you dig deeper into your career and you've had like six of them you know one of my friends jokes is like it's been like eight years that you like you haven't launched a new career like guess what i'm gonna go into nfts but um but on the lower side with meta angels you know we um you know we talked about those values and how we really wanted to weave those values into everything that we were doing um so came up with the idea to give each of our angels of focus like it's an angel of blank um an angel of innovation an angel of sunsets an angel of ecology uh so we used a i to generate 10 000 unique angel descriptions um the thing about ai is that it is very very good it is a beautiful writer in so many ways it is sometimes nonsensical or a total downer uh defensive or offensive occasionally offensive um that was actually much less frequent than a downer um you know first like we had to tell the ai to be uplifting and hopeful and positive in order to have it not say things like you know like you are an angel of calm you soothe the troubled souls who are like crippled by blah blah blah like it was it was pretty yeah it was dark yes in some in some places christian anderson over uh whatever disney movie version exactly um so like that was a really big part of what we were doing my brother's grandmother did i just mix that up sorry i'm still thinking about that but the last point i just made okay yeah um there's no like happy ending and and all those there are happy endings for all of the angels we got to a place where they were all uplifting and we had a qa squad of more than 100 people who read each and every single angel it's description equivalent of editing four novels and they and this team of a hundred plus members on our team on our in our in our community in secret because this is of course a surprise for reveal because we love surprises and we love extra little details um in secret over about two weeks edited four books worth of descriptions around the clock because it was a global team um and led to this so if you go to you know go to metanglesnft.com go to our marketplace look up an angel click on it it will tell you what it is an angel of if you want a specific one you can search for an angel of love there's an angel of parents of teenagers there's an uh angels of sarcasm which are amazing the fallen angels have like real attitudes which is great um and then some of them you know gabe's angels and angel of engineering one of my favorite lines okay so your wings shimmer with the brilliance of computer code reflecting the power of technology that you embody that was ai i mean that's terrifying that that's on the subject of what alex was saying about like everything having a greater purpose those angels are angels of that for uh for a purpose um we haven't rolled that out yet but um but certain angels will have special attributes characteristics participation in the community upside and the benefits um that's part of the fun is there's over 500 types of angels and some of them will get to be extra smash they remind it's like archangels you know and and right sort of don't our archangels have their their age we have our things okay i love this because and i've said this i think a number of times on the show i've always historically been more of like a words person than a visual person you know i love songs and lyrics and so when i can pick a thing based less on the art and more on the story or the name like that gets me excited so i actually i i realize i did know you guys had these pieces but i didn't know they were for all of them i'm gonna go check what my meta angels stories are you know what they're we had someone recently we had someone recently buy an angel i think it was with diamond wings and it was an angel of riches and they were like i had to get this one absolutely yeah i deserve this i think one of the things that's great as well is when people think about we talk about identity right so we're as far as i know the first collection to do the full range of race and gender without coding gender in so we don't have you know female angels and male angels for all genders but what we did was really create this variety for people to find themselves and that's reflected in the lore as well right there's angels of writing there's angels of um there's one there's someone who minted who's i think a surgeon or a doctor works definitely works something surgery related um who got an angel of skill they talked about how about the like miracles they performed with their hands and they were like this was like meant to be there's teachers who found so i think there's whether you're gifting it or buying it for yourself i do think identity and brand is a big part and it's part of what makes you feel connected um and feel represented didn't seem and so i think that's been excited for exciting for me to see what people look for and find and and share on social media and within our discord uh within our discord a lot of people have replaced their traditional discord names with like name angel of blank um so we have like lauren angel of language and amelia angel of spreadsheets um so it's really um really exciting to see people really embrace that as part of their identity um we had someone who was like angel of snuggles um and that was her name for a while we with 500 unique ones we like really went out on a limb with what some of the angels represented ali where did the name meta angel come from yeah so um so going back to that um that evening and sitting around on a couch um and talking about like what is the brand and representation that you would want to represent you um that is gender neutral um that is um really signaling your values you know we and and signals that idea of helpfulness and you know delivering on other people's needs um you know the first thing we actually kind of tossed around was this idea of a fairy godmother like we wave a logic magic wand and like make someone's dreams come true uh obviously that is gendered um and we weren't gonna go in that direction but like that very same night like early that morning we were talking about this idea of an nft project um and by like 6 p.m we had a domain uh and it was met at angels so in that true rapid fire nft iteration path um you know we we landed on the name really really quickly uh and the idea is like just someone who is delivering upon your needs like coming in and helping you with with that thing that um that that you most need support on and a guardian yeah exactly yeah we have a lot of guardian angels um that's one of the tropes of angels that we have within the collection the other thing i'd say is i think one of the things that's always sort of as a secondary thing appeal to me is there's this idea of sort of the better angels of our nature right that there's good in humanity that people um i mean the number of people who are like why would someone want to help someone else like you're clearly not the target for this community and that's that's okay like you're completely asking that question if that's your question 3 is such a transactional space right now right there's plenty of really beautiful communities being built but a lot of people who are in it to flip it who are in it to and not to say that having financial motivations is not a good thing there's plenty of reasons to get into web3 but this idea that you could want to help people just to help people for some folks was a like oh i didn't realize that you could like mint out in 48 hours with 93 participation on your mint list based on wanting to help people and we're like yeah there's a lot of people out there who the better angels right when you think about and what does it mean to push this space to be more human more helpful more collaborative more impactful right i mean of all the stuff like getting on an allow list is great and there's many positive things about it and we certainly do those things as well but i think that impacting people's real lives matters right and so i the way i think about what we're building oftentimes is before anyone ever sells an angel i want them to get more than their money's worth from the connections they get from the knowledge from the partnerships we have from the products we're building from our where we have you know exclusive member programming that's going to be coming up from discounts for all the different things that we build that's what it's why it's a membership right that while you're here you're getting value not just when you leave like i think it's such from going back to building products i think it's really weird to build communities where the value is leading right [Laughter] yeah yeah there's another metaphor there i'm trying to think what it is but i i'll come up with it once it's too late yeah and alex you know she talked about how we meant it out in 48 hours 50 52 hours sorry and two days two long days well it was because we had our silver list which is another whole story and sideline but um but one of the things that also really contributed to the enthusiasm that we saw behind it was the phenomenal phenomenal art from serana hayata uh who is just the most prolific and spectacularly talented artist i have ever encountered we met her in early december um and it came to her with this concept of a a non-binary angel that wouldn't have any traits that were tied to gender that would be racially racially representative across the full spectrum and also was capital a art um and that's a tall order to come through with and she did it uh in like six weeks we had every trait and it was like 400 plus traits what's so spectacular and and ali you highlighted this to me at one point and then i started looking at the collection more deeply is like you can't it's not just like oh they're gender neutral or like it's it's truly like you look at it and you're like that could be like you can see anything in it like it almost shape shifts depending on your perspective as you're looking at it you're like maybe that's a you know male or maybe that's a cool woman or like it's really interesting how the art like breathes in that way around sort of gender and identity so you guys have done a really good job with that it's one of the things as well as you know i think we we took on and again in classic us fashion decided to be overachievers and take on more of a challenge than we needed to but because we wanted to push what could be done with the art here i think it's something we're excited about when we think about angel labs as well is like what are the ways in which people are pushing the envelope and there's plenty of very good you know cartoon style pfps or pixelated pfp's out there and then it can be very compelling what else can we do right like and i think especially as we think about more people taking nft seriously one of our goals from at angels and i think we very much hit the mark here is that if an angel was on the wall at a museum or a gallery you wouldn't say oh it's because this is an nft that sold for a million dollars you'd say oh wow what beautiful art and then you'd read the card and go holy  it's an nft right like being able to turn that and be like in in of itself it stands for something um and so what else are what other ways are people going to push the envelope and some of that might mean it's not 2d there might be other other ways that people are still experimenting but it's very cool to think about where the space can go and um and what people are going to do next and i really encourage people listening to this to not just replicate what they're seeing that's not going to be success in this space and that's not how this space is going to grow broader topical slash general question i'd love to to get your guys thoughts on is actually social media strategies and specifically instagram and where you see instagram going with nfts obviously the energy has historically been with twitter you had mark zuckerberg announced that there'll be an nft integration in instagram and in some ways instagram is the more sensible platform for all of this because it is art and it is visual i think i i'll be curious i mean i think you guys have done such a beautiful job of offering a different kind of a project and i i think it appeals to a broader range of people than than uh what historically has maybe been in this space and i think instagram has that potential too of just bringing new people into nfts folks who aren't hanging out on twitter long preamble to a question but you're hiring a social media person i think i saw that on your jobs board yeah how do you think about social media and maybe instagram specifically or where do you where do you see all this evolving yeah so i mean social media it's it's right now aside from discord it's the primary channel for communication like it's so critically and crucially important uh and in thinking about instagram it's actually one of our community members debbie uh who eventually joined hugg um she came to us early on in like december and said i think you guys need to have an instagram strategy and she took up the reigns of that and just volunteered to help us with that uh and early on was creating really great informational content and instagram stories to help onboard new people and as we're thinking about making the space more inclusive bringing in more women bringing in more people who are underrepresented who aren't living their lives on twitter um like that's a channel that's going to be so so important um you know to your point about it being visual content so um it's so compelling and just scrolling through the grid of the meta angels instagram it's one of the things i was sending people early on when i was trying to explain to them what we were doing and what we were trying to achieve with the art uh you know it's gonna be a big part of our strategy moving forward um particularly as we're thinking about the lending and bringing in those people who are not traditionally involved um and you know with the the potential around stories i think that's where we could see a lot of that and really being able to do more it's not quite long-form content but things that are that are not just a caption an image uh things that are more interactive yeah i think so too i think and it's also a place where the the art that's more compelling will definitely get have a leg up on a platform like instagram i do think you know despite what what sort of meta and and and um sort of facebook and instagram have announced they have some work to do before it can really be a platform to turn to for this i mean if you use an nft hashtag on instagram it is like instant bots instant bots instant bots um given already all the issues with scamming and phishing that's happening on discord and on twitter you want to add that to instagram where it's potentially less sophisticated nft familiar folks i think they're going to need to really do a better job and they've not traditionally been good at that so that i think the one caveat in the space is it is such an opportunity and yet i think doing it you know the platform itself will have to live up live up to that opportunity because folks aren't just going to pull out a credit card and buy something on instagram right now that's not how it works and they're not going to do an nft before they you know buy a lululemon pair of pants and we see we see so much fraud happening in discord where like there are the dm scams all those pieces um and the people in discord are at a kind of higher level of sophistication around nfts though still hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars are being scammed for people every single day um on instagram right now because of the velocity of picking up some followers there are like a dozen accounts for crypto mom right now who's one of the advisors to boss beauties uh you know i talk to her about it all the time that a new one pops up all the time some of them have more followers than her actual account um and they're just there to scam people and like she hasn't been verified um there isn't a quick and easy way for those accounts to be taken down like there are a lot of of security measures that need to be put in place before instagram really feels like a safe place to talk about nfts final thoughts any advice you share we want to share with folks thoughts about the labs meta angels things we didn't get to i know we've already run we've run long unsurprisingly because we all have so much to share and wisdom you know on my side you know we talk a lot about elevating the space maturing the space helping take it to the next level and you know we've talked about how this is a 24 7 expectation right now around nfts i think one of the places where there is so much potential and and we can see teams take real leadership is around backing away from that um really looking at the human side of the space helping founders understand what they're signing up for when they jump into an nft project um the relentless messages um and when utility posts uh and you know not yeah and not only um not only helping prepare founders for that but really trying to change expectations within the communities for what it means to be part of one of these projects and what inappropriate pieces and um and and what to expect from these projects i hate to say it but that's why i think the crash that will come you know there's going to be some some bright sides to that i think it'll allow the space to mature and the communities to mature after that happens and the the strong really remain yeah i think so too i mean i think the thing the thing i sort of leave it with and um and this is for people listening across the board right if you're crypto curious and you think it's not for you you know six months ago i could not have told anyone anything about nfts and i'm currently the ceo of a significant nft project it's not as hard as it seems the gatekeeping is real but it's mostly jargon and so it's important to be educated important to learn about some of the basic tenets of it especially around security but it's only a handful of things you need to learn to for the majority of the sort of security things to be covered um and so and same on the nft project side at the end of the day an nft project it's a it's company it's a brand and there's a lot of similarities with web2 and so for people who have successfully built projects and companies and brands in web 2 and who are really curious about the space i actually think the sky is the limit because there's a lot of projects in the space right now that are people who have literally never run a company who overnight have four million dollars five million dollars 60 million dollars depending on the project they're referring to and who and who who don't have any clue what to do with it and and it's a reason that i think that the sort of lack of transparency in the space we didn't talk about doxing or not doxxing there's a reason we were transparent about who we are we want people to be able to make their own decisions on what teams they want to back i certainly take that significantly into account when i think about what nfts i might be interested in but the fundamentals of the business is the same there's obviously different things in web3 but you know it's it's operations marketing strategy spotting talent listening to your user communication right crisis management all the things that happen in a normal company happen in web3 just faster and so i think that's one of the biggest differences in the space is that pace we just talked about the pace of innovation which is so exciting for me the speed of execution which i find incredibly you know energizing but also the time frames for market expectations which can be unrealistic and so i think because that's an order of magnitude beyond what you see in web 2 or anywhere else yes it's exhilarating it's fun i also think it's a real risk to the ecosystem as you say right i don't think we can be building an ecosystem that not only burns out builders but burns out customers right you're building an ecosystem where consumers where people say i gotta take a step back can't i i don't know i need to take a break right like that's not healthy for the space um and so i think you know and building quality products businesses brands takes time it doesn't have to take years but it has to take more than days and so i think i i guess that's a thought i would leave it as a balancing the short-term view and the long-term view is really critical if we want this to be what it can be and if you want people to come in who have real jobs and real skills and values and after spending all day on discord then we got to make it attractive to those people and those are the people who empower the space yeah and building real companies like you cannot build a company while also spending 10 hours a day on discord it's just not realistic uh and like you need to take a step back from that like immediate reaction and um and reactive nature of things to really take a long-term strategic view and there's not a lot of room for that in this space right now and it's one of the things we want to change thank you so much this is one of these conversations where i just felt fully in it the whole time because i was so eager to hear what your answers were going to be so that usually is a sign that other people are going to love this so i'm really excited for folks to hear it thank you for breaking ish i think news about the lab here breaking it here breaking news i think big news breaking news breaking news here on this alpha true alpha right alex yes not the not that fake panther this is alpha yes this is here's the alpha apply to angel labs on monday share it with the projects you know that are amazing share it in your communities we want to hear from every corner of web3 and beyond for really the best projects the best teams the people you would want to back we want them to be part of this and so it doesn't matter where you where you're based what you
