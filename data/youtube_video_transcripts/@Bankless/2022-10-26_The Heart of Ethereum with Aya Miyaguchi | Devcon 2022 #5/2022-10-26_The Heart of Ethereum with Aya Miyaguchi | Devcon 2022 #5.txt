foreign [Music] back to the Devcon 6 experience in this episode I'm talking with ayat maiduchi the executive director of the ethereum foundation one of the leaders of Devcon and why Devcon is what I'm calling a cultural experience as much as a tech experience I asked Aya about the trajectory of ethereum that she's seen thus far and how all the devcons have changed and adapted and what really devcon's role is in ethereum as it is the place the meeting place the ground zero the epicenter of so much of what goes on in the ethereum ecosystem and what it's like been working at the EF for so long so I hope you enjoyed this fantastic conversation with ayamayaguchi of the ethereum foundation right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or fished and I owe a large part of that credit to my ledger Hardware wallet or really my ledgers like all of them all five of them because ledgers hold like 99 of my crypto assets and it makes me feel good about self-custody private Key Management you know what else makes me feel good using the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet or view your nfts or just keep up to date with the web 3 communities and of course you've heard of arbitrum and the arbitrim ecosystem is really heating up with their recent launch of arbitrim Nova arbitrum has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with her recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs Arbitrage from Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrim Nitro shipped last month and has made arbitrum faster and cheaper than ever so make sure that you experience what arbitrum has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking the fuel Network free from the evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security and maybe you're on arbitrum but you want to get to fuel you might use something like a cross the layer 2 Bridge from Uma across is a safe and secure Bridge making it easier to transfer your assets from one layer two to another or back to ethereum it's super fast super cheap and all secured by uma's optimistic Oracle and our last sponsor nexo which has like five different products and you're probably going to be interested in at least one of them first you can buy crypto instantly with credit debit or bank transfer it's also got an advanced trading platform called nexo Pro you can also earn interest on your crypto your Bitcoin your ether or whatever asset you like it's also got an instant crypto line of credit with as low as zero percent APR and a crypto backed MasterCard one of those things is probably what you want so go check out nexo the financial hub for the digital age and let's go ahead and get right into the interview right now and we are back I'm here with ayamayaguchi director of the EF Aya how's Devcon been going for you I've been having fun uh yes um it's been great and we kind of promised to make this stuff gone the best Devcon ever and I think team did it well as far as I hear from people I I didn't get to see everything but it is great energy and I also hear from new people that they get it this is a museum so that's what the great greatest thing to hear and the thing that I've noticed about Devcon is that it's not a Tech conference I mean we're talking about tech we're talking about theorem ethereum is a bunch of software but sometimes you know Tech conferences often happen in San Francisco or New York but we're here in in Bogota and I think if you called Devcon just a Tech conference you're actually not seeing the full picture so what is Devcon to you if it's more than just a Tech conference um so I mean I myself John Devcon too for the first time and just as an attendee before joining the internal Foundation debcon was a place that I felt ethereum was different so that's what I wanted to like our team to create but at the same time uh we're bringing debacon to Bogota this time and then bogora is well and also said it's not just bogora it is Latin America and and the combination uh like we are supporting all Latin America communities but also they can inspire people from outside to to feel the energy like how they can be creative I'm uh I've been advocating this idea of next being they're the next billion users and Builders of Atrium and then we have to include them but also they are pretty creative because they have to and the ethereum is a necessity for them and then they are building solutions for their own life so a lot of energy and the vibe and passion and creativity I want them to inspire the rest of the world so that's step one for me and what goes into some of the thought process behind how we select a city for Defcon uh here we are in Bogota Colombia uh last Defcon was in Osaka Japan before that it was Prague these are not their typical big conference cities that people go to uh so what are what's some of the thought processes to how we decide where we're going to host these things yeah so it's um there are a lot of criteria we look at and and then not you know we were not successful all the time we were not perfect but now like we want to have this like you know people to have different experiences like there are a ton of vegetarian events right and there are major events that happens every year at ECC like East Berlin and all those um what can we provide to the same people like something that they haven't experienced yet so that's one thing and then after we selected Latin America uh you know there are a couple candidates uh for Bogota the city was very welcoming but also the venue is I hope you thought that venue is amazing so the venue is also very important yeah and then we started to receive uh proposals from community members this year so we we are receiving proposal for next week next.com from different communities and so again like if the communities are very passionate and then and then you know like they can help us to do organize the best step gone that's you know extra bonus or extra point for for us so uh yeah those are the criteria and ethereum of course it's it's software but it's software that's supposed to help humans help us do the things that we want to do it's all about culture and how do you feel how do you think about culture as it relates to Defcon uh because like we all have all these talks and they're all very technical but you know we're in Bogota where again like I said we're not in San Francisco and we're also engaging with The Ether town community what role does culture play in providing the experience here in Defcon yeah so it's very very important for us to be a supporter as EF right I at the opening ceremony I spoke about subtraction or or one of our principles and then I definitely want people to see if it was an important message and we we choose some places but then like it's not We're not gonna we're not doing everything right it's it's just being supported and then Community starts building a lot of different things and you feel the vibe from that too but also uh speaking on the culture ethereum culture like we focus on building and no one is talking about the price of ether or you know like just that this this Bible Building Together Building Solutions together and then especially in North America that's not this is not just cool new tech this is this is you know like necessity for their life so like I love for everyone to feel that uh through through this experience and also wherever you go like you team events always have that feeling but with them gone like we we definitely want to make sure people feel that and this Devcon is happening at an interesting spot in ethereum's story uh we are a few weeks six weeks ish post merge and much of ethereum's early history has about been about getting to proof of stake and now we are having this Devcon where everyone all the developers all the community members are all coming together right after we go through this big transitory period in ethereum what do you think this the the role of Defcon is in like kind of defining eras of ethereum how does it help write the ethereum story yeah so obviously we didn't plan it luckily that gonna happen right after the merge and then it was perfect timing but also um this I also said this in my talk it's like marriage was important not just because all the technical because of all the technical advancements to the protocol this giant project was done by a decentralized community that's like who no one has done that before um and so I think the Devcon is a perfect place to celebrate that part that's just about the technical part um and then you can really feel uh you know there's so many people outside of EF who are involved in the merge and then they get they can actually be together in person and of officially so it turned out to be the perfect time but again you know we didn't really predict it um but uh maybe we got lucky because we were decentralized and then like you know someone gave us lack and so yeah there is a lot of celebrating going on and so I've always every time I see the people on crypto Twitter or the people that I interview on Bank lists that are all around the world all in the same spot that is something to celebrate uh and everyone chooses how to celebrate uh in their own unique flavors and people go out to dinners there's a bunch of parties how are you and other people at the EF celebrating uh uh here at Defcon um so I don't know like we just like being able to be together is one celebration and then we just you know I received this um Panda coin from the researchers um yeah but we just are happy being every together and be together you know like I just was with vitalik and Danny yesterday and then we kind of like we did it like this uh again like we didn't even do it like all the all the community members did it together but you know like we're able to be part of it that's very exciting and um yeah we we are also EF getting together at the same location doesn't really happen often so this is like we haven't really done because Devcon people have been busy with stepcon and the team has been really busy so hopefully maybe tomorrow or on Sunday we have like actual time twos Subway celebrate right as the organizers of Devcon you have to you can't celebrate too soon you have to wait wait for it to be over uh did you have any goals coming into Devcon any like things that you wanted to see any experiences you wanted to have or what did you want to get done and now that we're at the end of the conference we have a few more hours before we actually wrap this thing up uh did you achieve those goals yeah so my goal was to feel that um Latin America communities have developed you know so much and then to feel that they don't need us anymore right and then I think I do feel it that way I was with all that in my American Community leaders this morning we just got together with all different countries there are uh they're super cool but also very organized and they're learning events and hackathons on their own and then we are as a supporter and then I feel like our job is done and they don't need they've gone anymore so that's that was my goal and then I do feel it and then I feel like our mission is accomplished you said it was Defcon 2 where you first identified that there's something different in ethereum uh and I think uh that was a little bit emblematic of your talk that you gave about subtraction how is that subtraction mindset different than what most people would expect and how is it the right mindset to think about ethereum and what the role is at the EF um yeah so subtraction is really not about just doing less it is like subtracting your power so that others can join and then I think I just tried to explain it in in one word but then ethereum actually has it already right it was there that's how ethereum has attracted so many people and then EF doesn't have to be perfect like because others come in and then fill in the role and then you are doing this podcast to do education and so that's the that's the power of the human community and then so subtraction is all about like you make space for others but then like you add we subtract so that others can add but then those who are adding at some point maybe they can start subtracting so like I'm hoping to see that more not just from here but from others because I think subtraction is really critical for ethereum's decentralization is it too early to think ahead to Defcon 7 2 are we we're discussing um there's strong strong requests from different communities like some communities are very strong um so yeah I don't know yet so it's not like I'm hiding it I don't know yet well I uh and we have some uh closing ceremonies we have to get to so thank you for spending some time with me and uh and just thank you for everything you do at the EF thank you for having me cheers [Music]
