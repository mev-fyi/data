in a democracy the government works for the people not the other way around right America has many flaws and it's slow and bureaucratic but what eventually ends up happening is that sentiments shift in the U.S a new generation of people emerges they get people who run for office and basically America has this kind of self-healing system imagine how bad it would be if we got someone anti-crypto and they were dictator for life at least we can just wait four years or eight years in the worst case and get a new crop of people and crypto is going to outlast any Administration any official as long as we keep building I think we'll get there eventually
