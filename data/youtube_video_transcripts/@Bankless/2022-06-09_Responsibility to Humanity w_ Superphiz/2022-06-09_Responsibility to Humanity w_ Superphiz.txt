part of a game that we're playing with ethereum and with like promoting decentralization is to ensure that our kids can also play that game earlier you were talking about putting monetary incentives ahead of responsibility and if everyone puts monetary incentives ahead of responsibility we remove the ability for our kids to play this game because what happens as a result is that the network becomes corrupted and then it stops being the network that we all want it to be i totally subscribe to that like so many people who would argue with me say you know it's about financial incentives stop talking about responsibility i don't subscribe to that i have a responsibility to the change this extends beyond financial incentives and into dreams for the future i don't think of ethereum as a financial chain anymore i think of ethereum as the foundational layer for our shared future i'm so excited about the future of what ethereum can be that i'm done worrying about how much money i'm gonna make am i more focused on how i can steward this growth into something that benefits humanity
