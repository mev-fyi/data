you for having me it's always it's always fun to come and chat nfts oh it's a blast our favorite okay let's start as we usually do general macro update what's happening in the market right now what are the high level trends we're seeing give us the give us the update i'm trying to remember where things were last time we chatted in the last update but i i presume it's just been telling you crazy bullish yeah you can tell me okay yes it was bullish well so i didn't do a recap episode last week because we had a special episode with fuocious which if you haven't listened to i did that was amazing yeah amazing he's so incredible anyhow so the last episode we did was with you and there was we were back to like blue chips sort of doing well taking their place on the top of the top 10 projects board would sort of step back from seeing all these new projects come up and have crazy volume for a week or two they were really back if i'm not mistaken it was right it was like a week after apecoin news yeah so the dust sort of settled on the news a little bit but you still had rape in the top trading volume eight coin all the rest of it so what's happened in the last two weeks i suppose since then kind of more of the same where blue chips are just blowing up like it's gone crazy obviously we've seen azuki rocket to almost the 30th floor it's pulled back a bit um actually i think it went over 30th but now it's back under um yeah it's really it's blue chip season i think that's the best way to summarize the the market over the last two weeks we are starting to see i think over the last few days like a bit of a trickle-down effect even more where uh so originally it was like bought apes and then doodles were doing well and zuki was doing fine and trending up but then now like doodles exploded azuki exploded um cyber cyberbrokers has really just established itself as a new basically blue chip um but you know for for a good period it was like well that's it but what about the rest of the market now i think we're starting to see the rest of the market have that flow on effect and we're even seeing like some new mints that the mint out and then just rock it up to like point five one one and a half eth these the kind of thing that only really happens when there's a bull market um like ghostly ghosts and frank did you see frank no i missed it tell me tell me more i have almost no idea about frank except that i was falling asleep last night and i was like scrolling twitter and everyone's just talking about frank and to me it seems like a halloween following that i'm not following that i haven't seen this uh keyboard monkey tweeted about it um okay yeah the collection's called frankfrank and it's this total meme project and it's like the discord has two channels one is frank and the other is frank and i honestly i love it i love everything about it i i think it was free mint maybe it wasn't but it went to like a one-eighth plus floor and when stuff like this happens you know you're in a bit of a bull market i want one but i don't want to form a win at these prices um yeah and i know it's probably going to crash but you never know it's only the collection's 2 000 anyway this stuff this kind of stuff happens when there's a bull market so i think there's opportunities out there um but it's sort of we're still continuing to see blue chips performing the best and sort of separate even further from the rest of the market frank frank is making me think of kevin there's just something about like exactly white boy names yeah it's just really hit in their own way um okay azuki obviously big week you mentioned broke 38th floor at one point that was on the back of this basically surprise airdrop they did is that right can you break down for me honestly because i've only been sort of loosely tracking exactly what azuki did and how and i know you've got some strong feelings about it yeah so it was mostly a surprise air drop i think some people suspected it and there was like speculation that they were going to air drop something um and interestingly the floor price went up after the air drop which almost never happens but so they had an event at nft la and i think i think it was zagabond or someone was on stage talking about you know azuki and hyping people up and then just right at the end before he's about to walk off stage he was like oh and by the way check your wallets and it was like this mic drop moment and they just instead like you know most airdrops are you actually have to go and claim the nft you pay the gas they just paid the gas and sent nfts to everyone they airdropped two to everyone's wallet and they was immediately trading like a three three and a half eighth floor and then the price of azuki went up so i think azuki's were like 15 16 and then they just went 17 18 19. and so normally if they airdrop 678 the value the price of the original token drops but that did not i think that's usually because there's expectation like people know an airdrop is coming exactly so they're buying into it so they can get the air drop if you do it like a surprise like this it's like the of course the value of the project goes up once the next time they're just going to surprise they're dropping something you know and so and it speaks to i think the reason azuki has been it's always felt just like this outlier project in some ways you know it didn't have the the same level of a post-reveal dip it just has stayed really strong really consistently and as i've deep dived and tried to understand why it does seem like the quality above all else like they're just so consistently committed to whatever they do they're gonna do really well and i feel like this reinforced that narrative that was why people were already bullish about them because this was just a quality executed surprise for holders executing on this level that honestly i don't think i've seen since brought up your club really in that respect obviously there's a bunch of other projects like doodles are executing at a really high level too but yeah it's better let me ask you this well okay let me say this first what they dropped are they piles of dirt so this is also a really cool interesting part the airdrop itself the art was a crate with like a parachute so it was like an actual airdrop you got and then they had one trait and the trait was devs and the quality was doing something so that was just a fun little just meme and then i think a day later the artwork changed and it became an open crate i think it was maybe just a crate on the ground anyway eventually it opened and it was just a pile of dirt and that was on april fool's day and people were just laughing and i mean and then i think uh maybe something started to sprout out of it like a little plant or a tree and then now it's like a red bean and we're like this kind of maybe a little character with eyes poking out it's a bean we don't really know maybe it's changed again i haven't checked in a couple of days but yeah a that's fascinating changing art do you know technically the mechanism behind that by any chance yeah i think it's fairly straightforward um you can just update it on the contract and i think like until you like pin it to ipfs or rocket or something you you have the ability to change it yeah okay and then so is there expectation that this will have a final form of like a beautiful something that's gonna grow out of this dirt is that currently the speculation i think so i think there was speculation a when it was dirt there was like a metaverse land play because that kind of makes sense but now that we see like the bean with i think there's like a character or eyes like a little bean coming out of it maybe it's like a companion or something to expand the universe like mutants and cool pets and stuff like that um which makes a lot of sense because at a 20 30 floor most people can't afford it now there's a new entry point um yeah it's still a lot of speculation as far as i'm aware so let me ask you this this was going to be my question earlier and i almost feel like this is a theme that may come up a couple times during this episode just knowing what what topics we have on the docket which is where do you think the line is between azuki doodles board apes actually execute better and execute in this like incredible way and to what extent they execute well but they have so much attention that like anything they do is is people are going to dissect and and really observe at a level that like a smaller project just doesn't have the the benefit of of getting did that does that make sense as a question yeah that makes sense that's a really good question uh i think it's it's really tough to say uh clearly they execute well and then i think it's like a combination of executing well having art that resonates with enough people um having a community that's passionate and marketing marketing is you know part of executing is marketing and so you have these projects that on a technical level are doing something really innovative and executing maybe the art isn't fantastic or maybe the art is really really cool but they're just not able to market it effectively and cut through the noise and that's to me part of executing is knowing how to build the hype to build suspense tell a story it's honestly it's storytelling at its core um it's all these so i think yeah there aren't many projects there's maybe a couple um that i think of that are sort of executing on the same level as azuki board apes that have not had this level of success blitmaps is one that i keep coming back to but they don't really go out and market but they execute because you very well may be right and you probably are but i do think i think of board apes had the the kind of great fortune of being so early and being the first to always bring utility into the picture and and when i think about board apes and i think about so many things they actually did not wrong but like anonymous team you know like i i could go through the list of things if you look at when they first launched things that now we would see as maybe a red flag in some capacity that just because they were the first it didn't matter and so that launched them into being known very quickly uh you know despite there's some luck to that i think doodles you have jordan castro you have the team was inspired such confidence like the hype they got was partly because you had these people in the space who'd been executing for so many years and so they had the sort of right influencers they were friends already with jimmy and pranksy and folks who who tend to give you hype which is maybe why azuki's so fascinating to me because they don't they didn't have that so that's why i'm so interested how did they break through because i do sometimes wonder are there projects that are executing as well but don't have that that kind of connection they're a little bit too late in the market it's already quite saturated and so they're executing in all these cool ways but it's not breaking through and you know maybe that means they're just weak marketers but um but i sometimes wonder when we laud some of these big projects i'm like is this that spectacular or are they like just executing well but they're so big and uh observed that they get a lot of credit for it there's certainly like an element of luck and then also of when something we see something worth a lot of money and that's expensive we just inherently think it's better because of that yeah yeah that's a great point yeah um like i think there's a phenomenon in art when the more expensive art is the more people tend to appreciate it because they're like well it's worth a million dollars there must be something good to it and they'll find a way to really like it whereas if it was ten dollars it would just be like oh it's just another ten dollar piece of art there's nothing so there's something not to mention the loyalty like the loyalty that people have to board apes that their community has is not disconnected from the fact that board apes has made them a lot of money and so you once you have that momentum and you started to make people money they do get that much more loyal that much more excited about anything you do yeah like all communities obviously if you've bought into them have a community of people who are excited about what they're doing because they have some skin in the game but the more money you've made somebody i think the more excited they get yeah anyhow i will actually uh let's let's go from here to world of women galaxy which because i did not get to speak about this drop we're a couple weeks late on it but because i didn't do a recap episode i didn't get to talk about it and i wanted to i had some observations on that drop i think some areas where i actually don't think they executed stupendously um and i'm curious you want me to kick off and talk about world of women galaxies yeah you kick it off and i'll add some thoughts after okay so first i should say like big fan of world of women deeply bullish on them i do think look we're all so early we say it all the time but it does feel like you are starting to have these projects emerge that just seems like it's going to be hard for them to ever there's kind of a too big to fail element to it which i'm sure is a top signal in every conceivable way but like even if they dip down it just feels like they're going to come back you think about the fact that world women has a partnership with hello sunshine i'm like this project just feels like as sure a bet as you can find so all that out of the way i did think there were a couple of things they did with their dutch auction for the world of women galaxy drop that could have been better big one number one for me was i don't think it made sense to have world of women holders claim their galaxy world of women before and during the dutch auction and i just want this to not happen in the future as a practice because in theory a dutch auction is supposed to be about a couple things a to eliminate a gas war which it didn't really do in this case but b price discovery it's it's for a project that says we don't know exactly what our price should be so we're gonna let the the you know the buyers figure it out through this touch auction mechanism when you airdrop or not airdrop when you let holders claim it it stops being a price discovery mechanism because what happens is you have the world of women holders who now got free galaxies for them it's just like how much look how desperately do they want liquidity right are they willing to sell it for one each to get liquidity and then they're selling it on the secondary market on openc and undercutting the dutch auction and that's actually determining how low the auction goes i think if you didn't have well the women holders selling on secondary i think world of women galaxy would have sold out much higher it ended up selling out at one eighth i think it probably would have sold out at one and a half eth um because but i think because you had world of women holders that were like all right i'm going to get a free eth if i just sell my galaxy like that's worth it to me and now it's not a price discovery tool it's a how much liquidity do world of women holders want tool that was number one reactions i agree completely and bringing it back to azuki what azuki did really well was anyone who was on so they didn't have a allow people to claim in advance but they had an allow list and they said well they will be able to mint after the dutch auction at half the dutch auction price or something like that and yeah i just think that having it uh the claim after just exactly what you said like dodge auctions are about price discovery if you claim before you eliminate that and it just it's a disaster yep now it did mean there were some some opportunities i mean there was some really uh juicy world of women that were on secondary for like 1.12 even after i mean i felt bad there were people who were buying it for one on the dutch auction and i'm and paying more in gas than what you could have gotten one for on the secondary like on open c so there were some there's some good buying opportunities during that whole process if you were following it really closely which which i was because i was excited about it but um yes that was sort of my my first piece and then in general it you know the gas war was obviously disappointing i don't know how you avoid that entirely you had an awesome thread i thought on it that that has gotten i think a good amount of attention because you were able to flip you're like look i know how to play the game i know how to win the gas war and so i was able to make money on this uh by by just anticipating it properly and knowing how to set gas limits you want to say want to tell people about your threat a little bit and give us some tips for winning gas wars in the future yeah so i i was following it closely i wasn't super pumped or excited by it uh for a few reasons but i was just online at the time and i saw the dodge auction happening and then it was getting down to 1 8 and i was like well this is probably a good flip opportunity and i was able to look at the ether scan contract and see how many pending transactions there were and there were thousands like i think six thousand seven thousand um and realized that most people that are trying to mint will not be able to mint and they'll miss out and they'll probably want to go and buy on secondary and generally what happens historically is it mints out a certain price and then the secondary price ramps up and and up and up and up so i was you know right i was there and i was seeing it i was like well let me just admit i know how to do it i can see the pending transactions i look at a website that shows what gas you need to put in priority and max fee to have like a 99 chance of getting a transaction through blocknative.com i think is a site they have a gas estimator tool and then yeah i'm into 10 uh i put it through it went through i flipped them i didn't feel fantastic i was like i i stopped flipping like six months ago because it's like well it just doesn't feel fair and and it doesn't feel good even though you make a little bit of money it just to me i would rather spend time and energy on other things in this space and i'm fortunate that i can do that and i've certainly flipped a ton and obviously done well out of that but and i have nothing against people who do flip and who know how to play a game it's like it's a free market and it's one of the beauties of web 3 and all this is like but then it's just i think the biggest gripe as well i had is that they were marketing it as a fair inclusive drop and to me there was there was very little inclusive about it yeah and that that was the other criticism i was going to raise that i heard other people talking about i mean part of it was what how many mints per wallet could you have was it 10 or was it 20. 10. oh it was 10. it might have been 20 i'm entertaining i almost feel like it was 20. it was high you know so and i think that was the other problem um was just the number of mints per wallet you could have it was just like a you know a bot field day you know like and i don't know what what kind of protections they had in place to try and prevent bots from from dominating it but um yeah i think that was a fair criticism it was a high price point you know the the allow list felt very kind of insidery it was very grindy and insidery and they only allocated 2 000 spots for the allow list and then they had 10 000 or something for the it's like why not do it the other way around or just make it entirely allow you could have had yeah anyway yeah so agreed i think that was uh not the best execution we've seen you said you weren't super excited about it about the drop for a couple reasons was that one of them or are there others that was one of them the other was um just looking at like the floor price of world of women going into the drop i think was around the 10th mark maybe 11 um and then the dutch auction starting at three that to me seemed extremely expensive and i would not have played three yeah like if we go back to uh like bought apes when they dropped the mutants the board eight floor was about 60 eath and the mutant charter was out of the three so it's like a 20 to one ratio they were starting at like a four to one ratio um even at one eighth it was like a ten twelve to one okay what about cool cats cool pets they sold for they were probably around ten eighth and they sold for what one and a half yeah i feel similarly i didn't buy them i think i i think even on the podcast we were saying if it gets below one what maybe below one and a half we'll look into it i think we said two i think i said i i bought at one point two but i think i said i would buy it two even i might have said that too but yeah because because everybody was saying like if you don't want to buy yours at or was it was it 1.58 is that what they sold them for or what happened it might have been true anyway i i think cool cuts are slightly different because they they had an entire platoon gaming ecosystem with tokens involved and tokenomics and had been talking it up for months whereas world of rum and galaxy and mutants it's like what's what are you getting you're just getting another nft whereas there's there seemed to be more tangible interesting mechanics with the cool pets obviously it didn't quite work out that way yet but um yeah in general i think these dollar options start a little high yeah they they and that's the other point i was gonna make is we are seeing we are seeing prices start higher in general uh on projects a little bit and we've been talking about this i know back in january there was a lot of that and there was complaints around that i i agree with the criticism that it didn't feel inclusive in the way that like the whole spirit of their you know company for lack of better terms is supposed to feel with that being said i wasn't quite so bothered by the price i felt like one and a half eth was is like probably the right pricing for it and if you start at three and it you know like that so it didn't it didn't bug me for that reason quite in the same way like it was wildly mispriced but i'm also maybe more focused on like storytelling like i'm so interested in in the ip and storytelling side of things and i think you're a little bit more like technical gaming you know that side of things which is why i think i sometimes overlook or miss some of the when those mechanics are really cool in projects and for world of women you know the feeling like they have a really good shot at actually creating being one of the first projects to really have awesome stories film shows something created out of them um that's where my head was when i was evaluating it yeah yeah it's fair it's interesting that just watching the price action ever since then like the world of women floor has dropped quite a bit i think it's around eight or nine now and worldwide galaxy is 1.5 1.4 it's sort of been quite stable there yeah it's been it's kind of been bouncing i think between like yeah it's your point a kind of stable range of like 1.4 1.6 one point i think i saw them at 1.2 one point okay let's move on we've got a lot of topics i know you've got a hard stop uh i feel like we should just as we're talking about blue chips we should run through some of the other uh the other big projects that have had announcement befriend series two is coming out and then moon birds you know can you call it a blue trip if it hasn't launched yet but i mean god it's being treated like a blue trip it is i've i've never been more bullish on a project pre-launch than moon boards i mean birds so let's let's start with moon birds then um yeah same so ridiculously bullish and going back to this theory of if you already have all the attention on you all you have to do is like execute sort of basically to get a lot of credit which again people may disagree with that thesis but i think there's some of that that goes on i mean god you want to talk about a project that has all the attention in the world all the you know as far as projects go kind of celebrity high-profile name connections as you could want kevin rose is a deeply connected person has already said that he's going to call on some household names to to be a part of this community and then simultaneously a team that also is is very capable of executing like oh baby yeah it's yeah it's so that they were planning to the dutch auction at 2.5 eth uh and i think resting at 0.1 and honestly like two weeks ago so i i joined proof like five days ago i bought a pass on secondary i kicked myself for not buying one sooner just i've been listening to the proof podcast since day one and all that anyway in there people were talking about how two weeks ago they thought 2.5 was high and it's going to sell it like the 0.3 to 0.5 range and then just how quickly things have changed because kevin has just kevin and ryan have like turned on the marketing button and be like all right now we're going to do a marketing blitz and it is so effective it is clear it was going to sell out of the gas war 2.5 well it's hilarious so i did an interview with their team two days ago and i was actually gonna air next wednesday um and then i was like oh my god there's way too much hype like and there's so much it's moving so quickly that if i wait a week to air it first of all they're gonna have done so much other press everything they've talked about on my podcast is gonna have been hashed and rehashed everywhere else so we moved it up released it yesterday but they were they were saying on there the community to your point a few weeks ago was like nobody knows about us like how's anybody gonna know about moon birds like yeah you need to make sure you market you know a bit whatever and now the whole community's like stop marketing stuff there's way too much hype turn it off yeah yeah yeah that's really funny so that flipped fast uh and you know one of my questions to them because in their very first twitter space they're like yeah we're starting the dodge auction at 2.5 we don't expect it to sell out at 2.5 yeah and that was one of my first questions i was like you you don't expect it to sell at 2.5 they're like no no no now we do and now we're quite concerned the problem is you know we're going to have gas wars at 2.5 so they made a change as of this morning do you want to tell folks what what their announcement was this morning yeah so they are moving to a raffle system where you will have to sign up via pre-mint which is a website that basically every project uses now to collect wallet addresses and stuff um you'll have to verify a discord account a twitter account do a capture and ensure that your wallet has 2.5 eth in it it will be a flat price at 2.5 it won't be a dodge auction and yeah they basically decided that this was the best option given what they had on the table um i know that they were exploring some really interesting sophisticated mechanics like a blind dutch auction and stuff like that but just the the launches in like nine days to engineer all that in that time is unfeasible so i think um this was basically the best solution they could come up with given the time frame and the new information is it still two minutes per wallet do we know i think it's one i think it's one minute it was two at one point yeah am i wrong okay no it was just stick to one okay and then but but proof pass holders like yourself will get two yeah we'll get two minutes two two minutes yeah two free throws essentially free yeah um damn i don't know if we get them before or after i hope it's off the track i can tell you this because i actually spoke with their team and i told them i didn't that i said don't do and what world of women did at all i'll shout out i will say they were like oh we were going to but you're totally right and so they're going to do it after now nice um so yeah so well i guess it doesn't really matter now because it's not a dutch auction it's just a flat 2.5 right so so it doesn't it's not a price discovery tool anymore so actually that's true really matter you know the only thing i guess would be if i guess people can still sell it for under 2.5 and then it and then the actual itself wouldn't sell out but nobody's going to do that like no um so anyway so probably yeah people are already offering like five six seven eighth for the passes in anticipation of it going that high on secondary oh wow yeah wait explain that they already have the passes no no who has um not bidding on openc they're just like in dm saying i'll give you five eighth four if somebody gets passes oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh for correctly holders yeah yeah yeah let me put that out there if anybody anybody who does want to sell theirs i'm a very open buyer to that as well well there you go yeah okay uh yeah you bought a proof pass i saw them like welcome you to the community i was gonna ask you how to win the gas war but it doesn't matter anymore and you also gave us that tip a little bit already um let's go to v friends series two this is you you own you're in the v friends ecosystem but i assume you do you always know a little about it i won't i want um i won't belabor this honestly because i don't think it's it's i don't know worth it sounds like i'm being dismissive but everyone knows i'm a big b very bullish one to be friends uh i'm just going to spend so much in the next month between v friends and and uh moon birds and i feel like others um so basically that he did uh the friends series two was is launching april 12th um he's i think there's 55 000 nfts 55 555. five if you didn't know it was gary's favorite number um he there's there's a like a a 12 and a half day period twelve and a half days being like the partly title of his recent book 12 and a half day period where if you're on the friends list you can mint um and to get on the friends list you had to hold book game tokens which we've talked about on the podcast before and it was like out of the 120 000 book game tokens 32 000 book game tokens were going to be selected for like friends list access and then whoever the whatever the corresponding wallet was would get on the friends list i have i had crazy luck on this i never get this i had sold a ton of book game tokens made some you know made turned a nice little profit on them was holding five bookcam tokens all five of mine hit so i have i get to mint five friends series two off the fence ridiculous luck i i was did you look have you looked if you what you're i i have 11 and i got five and that's really lucky yeah five of five hit for me ridiculous crazy um so anyways we both have five okay cool so you did check so you're sort of up on what's going on i checked yeah you checked you knew um and so yeah i'll be minting all five we also as series one holders get get a couple freebies i believe uh that correspond to our character and my goal on this one for for series two i like went for the cheapest and if i don't you know i'll say it kind of crappiest characters when i minted you know the first round i was just like trying to spend the least money possible and this time around first for series 2 i think i want to flip and or just buy like a nicer character is i think that the goal i have for yeah series 2. um anyway and then there'll be a public sale that'll happen after the friends list no utility he's like you know this is i this is very much a i mean i'm sure he'll probably end up doing things because he's gary but um this is really his ip play right like i think he's effectively convinced enough people that he's going to make these characters matter as he says and this is really like a collectible play and you know he's doing the kind of gary thing of like people are going to underestimate it you don't people understand what i'm going to do with this so again i'm sure there will be you know there'll be all sorts of benefits you'll get as a series 2 holder but he's um he hasn't as far as i know hasn't signaled what any of that is and has been clear like this is not the same kind of utility play in the way that series one was interesting i'm still bullish they'll be priced at 995 dollars which will be priced in eth the day before they launch so basically whatever the price of ethereum is the day before the sale goes live they'll figure out what in east 995 dollars exactly yeah it'll be about 0.3 this is kind of expensive but also not yeah also you know yeah not not it not when you consider that series one is at like 16 eighth and it seems yeah highly likely that these will pop to a couple eth at least pretty immediately if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up

there was a little bit of drama there there basically there's a lot of failed out of gas transactions it was like in the millions of dollars worth of failed transactions and aj said hey we're gonna reimburse folks for failed gas we're making this right we're sorry about that whatever um any thoughts on this have you been tracking this at all yeah i i i was online around the time it was happening and they were like it was not a stealth drop because i think gary mentioned it in the discord and then he teased ajt's at on twitter and he's like we all knew it was coming so i was like keeping an eye on it and then i was cooking dinner and i just happened to come back to my computer and i saw that it was live and i was like all right let's go let's go and i just pumped the gas and i ended up paying way too much i like i'm into two for like point eight one i got for like one point two eighth and like i don't know i was like you know wow yeah cause the gap the contract is not optimized for gas so yeah which aj had a thread sort of explaining it like why they didn't use erc721a and you know there were uh they were building with a long term in mind from a user experience standpoint our goal was to create a frictionless companion claim roadmap for years to come by including the innumerable functionality of erc 721 vaynersports can guarantee vsp holders a claim in upcoming nft drops i don't understand this because i'm not technical enough but another priority of the drop was to add multiple security checks to mitigate some malicious activity while these checks are costly or on chain we felt it was worth it to check that a user was minting from a personal wallet and limiting the max mint per wallet address to four nfts so that that he was kind of explaining what their thinking was um i'm i'm still bullish on it i'm i'm absolutely i'm bullish on aj i have a friend who they're at like point four last time i checked which i may hop in and buy one or two but um i have a friend who worked at vayner x like very early days like when it was like still a startup uh and worked closely with gary and aj and you know she she's thinks very highly of both of them but she's like aj's the real brains she's like aj's a genius okay she's like gary's out there the front man but she's like aj's uh age is brilliant so um obviously both both brilliant but that's uh yeah you know aj's a little bit less you know fewer people know him but right he's apparently very talented so bullish and and the premise here is basically you know the aj um vaynersports has like a hundred athletes signed to them at least and uh obviously they're both huge sports fans very connected in the sports world and so this is really a utility path that's supposedly gonna have various benefits tickets to things they were throwing out world series and super bowl tickets i'm sure there'll be like raffles for those kind of things and um you know i'm sure there's the sports card play you get access to future nft drops that i'm assuming will be kind of sports card ask um i don't know what made you buy in just bullish on the the vayner ecosystem pretty much yeah i i figured everything that they've done ever has basically done well especially in the nft space um and yeah like sports and nfts has not really taken off yet the like obviously top shot and stuff but like in the in the utility sphere um and i think it's going to so i think they'll find ways to add value and build out the ecosystem and yeah yeah yeah do you have thoughts on like autograph and candy or any of these other sports marketplace like sports card marketplaces no i'm not very clued into them yeah yeah yeah um that is funny it is true everything they touch does doesn't turn to gold so hard to bet against him yeah okay couple other topics here [Music] have you been following the ape coin staking i'll call it a little bit yeah a little bit so there was the initial proposals put forward by the board um and then they looked like they were getting approved and then the community sort of spoke and was vocal and said you know we don't like the lack of clarity in these proposals so apollo's voted against it and then it's like back to the drawing board and then trying to come up with a new solution that people are happy with and i know that there's like a lot of different slightly different takes and options um i find it fascinating i haven't followed it closely i would love to um but it just to me is like this magnificent experiment in governance um at a really high level and global level including lots of people lots of money lots of attention in the nfc space so um yeah i mean i i i don't really know what the drama is i guess well and and drama is is probably not the right word it seems like it was actually very civil um but essentially that the the the aip the ape improvement proposal or whatever around staking that anamoca had put forward i think it was animoka who had really been behind it um you know at the launch had been voted against it felt like there was maybe a little bit too of this sense like animoko was a as a launch partner of of you know of apecoin and i i don't this is actually something i'll get into but so we don't know exactly but seemingly got a very healthy chunk of apecoin or definitely got a very healthy chunk of apecoin and and sort of this sense like okay you feel like an insider in a way that just out the gate makes us feel like we don't want to just accept it as it is um it is beautiful in the sense that i think dows do struggle with participation oftentimes and this was the opposite of that you had tremendous amounts of interest and activity and and participation by people i was reading a thread it looks like dingaling and and machi big brother and jimmy um i don't know machi big brother actually but those three have been leading a charge around just a slight modification or variation on the original proposal that um seems interesting yeah so we'll we'll be i'll be very interested to see how this plays out this gets me to part two of this and maybe why i call it drama though again maybe not our mutual friend john rogers did a deep dive like read through all the fine print on on ape and was just raising some questions specifically there are three launch partners that that all got apecoin on the launch of this and they're not named they're just launch partner one launch partner two large monitor three and for everybody who got apecoin um allocated to them as part of this drop like the founding team the you know the four founders and and and two of the launch partners and um they don't it doesn't unlock their apoint doesn't unlock for a year and then there's a vesting schedule where they don't get the full payout for three years it's a very standard like you know venture model if you or like if you join a startup and it's great because what it does of course is incentivizes you to make the coin work before you just make a bunch of money off of it yeah but this launch partner one got i think like let me i'll i'll pull the numbers but it was like a ton of apecoin day one and they get a ton more acorn in six months i think like the amount of apecoin that gets unlocked it is you know is like hundreds of millions of dollars worth of vape coin immediately and launch partner one is unnamed so my hunch would be that it's animoka or andreas um but john's sort of like i would like more transparency about who's this partner that's getting 100 millions of dollars at current based on current eight coin prices from day one and i'm kind of surprised that that more folks haven't sort of raised questions around yes so i mean even the good old foundation which is their like charity partner is their apoint is locked for 12 months that would be the one that would make sense to unlock immediately right away yeah uh yeah i mean for all the that we tout you know transparency and all that in in web three to have and like visibility and stuff it does seem a little uh web tooie to just have launch partner one two three and not know who it is and all that kind of stuff um yeah i think the thread was super important and super well thought and he basically also said that after in a year there's just going to be a significant unlocks every month for three years and so there's just going to be a lot of cell pressure on apecoin so the the job is really to make it valuable and uh to prove that there's like value continuing to accrue into the ecosystem to support support that because you have to imagine that a lot of these people getting their tokens unlocked after yeah they're going to be selling some of it they're going to they're going to want eath and usd and all that kind of stuff yeah yeah i think that's an important point it's funny because i i feel like these are the kinds of tokenomics dives that you always get in the erc20 world like in the defy world with coins like you know you're if your algorithm if you're you know what like algorand got uh i think messed this up too they had a lot of like initial vc part partners whose vesting schedule kind of kept sell pressure on the coin and and that conversation is is i think quite common because it's so fundamental to the product in on the defy side of the world and i feel like in nft land we're just sort of less that's that's not the thrust of our conversation so we we feel like we haven't looked as closely at it but it's totally true you have a lot of partners that start vesting after a year and then vest you know get a monthly allocation and you know that that is in theory going to be a supply shock on the coin now the flip side of this is a couple fold which is a these are founders and i don't think the founders of yugo labs are going to start dumping apecoin after a year because that would be quite devastating to their project in as a whole um a little like a founder or ceo like dumping shares of a stock of the stock they own yeah they might buy more yeah exactly exactly so i don't think i think that's good news and unlike coins they don't have like a crazy number of venture partners or you know like or or investors it's basically three these three launch partners are the only other sort of factor here the other thing and i think john made this point as well is it actually puts a lot of there's a lot of pressure on them to really do something with apecoin over the next year and he made the point i think like this is going to be a good year to be a board uh holder because and not that it's ever thought i could hear the people but uh it hasn't been i think yeah yeah oh my god this is ridiculous yeah that's insane but the their their their incentive is certainly to create a lot of utility for this coin over the next year um you know but in advance of some of the best you know some of this unlocked happening um to prevent just a crash of the coin when supply yeah hits it's going to be super interesting to see what they do how they do it i mean we've all seen the the leaked deck it's yeah they have plans they have big plans they're making a metaverse play uh m meta rpg play which i i really love that term um yeah yeah it's exciting absolutely okay uh this is i was gonna say speaking of drama but again not drama none of that was drama but we'll be curious people's thoughts on it if anybody else is dug into the tokenomics um this axie hack i feel like this was also a couple weeks ago but i didn't talk about it uh i have no like you know brilliant thoughts on this but it's maybe worth putting on people's radars in case they haven't been following it do you have i can break down what happened i don't know or if you want to if you have thoughts you want to share on it yeah i i don't have too many thoughts i i remember uh vitalik made a a blog post like two or three months ago saying the biggest security risk and where like exploits going to happen are going to be bridges bridges is the most the weakest and we've seen two big bridge attacks since then the i think the solana one and then this one now and it was huge uh it was like 600 thousand each am i making that up so it was 625 million dollars worth of yeah you know 170 000 yeah yeah yeah um so yeah i'll break this down for folks this is the second biggest hack of all time i think i think that's the stat i think it was massive um they hacked basically the is it called the ronin bridge yeah is the chain yeah yeah that axi infinity is built on and they have this bridge that goes from the ronin blockchain to the ethereum blockchain which of course is what gives xe tremendous value because it means you can cash out your smooth love potion for eth and then for fiat um and my understanding of what happened here was basically they had back in november when when just transaction volume and traffic and people playing axi was was super super high they had actually made some modifications to the ronin bridge and essentially laxed the security on it a bit for the sake of ease of use just because they had so much volume happening and then never went back yeah to tighten that up again and like essentially kind of forgot i think was honestly what the team said that they had done this which left it of course vulnerable and then you you had these hackers come in and you know take like 625 million dollars equivalent out of the system what's interesting is i feel like we have seen what these other hacks negotiations reached or where you know the hackers and whoever they they stole from kind of reach a settlement and they'll give some money back because it is really hard to actually withdraw funds because you know all these exchanges have kyc at this point it's very hard to hide who you are ultimately if you're trying to cash out stolen youth into fiat um in this case they've the hackers have already started to transfer eth to tornado cash which is something that gets used to sort of hide identity and hide wallet addresses and sort of you know launder essentially the stolen eth so it looks like they're they're proceeding with basically trying to take all this out of the system yeah it really is just wild the scale of the attack um yeah and yeah to your point about uh laxing security so i think they had like a multi-sig wallet that required um so there's nine signers on it and they only required five out of the nine to approve transactions um and basically four of the nine were controlled by one entity itself so these hackers uh got access to that entity somehow and then just had to get one more and they they found a way to get one more um and boom and i think they've since said you know that was a mistake going forward we'll require eight out of the nine but what also maybe have eight of them be a different entity yes it feels like even if you had five signatures but they but four of them weren't yeah yeah yeah that that's sort of a single point of failure it sort of undermines the whole you basically had two out of three exactly it was really what it became or two out of eight or whatever um yeah i mean honestly you know i i do think these companies that get hacked it of course becomes like their top priority to never have it happen again so ronan will probably become the safest the safest place moving forward to be because you know you know fool me once if they if this happens again they're they're really screwed um and they've already raised i think 150 million or so to uh start paying back people who lost money in this and and they've said they're looking to they'd like to raise the full amount and get everybody their money back you know remains to be seen but i think some of their um like venture partners have contributed to um i don't know that andreessen has but i actually think they may have um so they're going to start reimbursing folks who who are victims here um do you want to speak to and we'll cut this out if you don't feel like you can you can perfectly i i can give a very very rudimentary overview of really what bridging means when we talk about bridges i'm not a real expert yeah i'll bring somebody on at some point to break it down it's these magical things where you want to send money yeah i mean my understanding is it's essentially you know you haven't you have whatever you know your nft on ronin and then they basically create a duplicate wrapped version of it on ethereum yes my very understanding of what a bridge does but i think all the bridges themselves are like centralized entities because there's not a way for them to be decentralized and maybe there's a human element i don't know i don't know yeah yeah yeah just a a a very obvious point of failure i guess i guess vitalik pointed out to all of us okay i thought he was smart yeah who would who could have predicted that metallic would successfully predict things about ethereum yeah um okay pudgy penguins uh back from the dead you had a tweet joking about well what did your tweet say i can pull it up here uh some something to do with uh pudgy penguins proving rule nfts would you never sell your nfts never sell nfts because so many projects that go to zero or just drop heaps come back obviously lots don't and they just completely die so it's a very facetious rule this is my theory about being hyped enough like if you the too big to fail thing that i was mentioning earlier and also like if you get enough eyeballs on you like you can kind of do anything and like still if you if you execute at a basic level you'll get hyped and if you don't you're still fine you know so just to give people if anybody missed this pudgy penguins super hyped project at one point new york times talked about them yeah run by a group of co-founders one of whom was coal ethereum who's like 20 you know like you know and then it basically emerged that the founders had taken all of the money out of the project and the project itself was broke and the many millions of dollars that had been made on pudgy penguins had all gone to the founders you had 999 uh awesome you know person on twitter and long time investor in the space offering to buy pudgy penguins this is how it all came to light he basically in an effort to buy the project learned oh there's no money in this project the founders have taken it all um qual was booted out of you know was voted the community voted to to kind of push coal out of the project um and now somebody has bought them to what's the latest yeah that i'm not i don't know who bought them but they basically got bought out there was in talks for a while um and it's like reva revitalized the project the floor price shot up the floor price of the little pudgies which is their companion drop shot up um and you know they have some notable holders and i guess that these new owners are just trying to turn the brand around pump new capital in it you know the community is strong enough that they're they're back they're back it's it's wild it's wild back from the top never never sell it it's number one rule is never sell enfts at a loss how about that yeah guys [Laughter] because they all unless you're tax harvesting yeah that's true well yeah i know dumping all the ethereum and then just buying it back so you can i know that's a trick but i don't know i probably shouldn't say well we won't talk about it um all right last last things oh i i know the last thing we need to talk about both we we failed to last time um i mean i had a couple other things on here but i don't the solana nft is on openc that does feel like big news but i'm not wildly versus are they on there yet or yeah i don't know there was like there's been tweets suggesting it i know it's coming soon maybe yeah um tiffany's bought tom sacks rocket factory that bought a tom factory nft for like hundreds of thousands of dollars um the takashi murakami drop which i think we actually did talk about last time four point nine million addresses registered for that takashi murakami it's a million it's it's half a million humans and four million bots but even half a million humans that's insane oh oh you're you're speculating i mean i think it's probably it's probably even less could be a million 30 000 real wallets yeah exactly but yeah i'm i'm on there i'm holding out hope hopefully my it's kind of like winning foreign yeah it's totally winning the lottery um waiting for more details on that in terms of i guess at some point i think we're supposed to get we're supposed to get an email if we like no idea i don't think i signed up which is stupid oh what yeah i i did i've been trying to get details of when the raffle closed on monday this past monday um but i don't i've been like trolling twitter trying to figure out where i can find the website trying to figure out how to find out who got announced but i'm sure they're dealing with a lot of bot stuff i saw something uh an announcement from them saying that we anticipated about a million and that was gonna take us a while and so now this is gonna take us 4.9 times as long so we don't know when and we're not going to tell you how we're going to announce it because they don't want people to start scamming if they say well announced by email people sell that scam email so they're like there's basically they said give us time and i don't know maybe like six weeks they'll be like yeah that makes sense okay so we're just all hanging tight those of us who who registered i mean the crazy thing about the 4.9 million number is the registration process for this was you like went on the website you registered you got like an initial email that you had to like confirm and then you got a second email and it was like you have two hours to do the things we tell you to do here or like you're not on it's like they even had sort of stringent requirements of like if you didn't see that email within those two hours like you were done and still and applaud still 4.99 whatever i don't know um then the you know elon has bought a 9.2 percent stake in twitter i have thoughts i don't know if you thought i i almost don't want to wait into this one but it it does feel like it sort of touches it's fun it's it's fun i'm kind of into it you know i've heard commentators like what people that i really respect too that are like you know obviously that elon has indicated he's not happy with twitter or censorship on twitter and they're like who you know elon is not censored at all this is so crazy and i think there's a lot of commentary around that um i i do think there is a very real question around censorship on twitter yeah um you know we saw this during the election articles that twitter would take down that have since shown to be actually true and twitter was like taking them down at a point because they were anti you know they weren't good for joe biden and yeah yeah so yeah for the commentary commentators that i again i really respect kind of acting like there's no problem here i'm like oh i don't know i think there's at least a conversation to be had about twitter's practices around what gets censored and 100 yeah so and i do find elon just endlessly entertaining okay you have to go in one minute so i'm going to say you have a youtube channel we didn't we haven't promoted either our youtube channels on this show at any point because we're both typically deeply bad influencers and stuff so bad uh so we're gonna do it here in this last minute you have a youtube channel and you have a podcast you also try and highlight which i feel like yes promoted on the show ever i don't think so tell us about i have a youtube channel you can just find it on youtube seneca or xenica 33. i don't even it's zenica33 um just go to youtube and type in zenika and you'll find it um and then on there i have uh conversations with project founders and my show which i call zen chats which i'm turning into a podcast as well and then i have another podcast called two board apes which is also shown on youtube and you have a youtube channel and i have youtube channel so this is big news we have spun out i you know my shows have historically always gone on the bankless youtube channel they will continue to go on the bankless youtube channel for the foreseeable future but at some point we will rug y'all and they will stop being on the bankless youtube and they will only be on the overpriced jpegs youtube channel i'm coming at basically we you need 30 days you need to have like at least 100 subscribers in 30 days before you can create a custom url for your youtube channel i don't know if you also discovered this zenica so i don't have that's why it's annoying we don't have like easy youtube urls be like youtube.com slash overpriced jpegs so i'm like i think i'm two days away from the 30 day mark when i can have a very easy to promote url which is partly what's kept me from promoting it up to this point um but uh we will link to it below go subscribe to the overpriced jpegs youtube channel we'll do some fun stuff on there that you won't get on the bankless youtube channel and uh with that i think i think we're at our at time awesome thank you so much awesome thank you always the best we will talk in a couple weeks [Music] okay we hope you enjoyed the video if
