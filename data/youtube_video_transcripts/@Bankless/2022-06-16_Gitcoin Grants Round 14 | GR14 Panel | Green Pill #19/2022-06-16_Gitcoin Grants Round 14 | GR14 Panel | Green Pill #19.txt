what up coordination how are you doing this is the git coin grants quarterly episode this episode we're going to talk to scott moore co-founder in public goods funding work extremely to get coindale annika lewis public goods funding work stream lead kevin olsen vp engineering lindsay thrift vp product and austin griffith who is a dow steward at get coindale this episode is a snapshot in time of get coin becoming get coined out for the first time we've actually got modular parts of the grants 2.0 protocol that are going live and this is a great episode to understand what the future of quadratic funding is at get coin and the modular components the that are being built in grants 2.0 coordination i'm really excited about this episode i don't like to talk my own book on this podcast too much but grants 2.0 is coming and we're starting to roll it out in grants round 14. so whether you're interested in the technology of grants 2.0 or you're interested in just the details of grants round 14 it's a really fun episode in a time when the markets are down in which we're out of the bull market there's still three million dollars worth of matching for your favorite public goods on get coin grants so the markets are down but our hopes for public goods are way way up and so i'm so excited about this episode without further ado i bring you the get coindal stewards for get coin grants round 14. when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make

dollars worth of matching available until june 23rd scott you want to tee us off by telling us about the round at a high level yeah absolutely so for those of you who don't know uh get going grants is a program that allows you to basically donate to goods you care about public goods you care about in the context of your own local communities so we've run so many of these rounds with projects in the e3 and ecosystem and now we're starting to branch out into running even more of them with local ecosystems like for example the graph uh polygon and then other causes the community cares about so things like the climate things like crypto advocacy in the context of emerging regulatory environments and the goal here is really to think about what you know when we think about public goods what is the public that we care about well it's usually something in our own communities it's something that's local to us something that we've seen and touched and sort of felt locally and so the goal of this expansion into these new rounds is really to figure out what are those different kind of shared needs that people have and how do we figure out ways to essentially get the signal from those different groups and then in turn figure out what the broader global public goods that we need to fund are so we have 20 000 people providing their signal in this round so far that's with three million dollars as you mentioned the matching funds that are available and we're super excited to see just what people decide to fund um yeah i'll pass it back to you kevin amazing uh annika you want to take us into the details of grants round 14 what changes have been made this round what the rounds are stuff like that yeah so as scott mentioned we've got over three million dollars in matching funds in grants around 14 which is awesome to see in terms of the structure of the round so the dow ratified a structure that is fairly similar to what we had in grants around 13 on an overall level so we've got the main round our ecosystem rounds and our cause rounds and so the main round for grants around 14 as usual is the round that is available to any grantee on the platform with an ethereum payout address so all grants on that platform are eligible for that one million dollar matching pool we then have the ecosystem rounds which scott spoke briefly about which are really helping specific communities build and fund their shared needs we have 14 ecosystem rounds this time in grants around 14 which is a very fitting number uh also about a million dollars across those rounds and then finally we have the cause rounds which represent an expansion kind of beyond just web3 ecosystems and into more off-chain social causes and and things that you may not typically always see funded with with crypto and so the three cause rounds that we have for grants around 14 are climate blockchain advocacy and a brand new round around diversity equity and inclusion in the web 3 space so that's the structure of of the round overall if you're a grantee who's who's applied for a grant definitely check out all of the different rounds and the eligibility criteria for each one to see which ones you might be eligible for if you're someone who's just looking to see what's out there and fun different grants go to getcoin.com and you can browse through and see what grants you might like to fund and yeah we're really excited and encouraged by uh by what we're seeing so far the community is really stepping up in spite of the bear market to fund public goods and it's been it's been honestly an awesome pleasant surprise to see kind of the volume and uh and and just excitement around around this round uh so far yeah it's really neat to see that when the number is going down in the market the amount of funding and get coin grants is going up i think if i'm not mistaken this has been one of the strongest rounds yet out of the gate which is really curious given the given the bear market so number of contribution goes up and it sounds like the number of rounds that is being run on get coin grants is is uh is going up too so anything to add about that annika or scott yeah i think one thing i would love to just shout out that i think we we noticed before the round is the willingness and eagerness of many different types of partners to fund these types of rounds um we we saw coinbase announced a commitment of a million dollars to get coin grants just about a month ago before grants around 14 started up and they are funding the infrastructure round that scott talked about earlier um we've got kimball musk funding in the climate round and so even seeing kind of some of these you know more more webtoon native philanthropists come in and try and you know think about how they might use crypto for good so to me i'm just really encouraged by kind of the diversity of of projects and funders of folks who are starting to get involved um in spite of these these times wherein market was as you can see from this background we are in a bear market after all i don't have a green screen anymore it's just out of the budget but i think the infrastructure round in particular is special to me because you know as the number suggests we run 14 of these rounds when you think about it it's actually being almost four years of running bitcoin grants because each of these rounds happens squarely we try and be very cautious about how frequently we run them in order to make sure that we're running them on a sort of sustainable cadence for the community and the infrastructure around in particular is kind of where we started so everyone kind of remembers uh for those of you who were around the early the bear market in 2018 and it was you know in many ways a challenging time but also kind of a time that built a lot of camaraderie and a lot of shared sort of interest in the space and a lot of the grantees that we had in that sort of cohort have ended up being some of the most successful projects in the space over the last sort of like year or two years perhaps even longer so things like ethers.js things like uniswap or urine or co-op all these things kind of came out of that bear market and i think coinbase coming back and showing that they're willing to support that is actually probably to me the most like heartening thing about this whole round even though there's lots of other amazing stuff going on that's just my own my own small sort of like niche but yeah i'm super excited to see that live so if history repeats this bear market will have some of the most genre defining projects coming out of it and git coin grants is a place to get funding where when not a lot of other people are writing checks or i guess whatever the digital equivalent is writing checks sending transactions yeah i really hope that this bear market we actually see a lot more people going back to basics in some way i think that like we've kind of gotten ahead of ourselves in a lot of you know spaces we've certainly seen that i think um across people listening i'm sure people have seen that too um and i think that naturally we're going to end up with a lot more sort of you know swaps and urines and the rounds to come amazing uh would love to transition into the get coins transition into a dow and i know that there's some new goodies that have been built by the builders of get coin dao kevin olsen let's start with you tell us about get coin passport yeah man so um so bitcoin passport um i was trying to think about how to how to like kick this off i think you brought this idea to me um gosh like back in like february or something you were like there's this thing we've been trying to build for a while called passport and um luckily i think we were at uh uh east denver right caught evan's talk and got disco pill and and it like fit perfectly into like how we were thinking about this identity as the side the reputation system and um ultimately like adopted more or less that architecture right dids and vcs so decentralize identifiers and verifiable credentials as a way for folks to like get some like self-sovereign identity um but then also working with lindsay thinking about our roadmap for for grants2 um identity jumped out as like one of the first things to build right so so here we are we've got our first uh like bit of new uh protocol code coming out it's the bitcoin passport so this is a chance for folks to basically interact with something you might be familiar with we have the get coin trust bonus which before you could link your twitter and your facebook and ens and all these things and we would store that in you know the bitcoin monolith uh we've taken that out so we ripped that out now so there's an independent app at passport.getcoin.com you can build your passport there and that's all your information that's sitting on top of ceramic so ceramic's been a great tech partner for us through this whole process joining us for engineering calls and helping make sure we're building this the right way even offered some prs back to us so they've been fantastic um and yeah now it's live and so you build this passport you can take that you can think of it as like your data right it's sitting on the ceramic network but you control it with your uh your wallet and you can bring that back to git coin now and we ingest that and that's how we generate your trust bonus now so while it kind of looks similar um it's kind of the same mechanic it's kind of our way for people to prove that they are you know unique human beings and good faith actors in our system not not civil attackers um so you might know it and recognize it um but one of the things really exciting for me is kind of where it can go right it's a substrate now that's like kind of infinitely extensible and can take us in all kinds of really interesting ways um you know no secret we're all reading the dsoc paper and thinking about like where that can go i'm really excited about uh that product in particular having a bit of a life of its own and leading us into you know getting some new data uh that we can use for some pretty novel new mechanisms so i'm thinking this has a kind of a key to us innovating on just qf in general right so bitcoin passport is the new building block for identity on the git coin network and as opposed to being a centralized profile hosted at getcoin.com now all the data is hosted on the ceramic network and it's a money lego for civil resistance so basically quadratic funding relies on civil resistance which just basically means that we prevent sock puppets from using the network and using the passport we provide more civil resistance for eventually what will be the grants 2.0 protocol is that more or less right yeah 100 man that's it cool well uh i think uh people who listen to this podcast a lot know that i'm really excited about an ecosystem that could move from one token one vote to one person one vote and civil resistance is an important money lego um bitcoin passport doesn't provide any sort of civil resistance on its own though it's it sort of aggregates other civil resistance providers do you want to say who we're partnered with there or who we've integrated uh yeah i mean you've got your kind of classic oauth web 2 stuff so you've got twitter google facebook um there's a github stamp coming out too by the way we use the metaphor of passports and stamps so if you hear me say stamp just think vc in the back of your head if that's what you're more familiar with then we've also got ens uh bright id proof of humanity and there's a few more that are actually coming out uh and asking to to integrate with us so we're starting to get requests inbound which is pretty cool nice so basically being able to aggregate web 2 identity web 3 identity place it in a self-sovereign data store in ceramic and then provide civil resistance back to bitcoin grants will passport be used by other apps besides git coin grants in the future to provide civil resistance that's that's that's the hope right so this should be pretty easy for folks to integrate there's an sdk that we've written that's coming out um there's actually a hackathon that we're hoping to invite folks into so so come join us i think might be running by the time people listen to this but um it's a good way to get a sense of uh what you can build with passport um but yeah there's a bunch of groups uh they're starting to reach out as well about potentially just integrating passport as like a first rung in civil defense for their ecosystems too so uh good chance it's um going to get some some adoption in the space which is pretty exciting alrighty that is get coin passport thanks so much kevin anything else to say about bitcoin passport uh no i mean go build your passport um see how it works for you and um come hack on it and see how you can improve it what's the url for that passport.getcoin.com okay thanks kevin austin would love to move on to you and talk about the voting app that the build guild built with uh this this season so can you tell us about the genesis of the idea and what got you so excited about it and how people can access it what's up what's up what's up yes i can for sure you would even probably be the better person to give us the problem statement but the tl dr is the horse race problem right like basically the shilliest schiller ends up shilling the most and getting the most uh money up front which moves them to the top which means they get the most money during the grants round and we're looking for a different signal some other way to sort those grants in a way where uh you know it's not the shelliest shiller and the the solution was or a solution that we came up with was conviction voting and uh i think it came to me from you i don't remember where it came from exactly in my mushy brain but you think that yes it came from the ether yes yep i i uh i uh closed my garage door and turned on the ether and conviction voting but anyways it's basically you put down a bunch of gtc toward your favorite grants and that helps us sort it it's all about getting the the signal from uh folks that are conv have conviction for certain grants so the goal is you stake gtc the longer you stake the more voting power you have that voting power is then used to sort the grants ahead of the bitcoin round so then when git coin hits or when the grants round hits uh you can go to conviction voting right now uh on uh getcoin.com and you can see them sorted so if you want a stake go to voting.getcoin.com and stake gtc one one thing i wasn't expecting is a lot of people are staking a bunch and it's think of it more like almost like the quadratic matching stuff where it's we see people like stick or send like one usd or five usd right and it's a lot about the it's more about the signal than that one usd and i think that's the same situation here where you should keep most of your gtc for like voting and delegation and and governance but stake a small amount of it and let it sit there and accrue and let that be signal to us on what your favorite grant is so then we can sort them instead of using a horse race of shillers we can sort them by uh you know conviction and and how uh much conviction you have so voting.getcoin.co is the website oh you can even stake oh gtc it works on optimism too so if you're uh if you're not down with l1 i don't know it's pretty cheap to use l1 right now but if you want to get on l2 uh you can switch over to optimism pretty easily and stake your optimistic gtc also very cool and was this built with any perfect particular tool or framework that you're associated with yes sir thank you for the slow pitch it was built with scaffold eath by the build guild yes so huge props out to daniele who shredded on this thing it went from idea to prototype in like 24 hours and then it went from prototype to uh let's let's get it out into production in about a week and that was all because scaffold eath is a good way to get going quickly and daniele is a hell of a builder and just like sat down and built it uh we noticed that when you delegate or when you uh when you stake the the delegation for your governance voting rights goes away on the piece that you staked so if i have 10 g gtc and i stake 2 gtc my 8 still remains delegated but the 2 gtc once they're staked are kind of not voting rights at all and eventually when they come back to me i need to restake them so you we notice that we're gonna have to have folks you know have something for folks to redelegate and i think you can use tally but also uh danielle was like fine let's make delegation.tools another app built with scaffolding that allows you to like redelegate your gtc to other addresses something he also put together in like 24 hours too so you know props to danielle props to the build guild uh props to scaffold ether being able to build out quickly uh we got to figure out how to get this as like the default sorting method for next round so just planting the seed and getting it going and even to extend on that i think kevin you uh hinted at i was thinking we would only be staked for like a week and then we would all end stake and that would be the end of it but you hinted it like what if someone has staked for like two months on something like imagine how that the conviction curve would look and how how big your multiplier would be if you were willing to stake for months at a time so i don't know we'll leave it open ended we'll see how it goes but i'll throw i'll throw it back to you any any thoughts on on how this conviction voting worked yeah well now that coin dao is is basically in charge of governing bitcoin grants with gtc i think it's definitely up to the dow whether or not this becomes the default sorting mechanism so let's just revisit the argument for doing that uh in bitcoin grants rounds 1 through 13 weighted shuffle was the sorting algorithm on get coin dot co slash grants and because the more views a grants gets the more funding it gets there's a horse race at the stop at the top of the round where projects are trying to get more funding which gives them higher matching multiple which gives them a higher score in the waiting shuffle which creates this horse race in the top of the round and the idea behind the gtc voting was let's use gtc which is a governance token in order to govern the sort order of the bitcoin grants and that will provide a more fair starting conditions for the grants going into bitcoin the bitcoin grants round at the start thereby not stopping the horse race but sort of leveling it towards the ones that are most legitimate according to gtc governance and so basically you go to voting.getcoin.com you can stake your gtc on the grants and then that levels out the sorting mechanism on getcoin.com so the argument in bitcoin grants channel 14 if someone were to submit a proposal to make this the default sort is that it will make the grants round more legitimate and less of a horse race feeding into the quadratic funding is that basically the argument for it yep i think so and and like going back on some other arguments against it people were uh unhappy about losing voting rights or people were uh you know wishing they didn't lose their delegation and that's where i lean in to just take a small amount if a whole bunch of like the person who staked a bunch versus a person who staked a small amount when we look at the conviction when we look at the sorting like they're almost the same on the front page so you only have to stake a small amount to have a lot of uh impact on how this conviction voting sorting works i think that's it word nice yeah if we get into a world where there's so many utility so much utility for gtc and all these different apps maybe we'll have to build a mega app or something where you can get all of the utility all in one place sounds great let's just keep building lots of little ones first yeah yeah let's keep shipping small ones cool well i will keep putting ideas out into the ether if you keep huffing me for and building them and thanks again to daniele for for building that voting.kitcoin.com is the d-op where you can do that is that right voting.getcoin.com okay refi summer has arrived and cello is here for it cello is the layer one blockchain for the regenerative finance movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world

you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] uh one of the things that i really appreciate about this ecosystem where bitcoin grants 2.0 is being built and inside of the dow is how modular it is and so basically like in the old world if anyone wanted to change anything about the get coin ecosystem they would have to like pester me and get a pr into our repo but y'all built this completely permissionlessly just using the open source code gtc as a governance token as a money lego a list of grants that was available through the grants endpoint and then you just basically provided this data source so um i'm really excited about the innovation that can be unleashed when bitcoin is a modular ecosystem of money legos um and and i think that we're starting to see that come into existence with the passport with gtc with thevoting.getcoin.com and uh lindsay i'd love to have have uh you talk a little bit about bitcoin grants 2.0 and what this decentralized modular ecosystem is gonna is gonna look like and where we're at with the build out on that yeah such a fun build-up to talking about at this time for like uh gr13 last time we talked about it it was just a vision and a strategy and a thing we were gonna do um but here we are as olson talked about we uh have passport out and live um conviction voting is um being built with gtc um and so we are at the point where all three key parts of the protocol are under development um passport you can interact with now grant hub kicked off after that which will be the home for all project owners or future grantees to create their projects and apply to any round that's running on the the git coin protocol and the third piece being uh the round manager that has also kicked off round manager is essentially um the core protocol where a group that has a matching pool to deploy we'll set up all their parameters configure which mechanisms from the ecosystem they want to use are they using quadratic voting um do you have some sort of sible resistance you'd like to plug in with the passport or something else and so you'll be able to configure that round the way you want to there that's also just started under development so uh we'll see through the course of gr14 um go interact with passport um and during the claims period we're gonna roll out the first opportunity for folks to create their project in grant hub this will be the place you'll want to put your project in anticipation of future rounds running on the decentralized registry it'll also be a place you can begin putting your project to participate in rounds that are run by any of our early partners so that's the other opportunity folks have right now we are starting to seek partners who would like to be first adopters of that core protocol and run their rounds independently you can reach out to us i'm lindsay getcoin.co um or kevin olsen at getcoin.com um and let us know you're interested find us on discord um we're gonna start the first step really with these folks is tell us more about your intentions in running um a funding round we want to get to know the ecosystem more deeply so we're going to pull together what we're calling design partners uh be an opportunity for us to interview you but you'll also get a chance to be first folks poking around at prototypes testing as we build and truly being a design partner with us to make sure we're building for the needs of the ecosystem i think um bitcoin ourselves we've done um we have 14 rounds of understanding under our belts on how we run around but we're also rapidly discovering that there's a lot of innovation ahead of us and as each community comes to understand what their needs are and how they would govern they're around there's going to be some unique elements so we want to design for that and ensure we stay modular and extendable so join our design partner program um that'll be a chance to influence where we go from here thanks lindsey can you say more about what a good design partner looks like sounds like someone who's running a grants program themselves or wants to and evm based is there anything else um those are the big ones and also you'd have to be willing to commit some time um so that i'd expect to spend you know two or three hours a month um interacting with us in user interviews um testing the prototype shouldn't be anything super heavyweight um but we will be looking for folks that are willing to engage and dedicate some time with us sharing what their what your mission is um what you're trying to achieve what the unique parameters of your program might be thanks lindsay uh anything else to add about grants 2.0 from the entire group no i think just exciting to kind of like yeah like lindsay said move out of the design phase and into the building phase stuff's coming live it feels real yeah it is here uh i i remember when we launched the dow and someone hit me up on twitter and they're like you know what you're signing up for right you're gonna turn a whole centralized company and get coin grants into a dow you're like they're like you know that's going to take years right i was like yeah i know but uh i think that having it be centralized and modular is going to make the platform more credibly neutral and then the modularity is going to enable permissionless innovation austin when the grants registry is out i'm going to hit up the build guild and push some more ideas over to you and it's really excited about this ecosystem of modular tools that can be used on grants and bringing quadratic funding into more and more ecosystems is going to be be really neat i think and hopefully we'll see a world in which quadratic funding i think we're in 20 something rounds in get coin grants around 14 annika and scott correct me if wrong uh what would a world where there's 100 rounds running permissionlessly look like that's really exciting to me what's the exact number do you guys know 18. so not quite 20 but hopefully next time okay cool and then you know the other thing that kind of gets really cool with grants 2.0 is the ability to run different types of quadratic funding so the monolith uses pairwise bonding for civil resistance our friends or in clr fund use macy for for collusion resistance and so what would a world look like in which we were using different forms of quadratic funding and just had them modularly plugged in to the protocol look like i think that that's one of the neat things that i'm looking forward to as well anything else to say about grants 2.0 gr14 before we wrap just this modular permissionlessness if you're a builder out there listening stop waiting for permission to go build something it's permissionless it's available it's modular go build the thing yeah and if you're a builder out there don't be like me in 2017 and build it centralized to start i could have avoided or in the dark build it out loud and show it off build it out loud i love it um how can people get git involved in grants around 14. anna call pass it on to you for this one yeah if you're looking to apply for a grant or to donate to grants and see what's out there go to getcoin.comgrants and you'll be able to see where you can do both of those things if you're a funder who would like to get involved in get coin grants around 14 or future rounds uh on on a bigger scale uh feel free to reach out to scott or i um i think we can use the the founders email for that that one and yeah check us out on our discord um jump into the discord there's also the the support channel in discord if you've got questions as you go through your application and yeah hit us up on twitter as well coin and well very last point if you want to join the uh dow if you want to join the discussions on how the rounds are run um the future of grants 2.0 um last one would just speakup.kitcoin.com um it is you know a market for builders and there's plenty of building to be done there that's a really good point i feel like austin talked about kind of the permissionless and modular nature for builders and developers um but if you're someone who also just has a vision around the future of public goods and early stage funding come to gov.getcoin.com and participate participate in the conversation all of this is done in public um so it definitely extends beyond just developers kind of that offer to to engage and have a say in what we're doing that's the beauty of a dao amazing well thanks so much uh scott annika lindsey kevin and austin and especially to danielle for building voting.getcoin.com thank you for being on this podcast episode i think it's informative of where grants uh round 14 is for people right now but it's also historical time capsule for where we are with building out grants 2.0 when it moved from vision into actually starting to be something that was real and the markets are down but our hopes for public goods are up so contribute at gitcoin.com today and we'll see you all on twitter and on discord [Music] you
