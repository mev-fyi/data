what's really interesting to me that most people don't think about is what is the compute called for AIS the tokens right you you pay for a certain number of tokens right it's obvious to me that a tokenization of an AI open AI Network makes total sense welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys I'm in David's New York City studio today this is the first Monday episode we've ever recorded in person and this is all about getting our bearings as crypto investors where are we headed are we on the right path will there even be another bull market in crypto anytime soon raupal is our guest for these questions a few benefits and takeaways for you number one we rewind to 2022. what happened over the last 12 months in crypto did we learn anything number two we talk about why Raul thinks there's a crypto inflection moment on the horizon number three liquidity indicators these are the key indicators that inform rowell's outlooks in crypto investing number four we talk about why Raul thinks the popular inflation narrative is complete trash maybe we're in for deflation rather than inflation in the coming decade number five we talk AI is it a bubble or is it massively under hyped and how does crypto fit into the story and finally we end with Raul's crypto portfolio in the summer of 2023 has he increased his exposure to crypto or decreased it stay tuned at the end to hear the answer to that David why was this episode significant to you well other than having you right next to me which took some getting used to but I think it went pretty well uh Raul finds signals and finds ways to look towards the longest term uh signals that crypto can offer and just like investing in general and it's a nice uh respite for people who like I know you and I tend to be like sucked into the center of crypto Twitter uh there's like a lot of noise around there but Rel does a very good job of zooming all the way back out tapping into macro signals tapping in some internal to crypto signals and then also just being a strong reminder of some of the fundamentals that drive this space like when's the last time we talked about metcalf's law right here like like Raul's he just loves metcal's law and there's a reason for that uh and if your head's down like sucked into the middle of crypto Twitter and like like I said like you and I are like it's it's easy to forget some of these things that are playing out over the longest term time Horizon is that crypto has to offer uh Raul always Israel will remind us that crypto and macro are the same story and so even though Rick crypto is so young it's it's so risk on it's so small it is still a part of the macro conversation and the macro conversation is very very big right now uh and so I think we do a very good job defining the Contours around crypto the macro environment that is defining the internal crypto environment and then also trying to parse apart what's up with the internal crypto environment like there's a there's a story to unpack there and I think even Raul is a little bit lost and uh lost although patient for crypto to find its footing that's these are the the themes of the episodes I would say and bakeless nation of course stay tuned for the debrief episode that is available for bankless Citizens it's our episode right after the episode we're about to hit record on we've also

financial media and education platform focused on macro investing in crypto he's bootstrapped this company independently from mainstream media just like bankless Raul it's been about a year since we've had you on in what a year it has been welcome back to bankless my friend good to be here yeah it's been one hell of a year I truly has and uh by the way for bankless listeners seeing on on YouTube you can see David and I are actually recording this episode in person this is the first Monday episode we've ever recorded together never would have thought it was possible David it's very cute yeah Raul's seeing it on the other end so uh bankless listener you can see how we do with with this um bro we were hoping that this episode could be one where we get our bearings a little bit as crypto investors um because I think the market particularly maybe crypto investors we're all feeling a little bit lost right now like we're unsure of ourselves we don't know where to go next so we're hoping you could help with that does that sound good yeah of course you know where I wanted to start though was taking a trip down uh Memory Lane because I said in the intro it's been quite a year and I think you agree the last time we had you on the bankless podcast we titled the episode very aptly should we be scared right now okay this was May 16 2022 several months prior crypto had just hit all-time highs I think people were still feeling generally bullish um but the tires were starting to to wobble at that point in time and there were some bad things that were about to hit us um this is a clip from that episode and I I want to play back for the bankless nation just to capture that moment in time let's play that clip I'll take over here yeah it's UST right we talked about I just interviewed doe this morning by the way my goodness well let's talk about that because he didn't he didn't give a lot away what's happening with UST price and Raul I don't know if you want to pull up a chart too yeah when you hopped into this uh recording room UST price was at 98 cents being defended uh do you know what it is right now no it's in 92 cents what a day yeah yeah so that's a billion dollars of stable coloring market cap that's gotten a race in the last uh 30 minutes uh and uh as a monitoring Twitter right now and uh the Luna guard the Luna Foundation that has the BTC has just sent their BTC outbound so they are probably in the process of liquidating 500 million yesterday we continued on in that conversation Raul and we're trying to figure out what in the world was going on at that point in time um and so I think the answer to that episode title should we be scared right now we found out later it was very much yes although we're talking mainly about uh macro in that episode I just want to reflect on you uh with you about the last 12 months in crypto so it was also by the way a Priceless moment the face of mine when I was totally going through the ramifications as I said you know the ramifications of people who were going to get really hurt in that that's what was going through my head at that time it's like oh my God okay co-founder Remy was hugely involved in that space and I'm like he's gonna get wiped out some people did yeah can you tell us what happened so so that was going through your head at that point in time and then what what went on in you know the days and the weeks to come and then maybe zoom out and um and tell us like reflect on the last 12 months in crypto yeah it was the moment when we realized that there was going to be much bigger implications to the space because that was the the the first major Domino that's going to start accelerating everything but having been in this space for quite some time now since 2012-13 I've seen this before many times and it's where narrative suddenly gets to Peak frenzy A Narrative of fear and so it was by June that I started I hadn't I don't really trade a lot so I just kind of you know I'm an accumulator I wait for for opportunities to add and at that point I had realized that okay we're now in the phase where there's Mass liquidation Mass fear a narrative couldn't get much worse it didn't get worse in October I'm not sure because he's never made a new low so this was utter panic because it took people by surprise by October we were kind of used to the fact we were in a our own banking crisis of sorts um but back then it was Peak fear so what I was doing was trying to zoom out I try and spend as much time as possible hearing the noise and then trying to step back out of it to say okay if you filter out the noise what is going on here and it was the deleveraging of the space but my liquidity indicators which I think is the primary driver of well all markets were bottoming so I'm like huh so here we are just take the log trend of Bitcoin or the log trend of eth we'd come down to the log Trend which is the secular uptrend and we're at the bottom of the liquidity cycle which was turning up so that to me was like a golden opportunity and I started making noise about that saying well you know that June period was really an opportunity to start you know significantly adding into the space I'd not sold anything and that if you understood the liquidity cycle in the business cycle which most people in crypto didn't really yet understand that this was going to be a a good opportunity then we play through to the FTX thing which was you know a enormous moment um probably more so for mainstream media than it was for the space itself um and so it became headline news all around the world and again by this stage things like the year-on-year rate of change of M2 which was a big driver of Bitcoin which was my secondary order liquidity indicator had also picked up so I'm like okay here we are when the narrative is completely opposite to the indicators now not all indicators work all the time you know everything is a probabilistic outcome but the probabilities were very high so again I kind of added into that period as well thinking that through thinking okay here's our kind of Mount gox moment here's the big one it's the kind of puking the kitchen sinking of everything of all negative news flow and then since that date I mean firstly it gave me a lot of comfort that eth didn't make a new low in October right that was telling me something major then we started to see even over the FTX period eth starts becoming deflationary it's like huh not even in a bull market it's becoming deflationary that was interesting the Solana story was very interesting to me because Solana had been you know as the cheap narrative goes it's just a VC token but I started to dig in I owned a small amount of Solana but I started to dig in in June um to really look at the ecosystem and look at the depth of the ecosystem and I thought you know what this feels like an eth 2018 moment where it's down 97.5 there's forced liquidations and so that becomes interesting so for me it was a it was an opportunistic year it was hard because the narrative was so violent and you felt so under attack by everybody you know not only did people from the crypto from outside the crypto space turn on everybody on crypto but everybody within crypto turned on each other as well and it was a real moment of ugliness um and so it was hard emotionally hard to try and tune out the noise but if you're truly believe in a longer term time Horizon then these are the opportunities you wait for you know what and I would start to listen to people like Chris beniski who's great at this kind of stuff you know there's a few people Arthur Hayes there's a few people who really understood what what this was in the cycle and that it was an opportunity not a threat then subsequent to that we started to see the Gensler noise ramping up and my hypothesis on Gensler for over a year had been here's going to well there's multiple hypotheses on him but as a negotiator he's going to start with hard no hard no hard no you're going to prison you're all going to die and the space is going to go weird Libertarians we can do anything we want we'll we'll rebuild the Silk Road and you know it's like somewhere there's going to be a compromise and we don't know which side of the line it's all fighting which side of the central line it is obviously against have became politicized with in the process as well um even more so than when he started um and had different ideas what he wants to do what that meant because of his relationship with FTX whether they just wanted scalps who the hell knows but again what was really interesting as Gensler was firing up the narrative and that was becoming the predominant narrative in the space crypto prices were rising in line with liquidity and again that just gave me Comfort that the macro cycle was actually more important and the adoption cycle was continuing and none of this mattered I then started also focusing on there's too many people on crypto Twitter are us-based and so everybody filters everything through their own narrative which is they're going to ban everything it's the US it's the end of crypto but when you look at it the US is only a fraction of crypto yes there's a lot of money there yes a lot of companies building there but in a world of capital that is liquid that moves anywhere it's like water it'll find the easiest path it flows even the EU can't seem to regulate anything very easily got a decent set of rigs across the line then we saw obviously Singapore had obviously put that in place they had a bit of a bloody nose from the FTX Saga but they were still there then the news out of Hong Kong comes then the news out of the UK comes and I'm looking at this thinking we've seen all of this before is the US is trying to become protectionist over the system of money because it is the world's Reserve currency but in a global Capital Market Capital will find a way and my hypothesis has been if the U.S screws this up it'll just go to the UK and I remember speaking to Brett tej Paul and others from coinbase saying you know the probability of you opening your main office in London is extremely high it's like yeah it's easy to get staff to London yeah the weather's a bit [ __ ] but other than that um you know it's it's an easy place to go and you know I my entire time in the finance industry London was the epicenter of everything you know Goldman's main office was London nomuras and Main officers London Society General's main office was London so we know how this plays out and it doesn't stop Capital it just moves it around the board and again the US people were so U.S Centric about this that they were again getting confused over the global adoption which is what we're all in this game for versus can I trade my bags it doesn't matter over the bigger structure of things so I've been very optimistic over this whole period because the narrative was Peak pessimistic and there was only one hypothesis to test is this technology going going away or not that was the only hypothesis you had to have and if you didn't see evidence of it going away um or use cases dying and the other thing that backed up my theories were we saw what 60 billion dollars of VC money go in so there's an incredible amount of startups building new projects building new areas which will form the next foundation for the bull market now we've never seen that much money in the space before I mean it's like 10x the size of the entire hedge fund Market in in crypto just went in like basically two years so you have to start betting on the outcomes of that what does it mean you know what are the opportunities are going to come that we don't realize we know there's infrastructure stuff I know you guys are involved in kind of the ZK side and all sorts of stuff there we're also seeing some new layer ones do they help or not help who knows but we're also seeing I think people working on how to get Mass adoption you know what is the consumerization it's one of the things that also attracted me to the Solana ecosystem as well which is a really small part mainly a my main bets are in Eve but because if I were to say Solana stands for one thing it's a consumer application chain now narrative is everything in this game particularly in crypto the meme wins and if that's their mean that's a nice mean to have because nobody else owns that somebody's going to own blockchain of gaming somebody's going to own blockchain and Finance in the end because I think that's how the space evolves so yeah with all of those macro factors with Peak macro pessimism as well um you know I started getting along the equity market for the same reason it's like the pessimism was obscene people attacking everybody who could be vaguely bullish um made me think okay if the liquidity cycle is turned we know what happens which is over this period the economy will weaken so the probability of more liquidity or more cowbell as I put it comes back into the market and therefore forward-looking asset prices technology crypto will outperform and that's been exactly how it's played out never feels that way because there's so much bloody attacking and misery online but it's actually played out exactly right maybe I can try and put your answer into even more context rule I remember throughout 2021 um it was just an endless onslaught of top signals to the point of where like you started to have to ignore them because even though the from the startup to the end of 2021 was full of top signals like it was still beneficial to have exposure to the market and yet finally the top signals played out and the the top actually came in November of 2021 and uh that's when it was down only from then on out and I think maybe what you're saying is that in the last year or so we've had just a Year's worth of bottom signals you know starting with Terra Luna followed by three hours Capital followed by FTX but around the FTX era I think you're what you're saying is that you started to see some Divergence in some signals versus some bullish indicators and like one of them was the fact that eth did not make a new low during FTX eth started to become deflationary uh and some other you know various signs of strength started to emerge while they there was a growing Divergence in signals right Gary genzer comes in with his heavy Hammer uh everyone gets scared yet there are signals out there even in the midst of mass pessimism Mass depression Mass like infighting in the crypto World there are stronger and stronger signals sources of confidence for you uh that we are towards the end of that and I think that maybe that's really hits home especially when we get the Bitcoin ETF I don't know if that's really going to change the game but it has made people very very happy at the very least so maybe maybe what you're saying is just like man the the pessimism is drying up and at some point people are going to start to hear the signals for what what they are maybe we're not there yet but we're getting there I think the final part of pessimism that's washing through most things in a business cycle terms there tends to be things that lead and things that lag so it looks like eat lead all right bottom first the things the thing that lags is the further out the risk curve which is nfts so nfts are having a horrific time right now you know you can blame it on blur and other stuff but really it's a factor of nfts are recycling of capital within the space so when people are making money they want to buy premium nfts crypto punks or fidenzas or whatever it may be and when everybody's losing money they don't do the same it's the same with high-end real estate it's the same with you know Rolex watches you know we saw that Rolex watch prices come down because of the same reason is once you go out there's kind of trophy assets and stuff there's not enough money around so that is still washing through the space so that's the I think the last part of what has to happen and then as as you say the ETF is the tink of light on the other side now the ETF in itself doesn't cause a stampede if you launch the ETF between June and October you would have had zero uptake but the ETF as prices rising becomes very powerful because most people in this space are momentum investors particularly the raas uh the pension plans and others most people have done the institutions have done the work on this space and all they need is price because they don't look stupid you know everyone's investment committees beat them over the head saying see you were stupid thinking about this but everybody I speak to it's still on their plan I mean don't forget BlackRock we're talking about this during the last cycle you know remember they had Bitcoin on their website and he was talking about I think was saying you know we've had more hits on our website than we've ever had in history you know they've been thinking about this through as have most of the big players so it feels that as the darkness is on nfts we see the light coming for New Capital into the space and then it flows through and again very typically in a cycle you start with the Benchmark asset Bitcoin that outperforms then as the capital comes into the space because each other part of the space is less liquid you put the same amount of money in as it spreads down it causes an outsized reaction in other parts of the space so what what the space does need is New Capital because we've been recycling capital for a while it's the same with economies you know there's no new investment anywhere going on in the global economy right now because of uh except AI because of you know the economic situation nobody's got money but the moment people start making money again it flows through and we'll see um again stuff like the um eth Bitcoin um out performance begin again now interesting enough I've been digging on work on that too and I found that's entirely correlated to the business cycle that I've got a certain set of indicators that kind of suggests when that happens and it's again it's based on liquidity so it's the same thing um so that gets interesting to me as well um we're gonna talk about macro in just a minute because there's lots going on the macro side but in the first um questions of this this conversation the first part of this conversation two questions uh arose in my mind as you were speaking the one is uh how's your co-founder doing how's Remy doing you mentioned you got kind of hit hard I think use the term wiped out in the in the Luna Terra thing is he doing okay look I think it's very hard um because he had left real Vision um and was pursuing some other stuff and he was thinking about the crypto space so I look at it's very hard for him because you have to rebuild your Capital again um but you know he's building his own research service out uh doing some other stuff mainly on the macro side because he used to work with me at Global macro investor as well as my macro analyst so yeah it's you know it's hard we saw a lot of people I thought more people got hurt by the Luna thing then got hurt by FTX yes retail people as well yes and same with Celsius and all of those you know the the the you know centralized exchanges uh you know the C5 stuff that really hurt people um so a lot of people I know got caught out in that not that many people I knew were actually using FTX yeah some funds were I've got an asset management company exponential age Asset Management which invests in digital asset hedge funds it's a funder funds because I think well one of my hypothesis is the secondary markets are starved of capital in the space and we need more participants so we need to create Vehicles much like the ETF does most people will use stuff like hedge funds to give them exposures to the other parts of the space that aren't Bitcoin let me dive into maybe my second question here because you brought it up a couple of times and I really want to hear your perspective on the market right now because I'm bankless I feel like we covered sort of the Builder side of things very well but something that you said that I don't think we cover enough here and I want to get your lens on this is liquidity indicators you say you look at the crypto Market from a there's a series of liquidity indicators you kind of evaluate from time to time how can investors look at crypto from a liquidity perspective like what liquidity indicators do you use that sort of indicated that hey June is a good time to buy hey October November might be a good time to buy tell us more about that so it's complicated the business cycle is what drives liquidity so we can use stuff like the ism survey as where we are in the business cycle if it's below 50 we tend to be in recession real contractually times if it's expanding and above we tend to be expansionary times but what we know is when the economy slows down the answer to that is more liquidity because that's how you stabilize the economy whether it's cutting rates or whether it's increasing the FED balance sheet and I've spent a long time looking at this and developed something that I refer to as the everything code we could talk a bit about that later but so there's a bunch of liquidity measures they're not easy to do some of them you can get on trading view I think because some people have built them one is fed net liquidity which is U.S Centric which I don't think is the most important and that is basically uh the FED balance sheet minus the treasury general account which is the treasury building or reducing liquidity and the reverse repo that those three things and they actually have mirrored asset prices pretty well but it's not all about the us as we talked about before so then you need a global proxy so the global proxy that's easier for people to find is global money supply but again even that's difficult because there's no one measure of global money supply so you have to kind of construct it yourself but again I think people have got that on trading view now whether how good it is or not I don't know because we use Bloomberg and uh refinitive and other data sources and then finally the big daddy at all is we've got the global macro investor which is my research service the weekly liquidity index that's based around the G5 central bank balance sheet so that's the US the ECB uh the pboc in China the bank of Japan and the bank of England that seems to explain 97 of the entire price movement of the NASDAQ and about 87.5 of Bitcoin the reason why Bitcoin actually has a lower correlation than NASDAQ is because of the upcycles because the adoption rate is so high because it goes up the blow-off tops right that is the reason because the compounding of that but other than that it's all driven by this factor which is the central bank balance is different to the general liquidity in the market I.E money supply and stuff like that the central bank balance sheet is actually debasement of currency so debasement of fiat currency is a thing that most people don't understand because it's it's not obvious but when you are printing more of a currency particularly when all the central banks are doing it you're lowering the denominator which is the same why the Venezuelan stock market looks like it goes vertical it's because the the Bolivar keeps going lower so that is what is driving almost all asset prices so once I started adjusting for that I realized there was two assets that did better than anything else everything else like equities divided by the FED balance is a simple way of doing it you know for people who can't find a larger set of thing the S P's got nowhere since about 2012 since QE really became prevalent or 2008 really um and we found the same with real estate Gold Everything technology yes why adoption trends right technological adoption is Relentless and the other one that beats it all obviously is crypto because it's got the technological adoption um and it counteracts the debasement so once I found those out I realized liquidity was going to become the really important driver and I think it'll be the thing people talk about for this cycle and now whether it fully works all the way through or not remains to be seen so it's a little bit hard for people um to look at it themselves some people have um got some indicators of IT Tech Dev on Twitter I post a bit of this stuff I understand it's hard for people to do and if I can in due form we're just building out a new real Vision platform I'll try and make some templates for people that they can use um to make it a bit easier because it is incredibly powerful and really helps but Raul the basic story is when you see central bank balance sheets growing when you see currency the basement when you see that denominator being debased then that's an indicator to be bullish on assets and particularly crypto assets that's generally the all-in indicator before that you'll see so it will stabilize exposure now that's right so usually it stabilizes first if you remember 2018 the FED had been shrinking the balance sheet most of the sent Global central banks did the FED go and pause some of the other central banks start doing the same that moment assets took off Bitcoin was up 300 um into June or July of that year then corrected uh into 2020 but that period of pause is like the somebody taking the foot off the beach ball and it rises out above the water then the thing that lifts it is when they really start expanding the balance sheet I when recession is coming or you've got a banking crisis both of which we're toying with right now this is the summer month so it tends to get a bit quieter but that narrative probably picks up again and the beach ball gets lifted up by the gust of wind so this is the kind of moment in liquidity where things have bottomed because the central bank balance sheet stopped at um shrinking and Japan started um printing a bit China started increasing money supply the UK had to print quickly because if it had a pension crisis and then the FED had to print quickly for the bank crisis these were isolated events but they're the markers that we know the more cowbell is coming um and then we're waiting for okay when do they really swing into action money printer go Burr you know you can use the the very simple bell curve meme of the money printer go Burr that's the one that that's the big signal so really it's all about setting yourself up for for that big signal because crypto spring which is where I think we got to from October tend to be choppier harder to trade it's not an up only Market it tends to make good progress but it tends to be complicated because there's a lot of opposite narratives which we're seeing right people don't trust this rally because of banning or because of this because of that yeah so setting ourselves up for the big indicator the big moment I think that's kind of what we're all dancing around so far in this conversation we've talked about like the internal to crypto conversations right like just a Year's worth of negative signals seems to be like not having the same impact so that means that the big signal that's hopefully bullish is you know sooner rather than later hopefully and then we have the external indicators which we're talking about you touched on one of them but there's a few others uh Rel that I can think of inflation is not yet tamed we have a geopolitical tectonic shifts going on right now like you touched on the banking the banking crisis what are the big external indicators that are worth noting like like I said you talked about the the banking crisis but if we're looking for the big signal that tells us like hey it's it's safe to go risk on because that denominator is about to about to shift in our favor what are the what are the big macro external signals to the crypto world that you're paying attention to one is banking crisis right The Proven outcome for a banking crisis is inject Liquidators into the system we also know that there's a commercial real estate crisis so there's two parts of this crisis one is the banks themselves having deposit flights because of the mismatch of interest rates between what they offer their customers versus money market funds right that's not going to stop until the FED cut so there's a bleed of assets that come out of the banking system but the big one is commercial real estate nobody goes to the office anymore so we don't know how big Ryan comes to my house exactly um we don't know how big that is but it's in the one to two trillion dollar range I mean that's trillion with a t these are big numbers and this stuff nobody's ever going to use this offices ever again so it's going to end up on somebody's balance sheet and it'll end up on the central bank balance sheet but that's probably a 2024 2025 story when things really pick up so what else forces the central banks into the game it usually is the old ones inflation falling or unemployment Rising you know I'd use the you know as a good proxy for where inflation is going to be headline inflation is going to be in a couple of years a couple of months just use trueflation you know it's the on-chain um inflation thing that's about what 2.3 percent I mean I've been saying this for a while is I think there's a probability that headline inflation certainly PPI inflation is negative um over the summer now core inflation is a bit stickier but there's a extremely strong narrative maybe the strongest narrative they've ever seen in financial markets that inflation is going to be around forever and it's sticky because people pull up the chart of the 1970s C and say see it's going to happen they're imposing their own belief system onto markets as opposed to observing markets as an input as an impartial participant so I think that in that narrative needs to get crushed now don't forget a banking crisis is the single most deflationary thing that could ever happen except for AI which is the single most deflationary thing that could ever happen okay like can we talk about that for for a minute because I I don't know that the bankless uh bankless listeners have fully absorbed your take on inflation right I I feel like somewhat the accepted narrative on inflation right now among kind of macro gurus and the rest of of crypto is that inflation will be a persistent thing this decade right so we'll have um I mean we had what eight nine percent in kind of you know the uh the government uh inflation rates and that's dropped I think we're like four percent annualized a couple weeks ago and so it's going down but people are saying well that's a brief dip and then we'll go back towards towards double digits inflation will be a persistent thing for the 2020s for for many of the reasons the basement reasons other reasons that macro folks mentioned I think you take the opposite view yeah I think you are you think that well why don't you tell us you think actually Raul because I think it's a bit more you think deflation will be more the the take here the largest driver of everything of all economic activity in all of the developed countries is demographics GDP growth is driven by population growth productivity growth and probably debt growth what we've got is population shrinking in most countries or in the US at least stable but the birth death rates collapsed right so there is no population increase and most people have closed Borders or throttled their borders somewhat because there's a scarcity of job opportunities because of globalization so people have tended to throttle back on on on immigration okay so that tends to be the big um forward indicator for inflation it's very difficult to have an old population generating inflation I mean you know I've talked about this a lot when I saw my father retired I mean his spending probably fell 65 in the first two years of retirement it's a psychological effect the psychological effect is I don't know how long I'm going to live for am I going to run out of money right that is so powerful as a fear that people will entirely change their spending patterns there is a school of thought came out of one paper the Aging population is inflationary because those people will spend their money but it's the rate of change of spending money that's important here the Baby Boomers might have a lot of money but how do they pass it on what was very interesting is we saw this in Japan their old population eventually ended up living longer than expected pass it on to their kids who had retired so it just didn't get recycled into the economy never did so I'm not a so I'm a believer that the demographics are a problem I understand that there is a scarcity of jobs in some areas and that drives wages up but when the labor force participation rate is 62 percent there's 38 percent of the people who don't get wage Rises so aggregate effect wage Rises aren't as pervasive they don't drive demand which drives inflation so that's that the productivity side of the equation of GDP growth we're seeing things like Ai and new technologies coming in that replace workers so if you look at Amazon now has I think it's a one and a half million employees and half a million robot employees if you think of them in those terms those robots work 24 7. 365 they're more productive than humans in the roles that they do but let's assume that the same productivity so they've got an equal robot man hours versus man hours and that equation is going to keep happening because technology does one thing it looks at the highest cost and destroys it so everything that gets digitized goes to zero in cost we've seen it with Cloud compute with mobile phone data with literally everything so that pervasive trend of technology and the productivity of Technology plus demographics makes it almost impossible so why we got the inflation is not a function of the money that got printed that washes in and washes out it was a function of no Supply because factories were having to re get back up online and Supply chains were broken and everybody coming out of lockdowns that demand and Supply we saw exactly that after World War II same outcome we've been following the charts identical is inflation Rises up and then it just collapses back down you'll have an echo because of the year-on-year effects but it doesn't come back and I don't see a reason why it's going to come back when I press people to say show me they say de-globalization I'm like fine when I look at the amount of World Trade it's basically stabilized it's not shrinking and we're also seeing Supply chains change so the US moves away from China and moves to Mexico so all coming back to the US so I'm like somebody needs to show me a real data driven reason why inflation is going to stick usually when you get down to it when you open your mind and listen to what they're saying it's they're manifesting their own fears or desires it's the fear of the 70s Redux that's coming from an older group because they want Justice for what central banks have done they want their Justice they want to be proven that if you mess around with money it creates inflation I don't think it does it creates acid inflation because of the denominator effect I think inflation is very hard to actually create for extended periods of time without demand and that has to come from population so just to be clear on what what you think you you believe in your thesis so you're a big believer like debasement you see that as happening right now and kind of inevitable and you're tracking that very precisely you don't think that will manifest in terms of CPI price inflation kind of the common definition of inflation although you do think it will manifest an asset price inflation which is sort of a separate category that we'll put aside and the reason you don't think will manifest in the form of CPI inflation Consumer Price Index inflation is because aging population demographics we're not growing as fast as we used to Baby Boomers are aging uh and they're going to be spending Less in developed countries in particular and also because of Technology Innovation and digital Technology Innovation AI that sort of thing so you think that counteracts my question you then Raul is so where does all this debasement manifest does all the debasement that you see happening does that just get pushed into asset prices is that where it manifests it doesn't go into core CPI inflation correct so look what's happened once you understand this process you can see that real wages have not risen since 1972. the reason being is you put the largest population boom in all history the Baby Boomers into the workforce at the same time they compete with each other for wages so wages didn't go up after that you get globalization um and technology and it makes it really hard for wages to go up 2008 the world changed we reset all debt to zero interest payments and we started printing money and what happened is asset prices took off now if you change the denominator many of the assets actually didn't really take off they're just cyclical but it meant that the average person was now poorer every year in the number of assets they could own so the assets going up doesn't really help a lot of people because the majority of people don't have assets yeah the house you live in maybe but you live in that what are you going to do liquidate it and live on the street and it's not really it's it's a lifestyle asset but it's not an asset per se yeah in an emergency situation it could be but people own you know the average millennial can afford a fraction of the s p that they could that their that their parents their baby boomer parents could when they were 30. a fraction of the real estate a fraction of gold a fraction of everything which is why I've been a big proponent of crypto as the one opportunity for the younger generation and Technology because those are the only things that are going to really accrue wealth in the same way that your parents did from just buying the S P 500 you know and you need to beat the balance sheet as well which is growing at what seven percent a year or something um on average so you've got quite a high hurdle rate to actually get richer so once you understand the world in these terms you understand why populism Rose so fast right people just turned around and said well I'm not participating the Market's all-time highs the billionaires are all laughing drinking champagne flying jets and we can barely afford anything it's also the same discussion why people get very voracious about the argument about not ruling out fossil fuels particularly in the US because fossil fuels is the is the cost input traveling to work and the basic things of life and everyone's fearful that if you change systems like the EU is doing you'll increase the cost of living on people and nobody can do it because they're all like this so it's a it's a really complicated world and it's and it's not necessarily inflation that's the huge enemy here yeah inflation really hurt people over the last two years it's really hurt people because the price of goods never goes down deflation you know might happen for one or two percent never comes down so the cost of living has gone up and it went up more than their wages and that won't change metamask has something new introducing metamask portfolio metamask portfolio is the best way to view

secure fast cheap and friction free I opened up the AI conversation I want to make sure we we fully unpack that there's it seems to be like Schrodinger's position of is AI in a bubble or is AI about to cause massive deflation I think there's there's without a doubt a lot of bubble signals but also at the last jobs report I saw there was actually a line item for reasons why you lost your job and some to thousands of people said that they lost their job because of AI so I want to ask your position your your perspective on the AI industry in this present moment like it kind of feels bubbly like where Nvidia is priced 30 higher than its 2021 top the world can't stop talking about chat GPT uh like the crypto people are jealous of all the attention that AI is getting Jason calcanus tweets out if you're in crypto pivot to AI uh but also at the same time like we are also seeing people report that they've they're losing their jobs to AI indicating that some sort of deflationary pressure so I can kind of see the argument for both cases like yeah like companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars for ideas that they just started a couple months ago but like I said at the same time there are deflationary forces so like overall what's your what's your whole read on the state of AI in this present moment and as it relates to just like the rest of investing in markets I think AI is the most powerful technology Humanity has probably ever developed maybe with the exception of the splitting of the atom I don't think people understand what this means yet they still think it's like a gadget or a widget or a bit of the internet it is in fact if you think of scarcity the world everybody in crypto understands we replaced the scarcity of humans by creating the machines that was the Agricultural Revolution the industrial revolution of technological Revolution the one thing that we had as humans that were scarce was knowledge knowledge is now infinitely scalable there is no reason to have as many doctors lawyers accountants almost anybody producers editors writers marketers you name it I mean it's staggering and we've only don't forget here's us going oh well it's a bubble with we're six months into this since gpt4 came out it's gone from zero to 120 million users it went there in five months in five weeks I will say rather if the my frame of reference is crypto and if you got into crypto six months after you heard about it you're halfway through 2021. I don't know if AI moves at the same time frames that AI does but that's my perspective on just like yeah we're six months into it it could be kind of late so if you bought Facebook in 2012 it had some big ups and downs but just kept going right that was that the wave of of social media and that's part of the internet um so where are we in the bubble well it's virtually uninvestable you can buy some semiconductor stocks you can buy Microsoft that does a whole [ __ ] ton of other stuff you could buy Google we haven't started the bubble in this if it's as big a disruptive technology we're going to have one Epic bubble and we'll be looking in what though so that that's the question I I was going to ask as well Raul like how do people invest in this thing I'm gonna get exposure to the bubble yeah I mean one way to do it one thing it you know I would I would advise everyone listening to this is make sure you have an AI proof career and job and that begins with leveraging AI to the maximum degree in whatever you are doing right now are you creating content make sure you are using an AI assistant to help you create that content David is pointing to me right now you know are you a writing marketing copy make sure you are using an AI are you a graphic designer how are you leveraging something like mid-journey to actually help you you know kind of plan the next thing to develop so that that's one thing from a career perspective but I mean this is an investor podcast too Raul and I I can't figure out how to invest in this thing I'm not going to go buy Nvidia stuff no I mean I would buy what I've done is buy the SMH ETF that's the semis because it's not just Nvidia so okay so it's less scary than Nvidia and the semi Cycles just turned higher again it's driven by the business cycle we have forward looking forecast that should last for another two or three years so that and it tends to outperform the NASDAQ in these Cycles the NASDAQ itself pretty easy way of getting exposure to this whole Space then you could go down to individual stocks they've got so many other component parts Microsoft Google uh Tesla is a no-brainer in this I mean there's a reason um Elon bought Twitter and it's not because he wants so open playing field of debate it's because he wants all of the natural language of humans in the way that they interact with each other at scale because it because don't forget he's got the Optimus robot he's got the self-driving cars and he's Drive he's building the world's fastest supercomputer dojo so everybody's in this game so those stocks will do well um and then there'll be other opportunities that come whether somebody manages to go public whatever it is or it ends up being a gigantic VC bubble of course it will do you know we've seen this play out and play out um but the bubbles I mean we've only been going for six months these things usually go three four years before you have a big wipe out of capital A resetting off we go again tell me your take on this Rel so I think um we are and I am early in thinking and and you know David as well beckless is early in thinking as um of crypto as a potential AI investment vehicle Okay this may be a ways ahead of the narrative this may also be my bags and bias talking as well but you have to start thinking about all of the um AI agents that are emerging I mean just you just mentioned Amazon's Workforce right if you think of like knowledge intelligent artificial intelligence agents AI agents they will compose the largest unbanked population in the world they don't have an identity they don't have a Social Security number they don't have a driver's license what money system are they going to prefer it's not going to be Wells Fargo dollars that's for sure it's going to be some sort of programmable digital Ledger system and so when you start to think about that and again this is uh this is still a ways out in the future but you start to look at crypto again and say well this is we've built a digital programmable money system for AIS potentially right you want to create a capital structure as a set of artificial intelligence agents you can register a Delaware LLC no you're going to form a dow you're gonna register it on Jane you're going to have your banking apparatus in defy not JP Morgan and so we might be ahead of that narrative but is the is this just my bags talking or do you think there's something to that fun fact if you actually ask chatgpt what money system it would likely use what crypto money system it says it'll tell you ethereum um well it's proven to be the money of the internet right if there's a single currency of the internet currently it'll be ethereum okay here's how I think about it I developed a thesis called the exponential age which you've heard me bleat on about and that's the Nexus of all of these Technologies from crypto to AI to robotics to genetic Sciences to space to distribute a computing power and all of these internet of things all of this stuff they all are part of the same thing which is an entirely new technological infrastructure of the world and applications of the world so the blockchain sits at the middle of that and helps a lot of it become more efficient as as you rightly say the currency of the machines is likely to be the cryptocurrency in its format so I think that is a decent thesis but that's a way off you know your fridge paying Amazon to upload will happen right The Internet of Things what is it gonna do that streaming payments in we don't know you know the central banks are trying to get into this game as well by figuring out can they get faster and faster ways of payments but there's that the other thing is what's really interesting to me that most people don't think about is what is the compute called for AIS the tokens right you you pay for a certain number of tokens right it's obvious to me that a tokenization of an AI open AI Network makes total sense because you create a payment system for paying the tokens using the tokens it can create an economy so if there's one way for the machines to create an economy it's the tokenization of itself as a network right most of these are not a closed networks right now stability Ai and there's a few others are open source okay that leads itself even the fact that you are paying for tokens to use tokens for that I think that makes a tremendous amount of sense as it does with Cloud compute and other big open networks of this sort and finally the other one is I know you guys are involved in the kind of ZK ecosystem I think identity um it is going to be the most pressing and Urgent part of this first because we are going into a U.S election let's see how hot it's going to be as an election but if we've got a very polarizing set of candidates we are going to see an enormous amount of use of AI both good and bad and we will not know what content is authentic what people are authentic we already struggling with Twitter with authenticity all of this needs to get resolved and I think blockchain is the way of doing it so Raul you think AI is every every bit as hypey as it should be or let me just say it's it's it's definitely going to live up to all of the expectations and and all of the hype that has uh front ran over over time look just people need to get their heads around simple things it's like watch the deepmind go documentary when Google built this large language model called deepmind they kind of pioneered it came out of the UK that thing started competing against the world go Champion which is supposed to be the most complex board game strategic board game that that humans can play it wins the first bunch of them playing normal kind of go strategies it then loses a game and it the next game after that the commentators and it's all filmed are like what the hell is it doing this is stupid moves this doesn't make any sense it then never lost a game ever again and the only thing that can beat it is new versions of deepmind it had learned to play go in a way that humans had never played go and it would never have been taught the rules it learned the rules and it was that transition you see it on the on the documentary where people are like I don't understand this then we've started hearing stories out of Google X their internal Labs which is like this thing has some elements of sentience whatever that means these are all charge terms just go and say does it have a form of intelligence that we don't understand or a way of learning even simpler than that a way of learning we don't understand then go and watch the Sam Altman Lex Friedman interview when Sam stops and goes to Lex do you think we've built AGI and Lex pauses and goes I don't think so no one knows they don't know because the issue is here is this thing learns in ways we understand we've seen it learn languages that it had never been taught so it's learning and every time we ask it questions it's learning more the more data we put in it it's learning more we don't know how it learns or what it learns so what we're now stuck with nobody knows how these models work not Sam Altman nobody so when you so how I think about it is we're restricted by our own language so it's like if you've got broken Spanish and you speak to a Spanish person a native Spanish speaker you can't assess their intelligence because you don't even know how to ask the questions because you're limited by your language and understanding and that's where I think we are with this I'm not saying we've developed AGI but I'm saying is we don't know what we've developed but the power of it is enormous so well we we've done a few episodes now on kind of the existential threat of of artificial general intelligence super intelligence systems of course and I don't want to run us a field and talk about that um but rather I want to ask you a question I'm wondering if you've given any thought to this about the societal impact if what you say comes true and what you're talking about comes true so we are talking about already um asset price inflation for all the reasons we've talked about which is just going to exacerbate wealth inequality now people are also going to be hit with the same time their jobs literally being taken away by artificial intelligence agents it's not clear that society's governance systems Western liberal democracies let's call them can adapt fast enough to respond to this level of change you just think think even about the the tax code right there are so many ways for our wealthy individuals to kind of circumvent taxes and all sorts of various ways right and so you know their wealth can accrue far more rapidly um how are we going to tax AI agents what does that world even look like and I'm almost wondering if the world doesn't and societies don't start to buckle under this all of these external forces that are kind of hitting them they're not able to respond fast enough to this level of change and before we have to worry about some sort of existential risk from an artificial general intelligence we have to worry about kind of 19 late 1930s level populism and um societal Decay as a result of all of these forces coming to play and the change being far too rapid what's your take on this do you think we will be able to weather these storms as as a world as uh you know a global Collective of humans trying to navigate our way or do you think that we're in force and tumultuous times as a result of these changes so if you think of the AGI of the global population of eight billion people trying to solve a problem it's still very very powerful the machines are not at that level so my guess is we reorganize society which we know we're we're in need of and it's underway right crypto was one of the first parts of that it came precisely from a moment where it's like we need to reorganize the financial system I think we reorganize society and many of the jobs that people do they don't want to do what are the jobs in the future and I go with Mark Andreessen I don't think if it's all roses for sure but I go with Mark andreessen's idea that humans will reorganize and create different opportunities my thesis and I don't know is that community-based work because people are social and working within communities enabled by web3 I think is a big way for people to earn a living you know if they help bankless increase yeah banklesses reach productivity economic situation and their participants in your network and they participate in it then everybody's got alignments of Interest we live in a globalized digital nation states right now uh and I think we'll fractionalize into smaller and smaller digital nation states of which we can earn a living from so I do think there's different opportunities that will come but I think basis of knowledge is not going to be the the human opportunity much like physical force is not a human opportunity any longer but I do think also within this is we're we're entering a Renaissance period of productivity growth so opportunities are going to be vast for a period of time opportunities to use the technology to utilize it to augment yourself to augment your businesses is staggering in nature um so I do think there's a lot of opportunity to be gained by many and so there will be that friction of the opportunity to be gained the advances and then the reorgan of societies in new ways and that's going to feel friction friction full but I do believe it's part of the fourth turning you know the Neil how William Strauss thesis feels spot on to me it's the changing of generations it's the changing of systems it's the changing of the rules-based global order system in the way that it stands today as you said our institutions are really not able to deal with this like they're not able to deal with crypto they're barely able to deal with the internet we're still regulating internet stuff and we can't get around to figuring how this is so it's gonna happen naturally in a way that we don't yet understand I want to zero back in on the uh the crypto side of this conversation because I think we've uh illustrated The Contours around crypto pretty damn well we've talked about macro talked about AI as a the the big Force that's parallel to crypto uh there's sentiment in and outside of crypto don't take no parallel by the way I think they're converging but that's the importance yes yes yes yeah um definitely on a certainly on a collision course specifically though on the internal to crypto side of things and I really like the articulation of just like we're all kind of waiting for the big inflection moment and that's also how the bull market started the crypto bull market started uh last cycle 2020 compound launches governance their governance token and all of a sudden we had the appetite for tokens and before that moment there was there was brewing bullishness there was brewing excitement and but that was a very clear single moment of just like oh it's on and I think everyone in crypto is is waiting for that I think think my personal take is we are just now starting to heat up for my being it's going through a very very cold winter and we're still looking for that that inflection moment it's like oh it's we all have conviction that it's on now but we still as an industry we still feel lost right like like I said AI is the sparkly new thing that has stolen our attention there's still macro overhead clouds we still have Gary Gensler so I'm wondering just Rel like for the crypto native investor who is looking to get their foundations strong and be prepared to capture the maximum amount of opportunity to go into the future to wherever this next cycle and in crypto this next phase in crypto leads us how should investors be positioned how should they get their feet uh their feet fixed on the ground like what should they be thinking about in terms of making sure that they actually capture the upside that hopefully inevitably does come look it gets harder and harder to reach cycle because you've got more and more assets and more and more applications so it's it's actually not easy so for the general person you know ether's a good proxy you know anytime you try and spray outside of that you're just following narratives unless you really are involved in a space and you understand what drives it the adoption rates you know the metcalf's law stuff all of this stuff it is very very hard to figure out how to trade it so I think keep it simple stupid is generally the best outcome unless you're deep into a particular area of the space but then you still can't be blinded by your own biases because we don't know what the next big breakout is going to be you know we didn't know it was going to be D5 we didn't know it was going to be nfts we didn't know many of these things what's it going to be this time I have no bloody idea what are going to be the big applications this time is it going to be gaming I have no idea I'm not a gamer and it has zero appeal to me but to other people it's everything you know is it going to be the application of music and culture and all of the other things that you know I've been working on possibly could could that happen yes we just don't know could it be something to do with AI and tokenizing the tokens possibly could it be with digital ID possibly that's the hard thing about this space now you have to be a kind of deeply knowledgeable VC investor you know and that's not my skill set so it is and that's one of the reasons I set up the asset management firm because I'm just filing it out to hedge funds because it's their job to do it because it's hard so I don't really have a good answer for you I wish I did what about in crypto generally I mean are you a Believer maybe maybe this is uh more broadly to all the kind of investors like retail investors are you a believer in kind of active investing or more passive right so if you're if you're talking crypto you just mentioned hey keep it simple stupid um eth is a good proxy for a lot of the Innovation and upside in the space so maybe we're kind of saying like not Financial advice of course but eth is a reasonable hold in this type of a market but but like passive versus active investing uh you know maybe make the bull case for for for active for us and you know the bookcase for for Passive because I could see the merits of both so I look at Twitter and see the active so that means generally you've got a short-term time Horizon this is a very volatile asset class so it's really difficult to figure out what's a real Trend and what's not we're seeing that with the mean tokens right yeah attention and and a mean can last can be pervasive and last decades or or Millennia in the case of religion or it can last a weekend in the case of a mean token so it's really hard to better trade that and I think most people end up Net Zero or net losing money um then there's the people who do the fundamental work we've seen that work quite well in nfts but there's a lot of people who've been absolutely blown to pieces in that space too because they always see somebody else getting hilariously rich and they think that they should do it when if they just had some basic exposure they would do better doing it the other side is the completely passive way which is you just buy a basket of stuff or just hold some Ethan just sit with it and forget about it and add those macro cycles and just keep going that works really well it's worked for the Bitcoin people who've been in it forever works for these people it just works but most of us want to feel like we're just doing something that we're not just because we get bored and we like the attention span there's all the noise around it so what I tend to do is I have a few cross rates that I look at so back in 2020 back into 20 I had the Bitcoin eth cross all the time staring at it and I was waiting for that breakout then I switched most of my portfolio because I I saw the changing narratives between the two the adoption everything else and I switched most of my investment into eth back then I'm looking at and I wouldn't do it to the same extent because it's not as big but I'm looking at for example the Solana eth cross you know does that stop moving so would I switch Capital based on something like that yes I might increase an allocation so at least I feel like I'm doing something because it's otherwise you know half the time I've got the hourly chart of eth next to me but I don't trade it you kind of drive yourself nuts sometimes you just want to trade it and we don't all have infinite capital and we can keep buying it and keep buying it so you just kind of have to pretend you're in the game partly and then maybe make these bigger asset allocations that you think could move the dial and um I think those can be very rewarding one thing I appreciate about your perspective roles you seem to be a juggler of many signals uh you've talked about you've got the The Ether bitcoin price chart maybe it's somewhere to your left on the screen or something you looked at the liquidity indicators and then you also talked about narratives uh where do you get some of the more social squishy signals from like obviously crypto Twitter but maybe something more an answer more precise than that would be would be great where do you get the if if indeed like investing is hard there's so many more Assets Now there's so many more potential bullish use cases that might emerge first and foremost out of crypto where are you looking in this fear of crypto information sphere are you getting your those kinds of signals from yeah so what I'm trying to do here using all of these things there is no single source of truth right all we're trying to do is create a probabilistic framework and the best we can build our probability set and again it's not a mathematical thing it's kind of intuitively if I've got all of these signals then that's giving me a higher rate of conviction so I tend to operate with crypto Twitter at two levels one is overall sentiment who's killing who who's attacking who who's angry why are they angry right it's not who and what they're angry about it's why that really matters and understanding whose narrative is under threat how they're feeling emotionally threatened by something happening what does that mean is there opportunities in this is there something informational of value then I try and look at the people and it rotates it's not always because nobody has a source of truth and not everybody's right all the time but you just start trying to keep an eye on people who are doing something interesting or thinking in different ways and I think that becomes interesting you know there's there's people like Chris benisky who just kind of is not affected by all the noise and sticks to his own thing doesn't mean he's always right but I find that very interesting you know people at Arthur Hayes Arthur's pretty good at this kind of stuff as well doesn't mean he's always right but he's building a thesis you know he's he bought a thesis around nft platforms and then stuff like um Dex is and what you could do there interesting macro thesis looking for supporting evidence stuff like that so I try to look for people who are talking about interesting stuff from a non-emotional standpoint that's driven by a deeper understanding of the space that's not just because they're actively involved in it um but something about you know this is why I think it's interesting here's the application and here's what I'm seeing that becomes very interesting to me and then crypto Twitter on top is just the monkeys throwing poo at each other and you just see who they're throwing poo at and why um and you derive some signal from that yes because increasingly I'm having a hard time with that but well it is because you know nft Twitter has been busy destroying each other um Bitcoin Twitter has been reshuffling also just reshuffling its own narrative which is actually great to see I agree uh really really positive to finally to see a change of narrative for that ecosystem that's great eth doesn't really have a new narrative yet because we haven't seen a new application come so it's like it works it's got its yield it does its thing but we don't have a new narrative most of most places in the space are still missing narratives um so that's why everybody's feeling a little bit under threat and hates each other for anything anybody says but it's you know crypto Twitter is is still very toxic you can't say anything without somebody criticizing you for something you've said um and not in a normal debative fashion but just it's just insult after Intel after insult and because people are losing money and as soon as they lose money they get angry it's like you've got to understand time Horizon and what the game you're in because if you think you're in a different game you're going to get blown up I think they lost money and I think um part of the prevailing sentiment from coming from 2022 is they were scammed by a particular set of actors so now there's just a blanket distrust and they're overly crypto Twitter's overly volatile for the smallest of things can set um your tribe of pitchforks after you and I'm sure you've experienced some of that as as have we certainly um I'm curious what all this means for your portfolio though Raul like one thing uh we always ask at the end of these toward the end of these episodes is um what does your portfolio portfolio look like today so this is summer 2023 is it is it a super boring portfolio or like what are you doing you know I don't change a lot right I'm very consistent in what I do so it's still on a 80 eighth bit of Solana small bit of Bitcoin and a tale of a few things that I bought because I want to just feel the prize you know Matic or whatever that I'm not tied to because then you mention anything on Twitter and everyone destroys you and attacks you so it's so tiresome um so basically it's the same bet that I've had um and I I don't really change it you know I put money in when I could um and I'll wait to see you know when I got a bit more cash I'll maybe put some more in given the right opportunity depending how the market trades have you increased or decreased your net exposure to crypto as a part of your greater portfolio so I haven't sold anything so that answers something and then I added so I probably increased it by 30 40 in June June to October nice nice a good time to do that um well Raul as always this has been a fantastic conversation I want to maybe end in in kind of a summary form with the question we sort of started with and what I think has been the theme of this episode as we've talked about you know the last year how crazy that was in crypto so we talked about macros we talked about AIS we talked about this uh exponential age um just with getting our bearings and you know that term kind of getting our bearings I feel like as David mentioned earlier and we've talked about a few times this episode crypto feels a little bit lost right now like it doesn't know where it is it's somewhere out on the sea and it's not sure what direction to point to and that term you know get getting your bearings was a nautical term right it's like getting your bearings on on the compass and it it kind of brings the question of like what is our True North in crypto where should we be pointed what are the use cases that um will still remain going into the next cycle what are the narratives that will still remain can you kind of summarize this for the typical crypto investor who's maybe feeling punched in the gut from uh the last year or so of a bear Market what is the true north for crypto in your mind the true north is not narrative because narrative changes and this bull market will have a different narrative in the next bear Market will have a different bear Market narrative so narrative shifts there is one way of navigating it which is a very simple way that I use is the log Trend channel of this and that keeps you honest with where you are and what's going on so I find that very useful the other thing is I did a lot of work on what drives price action in the space and it's metcalf's law that I've written extensively about and you can basically estimate metcalf's law by two factors one is the number of active users and this applies to the whole whole equipto or just any ecosystem you want and then the other predominant factor is that value transacted in a week or a month in dollar terms right people have all sorts of different measures but those two together basically describe most of price and what I found is that I checked it against pretty much all of the major tokens and they all are priced accurately so like there's no informational Edge in knowing that thing so it's not like an Arbitrage opportunity is different it trades at a premium and I think that was because of yield whether it's yield or whether it's the burn mechanism I'm not sure the combo of the two so okay fine I think we'll see that in other chains that do similar stuff but if we step back and say okay what is the informational value I've got there you only need to know two things for the entire space to know what whether the economy of crypto is growing or not it's are the active addresses going up or down is the value being transacted going up or down and if those things are trending up over time the ecosystem is in economic expansion if it's not it's in recession it's really helpful because it goes to data as opposed to narrative and what are we right now are we you know we are still relatively flat we're starting to see activity coming back you know we've started to see the uh the active addresses Rising we're starting to see activity Rising as we should be at this stage in the cycle the crypto spring we're starting to see people people come out of hibernation start exercising those muscles again but we're not operating across everywhere so we're seeing you know nfts dead as a door nail but we start to see more activity in Bitcoin now bitcoin's great because it has huge value transacted um if there's a lot more transactions but there are lower in economic value just the nature of the chains so it this is really you know and xrp really interesting is because it has very low value transactions but a lot of them they all work out all of these workout roughly it's fascinating I think bro a lot of the indicators that you kind of just listed just now are all lagging indicators uh like one of the indicators I look at is like gas fees the when there's more gas being burnt when there's more eth being burnt it's bullish and usually it's uh as a after the price has already risen right transaction fees go up when there is more activity so these are all lagging indicators I'm wondering what your disposition or perspective is on when the timing to get exposure is as a result of like confirmation of indicators that you know are are lagging versus things that you actually try and predict the future about so if my hypothesis is the price is correct versus network activity I.E all crypto most tech stocks as well are priced are priced on metcal's law if price because there's so many participants discovering price every day is roughly right that actually means that technical analysis is pretty useful which is really interesting because price doesn't lie um so I think there's that and then there's the liquidity business cycle the understanding of the flow of money around the world and a basement those things give you a forward look everything else is just checking your hypothesis you know am I getting caught away with an excess narrative or is there is this continuing to to confirm my hypothesis that over time activity in this in in blockchain technologies will increase so it's a check versus a forecast and you just keep looking at those two things some people though Raul you said kind of the economic indicators are flat right now so some people right now are saying and they're going to remain flat right um that's it we've seen kind of crypto bubble and you know I I feel like they say that at this time every at every point in this type of a cycle um at the same time maybe maybe this time is different right um what are you saying in terms of the average crypto investor inter getting their bearings are you saying that we should just maintain course be patient that this is just kind of early Springtime how do you know that we will get to a number another summer season that we will have another bull market in the future are you taking that on faith or is there something more to the thesis here so if there were two factors that drive the crypto Market overall at the macro level one is liquidity and the other is the adoption of the technology so if you assume that liquidity doesn't come back bye nothing changes does the ecosystem grow do we get new applications for the technology in which case it'll perform just not as well as previous Cycles if you've got liquidity as well which is is the economy looking [ __ ] is it going to remain [ __ ] are the central banks gonna have to do something about it because unemployment's starting to rise or inflation's starting to to come off too sharply or the banking system is blowing up those factors then you bring the liquidity equation back in currently we've got the liquidity equation and a little bit of the adoption equation coming in The Sweet Spot of the market is when both are happening so I don't think we would have for it to do something catastrophically different I'd be very negative we'd have to see an ongoing decline in in the use of the technology and an ongoing rate of change negativity to liquidity but rate of change liquidity even if they just stop tightening rates and stop shrinking the money supply and stop decreasing the balance sheet is enough for the beach ball underwater the beach ball is the adoption of Technology Plus Animal Spirits so you know these are the factors that need to everyone needs to assess at all times and again nobody has the truth nobody has a crystal ball in the future I think I've developed one with this thing called the everything code but I don't it's a hypothesis and I can't trust it yes so as we draw to a close then uh just update us Raul on what you're doing so what is the everything code and what are you doing what are you focusing on over at real Vision these days um the everything code is actually a culmination of 19 years of work where I putting you know I spend the whole time in macros trying to solve bits of puzzles and then suddenly occasionally everything comes together and this was 19 years of work coming together to understand everything from the demographics which I've been working on for a long time Plus what happened in 2008 the political climate globalization all of these things come together and I realized that to cut to the chase the central banks they're printing is actually to pay the interest on the previous Cycles debt that they accumulated and it's proven out over time and so that's a very power powerful hypothesis because the last cycle was the massive printing for covid so it suggests we get a huge amount of printing to come in 20 24 25 and I think the central bank balance sheet goes from wherever it is now six and a half trillion to maybe 12 trillion so that's an enormous amount of money to come into the system interest rates have to come lower because everybody needs to service the debt but what I've done in the whole everything code is because I've got a lot of forward-looking indicators I kind of think I know what drives liquidity and how to look forward this will not it's a hypothesis but therefore because I know the correlation between assets and the balance sheets I can forecast asset prices out to 2026 which is arrogant and hubristic um and I you know I'm not expecting it to be perfect but I think I found something really [ __ ] big and nobody else but specifically specifically the everything code is an article that you've written that details yes in global macro investor which is my kind of high-end research service I've just started publishing in real Vision so if anybody's a real Vision member I think all members for the essential membership got one part of the article it's a three-part article on real Vision the real version Pro uh crypto Pro macro guys are getting it um right now so it's it's a really important it's the most important thing I've ever done whether whether it's right or not I don't know um so that's so I've been on that and then you know I've got three other I've built two other businesses in the crypto space one is exponential age Asset Management which is to allow Ria's pension plans family offices access to the market in in a way that's very helpful to them which is via hedge funds in the space in the crypto space and then I was a co-founder of science magic Studios which is tokenizing culture music um fashion Sports entertainment um and that's a really interesting space because that's one of the big bets that I think will play out over this cycle and then at real Vision we're rebuilding we've rebuilt our entire Tech stack to build out a platform that is the kind of Nexus between community web 3 AI and just the place for people to live their financial lives so we that that's working really hard on that now we've got the ultra first beta stage internally uh we're now just building on top of that as we start launching that and that will be an iterative process but sometime over the summer people will see this new platform we think we've got some really interesting stuff that's not been done before to give people the power of knowledge augment people augment people in their financial Journey that kind of stuff I've been noticing a lot of the engagement with the web3 community built right into the platform which I think it's it's fantastic I just want to confirm something with you Raul you are indeed an MFR correct I am an MFA I'm a punk an MF board ape um and um red guy those are the communities and crypto dick butts obviously have to obviously yes it's quite the portfolio there Raul um so yeah as we draw to a close we close with the the everything code so you mentioned that you're predicting prices in 2026. um I'm curious about crypto prices in 2026 you don't have to give us the specifics people can unlock that in the article but are they looking bullish yeah um look it looks very bullish from here on out uh this year this is what I'm really reticent so I'm never going to name numbers I'm really reticent because this year looks more bullish than even I expected but what is really interesting is everything codes also just matches the log channel it kind of is in the same direction or whether it's the wave version of that channel um they're all consistent amongst different ways you back in and out so yeah it just looks like a crypto cycle and it looks like it should be and it should be I don't think it's a pure function of of the debasement if it was then 2021-20 cycle would have been even bigger so it's it's not right so it's a function of the amount of capital available to move the space Etc so yeah it looks very positive to me and I don't think we need to get worried until 2025. this has kind of been my best take as well and it almost seems so simple that we're just going to repeat an entire crypto cycle yet again on that kind of I know three to five year I know why you've got you've got that you've got the uh the receipts huh you've got the everything code explains why and it's not to do with the halving the halving happens to be coincidental with the big reset people talk about the big reset to come we had the big reset in 2008 ALL interest rates went to zero everywhere it was like a debt Jubilee you don't need to pay your interest on your debts what that did was force every government and most corporations to reset all of their lending all of their borrowings into this three to five year window so most government debt is three to five year debt what that meant is it created an interest rate cycle and a business cycle and a liquidity cycle that was three and a half years on the nose or four years which is exactly because because Bitcoin came out at exactly the same period it's cyclist driven by the same things it's driven by this debt cycle this debt cycle is not going to go away yet uh until productivity is large enough to destroy the issue of the death itself we're not there yet so I think it just keeps repeating and once you understand this thing it's one of the big unlocks in the everything code it's like oh my God everything makes sense now I don't have to chew myself up with trying to figure all this stuff out it's kind of In Plain Sight this is just it Raul and as we uh close out this episode it's has always been a pleasure you bring tons of insight into this conversation and I I think the answer for you know anyone who is a crypto investor in terms of getting their bearings is probably just as simple as don't overthink it continue to dollar cost to average in okay not Financial advice of course um you have to figure out what percentage of your portfolio into crypto makes sense but um it feels like we are destined for another run-up in another bull market crypto isn't dead it's not over just be patient we've seen this play out before go talk to some other crypto veterans who've been in some of these Cycles they will tell you that this is what it feels like to be in a bear market and uh Raul thank you so much for talking through all of the issues related to this as we draw to a close close I'm curious where can people get access to the everything code And subscribe to real Vision get access to some of the resources it's like a dollar it's like a trial for real vision and you get the first of the article so you should do that anyway because there's a lot of great content you know I've been a big promo proponent of explained to people macro encrypts are the same thing everybody needs to understand all of this it's all part of the new future and real Vision you know that's where it really excels so just go to realvision.com um and just get free trial there and go and read the everything code article see some stuff there who knows you might see you guys on there pretty soon too um you know oh hey and that's the whole point we're kind of all in this journey together all of us and you know I think it's a it's very important for us all to lead by example to show how this new world of web 3 is all about a larger Community well the Twitter is busy destroying itself I think we need to show the way to show no it's an abundance mindset we should all have and the more we help each other in our Journeys the better this whole Space will be there you go well Raul thank you for joining us on the bankless podcast and uh updating us on those things it's been fantastic to talk to you guys I loved it thanks guys bankless Nation David and I will actually be recording an episode where Raul and Team interview us we're recording that tomorrow so you can expect that on the real Vision uh platform as well we'll include some links to the resources Raul mentioned in the show notes gotta end with this as always risks and disclaimers of course crypto is risky none of this has been Financial advice you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] thank you [Music]
