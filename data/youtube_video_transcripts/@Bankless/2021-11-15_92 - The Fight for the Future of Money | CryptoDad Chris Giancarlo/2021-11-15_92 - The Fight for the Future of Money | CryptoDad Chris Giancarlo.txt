[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what an episode christian carlo former cftc chair but also crypto dad and if that wasn't an episode like like spending an episode with your dad uh krypto's dad i mean i don't know what was it could not have been better what were some of your thoughts and takeaways coming out of this yeah it was a combination of one of the most heartwarming wholesome episodes that i've ever listened to with very concrete very there's high wisdom actionable insights right it's the most dad episode possible like very like here's how you live a life here's how you like print principles here's some actions here's some really really good advice also i just feel like i got this virtual like pat on the head at the end of the show i was like all right like millennial generation younger generations you guys got this you guys can take it from here uh so like chris just really spanning the gamut of just like being a good regulator regulating an entire nation he's no longer a regulator but once once was and then also just words of encouragement and it's just extremely refreshing it's already been one of my favorite episodes yeah you know what it's it's kind of like a good dad looks out for his kids right i mean i don't want to overuse this analogy but it really felt like the whole vibe of the episode and um his statement in congress that earned him the moniker crypto dad we owe it to this generation to take krypto seriously think about that we owe it to this generation how refreshing is that to hear in the halls of congress like that there is some accountability for future generations and like that we should go investigate this asset class and understand it more because they see something in it so let's try to understand that before we dismiss it before we kill it before we try to crush it let's try to understand that first and that is something that i think everyone feels is missing from the halls of power today right this like you're not hearing what we're saying right you're not you're not listening to us you're not understanding why this asset class has gone from 0 to three trillion dollars in the past 11 to 12 years right like so why don't you listen for a bit and and that that was his message that he took four years ago in 2017 and then he's been an advocate for for crypto since so he just had some fantastic insights we talked about cftc versus the sec we talked about um this new money system and how important it is to imbue and embed our values inside of it we talked about the nature of money and chris has a an excellent fundamentals foundational understanding of like what money is as a societal construct so many things to unpack here oh we also talked about like you got in this discussion with him about futures right so like that was just an educational course right there on understanding kind of commodities futures and how it impacts the um the reserve currency status of the dollar and the price of the underlying all of these topics so just an incredible episode chris is absolutely somebody who does not miss the force for the trees and i think that is the big discrepancy between regulators and and people leaders like chris and one of our biggest frustrations about the world of regular regulatory agencies where regulatory agencies are oroboric they are a snail a snake biting its own tail they are doing regulation for regulation's sake just because that's what they do uh when everything when you're a hammer everything is a nail and chris is not a hammer chris understands not just crypto and it is i find it fascinating that he came into the world of crypto not interested in crypto but realized that there was a something here and he needed to fight for it so again chris understands what this industry means and how it impacts the world and does not come in with his preconceived notions about how financial markets should look like and how they should be regulated yeah we didn't use this term during the podcast but uh like after the podcast reflecting it's like what's a first principles regulator look like right so let's talk about the the laws that went into place in the 1930s and 1940s there were principles behind these laws and some of those principles are valid and some of them are good but they don't necessarily manifest in the same way in you know the 2020s as they did the 1930s and 1940s so he's boiling it down to what are the what's the purpose of these regulations in the first place and there seem to be few in government who think like that but um that's really why i think the the cftc has has kind of um shined and and uh had a great role to play for crypto and this anyway so so many things we unpack here as always guys if you are a bankless premium subscriber you get to hear david and i's recordings after this podcast where we do a debrief on the entire episode and drop some of our thoughts and extra insights and some fun stories after the podcast so um make sure you become a premium listener and you can get access to that on the bankless premium feed david anything else nothing from me let's go ahead and get right into the episode with chris giancarlo crypto dad right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and returned back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest this is chris giancarlo he is the former chair of the cfdc he's an advisor in the crypto industry he's a senior counsel at a law firm you probably know him as crypto dad though that's that's the way i know chris giancarlo he's written a book with the same name it's called crypto dad the fight for the future of money i've read some of this it is absolutely fantastic chris it's a pleasure to have you on bank list how are you doing today sir doing great sean thank you so much for that warm introduction it's great to be with you i love your show and for me it's a treat to finally be on it uh well you are very welcome it's a pleasure to have you i i want to maybe start by setting the stage here you titled the book crypto dad and i think that's the way many in the bankless nation and the crypto audience uh know you but let's start with that story because this was a moniker that you obviously didn't bestow upon yourself like you didn't say i am crypto dad hello everyone my name is chris this is something that the industry gave you similar to hester purse i think people call her crypto crypto mom in the industry um and i think it's because you were the person who stood up against a tremendous amount of ridicule uh when the cfdc was talking about uh making bitcoin futures happen four years ago right this is not a popular idea at the time you also stood up in front of congress and you used this line which i think the crypto industry absolutely loves we owe it to this generation owe it to the younger generation to respect their interest in the asset class guys imagine that imagine congress owing something to future generations okay this is why you have earned the title of crypto dad i think in crypto circles but can we talk about this line because um i read that chapter uh we it the chapter in your book or there's a title in your book called we owe it to this generation can you talk a little bit about that what do you think congress and those in the halls of power owes this generation owes the future generation so let me tell you actually the back story and then we'll talk a little bit about what i really think congress does over this generation in in 2017 we were pro i was chairman of the cftc and we were pr and by the way just quickly i didn't go to the cftc to do crypto i went there to help clean up the reforms of the swap market which i'd worked in for a decade and a half beforehand but you know in life you go to do something and and life happens other things happen and you can either say i'm not going to focus on it or you can adjust and in my case it was let's adjust let's learn everything we can about this new asset class let's understand it we set up lab cftc in the spring of 2017 and i said master crypto i appointed dan gorfind to run it and i said start teaching us as a commission this new asset class to the point where in the summer of 2017 the the five-member commission were actually doing mock bitcoin mining uh exercises in our boardroom to understand what mining was all about anyway in the fall we were approached by two of our biggest exchange operators chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board options exchange about listing bitcoin futures and as we started processing those applications we were getting huge resistance um there was a full page ad in the wall street journal taken out addressed to me saying please don't go forward with bitcoin futures if you do it will destroy the economy wait who took out this ad thomas the ceo of of interactive brokers what's his skin in the game there why does he care so much well so he wanted to see um the the margins uh fund the collateral fund basically segregated for bitcoin futures against all other asset classes his worry was that it was there was a default in bitcoin futures the call on that collateral could unwind all of the other instruments that are traded in the same clearing house now the fact the matter is the whole idea of clearing is that you co-mingle all assets so if one asset classes up another one is down you've got a portfolio margining effect his idea those it should be segregated otherwise it would cause harm to the financial system a couple of things i explained this in the book we actually did an analysis of that we came to a different economic conclusion as to its viability but moreover we actually don't have the power as a commission to tell clearing houses you need to segregate this you can co-mingle that so anyway those are things that i explained the book but that's just one example of the resistance the futures industry association the trade association for the entire futures industry wrote to us and said don't go forward with this at least on the current timetable and then we had your regulators both here in the us and in europe and in asia calling saying if you do this you will legitimize bitcoin and that was one eureka moment for me because i said to myself wait a minute i'm an unelected bureaucrat it's not for me to to legitimize a legal asset class or not legitimize it that you know if congress wants to do it fine that's not my job and in fact it started troubling me because i thought the only thing that's going to legitimize an asset class is the marketplace itself right right if you got a marketplace where people can both go long and go short that's the best either legitimacy or illegitimacy thousands of new products are launched every year or hundreds at least many of them never make it because the market doesn't legitimize them not because bureaucrats don't legitimize them and so it was my thought that you know what the best test of this is let the market proceed and so we did not block bitcoin futures we announced we were going forward on december 1st 2017 the products launched the markets resolved the price itself but not long after that and this is how the bitcoin crypto debt came about i got a summons from the senate banking committee to appear in front of the committee and clearly it was to be called on the carpet to to basically justify everything we had done and so in preparing for that hearing we prepared as you do as a chairman of an agency a lengthy briefing document it must have been like 65 pages detailing every step we had made in in going forward with bitcoin futures we submitted that a week before and then the night before the hearing as i'm preparing for it i'm thinking about if you've ever watched one of these hearings the the witnesses have these little clocks little game clocks on your yes in front of you and they go from red to yellow to green and when they go green they start counting down from five minutes to zero and if you you know if you're still talking when it goes zero boom the red light goes on the gavel comes down so i'm trying to condense 65 pages of text into a five minute 500 word testimony and i said forget it i'm never going to do this so i'm going to just approach this entirely differently so that morning when the light went green on my desk i basically pushed my papers away and said senators i know i'm here as the chairman of the cftc but if you'll allow me i just want to talk to you as a dad wow and i explained to them that during our annual family ski trip that i do every year with my brothers and all our kids every night after skiing all my kids in their 20s all my nieces and nephews wanted to talk about was bitcoin they had heard that we had green light at bitcoin futures they wanted to understand it now these are the same kids that we had tried to interest in the stock market for years you know with basically no interest but suddenly the interest and it dawned on me that there's a real generational thing going on here and so i said to these senators just what you said i think we owe it to them to get this right not to dismiss it as some sort of you know childish fantasy as as i think perhaps there's a tendency to do and some people in my generation but to actually open our eyes to it and say what's going on here really understand it and get the regs right so it thrives as opposed to being strangled in in its in its in its infancy anyway so having said that i want to talk to you as a dad suddenly my twitter handle exploded and they were calling me crypto dad and some people said i want to be adopted by you it was so much fun and it was actually a few months later that hester purse was confirmed and then when in one of her first statements she referenced my testimony and then she became crypto mom yeah she is also amazing too i've got some memes that that i'm showing on the screen this is uh this is you as like the uh the last um fudd bender i believe uh memes from the courtesy of crypto twitter coming out and uh this is another one if you go into twitterverse you you'll hear a term huddle did you actually say that i did you said hoddle yeah and i said my niece is a toddler that's hilarious chris you know it's funny because i mean i was there and john kennedy was a senator who's a really fun guy he said what is all you're talking about i still write with a quill pen well the fact of the matter is he's somebody actually starts is starting to get it um but you know it was an opportunity to talk to congress in a very fresh direct way without uh just a lot of bureaucracy chris i remember listening to that talk and i remember posting on my facebook because this is where all of my my parents and my my the older side of my social connections that's where they were going to listen to this and i remember posting for the first for the first time a millennial i actually feel heard and represented by our leaders and that is what started to actually have some faith that maybe we actually could get this this whole thing right uh so thank you for for representing us in a time where you know this is after the up on the heels of the 2017 mania which is not it didn't wasn't crypto's best pr move but people like you understood the fundamentals but you also talked about all this resistance that came and the fact that you were even summoned to the uh housing banking urban affairs committee in the first place to like answer for your accepting of bitcoin uh in the cftc and also all the other responses from the private sector is concerning why do you think you got so much resistance from almost everyone who's in a position of power about accepting bitcoin and what did you learn from that well look we have a massive financial market infrastructure a massive financial industry infrastructure that is very close with its regulators as well it's a legacy system that was born in the 20th century you know it it's not only massive it it you know it touches our lives in so many ways it's fundamental the economy and uh it was once state-of-the-art uh in the last century it's showing its age now you know i i actually liken our financial system to a lot of our physical infrastructure our bridges and our tunnels and our airports and our railroads that were once state-of-the-art you know are no longer so and they're decaying in front of verizon we need to upgrade them a lot of that is similarly true about our financial system and i really believe digital token technology and digital asset technology has the promise to actually help us modernize the system and upgrade it for for generations to come if we let it but you know there's an old adage you know challengers to the status quo the first thing the status quo does is ignore them then the second thing it does is attack them and the third thing it does is it adopts them i think we're in the late attack stage right now when i went in front of that hearing we were just coming out of the ignore stage and my testimony was to basically say sit up and listen everybody there's something going on here i think you know i described it the other day somebody said where are we i said i think we're in the empire strikes back segment of the trilogy uh the best movie by the way yeah it is and the death star right now is is you know is is quite active and um uh you know so we are we you know this this new innovation is being attacked by a legacy structure a legacy regulatory framework a legacy industry uh but the smarter ones are event are getting it you know it's amazing how with the launch of bitcoin futures that we did at the cftc you know that allowed for the first time solid traditional institutions to enter into this on a regulated u.s regulated marketplace and you know with the like i cite in my book the likes of you know bank of new york going back to 1778 and and and mass mutual and fidelity with these kind of names coming into the space the adopt we're moving we're still in some of the empire strikes back but eventually we're moving into the adoption phase so i think we're in you know phase two and a half right now i think i think i tell people all the time i think the medium to long-term uh future is very bright i think the immediate situation right now is precarious but ultimately the system will modernize because that ultimately that's what we do in the united states and because generationally that's where this is headed my generation will eventually pass the baton to a new generation that gets in digital assets they get it in their bones because they've been video gaming since they were 16 years old and they understand digital tokens they understand avatars they understand uh you know a virtual world the metaverse and so it's changing but you know we're still the empire is still striking back right now yeah you're speaking our language so i guess we're at the part where luke luke skywalker just gets his hand cut off right and that's why we're feeling some pain right now and so this was so striking because uh you said you had regulators calling you and their specific was concern was like don't make bitcoin legitimate your actions could make bitcoin legitimate and you talked about this general fear of change and this general departure of the status quo and we've talked so much on bankless about how we feel like some of the regulatory regime anyway um is is sort of an incumbent protection sort of force and it can feel like a racket at some time but can we get into some of the specific concerns like the fears okay so when someone it's when someone's saying to you i'm afraid that you're going to legitimize bitcoin what exactly are they afraid of is this we're afraid of um the volatility we want to protect retail like this volatility could destroy the economy are they afraid of loss of of dollar supremacy uh supremacy hey this is this is you know the the dollars world and the us has a strategic interest in in making its dollars supreme are they afraid of kind of the criminal and and terrorist type of angle what are their specific concerns with crypto being a legitimate asset class yeah so all of the above it almost you know [Music] where you stand depends on where you sit uh so if you're a central banker of a major continental economy with a reserve currency to protect the euro the pound uh the dollar then a a big concern about bitcoin is its potential to unseat those reserve currencies if you're a central banker uh with with a monopoly over wholesale payment systems you're worried about stable coins uh um taking that monopoly if if you were in charge of a uh of of of aml kyc procedures at say a treasury excuse me then then you're concerned about payment rails that are outside of of that control and and tokenization is very scary to those who are the uh overseers of account based money systems you know if you're in a court court i mean correspondent banking is right in the crosshairs of digital assets right um it's a huge rent collecting that soaks up one or two percent of glo global gdp just to move money around the world you know think about how kodak must have felt when digital photography came about well in the same way if you're running a correspondent banking you've got to be really afraid of stable coins so there's a lot of fears to legacy systems what i tell fellow regulators is don't confuse the state of the art of a of a of a method of achieving policy with the policy itself aml kyc as we currently know it is based upon identity as the first step in every transaction why is that because our account based money system requires identity it's a first step in every transaction somebody's got to identify who you are where you bank and how much money is in your bank before you can use a check or or a credit card or zel or venmo right as we move to a token system we don't need to establish identity in every case although we can unmask identity in a pseudo anonymous system later on if pattern recognition shows us there's something that needs to be unraveled but for many people that oversee aml kyc they can't envision a world where they don't establish identity in every transaction and so they're confusing the state of the art of a method with its ultimate policy goal which is catching money launderers and illicit commerce and so you know regulators get comfortable with methods of regulation the reason why defy just blows the heads off regulators is because regulators regulate in a common way what how do the regulators regulate they look at an ecosystem and they say where are the intermediaries where where are the choke points great we'll register them we'll license them we'll give them certain jobs to do collect information et cetera et cetera and in return we'll give them certain monopolies and barriers to entry that's how regulators in an analog world traditionally regulate but once you get rid of the intermediaries regulators you know kind of have a connection because they can't figure out how to and what they've got to do is relax and recognize we can go from an entity-based regulatory structure to an activities-based regulatory structure using big data analysis blockchains and let's use pattern recognition to find bad activities and once we establish the activities we can then go find out who are the actors engaged in those activities but it's going to require a sea change and one of my biggest concerns is regulation made for the convenience of regulators my biggest disappointment in the recent uh pwg report was it was all about you know first do not disturb the regulators do not ask the regulators to change any of their methodology you know it's it's innovate to for regulatory convenience rather than innovate to solve societal and and economic and and market structure problems we can do better i definitely think we can do better chris and i could put part of my worry is like do people in in government in these places of powers actually understand this asset class they understand that like what peer-to-peer defy can bring are they they're starting to use it and i think that will come soon but let me ask you a question because we we do want to talk a lot more about regulations some other themes in your book but um just to kind of round out this discussion about kind of the the birth of crypto dad and and futures and all of these things do you feel somewhat vindicated at this point okay so the sec has just approved a uh an etf based on what bitcoin futures okay the futures that you started four years ago people were taking full page ads out against you and uh grilling you in front of congress and now there seems to be an acceptance cross regulatory body acceptance and general governmental acceptance that this asset class is here to stay and thank god we had futures four years ago to prepare for this day now retail can get more involved in asset class of course we'd like to see spot we'd like to see other things but this is at least a step in in the direction do you feel vindicated by that like being on the right side of history yeah so so i tell you what back then we knew we were doing the right thing i don't i don't want to sound arrogant but but you know in our heart we knew we were doing the right thing because in every mature market of any commodity ultimately a a derivative futures market develops and ultimately the price is actually no longer set in the spot market it becomes set in the futures market and the reason for that and that's true in oil that's true in wheat that's true in cotton that's true in iron ore that's true in interest rates the reason for that is because the spot markets are too dispersed to bring all the major buyers and sellers together which happens in the futures market where they can all meet and set the price and so it's sort of it's market economics 101 that we knew when we launched a bitcoin futures market eventually it would become a major component of a matured uh uh sophisticated deep and liquid market ecostructure but i i do feel vindication for the pool for the pundits um they were you know there were press people in the mainstream press that were lampooning what we were doing they were they were you know old kind of central bankers they couldn't envision a world beyond the 20th century world they knew that that were giving us a hard time so i do feel vindicated in that regard um and but more importantly i'm delighted to see this emerge into a tr three trillion dollar marketplace it it shows the the what happens when you get when you get really strong emerging technology breakthrough technology combined with the right regulatory response that's not suppressive that is saying how do we channel this for good when you combine the private sector and the public sector in in in in smart in a smart construct really good things happen and we've done it before in the united states i'm actually working on an op-ed right now with dante desparte you know in the 1970s a new technology came around and that was called financial futures up until the 1970s the only way to control economic risk was actually through agriculture futures there was no idea about doing futures on interest rates on foreign exchange and once those products came around it actually allowed the united states to go off the gold standard and it allowed the dollar to become the world's reserve currency with enormous wealth increasing aspects for american citizens it but it it was an enlightened response to washington washington said this innovation is so important we're not going to screw it up by giving an old line regulator like the sec oversight we're going to create a brand new regulator the cftc to oversee it to make sure it oversees deep and liquid markets for this new innovation so if you get the regulatory response right for a new technological innovation enormous amount of economic and national growth uh can result and so i think what we did it four years ago was another example of that chris there's a small rabbit hole that i want to go down about the futures based uh bitcoin etf versus a spot one and learning that most price discovery actually happens in the futures market that's actually new information for me i'm not well not well savvy in the world of futures markets but one of the big complaints of the futures etf that we hear a lot throughout the the industry is that there's not actually physical bitcoin actually put into custody somewhere right and a lot of people get frustrated because they think that you know um spot demand of a of a spot based etf will actually create you know a a price appreciation of the underlying btc asset which is what a lot of the people in the industry want demand for an etf creates price appreciation in btc and the conversation has been something around the lines that a futures based bitcoin etf doesn't have that effect is that true and is there any color you can add to the actual impact of demand of a futures-based etf versus a spot-based etf on the price of the underlying yeah so so first of all just add to that sort of basic futures economics 101 there's two types of futures there's futures that upon the the expiration of the futures contract say it's 30 days or 90 days settle in cash in dollars but there's also futures that actually physically settle so you can imagine a wheat contract at the end of the period you've actually got to deliver the wheat well actually we greenlighted two types of bitcoin futures at the cftc a cash settled one which is the cme product and a physically settled one which is the backed product the as i understand the pro shares etf it's based upon the cash settled one that cme does yes it's very possible though that an etf could be launched and maybe there are applications in front of the sec right now for a bitcoin etf that settles on the physically settled uh bitcoin futures at backed i have to say i don't know if there is but there's no reason why it couldn't whether the sec would approve it or not i don't know but in a construct that you could have an etf constructed that way um you also can have an etf that's constructed to reference an underlying spot market what's a spot market that's a a physical delivered market that's not in the future but it's today fiscally settled today you buy you receive bitcoin uh that's we know there's there's there's those exchanges coin base kraken here in the u.s there's many of them abroad um when i was at the cftc and when we greenlighted bitcoin futures we knew there were applications pending since i think 2013 at the sec for the etf so we actually started a study group at the cftc to start thinking about what happens if the if the sec actually green lights uh bitcoin etfs on our marketplaces and we started actually doing some economic scenarios as to what that look and looking to see where there might be some concerns now when i left the commission in 2019 the sec still had not greenlighted any of those etfs i don't know as i'm talking to you now to what extent the sec and its recent green lighting of pro shares drew on any of that economic research we did at the cftc i don't know to what extent the concerns we had then about what are called position limits and margin concerns and a balance between cash settled and physically settled have been taken into account i simply don't know what's happening in the blacks box of the sec and i don't know whether they're talking to the cftc you know one of the things and i read about this in my book i was shocked i mean literally shocked at how little conversations take place between the sec to the cfdc to the occ to the treasury i mean it's like these regulators are in separate ivory towers and one of the first things i did was break down those towers establish both personal relationships with the heads of them but also institutional working groups and and ad hoc joint committees to break through some of these silos and we worked very well at the cftc in the sec during that time and i i just hope there's some good conversations taking place today and they're sharing analyses and economic research because you know products and markets organic they're always changing you know it what works in the summer may actually not be working so well in the winter as different dynamics take place in the market and and a big job of regulators is what i call market intelligence to be following these developments on a daily basis and see if things are getting out of kilter so it's a long-winded answer to say i do have concerns about market structure between this etf product and how it's interacting with the underlying bitcoin futures market but but i'm not in the flow of information some of this is highly technical i don't get the daily runs that i got as chairman i would get you know daily information from our market intelligence people we would follow it we would do a friday morning review every week to see what the ramifications are you know when we launched bitcoin futures we had a whole team to just monitor it daily to make sure the margins were right and how it was working and and there's some great teams at both agencies i just hope they're coordinating so with regards to the actual uh price of the underlying asset as of uh as a function of the demand of either futures or spot based etf uh demand for futures versus spot do is the differences in how these impacts the underlying price of these things undetermined and determinate or do we actually know that yes demand for a spot based etf actually does connect to the actual price of the underlying more directly than the the price of a futures so so it's art not a silence science right uh and and if i can just point paint the picture why is it that the cfdc only oversees derivative markets and not spot markets right well go back to the original products that were traded in futures markets they were mostly futures on commodities so the cftc oversees wheat futures but it doesn't oversee the spot market for wheat which takes place at grain elevators all over the country right it oversees the futures market for gold but it doesn't oversee the gold price that's set in jewelry shops in every in every town square in america it oversees the price for oil futures but it doesn't oversee the the price paid at the gas pump when you buy gasoline and because the price paid for gasoline is at millions of gas stations all over the country that's not actually where the fundamental price is set the price is set in the 30 day oil futures market the 60 day the 90 day the sixth month the one year so that's basically uh futures markets 101. when you now go into bitcoin at first since the the origins of bitcoin you know a dozen years ago the price has been mainly set in the spot market but with the emergence of both cash settled and physically settled bitcoin futures starting in 2017 you're increasingly seeing the key price set in the futures market why is that because the big institutional players the big hedge funds the big um uh money management funds are actually not engaged in those spot markets for the most part they're doing their major institutional buying and selling in the futures markets and there's retail there as well i wouldn't say that the shift of where the price is set is fully flipped over to futures my understanding and talking to people in the market tell me it's probably still somewhat 50 50 but the trend is going more and more to the futures and that's an organic natural process that takes place in most futures markets once upon a time the price of wheat was set when the farmer sold it to the grain elevator today it's set in in the in the various wheat markets in chicago in kansas city and minneapolis and and similarly uh that's that's starting to evolve in bitcoin and i'll add one more thing there may be some people that are concerned about that ultimately that's a good thing one of the strong underpinnings of the us dollar as a reserve currency is most of the world's major commodities and benchmarks are actually made in dollar-based futures market the fact that the price of oil is set in u.s markets in dollars is a huge strength to the us economy the fact that soybeans the world's most important uh edible commodity is set in u.s markets is a huge strength you know when a when a soybean farmer in argentina sells soybeans into the world he's not only going to worry about the soybean price but he's also got to worry about the conversion from his currency into the dollars american farmers don't have to worry about where the dollar is in global markets so it doesn't have to worry about a conversion so uh into another currency so these are strengths if i think it would be a tremendous advantage to the united states if ultimately the price of bitcoin were set in u.s markets under u.s regulation settled into dollars well that illustrates very clearly as to perhaps why the sec was a fan of a futures based cash settled etf for bitcoin coming out out the gate is the answer to the question uh the reason why futures markets set the ultimate price is because that's where all the liquidity is you said like all the big money this this is just where more volume occurs and so therefore that's where the price occurs it's where the the major buyers and sellers and and it's where information you know information is what drives market right is where most of information is aggregated we know on the global spot markets there's huge arbitrage in price and the reason you have to arbitrage in price is not every market has got all the same information at the same time so an asian market during daylight hours may move in one way that another market even though it's it's 24 7 you know it may be night time there you've got less buyers and sellers in the market there and so what happened the reason why the futures markets eventually become the price setter is because you have all the information in one place you have all the major market participants in one place you have all the liquidity the depth you know liquidity is a it's not a a one factor thing a lot of people think about liquidity is the number of buys and sells liquidity is sort of like a diamond with many many facets you know there's depth of liquidity there's breadth of liquidity how many participants in the market there's concentration of liquidity do you have one or two players that provide most of it or do you have not only 100 players but it's spread out amongst those players it's the dynamics of liquidity you know what is liquidity like in midday compared to what is liquidity like at midnight and that's an important element of liquidity there's how does liquidity react to certain external factors if you know if if there's a rising interest rate environment or or a market crunch what happens so liquidity is a is a is a multi-factor thing and therefore a market participants ultimately kind of congregate around one or two marketplaces where they can find the big the deepest uh depth the broadest breadth the most consistent liquidity that's what futures markets provide traditionally in most of our major commodity markets ultimately you'll see that happen in bitcoin and and i don't see say this with any bias it's just as a student of market history that's what generally happens as bitcoin becomes an accepted part of the financial landscape i would imagine the same dynamics that have happened to most of the world's major commodities will similarly take place with bitcoin if not then you question whether bitcoin is truly an investment great asset class if it is an investment grade asset class i would imagine it would follow the same trajectory that the world's other major commodity asset classes energy commodities food commodities etc follow this has been super educational guys just so many gems in there this is crypto dad schooling us on liquidity and commodities uh which is super important so many things like you know we could highlight there one i think that was particularly insightful is i i do think that the commodities world has a lot more to teach us about um layer one of blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum than the securities world does actually as a matter of fact because at the end of the day what is block space well that is a commodity and what is the unit of account and store of value and um medium of exchange for buying block space well that's bitcoin and ether bitcoin on bitcoin and ether on ethereum right and this has corollaries to how the us dollar has maintained its monetary supremacy it is the petro dollar it is the dollar of the commodity which is oil oil makes the world go around right this is energy so many things we can learn from the commodities market in crypto gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are

of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in heath i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com i want to touch on another thing um that that you mentioned which is this kind of collaboration between the cftc and sec and sometimes it happens maybe other times it doesn't but one collaborative point i've read in your book this is an insightful paragraph another asset we care a lot about besides bitcoin is ether uh and this year ether finally got some futures okay this was like a week's not months thing that has been uh speculated about and promised for a while and hoped for for a while now it finally came this year it also felt like it came on the back of something that um an sec regulator bill heinmann said in in 2008 he said based on my understanding this is a speech he gave is not ether is not a security and it felt like in in your book maybe you implied this was part of some collaboration and part of some ongoing discussions between the cftc and scc to actually make that statement happen too or influence bill hyneman and other than the sec's decision making on that anything you can speak to about eth futures and the path that that's going down and do you expect i know you can't comment on like what that cc is going to do next but do you expect uh an eth etf to follow at some point soon so thanks thanks ryan there's a lot to unpack there um we began by talking about collaboration you know there's two areas of collaboration that are equally important one is uh with with our great exchanges i mean cme and ice with backed get a lot also deserve a lot of credit for originating these products these are seasoned market operators that bring enormous amount of skill and experience to managing markets and so we we're talking a lot today about the credit to the cftc but credit goes to them uh equally if not more for managing smart markets the reason why the bitcoin futures market is doing so well as it's well managed by cme another area collaboration that i think often gets mis left out of the conversation is across the political aisle you know during tim massa's chairman of chip of the cftc when i was had the honor to serve a long time as a junior commissioner we worked very well together and actually the birth of the cftc's role goes beyond before me it goes back to 2015 when chairman massive administration with my support identified uh bitcoin as a commodity under cftc jurisdiction we made that statement 2015 before the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and it was absolutely the right determination bitcoin is undoubtedly a commodity and it deserves a regulation by the cftc not the sec in 2018 is a few months after we greenlighted bitcoin futures we had established a sec cftc cryptocurrency ad hoc working group chairman clayton and i uh put together a team of about 15 professionals from our two organizations that met every two weeks part of it was to make sure the sec understood how bitcoin futures were operating but what we also did was drew up a list of major emerging crypto assets and wanted to start working through them with the sec to identify which ones were commodities and therefore on the cftc side of the ledger and which one might be considered securities and fall on the sec side of the ledger now that work was was done uh in confidence between between the two agencies so i'm not going to comment on any particular crypto but as i described in my book we were focused on ethereum as perhaps the next major crypto asset to emerge in terms of utilization and use in um as a result of these bi-weekly conversations and perhaps in independent work the sec was doing uh in the summer of 2018 bill himmon gave that speech where um where he said that from his point of view uh ethereum was not a security now that was consistent with the viewpoint of the cftc and my successor he tarbert uh came out with a pronouncement saying that ethereum is a commodity i very much believe it is so i think that hinman's speech was right i think chairman tarben speech was right but some of the seeds of that determination was laid in those um those those cross agency uh meetings that took place every two weeks during the remainder of my term as chairman and then i understood they continued into chairman tarbert's term i don't know whether they've continued under um chairman gensler at the sec and chairman acting chairman benham at the cftc i can't say but i think those meetings were influential in a number of regards yeah absolutely and uh we hope they're still continuing and that there is some discussion between these agencies moving forward i'll add one thing ryan since i left the cftc as a private citizen i did publish a piece um in the spring of 2020 in the international financial law review stating my view as a lawyer that xrp is not a security and we'll see how that how a court determines that but that's a published piece that i put out well but i'm not i didn't state that as a chairman of an agency i said that uh in my in my private capacity and i think we we do want to touch on more uh regulatory items you know soon including maybe some more conversation about the sct scc and and see um cfdc and kind of their roles and things but but first let's talk a bit more about the the main theme of the book right so it's it's called a crypto dad i say the book but it's also kind of i think your message lately it's something maybe you've you've actually accidentally gotten to crypto like all of us you know 10 years ago if you'd asked me you know what i'd be doing i would not have said i would be doing a podcast new crypto and like in this industry like it would be a completely different trajectory but now here we are because so much of what we see in crypto i think has aligned with our core values values like you know you know freedom and um economic uh you know enterprise and and um the ability accessibility of our financial system but the title of your book is called the subtitle is the fight for the future of money it's interesting you word use the word fight you also use the word future of money and i want to talk about this uh quote which is sort of the the synthesis of the thing to me and you say this money is too important to be left to central bankers money is too important to be left to central bankers there's a lot to unpack there in this statement so let's unpack it what do you mean by this and why did you say it money is as much a social construct as it's a government construct if you go back to the beginning of time whether money was in the form of shells or beads or or clay tablets or wampum or money reflects societal um estimates of its worth they think those shells are beads or clay tablets actually represent something or society thinks they're worthless and moves on to something else govern governments can issue all of the paper they want they can issue all the polymer notes they want but if society doesn't um confirm the value of it society doesn't believe in it if society is worried about its inflationary impact society will find other means of money governments cannot uh uh issue money willy-nilly without concern for the trust of society trust is in many ways what's driving the whole crypto revolution a generation that lost trust in the existing financial system and then the overseers of it during the last crisis are experimenting with trustless systems or consensus-based trust systems trust is at the heart of this whole new innovation trust is at the heart of the lack of of of authority or the diminishing authority of the old system trust is everything and trust is a consensus mechanism the trust of society if there's not a consensus of trust in a given instrument and it doesn't surprise me that in the same week when congress decides to spend over a trillion dollars that is so supposed to be free to have no cost whatsoever according to some government officials in the same week bitcoin it hits an all-time high in terms of its value people vote with their feet as to where they put trust and so the reason i say that money is too important to be left to the central bankers it's not an insult to central bankers it's a statement that says we all together central bankers in the private sector must establish trust must must must protect trust must further trust in in the monetary systems we use and i think we're in a phase right now whether it comes to money whether it comes to financial systems whether it comes to all aspects of society where we're we're in a search for who do we trust we've lost trust in traditional institutions and traditional conventions and and and ways of life and we're searching for a new so some some new social markers some new social paradigms and and nothing is sacred but the banking system is not sacred and the existing money monetary system and the dollar itself are no longer sacred trust is not a given trust needs to be re-earned and so you know my message to my former colleagues in the central banks are you've got to open your eyes to what's going on here simply insisting upon faith in in your traditional oversight your traditional institutions is just not going to cut it you've got to re-engineer you've got to re-engage and rekindle trust and i think that uh digital based trust is something that a lot of people increasingly are putting their faith in as opposed to you know great paragons of virtue behind uh marble pillars in in big offices in washington it just it's just not doing it anymore chris this is amazing this is like so you first of all i i'm super impressed that you are taking this back to base principles because so many people when they talk about money they don't think that way they don't look at the societal trust the shared values basically the shared fiction the societal construct that money is right they're already way beyond that and they like they start at a level that doesn't even make sense but when we talk about crypto and a new paradigm for money we have to get back to the basis of like what money is and when you unpack what money is that that's where the the second part of your sentence makes sense which is like it's too important to be left to central bankers because a small group of central bankers cannot possibly determine the consensus for an entire society on what values society cares about right we have other governance structures in place for that there are things called markets there are things called democracies for instance where the people get to choose what values they want to imbue in their money and this feels very much to me like we are changing our monetary regimes and the way we think about money as we enter this digital era going from the physical analog era to this digital era so we better make sure we pause and we get the values right and it's not up to the small group of central bankers to like tell us what the values are right because they don't get to decide they don't get to pick this is a bottom-up phenomenon can we talk a little bit about what values you think are important and you think society will feel like is important in this new monetary system that maybe we're constructing from the ground up so so you're so right on so you know one of the big driving value system behind bitcoin behind crypto is the notion of economic privacy economic liberty and censorship resistance right okay provided it's legal what i do with my money is my business and nobody else's business that's a huge driving factor and yet the same time that bitcoin is attracting a whole generation because of that economic privacy and liberty it guarantees we have a government proposing to monitor bank account transactions of six hundred dollars or more and when i read that i thought oh my god you're missing the whole point when you propose something like that you're diminishing trust in the existing system you're actually you're validating a crypto by just by proposing something like that there's there's just this disconnect between you know my generation's oversight of the financial system and where they're going and a new generation going into completely different way you know what what people are searching for in crypto is economic liberty that that what i do is my business okay of course of course i'm a former regulator of course we cannot have scope for illicit conduct right silk road put a stain on the whole innovation you know we've got to have proper law enforcement but law enforcement is law enforcement if something is legal we're no longer talking about law enforcement we're talking about people's entitlement to economic liberty economic privacy and no censorship by politicians you know you can i talk in my book about you can imagine a world where you get a right-wing government come in and suddenly you can't use digital assets to fund an abortion you get a left-wing government suddenly you can't use it to buy ammunition for legal firearms right and you can have this ping-pong whichever government's in they start censoring our use of money we cannot have that we you know a free society must demand economic freedom and economic freedom by the way is as important as religious freedom it's important as free speech if you don't have economic liberty you don't have liberty right because we live in a economic we live in an economy we live in a capitalist system you need to spend money to have experiences whether they be philosophical whether they be social whether you want to bring about change in certain things you need to be able to deploy capital and so economic liberty is human liberty and we can only have economic liberty if we don't have government censorship and so the reason i call my book the fight for the future of money is we're truly in a battle we're in a battle between uh governments both both dictatorships and democracies over what values will be in digital money the digital you on will be a tool of surveillance the question is whether a digital dollar will also be a tool of surveillance um we have we're in a fight over sovereign and non-sovereign money big tech companies also want to have your data so if if if a big tech launches a a digital currency how will they mine your data and how will they use your data to influence choices you make as they do with social media engaged in that battle or is also the big legacy banking system which has a vested interest in either preserving certain ways of doing business or making sure that new ways of business they have the same monopoly in and we're in a battle with with legacy regulators that like the regulatory structures in which they're comfortable that which they've prevailed for so long and are unwilling to change and and so those are your combatants in this fight but the most important combatants of all i'm afraid haven't fully taken the field and that's society at large that is your neighbors and my neighbors the bookkeeper down the road the dentist that i visit on you know once once a year those are the people that are not really fully engaged they say oh crypto that's interesting and what i'm saying to them it's more than interesting if we don't get it right a digital future could be one of enormous actually repression and censorship and surveillance and if we get it right it can be one of much greater inclusion much greater economic liberty than we have today a faster and more efficient financial system and one that serves people much better than the current one does but the the that fight is in the outcomes in the balance of this fight right now there's a lot of players with a vested interest and there's a big society at large that doesn't understand the degree of interest they have in this and my book is a bit of a cold arms to them to say you've got to engage in this battle because the the future of money is going to be the future of liberty well said sir i mean this is fantastic shivers down my spine yeah th this is exactly why we're in this industry chris it's exactly why we're on the bankless journey you know uh is so many fantastic things you said but i'm reminded that quote that um eternal vigilance is really the price of freedom and as we change monetary regimes we're also having this like human-wide regime change where we're moving from analog sort of rights written in things like the constitution to sort of a a digital rights type landscape and things are different in the digital world and if we don't have a bill of rights of economic freedom in the digital world um what if we lose everything that we have have tried to gain in in in the in the analog world and that's that's a big worry i i guess you know when we see big tech sort of encroaching on our civil liberties and our digital economic liberties and then we when we see places like authoritarian regimes in china sort of say you know this is crypto this is digital blockchain it's called the digital wan and we control it and we surveil it and we tie it to your social credit system do you have hope actually that your neighbors your friends society the citizens will actually fight for these freedoms right it's like it it seems like it depends on back it depends on the people once again to actually care about these things and to actually start fighting for them and sometimes chris i gotta be honest even though i'm hugely optimistic that's why i'm in bankless that's why i'm in crypto that's why we're we're saying the things that we're saying but like sometimes i'm worried that we're in kind of this echo chamber of people who who just care about this but like the wider society doesn't understand enough to care about these freedoms they're not thinking long-term enough to understand that we are moving into a digital future potentially of repression like the metaverse could be a very dystopian place if it's controlled by authoritarian nation state states and big corporate interests but if it's if it's individually controlled if there's like freedom economic freedom and digital freedoms for the individual then it could be a fantastic place but if we don't get it right now there's so much at stake to lose my worry is or do you think that enough people will care to actually make this happen chris what makes you optimistic so ryan i totally agree with you i think we've been far too we've enjoyed too much the convenience that comes from digital commerce that we we've just allowed all our data to be sucked out of our transactional activity we've so enjoyed the the pleasures of social media that we've allowed social media companies to basically suck all our data out of us and i worry that we'd be far too happy with digital money that we'd allow either central banks and governments or big tech companies to basically take away our economic uh autonomy by gathering all our information or worse start conditioning our economic choices by in the same way they condition our our media choices and so that i'm as pes i'm as concerned about that as you are and it's one of the reasons i wrote my book i wrote my book not for a beltway audience not for a crypto audience actually as much as i i hope they read it but really for an ordinary audience and that's why it both contains technical discussions with storytelling and and simple messages because i just want ordinary people to read it and come away with the concern that they've got to be activated to fight in the future of money for their liberties what gives me hope is actually the way that recent proposal to surveil bank accounts for six hundred dollars transactions was fought back and actually dropped it says to me that there are still concern citizens that are outraged by the notion the government would collect that kind of data and and that outrage needs to continue and i don't it's not politics as you if you know me and if you read my book it's not republicans or democrats you know getting having the light bulb go off falling down the bitcoin rabbit hole happens to both republicans and democrats and there's resistors on both sides it's not political but the fact that a proposal like that that proposal was more bureaucratic than it was one party's proposal it was the it was the the washington apple put soup of agency saying this is to our advantage this is for our convenience let's do it the fact that society rejected that push back against a big government effort to surveillance to me is is a candle in the dark that hopefully society gets it and hopefully if if people read my book and get activated um and an activist on this issue of economic liberty uh hopefully the metaverse the future and and but we all know this is happening this is there's no turning back this is coming the future of money is digital the future of financial services is is digital um so the fight now is what are the values of that digital future going to be just as we've been talking about and we've got to fight today for economic liberty in every way and in every forum and every conversation thanksgiving's coming what a better time to talk about economic liberty around the thanksgiving and believe me don't make it political because it's not it's just about what does a free society do when you go through fundamental uh uh technological and economic change we must maintain the values of a free society and the perfect opening for that is you know bitcoin ether of crypto at an all-time high so you know at thanksgiving they're gonna be asking something about crypto there's your opening folks chris we talked to uh your regulatory counterpart crypto mom uh hester purse one time and we talked about the alignment behind crypto and american values a lot of american values are instantiated in these systems that that we use and while while watching all of these different regulatory agencies we've kind of in my opinion think the cftc has always been the most fair the most logical the most rational the the regulatory entity that allows crypto to continue to express its american values well without being uh overbearing uh and just restrictive so can you can you if there were all the other regulators listening to this podcast which hopefully one day they will can you tell can you illustrate perhaps the model of like how and what has the cftc done correct that you think that they should follow in your guys's footsteps in order to make sure that these values that we uphold so dearly are retained by these systems yeah i mean look each regulatory agency has a different provenance they have a different history they have different congressionally assigned missions they have different political cultures the cftc i think has this rare combination of having the best of all of that i mean for one thing it reports to an ad committee which is a group of really nice midwestern people that generally get along they don't divide by politics at the ag committee it's always it's not always but mostly bipartisan and therefore that you know tone from the top comes down to the agency i'll give you one little example that i mentioned in my book when you go to the senate banking committee the senators sit on this raised dais behind this wood paneled uh bank and they and you have to look up to them after you know an hour your neck hurts and and of course they love looking down at you right when you go to the ad committee the ad committee doesn't sit on a desk they sit around a level table which is meant to symbolize a kitchen table on a farm wow and so you you look at them level like you're sitting at the table with them i mean it's just a little thing but you know little things in life make all the difference it's a sense of of we're all in this together you know it's not us against you whirlwinds together and when i go and testify in front of the ant committee it's less a testimony it's always been a conversation and that's just a starting point for the type of bipartisanship that generally takes place at the cftc it's not an agency that breaks down by party as many other agencies do another thing is the the some of our fellow agencies like the sec have have an investor protection mandate and they often see everything in the eyes of almost like the how do we protect the lowest common denominator not the most sophisticated market participant but the least sophisticated and i think with great respect i think that kind of dumbs down a lot of their approach thing i think it's why their approach to investing is accredited investors can invest in anything but non-accredited investors are very limited what they can invest in and it's almost like protect the incumbents and protect the rich and not help the the least um ones who might want to get in more sophisticated and take more risk it feels very patronizing at least i i think that's a fair characterization i'm i'm critic i write about that my book are critical now the cfdc does not have an investor protection mandate its mandate is to maintain deep and liquid and orderly markets free from fraud manipulation and because by definition derivative markets tend to be more institutional than retail so the cfdc has a product innovation bias and the sec has kind of a product limiting bias and there's there's a whole bunch of reasons why the cftc i told people all the time if you're going to take an appointed job in washington and you're a markets person the cftc is the best job in town it's a great agency it's a collegial agency it's got a great track ready i'll give you one other factoid and we did this analysis between the year um uh 2000 and 2017 the cfdc greenlighted over 12 000 new product launches that is more than every other regulator in the world including the sec combined we're green lighted at the cftc i mean it has a remarkable history of new product innovation and i think it's an american treasure so what a remarkable history of saying yes saying yes the bias is to say yes be why not not willy nilly because it's a belief that the market will work out the value proposition by the way of that 1200 probably 900 of them you know disappeared after a few months why because the market didn't validate them not on elected bureaucrats and that's the way it should work i just want to leave you with this um uh what would i say to other regulars what i'd say is courage in italian we say karagio courage my friends we're an aspirational society we're a courageous people we explored the moon we explored cyberspace let's not be timid about exploring the future of money let's just let's be bold about this okay we'll get a few things wrong you know we had a few mishaps on the way to the moon there were a few missteps on the way to cyberspace let's let's let's be smart about it let's let's let's prosecute fraud manipulation let's let's prosecute bad actors but let's have a little bit of courage to to take the step to explore this new innovation and not be afraid of it chris one thing we always say on bankless is at the end of this show and you're gonna the listeners are gonna hear it in about 30 minutes is we are going west we are on the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you are with us on the bankless journey and so hearing that same sort of like yes let's let's choose to explore let's choose to see what's out there is exactly the these sort of uh reasons why we get so excited about this world of crypto chris i uh you know what's really interesting about the story of the cftc too is um you're talking about like saying yes to all of these markets right and like very much in crypto we live in this world of like infinite markets infinite tokens and infinite markets right it's like the cream rises to the top over time but there are a lot of failures that's why it feels like a more open less permissioned regulatory approach to this asset class is what's needed and you use this term that gets you know from the hippocratic oath in your in your book like first principle do no harm is what a regulator should do and um you tied that to kind of the regulator's actions in in the 90s or the us government's actions in the in the 1990s with sort of the birth of the internet do you think that there are some lessons we can draw from that time period about not squelching innovation i mean i know you've used this term in your book it's the term we use crypto is the internet of money right this is another wave of the internet's digital scarcity property rights on the internet and so can we take an approach that we've we've taken in the 90s and i guess what should the u.s do like broader than just the cftc and sec what would you like to see from congress from the like the broader executive branch what would you like to see the u.s pursue strategically here yeah so so i i wish we could take the same approach of the of the 90s which was a very bipartisan approach it was the clinton white house and it was the newt gingrich congress that came together that said in the first wave of the internet the internet of information we should take a first do no harm approach now to some degree that was somewhat easy and why is that because of our traditional democratic notions of freedom of speech our first amendment protects freedom and doesn't just protect it it says the federal government shall have no role in regulating speech and therefore you don't have a ministry of truth in washington you don't have a ministry of information and so the this the first wave of the internet kind of came into washington as a regulatory light zone this wave of engine of the internet the internet of money the internet of value is not going into a regulatory light zone it's going into a regulatory mine field because we don't we have long in our democratic society presumed a role for government when it comes to overseeing things of value we don't have one banking regulator in washington we've got three and we've got one in every state we don't have one market regulator in washington we've got two and many states have securities commissions and so as this wave of value that this internet that concerns things of value goes into the regulatory landscape it finds regulators with legacy authority over things of value and they're not interested in yielding ground at all i mean and so this wave of the internet is different because society has allowed and has accepted regulation of things of value and in some cases relied on it to police markets that's why i firmly believe congress does need to step in i i think right now i don't hear coming out of this administration a pronouncement that innovation is a good thing and there needs to be a national imperative to further innovation i hear what i hear is we need to protect regulatory legacy regulatory frameworks we need to preserve we need to first do no harm to the legacy banking system not to the new innovation and so uh what what i'd like to see and there are some voices on both sides of the island in washington that are starting coming around to that congress needs to step in and say yeah we we of course we need to we need to protect markets against bad actors of course there needs to be sensible regulation but it needs to be balanced against a national imperative to modernize our use this new technology harness this new technology to modernize our financial system to make it more inclusive it's it's woefully exclusive you know it's a system that require requires identity in every case in a world of 8 billion people when a billion and a half do not have identity they are excluded from the existing financial system it's woefully expensive i mean there's so much rent collection in the in the current system it's shameful and it's slow and cumbersome you know it's it's a it's a nine to five five days a week industry in a time of 24 7 365 commerce and so we should harness this new technology it's going to take congress to make it clear that there's a national policy uh in seeing this furthered and so uh that's where i'd like to see congress step in it's crazy to me like we can't even get stimulus checks out to all of our citizens right i mean it's just absolutely insane in this and if we send it to our citizens they're locked at home under uh coveted restrictions or they don't have bank accounts so they can't cash those checks at the beginning chris you said that it's going to take congress to to get this ball really really moving forward and there's been a growing um concern in the crypto space that eventually in order for us to actually like clear this landmine this regulatory landmine it's actually going to have to be the courts that you know because we can't get the sec to give us clarity so we're gonna have to force them to give us clarity via taking it to the courts um but you're saying like well actually congress can do this could you perhaps like do a little juxtaposition behind what it would be like to get clarity from the courts versus what it would be like to get clarity from congress and which one should we prefer in the industry like which one is is better for for both of us certainly congress not the courts the courts are too idiosyncratic and there's not an opportunity for um the industry and and and all industries the new industry the old industry congress is where you know our founders you know saw social issues economic issues being worked out right we've got an election coming in 2022 and i'll tell you i spent five years in washington this is the time to make voices heard this is the time to when you know every congressman now after the election last week is now running for next year this is the time to get in their grill this is the time to let them know that that that congress need you know needs to step in needs to step up and recognize this new innovation and you know there's some leaders in the industry some of the ogs like sam bankman freed and others that are you know making the rounds in washington getting the word out that this industry is a player it's here to stay and that it's got something to say and needs the congress to step up i think it's got to be congress i think the opportunity to get the word out to to influence a new generation of congress people and senators is now and ultimately they're the ones that have to come up with good public policy they've done it before it can be done again i mean that that's the right court the right course uh the courts are too idiosyncratic it depends on what judge you get how the plaintiff's papers are done it's not a place to iron out long issues of public policy they're trying to interpret rules that congress made let's get congress to make new rules that show this this industry the the support and the the furtherance that it needs i mean we do deserve an update right from the 1930s and 1940s financial laws that are we're basically abiding by i think it's you know every hundred years or so you gotta you gotta update those things the 1946 supreme court case is determining what's a security and what's not i mean come on right about orange groves chris how we test yeah i i actually maybe maybe i'm naive here and i want to get your your answer as to whether i'm naive or not but like i'm kind of gung-ho about crypto taking it to the courts and a little bit of this comes from the fact that the new york stock exchange took the sec to court five times and won five times and really got that clarity five times in a row and i think i mean of course i think this maybe i'm very perhaps i'm very biased but i think crypto has the legs to stand on to win in court am i am i naive for thinking that we can like take this to the court and wins and maybe we should just redirect all that attention back to congress or what's the deal here no i don't think you're naive in fact you know as chairman of the cftc uh court decisions were very important to our authority you know we did as i said we declared bitcoin to be a commodity in 2015. it was a 2017 case i think that actually confirmed our determination and gave us this the legal support we needed uh to stand behind our decision so i think the courts play an important role but you know they can play an important role that you could also have setbacks it's it's you know it's a bit of a toss the dice you you and and and their decisions are narrow they're you know focused on one particular aspect if there's not the possibility for the courts to give us a comprehensive statement of national policy to further this innovation um you know only that can come from congress so you're absolutely right you're not naive to believe the courts have a role to play i think they have an important role to play but ultimately i think a free society elects representatives to go in to make determinations of broad public policy as what's our national interest uh in the development of this innovation you know that the first wave of the internet enjoyed broad support in washington uh i think there's no reason why this wave of the internet shouldn't have brought support as well with the courts with congress and ultimately uh i'd like to see an administration and i hope it's this one or the next one that makes a firm commitment to innovation as opposed to a commitment to protect legacy structures yeah absolutely and i think you know within that hopefully bankless listeners hear a call to action which is at least if you're in the u.s elections or whatever jurisdiction you're in internationally elections are coming up in the u.s they're coming up in 2022 so that's next year so right now we should be lobbying we should be making phone calls we should be um you know activating our voices and making sure that crypto messages are heard now is the time i know we've spoken a lot about this on bankless but i i was also interested in like the post uh note the postscript note of your of your book chris which is basically about the infrastructure bill that sounded like it just come out when you went to publish on august 8th or so and you said this it appears that congress has now identified its first policy priority for crypto this is like the first time that congress is actually talking about crypto in a policy priority and what is that it's taxing it uh and you said this as it has so often congress appears to be mortgaging america's future to pay for political failures of the past that i guess is the the pessimistic side of things it's like the crypto industry i mean our industry is moving so fast we can't afford to wait for congress especially this congress right who four years ago they're barely listening to your message of we owe it to this generation like i speaking for younger generations we don't feel like congress feels like they owe it to future generations to do basically anything and so we're worried about this chris um are there any other biggest reasons for optimism let me give you the biggest reason okay please because life's a conveyor belt and and you guys are are lowered down the conveyor belt my generation is toward the end of the conveyor belt agency chairs come and go and then we fall off the conveyor belt and then your generation moves up so generationally this is moving in your direction and and so it's going to come um again i think we're in the the empire strikes back segment of the trilogy the rebels got to hold on survive the death star and and it's it's go the world is going to change because a generation wants that change gets that change is behind that change and eventually is gonna you know dominate the landscape it's it's on the come short term it's precarious long term i think the sun is shining down at the end on the other end of the highway that that's great and maybe as we as we start to kind of summarize all of this and draw to a close chris we're coming kind of full circle with your role as crypto dad because i feel like you are providing a lot of wisdom uh from your generation some fatherly guidance to to our generation it was really interesting in like the end of your book to to to read kind of a summary and you made some really interesting statements i i think particularly to young people i i was wondering if you could leave us with some advice here but one of the threads i want to pull in is this idea that you have about free markets and free peoples you said this free market capitalism is not a source of misery and oppression it is the antidote not a source of misery and oppression it is the antidote i want to ask you about that you also said this for young people politically driven economies are dream destroyers okay i think there are a lot of younger people who are uh very much like rebelling against uh the capitalism of the past right and i i understand why they see the this form of institutional crony capitalism that has become corrupted and institutionalized and basically has uh subjected um subjected the world into this kind of broken system so i totally understand that but um you seem to be thinking about a broader picture here and you're painting a picture of like capitalism maybe in particular this internet of money being part of this the the way out the way out being economic freedom tell us what you meant by that freed free market capitalism is not a source of misery and oppression it is the antidote why is it the antidote yeah look i'm no fender friend of f uh uh phony capitalism of crony capitalism and i talk about that in the book i'm no fan of a big tech no fan of big banking uh but at the end of the day i'm also concerned about trends that sort of would have us conform to sort of group approaches to solving social problems you know where rarely do big groups come together and actually solve problems it's it's generally individuals that have the freedom to think outside the box to bring new approaches to things and so i hope we go into the future with a balanced mindset not one that is that is perhaps coercive toward group approaches to things but one that allows free thinkers and free individuals to to to to to express uh unique thoughts and to and to pursue unique dreams and and and wherever you look in the world where you have tightly controlled economic systems where you limit economic freedom you find no growth you you find a generations that are that are thwarted at every turn and if they're lucky they escape those systems and if they're unlucky they're stuck into them for generations to come you know we in the united states have made our share of of so many mistakes social economic and otherwise and yet we're still the the place where people with a dream and an idea go to to thrive and often they have to do it against a lot of pressure to conform societal pressure political pressure um online pressure and yet you know and you reference my role as a father i kind of feel like it was my time to stand up for the free thinkers for the dreamers the people that are unafraid to think for themselves to stand out and i think that that capital markets are the oh ultimate in crowd sourced innovation you know it's it you know reason why i stood up for bitcoin futures was let market participants decide its value proposition not bureaucrats not unelected people in government i i found a lot of great people in government but the end of the day governments really provide solutions to social problems it's more often the individuals and the free thinkers that that are unafraid to to to put forward solutions and and and allow free people to decide whether they're right or wrong so yes my book is a call to action for a for a to be unafraid to be have faith in free markets it's not a call for crony capitalism big corporates big tech big banking it's it's a call for free thinking i think that's what people feel when they're on the the crypto journey in the bankless uh journey is this the sense of freedom like anything is possible there's limitless opportunity there's infinite white space and you said politically driven economies are dream destroyers i feel like right now the existing economy outside of crypto is politically driven and that's why our dreams are exactly yeah exactly what we've got is political mandates to kind of stifle or hinder this innovation why to protect legacy systems that are ingrained into the political process and so it's a dream destroyer and that's exactly what i was referring to in my book you know if you know i'm not trying to name names i'm trying to broad broad pictures and i think if anything this new genre this new generation i think is truly the innovative generation of tomorrow if we can just survive the current onslaught and get to the sunny uplands and we will we will i'm confident we will chris you're you're speaking our language and it's it's just very refreshing to hear um so many people from so many walks of life who aren't the younger generation also get it and also vouch for us so thank you for everything you you do and i want to actually go back full circle back to uh the senate housing banking urban affairs committee where you got your nickname uh crypto dad because you talked about how you tried to get your kids interested in the stock market and it was just not landing with them but bitcoin did land with them are they still interested in bitcoin and crypto to this day four years later totally so um uh one of my nieces who was really in in in bitcoin early um and crypto generally i think was a was hodler since 2013 so she got in early has done very very well one of my sons is a business consultant with a large consulting firm advising on some of the biggest blockchain experiments that are taking place on wall street right now doing some really interesting work my youngest son is owns crypto um so yeah they get it now i because i was at the commission um i didn't own crypto during my term there i thought it would be inappropriate for me to be stating views on it while i could have benefited from it so i i didn't until i left in 2019 but um i'm all in in so many different ways both as a direct holder but also as an investor in a lot of of angel startup companies that are doing some really including crypto surveillance and uh crypto tools so uh crypto infrastructure so i i'm a big believer in the space clearly and um and i'm very transparent about you know where my position is chris but i was once a kid before in the world of crypto that was a pessimist and only saw darkness in our future i was trying to get my way into grad school only saw debt only saw more more schooling ahead of me and i was just i just did not believe in the future until i found crypto and now i'm one of the most optimistic people that i know i'm wondering if you saw the same transition happen in your kids if their their involvement with crypto also impacted their disposition about their sunny outlook of the future well that's that's that's really amazing um and but it's not the first time i've heard that i i don't know it's actually something that maybe i'll ask my kids as to that i i i i i hope they're optimistic for the future you know i i um we're a country that's always been optimistic about the future and i and i think we need to return to that um and you know anything's possible possible in a free society uh and and and that that includes failure uh that includes um uh screwing up um but but it also includes you know uh uh amazing achievements both both for one and themselves and their family if that's what they choose to do or achievements for society more broadly if they choose to do that's the nature of a free society to give people those choices and and it can be harsh it can have a detrimental impact but it also i think can be tremendously uplifting and and um i hope we can rekindle that society because that's that's what powers us to our better achievements um and and i think we're more aware perhaps of some of the failures in the past and you know i always one thing i always tell my kids you you you learn from your mistakes you celebrate your achievements you don't learn much from your achievements you actually learn from your mistakes but you got to be able to make them because you'll never learn if you don't crypto dad ending it in true crypto dad fashion with some fantastic advice for you who are early in the crypto journey which is frankly all of us and uh chris it's just been a pleasure just just when listeners
