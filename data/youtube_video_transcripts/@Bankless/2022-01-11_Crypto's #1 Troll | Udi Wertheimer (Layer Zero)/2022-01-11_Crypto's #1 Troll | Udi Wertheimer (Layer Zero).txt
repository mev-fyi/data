[Music] [Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with udi wertheimer and udi is one of the most interesting and unique characters i think in the crypto industry he's frequently cited as a troll uh by many of uh the people in the ethereum community um and i think that's just because of his generally cynical and antagonistic uh just um uh disposition uh and he he likes to poke fun he likes to make some funny jokes uh but overall he's also just really insightful and makes some connections that i think a lot of people fail to make or just forget to make or just it tends to be a little bit more pragmatic and so i've always wanted to get udi on in a much more unfiltered sense so i think this is a perfect podcast for this because uh udi has a persona about him that uh it's hard to tell if it's if it's uh a facade if he's like playing uh playing a role or if that's actually udi so i'll let you determine for yourself what you think about that uh before we get into that conversation with udi we must hear about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrarily is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitram and arbitrom's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitram you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nfc projects building on arbitrary many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrom.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitrom using bridge.arbitrom.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswapgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless hey udi how's it going hey great what's up no nothing much man uh trying to fight this onslaught of frogs that are in my twitter mentions i don't know if you saw that it's all that antics on twitter or not it's always twitter wars always twitter i like the frogs yeah you're a friend like the frogs i want i want to make sure the frog's here that i like the frogs yeah why why do you like the frogs i think it's i think it's a cool meme i like the bean what is the frog meme to you it's all about the anti-vc movement isn't it that's what it looks like i don't know you never know how real this stuff is like if you're a vc shouldn't you start a meme about being anti-vc and pretend to not be fcc what would be what would be the game theory behind that why would you want that well i mean you always get a story right there's a narrative for to get people excited that seems like a cool narrative now are you talking about every coin starting out like the big the big thing that everyone has to say about is that now these the vcs they got a location they're trying to dump it on you you know there's the whole jack dorsey thing going on there's a lot of memes around vcs right now yeah um are you saying that like it's a a tactic that people are leaning into i mean isn't everything yeah for sure it is i'm a very cynical person david yeah you are quite cynical yeah yeah udi uh how did you get into crypto man when was the first time bitcoin you've been in it for so long you forgot it's like it's probably been around uh roughly 2014 and um i uh i back then used to think that you know like stuff like bittorrent and and decentralized file sharing is cool like technologically like i'm a software engineer by trade so i was excited by the technology behind it then someone told me about bitcoin i was like hey that's similar so that's cool and and also i had some brief experience with online poker i wasn't really very good but i i played like recreationally you could say i somehow managed to not lose money and and um i i believe there was this big event that they called the black friday of online poker which i think was in 2011 but i i'm not sure anymore and what happened was that you know the fbi kind of froze the funds of a bunch of uh big poker sides and that's where a lot of poker players realize that their money isn't you know their digital money isn't really theirs because you used to log in you see a number you say okay that's my money and then when one day it's done um so i kind of had this concept that i think a lot of people didn't have back then of well most digital money isn't really yours so that was easy for me to grasp how bitcoin is different in that way which i think a lot of people you know looked at me very confused when i would try to explain that um so that's probably why i was excited about it it took me a while though to you know get over my fears and to really dive in and and look at it as an investment that took a while for sure uh you know i went through i went through um you know this one hype cycle where you know i bought some bitcoin i saw it i don't know whatever it was like triple in value fairly quickly and then you know dump 50 percent fairly quickly again or whatever and i was like stressed so i was like okay i'll get out with my 30 gains feeling like a very smart person and it took me a while to see that it's a long-term thing um which is probably how i you know i also kind of realized okay it's not just about the technology to me at least it's also you know there's a financial revolution going on here um probably when i started realizing that you can you know you can take your bitcoin you could put them in exchanges and you can you know you can use it you can do stuff with it that i knew for a fact that i otherwise couldn't do um like you know i live in israel for me back then it was very difficult to get you know to get an account and a foreign brokerage right it's a difficult thing they will have to go through hell to do that but with bitcoin i was like oh i just deposited the thing i can do whatever i want that's amazing and um that's probably where once things started to click it was all ponzi's by the way but still what do you what was so amazing it was possible i mean the the you know the things you could trade also mostly old ponzi's definitely back then you know like it was really ridiculous like the the the altcoins of 2014 and 15 were absolutely insane they were mostly jokes like i think most people saw them as a joke did you did you take any of them seriously uh no but and you didn't consider bitcoin uh to be a ponzi you you thought it was bitcoin is the one thing and then it's just in inside if it's a sea of ponzi's yeah yeah i did it was i mean it took me a while to see bitcoin that way too but yeah um and and i think it was easy to think that back then right because the the bitcoin the others were literally cloned like you they literally they took what's going they changed a couple of lines they changed the logo in the name and that's it literally that's all it was so so it was very easy to to see them as jokes and you know have you ever heard of um uh what did they call it aurora coin oh vaguely yeah it's been a while since i've heard that name yeah so that was it was hilarious because that was i think i think the story was that it was the coin of iceland or something like that and like obviously you know obviously the government had nothing to do with it they they were like they're just saying oh we're gonna i think they have they claimed that the government has some sort of an open database of citizens and they claim that they will just airdrop a number of tokens to every citizen and and but before they did the airdrop there was like a long period of i don't know a month or two where where it was just you know they just sold it to the market and then you know they pumped the price very nicely it was it was actually one of the biggest everyone everyone was talking about because it grew spectacular but it was complete you know it was ridiculous like obviously i think it was obvious to everyone this was not going to become the coin of iceland but you know people bought into the narrative and then of course you had dozens of other country coins like people popped up with a greek coin and a friend's coin and they had a coin for every country and obviously like you know two to three months later that stupid narrative died and it disappeared so that was just one example but that was you know just like everyone is talking about leia ones and metaverse now back in those three months everyone was only talking about country coins so i was about to ask yeah this this this antics this behavior seems very very um a lot of parallels to some of the antics i think we see today in 2021 would you agree with that yeah yeah i i for sure um and you know it's true for uh traditional markets too i think it's just more pronounced here in crypto a lot more pronounced but um but yeah it is similar however um i think you know the quality of the jokes improved they're they're they're not you know it's used to be so so stupid really it was it was absurd and i think i think it has a lot to do with um um you know how a lot of the earlier bitcoiners still see old coins as a complete joke because you know that's that's what they were um they really were and i i would say they've they've improved somewhat it's not like you know it's not like it's amazing now they've improved somewhat improved in what sense what did they improve upon i think so you know first of all things you know they're actual things that work right that's a big difference um okay so they're going from ponzi's to actually like legitimate projects with legitimate like things behind a lot of them are a lot of them are still ponzi's so you know like a cool thing to do now apparently is to do a you know a game a playtorn game or whatever and um attach some uh you know attach a token to it and [Music] a lot of these tokens aren't going to name nades a lot of these tokens are really built as a ponzi with 3d or 2d graphics basically and so a lot of them are still ponzi's but at least there's something going on and also you know i don't mind if people want to participate in ponzi's game i guess they're you know but um i would hope do you subscribe to the notion that every financial asset is a ponzi at the end of the day um you could say that maybe and it's fine um but uh there's you know there are definitely a lot of dynamics around um you know most token projects that you look at today it's like their main focus is how to incentivize people to stake things for the long term or the short term or whatever and like the entire focus of what you're doing is the ponzinomics of it is to make numbers go up right yeah yeah i mean but you could say that about like an uh a company on like the nasdaq or or um nyse right like the purpose of apple is to make number go up right it's the same thing but there i think the difference you're highlighting is like well in order for apple to make number go up they make really good iphones and they make better and better iphones whereas these games are more they're they're trying to make a fun game but like it's really about like where the intentions and how how quickly they're trying to go after the token price rather than actual like a legitimate product yeah and i think probably at the end of the day you know some people will say that it's because of regulations like apple would have done the same things if it wasn't regulated that way i i i think that's not true i think that um the reason that it's happening is because that's what stupid now that's probably not gonna continue forever uh the demand for ponzi is at some point i don't know when at some point is probably going to die down a little bit and um and then you know people will be forced to do something else to make the number go up uh right now it's easy and effective so that's what people do is because crypto is just like filled with all these ponzis of different flavors and kind of always has been since the genesis is that one of the reasons why you're you are described yourself as cynical or were you cynical before you got into crypto oh i was always cynical always always been cynical yeah it's a genetic thing probably yeah did your has your sense of humor changed um uh by being in crypto or again has your sense of humor always been what it is uh you know probably probably has been always similar but um but the topic changed yeah yeah it's the same idea did you have you ever developed like uh a core thesis about crypto like have you ever um oh i i have developed a billion billion core theses and i keep changing them all the time i mean in that case i don't think it counts as core i think it just counts as a species uh fair enough it's a short term or this it's designed it's designed to be a poor thesis but then it fails um i mean i think that i think you know above all else i um and that i think i think we probably talked about this before actually on one of the other podcasts i think that um to me and i think to most people i see it's not really about the technology even though i'm kind of a technologist at heart i don't think that that's the issue here i think the thing is that we are finally able to just do whatever we want with our money and um and that's very new relatively and just you know because that happens then then a lot of crazy is gonna is gonna happen with it i think that's i think that's all it is and it's very hard to predict like how it plays out um you know i would imagine that the next year will be very different from them than the last one um you seem like a guy who um rides the wave rather than tries to steer the ship yeah yeah you can say that yeah um i think steering the ship is hard it's hard and it's it's like there are you know there are um there are things you can affect in life but um you know the market it's probably not whatever right thank you you if you try with the flow i think the mct makes it easier to you know affect other things in your life that matter more right so i'm i'm a big believer in um not trying to change the world why i that why why do you believe in not trying to change the world you know um jordan peterson has this thing where he says clean your room right i don't know how cringe you think jordan peterson is but he he has this thing where he says like clean your room and the point is before you try to you know before you sit and try to describe how you should change the government and how you should change society you know you should change like thirst you know figure yourself out and um and the you know the nice side about this it's a feedback loop right because if you if you start with yourself while also you know you integrate yourself in the world you don't become a loner um and you you go with the flow where it comes to how society as a whole functions while trying to affect you know yourself your friends your family or your immediate community then you know you take power from the world from society and you use it to to change the things around you that you care about that you care deeply about i feel like that's the way to go at least for me um but there are a lot of you know there are a lot of cool people who are changing the world which i find amazing that's amazing too well isn't isn't his notion of cleaning your room is like if you're interested in changing the world you got to make sure that you are it's like um you know put your oxygen mask on first before you put it on your neighbor right i feel like that's it's a similar metaphor yep yeah yeah it's it's it's yeah it's definitely also about you know um like really how can you think you can you even can fix society if you haven't fixed you know if you haven't cleaned your room yet right and and how can you even imagine that you can fix the government if you're you know if your family is dysfunctional is your room clean right now ooty yes yes it is room i i i blurred it out i blurted out but it is clean it is actually pristine doesn't that mean that uh according to jordan peterson you're ready to um uh move and start to clean up the world because your room's clean step one is done step two is to help the world i might i don't i i really you know i don't have aspirations to change the world right i i don't like what would i change i think the world is fine i know that we love to say in crypto that everything is going up in flames and we're the we're gonna save everyone i don't know i don't think i don't think the world i'm old david i don't think the world is going up in flames i think it's fine as it is and and you know we have a unique challenges fear but um i'm i'm optimistic i'm optimistic so i don't want to change the world but um but you're right um there's definitely there's definitely uh room to venture outside of the room you said you're an optimist rather than a pessimist yeah yeah yeah you're a cynical optimist how do you see yeah is that an oxymoron or how do you square those two things yeah um so to me at least in my mind i use cynicism to just you know just understand understand the world right and i at least tell myself that it helps remove layers of fake narratives and and that just helps at least helps me personally analyze things and and i i just happen to once you do that things usually aren't that bad now that said you know a lot of things did go you know did get worse in the last couple of years um i kind of um established a lifestyle uh digital moment kind of because i wasn't happy with how things were going back home and so you could you know you could call that a pessimistic view but i think you know to me um to me the nice thing is that that and especially you know for me i'm lucky enough to be able to do that to be flexible and to position myself in a way that even if well my home country is kind of flipping out so i can go somewhere else and if you know my boss is annoying me i can go somewhere else so that's great um i know that not everyone can do that but um i think that's a good you know that's a great thing to strive for and i think that's something that can give a lot of people optimism you know a lot of people are you know if i feel like a lot of people are complaining about the situation that the world puts them in but it will actually easier to feel hope for when you feel like you can change things for yourself and for the people you care about instead of changing everyone around you which i'm just not interested in doing anymore i'm too old for them to all they can do whatever they want if there was one thing about the crypto industry that you could snap your fingers and change what would it be or is this something that you don't even consider because this is just not what you think about yeah it's an interesting question probably the meme coins right they're so triggering i mean the meme points trigger you man it's um it's funny that you say that because some people would call you yourself a meme but i'm not a meme coin that's the difference like like it's memes are great memes are fantastic i love memes but meme coins you know why people are so frustrated about them right like i'm not the only one uh of course it's um i think it's the it's the it's the text messages you get you get a text message from a friend from high school and he's like hey i heard you're into bitcoin or ethereum and you okay so like so what do you think about uh chib fluffy new yeah and i'm like come on man like i don't even what what what do you even say and you don't want to and you don't want to say don't buy it because maybe it goes you know maybe 10x is tomorrow i don't know i don't want to be responsible for that so like i don't know i don't know what to you know and and then i know a lot of people in the on the bitcoin side are very frustrated about it and i'm sure a lot of people will be assuming that are very frustrated about it too that that you feel like oh there are so many things that i'm eager to talk to you about that i'm eager to show you and that are you know that are exciting and and that could change your life and you're talking to me about this dog coin and then to make it worse they make money too like it's terrible do you think that we're uh i kind of think that uh the world's only going to lean more into memes i kind of think that like we are now living in remember in 2017 when um the arizona iced tea company added blockchain to their name and then their stock price like 3x or whatever like that was indicative of what uh what was to come i i think like dogecoin is now a force to be reckoned with shib is a force i think we're leaning into more and more meme coins and i think with crypto we actually start to uh uh kind of just change the game of what it means to invest so like now now there's the fundamentals but then now there's also like all right well how good is the meme at the same time yeah yeah yep which is kind of in my mind it's a little nihilist it's like a little uh nothing matters therefore like like eff it i'll just ape into ship because nothing matters yeah it's um well if you think back at you know about let's say when you started up out with ethereum uh i don't know much about that period in your life but i can i can imagine i can guess that um you probably i mean i'm sure that you saw a lot in the technology and i'm sure you saw a lot in kind of the opportunity to build but also i'm sure you saw you know a community and and and a chance to belong with like-minded people who have similar motivations to you and now if you're you know if you're an investor in your very early 20s right sometimes even younger and um so first of all your motivations are not going to be about the tech you don't care you don't understand and you don't care to understand either and it doesn't make you a bad or stupid person just not one of your interests right you have other interests in life and the reason you you're doing any of this is because well you can't you will never own a home right if you just continue working as an uber driver that's not gonna work so you have to try other things that i have no issue with whatsoever i think it's it's excellent and then you find a community of like-minded people who are saying look i'm gonna try anything i will try anything to to get out of this rat race and now you belong to that community and whether or not like i don't know whether or not are you is it actually gonna work for you it's mostly a lottery i don't know but maybe but you are gonna be with those people with those like-minded people and i think if you stick around with the people not with the coin then eventually you'll probably find something that works so so that's okay um the the counterpoint though is you know those meme coins have such short lives sometimes not all of them but sometimes so like how long is this community gonna last um but if you if you pick correctly i think there could be something there maybe do you have opinions as to which uh blockchains which currencies which tokens actually like quote unquote win out like do you do you have uh desires about what the end state of crypto looks like um i doubt that it i doubt that the winners are gonna be the names we're familiar with now um maybe some of them does that include bitcoin i don't know if bitcoin even competes like it it's i think that you know like who's competing with bitcoin right now you might you'll probably say syria but but um i think you know i think it's very different right and and i i just don't think you know i think when i think of who's competing in crypto i'm like you know binance and ftx and solana and and and you know whatever i don't need to say all the names and then there's gonna be probably new ones and i don't know like does just jp morgan get into that can they can they play that game at all i don't know like who knows but um it still seems early enough to say who's gonna win and bitcoin is just i don't know i don't know man it's just money it's just it's just like money is a big word it's just like it's literally digital gold i think and and that's you don't talk about you know digital goal like physical gold competing with with apple stock um so i don't know i don't know what's it's different do you think that there are there are winners though i think you know so there are okay so they're going to be there they're a bunch of verticals right so if we're talking about the smart contract thing um i think that i would imagine as we go on and assuming that this becomes mainstream it still did not right like i guess nfts is one thing that kind of went mainstream and the rest of it didn't really um [Music] so so let's let's take the nft example i would imagine that and you know in two three years from now assuming nfcs are still around then probably people will not know which chain their nft is on and which chain the the marketplace is on and they're just gonna have an app on their phone they're gonna use it and they're not gonna be exposed to  like transactions and gas and whatever it's just gonna work and then does it even matter who powers it i'm not sure like eventually in the end state doesn't matter i don't know like what do you gain from being the infrastructure of that i'm not sure that anything because again like you could say okay some networks will try to you know attach the tokenomics of their preferred token to the usage of the network but if you do that then long term they just want to use your token because why would they pay you they could use aws especially for nfts right it's just you know you don't need anything so so they'll go i what i'm trying to say is i think eventually as time goes by that will move and that can take years but that will move to probably just the cheapest option i don't know what that is but that's probably where and people won't even know what they're using so i don't know i don't even know what it means to win that in the long term in the short term sure uh someone will you know win big at least in things like you know market cap and price and you know the the war seems to have been picking up a lot of steam lately so if you think that a bunch of users won't care about what system what chain that their nfts are on or they won't know they won't even care to investigate and they're just going to migrate to the cheapest option in your mind does that simultaneously also mean that people just don't care about these decentralization and they'll just go to the most centralized chain because that's how you get cheap fees yeah yeah i mean well it depends what you're doing right like if if i'm i'm not but if i were to provide liquidity to some coin with 100 million dollars maybe i would care a lot about decentralization maybe i would be concerned about you know people having control over this and i would want to remove as many trust assumptions as i can because it's a lot of money but if i'm buying penguins why would i care like i don't i don't think you care i don't think most people care that's fine i don't think it's i don't think it's a bad thing the fact that they can do this at all owes some credit to the centralization if you didn't have a coin you can pay with then you couldn't do any of this because paypal isn't going to let you do this and and you know like whoever isn't going to let you do this um you know there are some nft drops that you can buy with a credit card but they're definitely not going to let you do the marketplace thing with with with a credit card usually although i think that you know nba topshop did that i think they did um but it's complicated so so you can ah to centralization and and maybe that's how things kind of progress so you're gonna have these apps that are mostly centralized not entirely centralized but maybe they will use uh stable coins or eve or bitcoin or whatever is their currency um that kind of makes sense to me but i don't think that i don't think that people will care too much about decentralization now that that depends on the people right like if you're in your early ethereum community member and you you know you bought or got punks early or you got you know one of the other ones early and you're like this is part of your identity and you believe in that that might never change and maybe you're gonna continue focusing on owning that with your own keys and whatnot that's fine maybe that community is gonna keep doing that but that's you know that's what i'm saying is that's gonna become a niche and if this thing stays mainstream you know new people are not gonna care about this history like they'll be like okay if i can afford this i'll talk about it then but until then uh they're not gonna they're not gonna care about this at all i can't imagine the world it's kind of it's almost like you know right now it's like uh it's an obstacle they have to go through and and you know we see everyone uh making fun of you know basey holders right now uh for losing their keys and whatever because and it's easy to make fun of them but like what are they supposed to do they just found out about this and it is confusing and if it was a centralized app that you download through this to your phone and it won't happen and you know coinbase is going to get into this more heavily and they're probably going to be others and and i would imagine that they'll try to push the more custodial centralized approach because honestly i think for most people it's better it's a better user experience so i do agree that leaning into like maximum decentralization on your assets is like super not appropriate for newbies until they know what they're doing but i feel like there's just a the easy answer to that is like well coinbase has their nft platform coming out and it's going to be a custodial centralized thing uh that should be where people start and then being able to withdraw it because they've also indicated that the coinbase nft platform isn't going to be a walled garden you're gonna be able to put your apes in and move your apes out and so like it's gonna be like so long as you have the ability to like live a decentralized life by like doing your stuff on decentralized things i think you'll be able to easily like migrate it's between centralized platforms like you know coinbase's nft platform and you know whatever decentralized version of openc comes up how do you feel about that version of the future yeah it sounds it's unreasonable um but even then like why do you why do you ever uh run off t to a decentralized platform rather than moving it to another centralized platform so like let's say you buy it on coinbase now you want to sell it you want to sell it and you believe that maybe for whatever reason you can get a better price on another platform so that will be a reason to move um honestly that's the only reason i can think of to move um i mean you can say oh i want custody of my nft but like what does it mean man like it's a penguin like i don't i don't know i mean i i really don't know what it means i don't know i don't know why would anyone want that again fine you know if you buy i get it you buy an nfc for it for a million bucks or 10 million bucks or 50 million bucks then okay maybe you have some thoughts about custody then but like if it's what are we concerned about that coinbase is going to steal your nfts that that they're gonna get hacked and and people are gonna steal the nfc so this strikes me as ridiculous like you know if that happens then coinbase will reissue the nft like you know it feels it feels absurd um well i think rather than like uh the technical properties of decentralization like if you want to do like money lego type stuff with your nfts you want your nfts to be composable you kind of have to have self custody over it well yeah um i mean you don't necessarily have to you can have composability with centralized apis too but so far that's not really what's happening so so i i get what you're saying there if you want to you wanted to to use it and leverage it in in other apps that are not marketplaces yeah maybe coinbase isn't going to offer you all the services you want yeah okay um i can i can kind of see that but that's that's really like the the you know at least for now that's the very sophisticated end of the market um when it comes to tokens when it comes to coins on nfts it doesn't really exist significantly yet sure so could it happen maybe yeah i i just i just i feel like it's probably going to be probably going to remain a sophisticated thing sophisticated people do booty uh who are your heroes in the crypto world do you have any anybody that you look like oh man i mean come on obviously sam bank went free like yeah that's the default answer yeah yeah i think look the guy showed up uh what was it 2017 and he just bootstrapped an empire at a time [Music] you when it's funny but back then everyone thought like hey if you don't have an exchange running by now that's it you're done it's gonna be betrex forever or whatever it was back then i guess finance um and [Music] i mean he bootstrapped an empire very quickly i think that's amazing and um what about sam is it just his accomplishments that you have a ton of respect for no so i was about to say and the you know the the thing i really admire is that he's um he seems to be very flexible uh in his um thinking so you know i i at least from what i can see publicly seems to change his mind fairly often and he adapts to new information very quickly and very well and i think it's a very likable uh ability to have so i mean he's really good at it so he's really good at changing his mind i think that's a good thing i think that's a good look the world changes so often in the last couple of years that you i think you you need to be very flexible in the way you look at things the crypto moves so much faster than the outside world and so i think inside of crypto there is benefit to changing your mind less because crypto moves in the end right yeah you need an anchor right you need a reference point so like sure like being able to adapt is really really useful but if you're trying to adapt as fast as crypto is like you're probably a retail person who's just trying to chase pumps well yeah yeah um you know if we're talking about sam then uh i i'm yeah no i'm not i'm pretty sure sam has yeah i'm pretty sure he has some deeply rooted beliefs as an anchor um and if if you're asking about me um then i think that again what i find exciting about all this is that we can finally do whatever we want with uh you know just money doesn't doesn't that require decentralization because the whole point about we can do whatever we want is enabled by permissionlessness which is required which create privacy centralization yeah so so i've been thinking about this a lot um for years really and surely you have to and the way i see it these days is that i think um it's funny because a lot of you know back in the 2015 16 17 block size wars in bitcoin which are kind of mythological at this point um a lot of the losers of that debate used to say what am i gonna what i'm gonna say now which is that there are multiple ways to go about decentralization like you know there's the bitcoin way which is very um protective and defensive and tries to imagine though you know the the worst things that could happen optimize for that which is why i think you know bitcoin will flourish in a doomsday scenario of the world just don't know that i particularly want that to happen um but i think bitcoin is great for that and um and there are other approaches which are going to say okay technically there are definitely switches that you could use to turn off a thing but the existence of multiple computing platforms with different switches and different jurisdictions and different individuals and some of them are anonymous and others are not and some of them are in singapore and others are in the bahamas and others are the us god forbid and you know and all of those differences between them they ensure continuity of the movement is one of those gonna fail probably yes at least one probably but um you don't necessarily have to have the most robust reliable option it's very unlikely that the most robust and the most reliable option will be the only one that survives because for that they will have to be able to attack everything else which has different weaknesses so that's hard you know so they'll probably go after some of it you know one thing that is very central to this whole thing obviously is tether and usdc and the others those seem like very obvious targets but even there we have multiple and we don't have only one and they're different approaches i feel fairly confident that you know at least some of them will stick around so and i think that's a better way because i don't know if you know i don't know what the best approach is like you could say if some stable coins are more decentralized than others but are they better i'm not sure because they have their own issues and their own problems so i think it's great to have multiple options that's what true decentralization is we don't know which one is going to get attacked harder and more effectively so we have a lot of them i think that's the way to go and ethereum is much less likely to fall than let's say solana it's much more likely that ethereum will stick around for the long term than that solana would but um but it's still not guaranteed in my mind so i'm happy there are other approaches um that's how i look at it who else other than sam in the crypto industry do you consider a hero seems to have been a really cool guy do you think he's satoshi well who knows i wouldn't really know i think it seems like it's um seems like it's possible but i don't have i don't have anything smart to say about it okay maybe what about um outside the crypto industry in the real world do you have any heroes there oh i showed some affinity to jordan peterson already um why jordan peterson are you religious um no i'm not uh i'm not religious but i um you know i'm lucky to [Music] to have uh to have friends who are uh and each if they're you know i'm not gonna mention them but it's in their own way i find to be some of the most uh you know moral and upstanding members of whatever community they want to be a part of and productive so really just great human beings um and it might be a coincidence but that's that's that's that's my impression that's the kind of the luck i had meaning uh people who do consider themselves religious so i even though you know i grew up in an environment that you know look looks at religious people kind of funny um i actually appreciate religious people a lot and while i'm not myself i find that you know there's a popular from from what you know people of faith believe udi do you consider yourself uh a lone wolf or are you a part of a community somewhere um you know i see so i still i still consider myself a bitcoin or even though the bitcoin community is very angry at me most of the time but like aren't they angry at everyone all the time well they're angry at a lot of people that's true um so is the some niches of the ethereum community and when i'm saying some niches it's true for it's true for bitcoin too right because a lot of people look most of the bitcoiners i know are are not well probably not most by numbers but the bitcoiners i'm closest to i didn't meet on twitter and i met them in real life and they're you know they're nothing like the personalities that you do meet on twitter that's kind of a small sect of what bitcoiners are i think most bitcoiners are you know fairly pragmatic like look if to be honest if you if you if if you're someone who was early ish to bitcoin but you're probably somewhat insane if if if you bought bitcoin early and stuck around that there's probably something wrong with you um but it it worked out so so yeah you're gonna have you know those people are they're colorful they're interesting um but most of them are great people so yeah we started off this conversation talking about about the frogs and i kind of think that like there's a significant amount of overlap between like the cyber hornets and like the frog nation like the the bitcoiners will like come after you if you say something dumb and and it feels very much in the same way that the frogs will do the same do you agree with that i think uh i mean i think it's a strong community and [Music] i don't look this this happens but i don't think that's the main thing i see from them you know i don't feel like that's the um okay so not from the frog people and the bitcoiners i think it's gotten worse this year i don't know if i don't know if it's me that started to notice it more well not this year last year i don't know if it's me that noticed it more or if it really did get worse uh but i feel it feels like it got worse to find worse well i think you know i think a lot of the more moderate people kind of disappeared and what was left was just very extreme and you know i'm fine i'm i'm not known as being the nicest person in the world and it's i'm fine with people not being super nice on twitter i don't think it particularly matters if you're nice or not nice it's like whatever you know people have their own personalities but um [Music] there's this um there's this disdain to [Music] any form of knowledge really which is alarming like people refuse to even look into stuff you know when i used to you give you know you hearing people  all the time at least i knew what i was talking about technically you know like at least i you know i did my homework right now a lot of my analysis was wrong but at least i you know was analysis and yeah analyzing yeah yeah so and the i think the reason that matters is um it just looks bad when you when you see when you when you decide that you have to talk very confidently very negatively about something that clearly you do not understand at all then it's a it's just a bad look and these days i think that a lot of the people who are new like any i think most of the people if not all the people who get to bitcoin these days almost without a doubt went through some other coin before they got to bitcoin and i think that's great but if if you they will spot the you can't fool them because they're not idiots they know like you know imagine you you you log you log into twitter you're only like two you have two months of experience in crypto then this bitcoiner shows up or has whatever he's holding bitcoin for i don't know how many decades and he's telling you no you don't get this and you don't get that and that's not how it is that's not and he's like but dude i you do not know what you're talking about i have two months of experience i know more than you that's not a good look that's not very impressive and and again that's i think that's not bitcoiners i don't think that's the bitcoin community that's a small sect that unfortunately uh became more and more seen as representative of the bitcoin community they're i mean you know i i of course i can we can wax poetically about how there's no official representative and there's no that but that's what people see you know they log in there's a bunch of people with a bitcoin logo and there is their profile picture and that's what they see so that's what people perceive as bitcoiners and that's a problem i i hope that changes i think i think there's advanced change um because i think it kind of jumped the shark last year and what about optimistic about that too well not bitcoin bitcoin is great bitcoin doesn't need anything the bitcoin community the the loud parts of the bitcoin community yeah yeah because again a lot of you know i mean what's up you know what's the bitcoin community the early ethereum community is a bitcoin community too right um a lot of people who are bitcoiners are also you know they're dabbling in coins uh they might not even call them coins some of them do some of them don't some of them see a lot of interesting nfts and i think that will continue um some people were kind of afraid to talk about that i see that changing too um so i am optimistic about this i think there is a chance that it will get better the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever

to get started how strong do you think the correlation is between um the goodness of a community and the value of an asset on the secondary markets um well there look there is in the sense that i mean you na you need people to hold the thing and one of the reasons that they're going to continue to hold the thing is the you know the quality of the memes we talked about this before so the you know the community does affect things and [Music] and you know i think you know like michael saylor uh was probably at least partially kind of orange build by by some some of the more uh prominent uh bitcoin community members so it has an effect for sure but again um [Music] the bitcoin community is not what we see on twitter you know like there's so many people who hold bitcoin and don't even bother to they don't care what happens on twitter they don't even know it exists they don't buy bitcoin books and they don't watch bitcoin podcasts and you know they have better things to do in life and um might be just as influential if not more influential they just do it in other ways so yes community matters i'm not sure that this is really the community it looks like it is but you know like a lot of these people honestly don't want to be a dick about it but honestly they joined fairly recently they don't hold a lot of bitcoin so you know how much how much effect on the market can they have um so you know we have to put in perspective and i think that bitcoin is bigger than all of us really um i don't think that our little fights are given to change the long-term trajectory of bitcoin uh but i care about short term too and i think you know if it's kind of um can you imagine you know there's some people this is something for example that i haven't seen in the ethereum and ever there are people in bitcoin community who would say um we don't want they say that explicitly we don't want people to join if they don't understand the greatness and importance of our ideals and our morals and if they're not gonna run their own note and and mix their coins and uh whatever is the month is um then they're not real bitcoiners we don't want them and if they're not gonna do it that's great and that to me is reprehensible it's like if you truly believe that this thing is going to improve people's lives and you actively dissuade them from using it how do you how do you reconcile that exactly like that's that's insane that's that i mean evil i don't know if you truly believe that it's a good you know that bitcoin is it it's gonna improve people's lives and then you actively want them to stay out then you're a pretty bad person so uh the maybe this is kind of what you're referring to when like some parts of the bitcoin community like jump the shark and i i kind of think that like some of this energy comes from uh parts of the bitcoin community just wants to signal to the other parts of the bitcoin community like oh yeah i'm a big big yeah like look how look how much of a bitcoiner i am this is where i draw my maxi line and you have to be at least this maximalist for me to acknowledge your existence that's kind of what i think is going on sure yeah yeah i i would agree with that yeah and i think it's a very um i think it's very similar to what you know what happened with the so-called uh social justice warrior movement um things just go you know it starts from i'm not you know i wouldn't consider myself a progressive person at all but i think that the uh original basics basic ideas are at the very least well-intentioned at the very least so it starts with definitely good intentions and then it just gets more and more and more extreme and it becomes a competition of who's more extreme and at the end it's almost unrecognizable right like it's it becomes seems like insanity and it's a quote um and i think if we don't stop that's where we that's where we end up we've already gone quite a long way but if if we don't if we don't stop i think that's where we end up and it's funny it's sad and funny to see you know a community that a lot of you know a lot of participants consider themselves very right-wing but they still fall to the same trap um so i guess it's not about size anyway it's just human behavior yeah what's your biggest critique of the ethereum community uh it's it's similar i don't think that the ethereum community is largely toxic but i think that um um i see a lot of examples of people who in my opinion just don't notice what people's motivations are i think that's where the bitcoin thing comes from too like you you don't understand what people are looking for and it almost i mean they think community doesn't seem to have gone to the extremities that the bitcoin communities have in the sense of really like ridiculing people for for their beliefs um and their motivations definitely gone far enough is to not understand them at all and to kind of just say something wrong and it's the upper you know centralization thing and how the other things are less decentralized um you know i'm sure you can imagine we had those debates in the bitcoin community so many times that's what people said about ethereum that's what they said about many other things and it's like they're they're not disguising so so for that reason there's there's no need for them to exist at all and um and it's just a repeat of the same thing and i think me you know me maybe you believe that i think we talked about last time kind of said okay but there is a right uh point on the spectrum to be on and i think that the theorem is exactly there i mean maybe i don't feel like i can be that sure about anything really you know it could be but um i don't know and i i haven't you know i haven't seen evidence to that so far um i haven't seen evidence to to others either but that's why you know that's why i believe that in the future people will not even know or care um but i guess we'll see what's your uh biggest critique of bankless [Laughter] well it's the ethereum focus man that's the only thing i think you've done uh i think you've done a you know you've done an amazing job this year really i told you that we've been in person too i think you guys uh you know you grew up very quickly and you became you know a whole household name at crypto i think you've done an amazing job and i think if there's one thing that that that could make it better is if you focus on other things they're not just ethereum um and i mean i think you have sometimes but but you're obviously very thin oriented and i think for a lot of um i think for a lot of new people that's just not it's just gonna be not gonna be enough for them you know right um the moral stance about it around it you know i disagree with um like i i i find it difficult to find any superior morality within ethereum that wouldn't exist on other chains right so um and it's you know it will be i can't tell you how to do your job right you know you know much better than i do and but it at least intuitively and also a little bit from experience i feel like um it's easier let's say you know let's say uh optimism or arbitrarily or stockport or whatever uh are finally at a point where they're really ready to take on the world and i feel like it's gonna be easier at that point to sell those you know sell to to to promote those um after showing that you know you care about the practical solution and not just the politically correct solution right so if you're saying okay right now hey you should usually that should but here's an interesting thing going on in avalanche and polygon and finance or whatever and then six months later you're saying hey optimism is doing all of this but better that's a lot more you know approachable and at least to me but you know your audience better than i do so well i would say i would say a decent amount of the audience would be very very um uh they would agree with you with that with that critique um i think perhaps the reason why we haven't done that is that uh we do believe that this entire space uh stands on top of decentralization and that there are other chains that are not engineered to reflect that truth um that we there are some chains that are engineered that just tilt towards uh centralization more and more and more so just by by the very nature of what the systems are maybe they are have some measure of decentralization today that makes them viable candidates for conversation and you know podcasts and hosting guests but uh our critique is that over the long term just because of the way that the delegated proof of stake systems the the nodes that are just super high juiced up throughputs that that system eventually tilts towards decentralization so we think that we are front running the tilt towards uh centralization by just not talking about it today how does that critique how does that justification land with you was that tilt towards centralization or decentralization many many of these alternative layer ones that are just like have compromised on centralization but still have some semblance of decentralization uh i think a lot of them if not all of them actually just tilt towards centralization more and more and more as time goes on and therefore we're just not going to talk about them just because like well they're in their maximally decentralized state right now and they're actually only going to become more centralized over time yeah um i think you know i think that's a fairly reasonable prediction i think it's definitely possible probably more than possible um but maybe that's what people want that's the only you know that's i think that they will do most of them you know the good ones i think they will do what's right for the majority of their users that's what i think and it's definitely possible that's going to be what's right i would be i myself would probably be more bullish on ethereum if i thought that it would have at least functionality of a more centralized future because um i think that's what people want and i you know i think that you know the modular approach uh might enable that to some degree um but but yeah i think like you know that's the thing like if let's say you know you do the stockport thing whatever zk thing and let's say that's a huge success i don't know maybe it is maybe it is and who knows but let's say it is then let's say people consider that decentralized that works so okay what happens next well obviously you're gonna have the other ones do it too right and they're gonna you know someone's quiet or eventually or they're gonna start their own l1 like one of those things is gonna happen and it's not gonna be an ethereum exclusive that's for sure if it if it's you know if it succeeds so so you know if it's a good solution they'll do it if if they think that the centralized solution is better they'll do that i don't know i honestly don't know what's the best um but i think they will do what's best for users do you have any aspirations or uh for the crypto industry in 2022 like is there anything that you want to see come out of the crypto industry this year um lightning network on coinbase why no no i'm joking oh that was a joke it's funny how uh isn't funny how the people who don't you know who religiously refuse to use exchanges keep harassing exchanges throughout lightning supposedly they listen to you you're not customers right what do you want um no i um that's a very good question i don't know i'm uh i'm a big metaverse geek i uh you know during the first year of it i uh i used to run a bitcoin meetup in virtual reality every week that's something i used to do and that was a lot of fun a lot of people which used to show up for that i think probably still to this day they're more the the amount of active users we had back then is probably still bigger than the number of active users on let's say decentralized today so that's that's something but like but so i'm a huge vr geek a nerd so i don't know i'm just excited about that field in general but it's also extremely overhyped right now you mean the metaverse or vr yeah i mean well metaverse specifically but now you know all the vr people are now just calling themselves metaverse people because i mean vr was a bad name did you know that they used to call themselves xr because it's both ar and vrs like both augmented reality and the virtual reality so they used xr which is like what is this what is this name that's how they called it the xr industry and within a few weeks yeah no one did because it was a terrible name no one cared and now and now it's it's it transitioned completely and fully into the metaverse industry within weeks so i think at the very least it's a better name it's a better buzzword metaverse industry yeah yeah you have an oculus we're gonna have oh yeah of course yeah it's not fun i don't really use it a lot but it's fun for fitness they're cool fitness apps dude like even some of the non-fitness apps can still like break out of sweat like beat saber like you can get it yeah you can get a sweat during that thing man yeah yeah yeah what's your favorite uh oculus game i mean bit saber for sure and um and uh what was the name of the other one there's supernatural is a pretty good one it's very similar to beat saber it's like designed for fitness so it's that's a good one um there's a very good pc vr game i mean the best obviously the best is half-life alex if you have a vr headset you have to play it right phenomenal um i mean that's that's what needs like a a wired connection to your pc right you you need some form there you can do it wirelessly too but you need a gaming pc um that one is really good really good i mean i said if you have a vr headset but really you should get a vr headset for that because it's that good it's a phenomenal game but uh in 2022 have you uh any new year's resolutions have you resolved to do anything in 2022 well i don't want to share them because i'm obviously not gonna actually do them so i want people to that's the people i could ever think you could say yeah all right you're not gonna share them why why why would you uh uh not want to do your own new year's resolutions no no i will i will um but they're private and uh and um yeah i don't know let's focus on people this year what does that mean i don't know i'm trying to say something inspirational i don't know i have no idea what do you think my new year's resolution should be i haven't i haven't formally come up with mine yet uh man i don't know i don't know like if you do the same thing you did last year but bigger i think that would be good you're bankless yeah yeah i mean look but i don't think and no one reasonable should want you to stop i think you guys are doing a great job um and if you if you continue to focus on people then i think you'll eventually become multichained too we shall see we shall see um yeah udi what do you when you wake up in the morning what do you care about what what ends up in your head first thing and the bitcoin prize yeah right check the bitcoin price first every day for for i don't know 15 years old however long it has been every single day no not really not really um i don't know first thing i think about when i wake up is breakfast man i don't that's it i don't have any who knows what uh do what i like to do seriously though what i like to do in the morning is go out uh to the balcony and just look at this lively city i love that yeah yeah your coffee are you a morning coffee guy no i actually don't do coffee at all almost yeah yeah what is your advice do you have advice of choice i mean i would in another life i would have been an alcoholic for sure i'm just fighting it very uh aggressively but i for sure would have been an alcoholic what's your favorite type of alcohol my favorite is beer and that that i just don't drink at all and haven't had a beer in a very long time uh because it's also it also doesn't fit into my diet um because i'm doing the no carb thing but uh are you doing keto stuff so yeah most of the time yeah well it depends last time we met in miami i was obviously in one of my uh relapses but uh but i try yeah yeah yeah well it's hard to do crypto conferences and also stick to regiments at the same time yeah yeah um so yeah if i do drink it would usually be whiskey but i try to avoid it most of the time yeah all right udi well any last things i should be picking your brain about that i haven't asked yet well we talked about members so that's it that's the most important thing uh mad versus the most important of course is bitcoin greater than 50 of your overall crypto portfolio oh yeah for sure yeah yeah buy a long shot yeah yeah because i i don't uh it's a you know it's a risk-adjusted thing right i'm very i'm very sure about bitcoin and i don't need to you know i i don't need to outperform everyone it's fine i'm i'm i'm okay and and i'm very sure about i can sleep well holding bitcoin um i i do hold other stuff uh sometimes but it's going to be a small percentage because there's a much greater risk um it's as simple as that if you know if bitcoin dips 50 tomorrow i'm i'm gonna be fine i'm not gonna lose a lose a minute of sleep over it but the other stuff i'm going to give myself so much um you need conviction right you need conviction to hold things for the long term so what advice do you have uh for people that came into crypto in 2021 uh you know there are two ways to make it one is to gamble and that's gonna work for some people and it's going to fail miserably for others and if that's who you want to be that's i mean fine um but that's you know i can't give you a lot of advice about gambling um the other option is going to be to really dive dip deep in research and i think that if you do that you know you're gonna need to especially now you're gonna have to kind of find your niche it used to be just crypto and now you're gonna have to find your niche inside crypto because it's virtually possible to deep dive into everything so first of all find that then um do some very very serious deep tags into the topic of your choice and i think if you do that consistently there's still you know it's still early but you need to do that you can't just oh i'll just buy if i'll just buy bitcoin i don't think that this is going to give people what they're looking for well udi thank you for coming on this episode of layers here yep thanks thanks for
