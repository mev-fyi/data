[Music] coordination what's good today on the pod we got sergey nazarov the co-founder of chain link and chain link is really interesting for me because it's the industry standard oracle network for connecting smart contracts with real world data uh and off chain computation so if you want to build a smart contract that's smart it's got to have data about what's going on in the world and chain link is the largest smart contract network for doing that in this episode we talk about sergey's vision for chain link intersecting with all trust minimize computation so not just oracle's in the future the vision is broader than that and given that season two of the green pill podcast is about regenerative society and decentralized identity we talk a little bit about how oracle networks and decentralized computing can bring value to everyday people how decentralized identity can create a more regenerative world and man he's just such a galaxy brain i can't believe that he's just not dropping knowledge bombs this entire episode deeply technical but also empathetic to the cause of the green pill community which is regenerative crypto economic society so i think that you're really going to enjoy this episode with sergey nazarov the co-founder of chain link i know that i did without further ado i give you sergey and azeroth refi summer has arrived and sello is here for it sello

immutable.com alright thanks so much for joining me thanks uh for having me kevin yeah really excited to talk to you about chain link so how did you get into crypto and how did you come to co-found chain link so i got into crypto around 2010 when the only thing that existed was bitcoin um i actually got into it from the gaming side of things because i was into and still am into pc games and back then there were only three groups that really did anything with bitcoin they were the people who made it uh crypto cipher punk people there were um speculators and then there were um gamers uh which were many of the miners back then because you could still do that with gpus so i got in from that point of view um because i learned about it from the gaming community and then as i started to learn more about what bitcoin actually was and how it was different than other digital currencies and how it could exist without an organization and how it could exist into perpetuity and how it was immutable and beyond the control of any one party i knew enough about the history of digital currencies to see the the value in that and then i spent a few years kind of just doing bitcoin bitcoin related things nothing really impressive or or that useful and then the first smart contract started to come out uh well before ethereum and others so started working on some of those and some of the first systems that went beyond bitcoin um i think the first one that i saw was namecoin and then where a few others uh started working on those systems putting them together basically trying to combine them into more advanced applications so initially what i was doing was trying to combine multiple chains to have different like privacy preserving and uh well not exactly privacy-preserved but different encryption and and transparency in certain cases privacy features and so we would make these applications composed of like a few different features from a few different chains it was you know immensely difficult and there weren't uh as many guarantees and it wasn't as much speed but it was you know super interesting and then chain link came out of the experience of doing that because oracles are basically a computing environment that does what blockchains don't do but it still does it in a trust minimized way so basically what what we realized in the course of building all these smart contracts was that blockchains could only do a certain set of operations that we needed and those operations were very important uh they they focused on private keys token ledgers and state changes uh state machine changes and you know ethereum did an amazing job at introducing kind of a programmable state machine that people could could use for general purpose instructions um but there's still a ton of computation that blockchains don't do and it was really the combination of those computations together with blockchain computations that um i always felt even from the earliest days would give to uh smart contracts right like they're called smart um but you know blockchains in and of themselves don't even allow them to know what time it is they don't allow them to have access to any information outside of the chain and so my conception of a smart contract was always uh beyond tokenization and beyond what blockchains enable and that conception naturally led to oracle networks because they are the um well they're the really the gateway to more advanced smart contracts what we call hybrid smart contracts one example of this is defy so d5 for example wouldn't exist without oracles and oracle networks and there's many more other use cases like that so the the thinking behind chain link was to create decentralized infrastructure that provided these additional capabilities beyond those three capabilities of a blockchain um and very happy to say that the network has successfully done that has uh powered into the power of tens of billions of dollars in value has enabled hundreds of billions of dollars in value and in in in many different verticals is by far the leader in how people build applications like defy um so in that sense i think a lot has been achieved but i think there's much much further further to go right beautiful so it seems like the oracle problem is what chain link is really deep on solving and you can build much smarter smart contracts with oracle's i'm curious if you could pull if i could pull the thread a little bit more you could tell me a little bit more about how chain link works and what's the end game like what is the world in which chain link is maximally successful looks look like sure so i just think of it in terms of decentralized computation what an oracle network is is it's a way to generate consensus but it generates consensus on topics other than a blockchain's topics right so a blockchain can generate consensus on transactions about private key signatures token transfers token ledger updates and state machines those are the things that a blockchain can come to consensus on and that's great and that has given rise to this whole tokenization movement which has resulted in trillions of dollars of value being formatted in this cryptographically guaranteed tokenized format and that's great and that's a great start just like the internet began with unencrypted messaging right and universities would send messages between each other and you know then the message is expanded to more consumer use cases so that's all wonderful but what um oracle networks do is they come to consensus through a committee of nodes right so there's smaller committees of nodes that come to consensus on specific topics you you actually start starting to see some chains try to make smaller committees as a way to scale whether they call it sharding or side chains or parachains or subnets or whatever they call it they basically try to create smaller committees to make smaller chains focused on a specific application's needs for those three things private keys token ledgers and state machines um oracle networks and chain link as a framework for oracle networks is a way to create small efficient committees on any other topic and uh you know proud to say that we have over a thousand of these um oracle networks over a thousand of these committees um which is a level of scalability that other systems um have yet to reach and those thousand plus committees can come to consensus on many many things so they can come to consensus on random numbers they can come to consensus on data about weather they can come to consensus about data about prices they can come to consensus about computations that may not be done in a blockchain or people don't want to do in a blockchain they can basically come to consensus on anything that people want them to come to consensus about but they are not focused on blocked production right so our goal is not to generate blocks there's a lot of different chains uh that are generating blocks and that's great and you know i kind of view that as a computing environment and you know maybe a database or or however you want to really look at it uh you know database with unique transparency and immutability properties but we don't make blocks we create committees of nodes uh the network creates committees of nodes that sit next to block production systems like blockchains and they inject everything that those blocks need so if those blocks need data they give them data they need randomness they give them randomness they need some more computation that they can't do on a blockchain they give them that they soon enough they will be able to give them cross-chain communication to other blockchains as well as movements so to answer your second question the end game is that oracle networks provide all the trust minimized computation that blockchains and trust minimized systems need but that blockchains do not produce right so blockchains will produce ownership token transfer state changes private key signatures multisig they will continue to produce all of these computations in in various collections of blocks whether those blocks are on a main chain or whether they're on a collection of smaller chains connected to a main chain and and that is where certain core logic certain transfer of value certain key conditions to private key signatures will continue to become fulfilled but then all of those conditions will continue to need more and more data more and more trust minimized computation and more and more cross-chain communication those are the first three big categories that the chain-link network is focused on and then many of them has a leadership position anywhere from the 60 to 90 plus range in terms of the value secured in a specific vertical or by user count and this is because um well we've invented this new form of consensus we've pioneered it together with a lot of great academics that that we work with from the top universities and now it's kind of becoming expanded to do more and more advanced computations more and more advanced data and suit relatively soon uh cross-chain communication which includes token movements but actually allows people to string together those uh different contracts on different chains much as i was trying to string together many different blockchain protocols into a single useful application many many years ago so this is not i would say a new idea for us it's an idea that has formed on the basis of what um is needed to build useful smart contracts right so our goal is to enable the larger industry and the world really to have useful smart contracts and while tokenization is very useful it's a very good beginning for our industry i think it is probably a single digit percentage point of the total value that will reside in the trust minimized um systems of our industry like blockchains and oracle so i think tokens and ownership whether they're equity tokens or utility tokens or nft tokens is just the beginning and our goal with the chain link network is to um level everything up and i'm very proud that we've had a a big impact on that in d5 in insurance and fraud proof gaming in carbon credit markets a number of places beautiful so it seems like oracles are just the start and there's a lot of opportunities within decentralized computation as that ecosystem grows and tokenization is just a percentage of that i'm curious to see how our visions align as you know i was one of the co-founders of git coin which is uh known for git coin grants one of the largest crowdfunding applications in the web3 ecosystem i'm wondering because chainlink has been a longtime supporter of bitcoin grants thank you for supporting bitcoin grants what are your what are your thoughts on open source funding and public goods funding and how does that intersect with your vision i think the coolest thing that the most impressive thing that a technology or an invention can do is become a global standard which means that it becomes a public good and open source software is the the version of this for you know software and the internet so i'm a big supporter of open source software and have been for for the longest time also open source software tends to win and it tends to win for a number of reasons around how many eyeballs uh i'll look at a problem around people's ability not to necessarily have to deal with large corporate entities that want to take over their uh you know their use of a type of system and and a lot of other huge benefits security benefits the ability to build a community of smart people to solve a problem so i think there's two two parts to your question there's an open source part and a public goods funding part so on the open source part i think that's the right way to build software that becomes a global standard and that is really what we are trying together with many other ecosystem companies in the chain link ecosystem to move the chain link network towards towards being a global standard much as linux is a global standard https is a global standard uh tcpip is a global standard these are all global standards that power the internet and blockchains have begun a transition to trust minimized applications that's actually what we see ourselves as participating in so it doesn't necessarily have to be that the whole application is on a blockchain or that the whole application is off a blockchain i think all applications will eventually become trust minimized which means that they guarantee their users certain um reliability transparency and properties about not being able to deviate one example of a trust minimized application in my mind is actually encrypted text messaging so 10 15 years ago nobody cared about encrypting their text messages and then everybody saw you know hacksaw telecoms the cambridge analytica thing and facebook and now the top retail uh messaging systems all have end to end encrypted at the top of each chat session they write and this is entered encrypted this means not even the team of the thing can can read your messages so i think the whole world will go in a trust minimized application direction and i think that that will require global standards and those global standards will be public goods because the nature of trust minimized applications and their impact on society in on a truth focused on a truth-based society and a kind of truth economy is something that we seek to enable so um i think bitcoin grants is is a great thing and it's a great model and it's supporting a section of the trust minimized application economy primarily focused on ethereum of which i'm also a big fan and which you know has pioneered a lot of amazing things in our industry and so i've been thrilled to have chain link participate in helping support ethereum its innovations the bitcoin grants program because at the end of the day i think we are all part of building a trust minimized world we're all part of building a world where our relationships are cryptographically guaranteed and that's what ethereum and chain link and everybody else in this industry is really working towards and that's what i'm working towards and that's the the the real shift in the world that i think everyone here wants to see and and it is such a big impactful um shift that i think the systems that make it happen will have to be public goods they will be such a big part of how society functions that just like linux or https or tcpip or any number of other standards they will become public goods so so you might as well just be clear about that and you might as well just set out on that on that journey and towards that goal which in in my opinion once again i think is probably the pinnacle of what you can achieve in making the technology is you can create a global standard for how the world works for many many decades um and and that's really the goal that we have with all of the computation and all the trust minimized application work that the chain link network enables beautiful well thank you again for your support of public goods on gitcoin grants and it's quite interesting to see the intersection of those two visions i'm curious you know if i could pull the threat a little bit more if you think that smart contracts oracles and blockchains can create a world in which there's more economic fairness and transparency how does this vision that you have of creating more standards and more public goods create more economic fairness or transparency for for everyday people sure absolutely one of my favorite examples is crop insurance because it has relatively little to do with tokenization i think eventually the cash flows from crop insurance will become tokenized and sold as tokens but the initial implementations of crop insurance of decentralized insurance against weather and for crops is um something that really shows how the entire world can leapfrog towards a fair and transparent model of um basically commercial relationships which if you really think about it commercial relationships are what enable us to live the lives we live uh the ability for people to engage reliably in commercial relationships is at the bedrock of capitalism it's at the bedrock of how our society works and it's at the bedrock of why we all have so much discretionary time to pursue whatever we want to pursue so crop insurance um doesn't really exist in many parts of the world and it doesn't exist in many parts of the world because the local legal system in those countries does not provide enough reliable collaboration you can't make an insurance company because you'll be defrauded or the policy policyholder will be defrauded and so what that results in is that there are entire parts of the world where one negative event can throw um you know a very large population into poverty because they don't have a way to mitigate that risk they don't have a way to manage risk and you know this might not sound as exciting as other use cases but realistically if you look at the history of the world the point at which people can manage risk is the point at which they begin to engage in certain types of activities so the point at which you can create insurance for ships is the point at which people start sailing really long distances on those ships and the point at which you can create insurance for other activities is the point at which people start doing those activities now i would say probably the majority of the world doesn't have a way to create many uh relationships many commercial relationships and to manage help people manage risk so the the beauty of smart contracts and oracle's combining is that you can actually make crop insurance that has nothing to do with the legal system of the country in which it is provided so you you don't need to have a local insurance company you don't need to even have an international insurance company you can just codify all the conditions into a smart contract have those conditions verified by oracles right which is one of the few things one of the many things that oracles do it's one of the few things they do extremely well now um and to have those conditions verified and proven to the contract opens up this universe of new commercial relationships so now if you if you live in a certain part of the world where global warming is making things a lot more difficult in terms of being a farmer for a few consecutive seasons your option before was to stop being a farmer and become a migrant worker now you can get crop insurance that guarantees your ability to continue being a farmer and that crop insurance can be at an even higher quality than the insurance that people in developed countries get from the biggest insurance companies and that's this a similar type of leapfrogging to when you had people trying to get paper books and not having local libraries to having a 50 android phone and being able to read and listen to the same content and information that i gain access to so i i think what the internet did for information and how it democratized access to information is what uh smart contracts and oracles and hybrid smart contracts will do for democratizing commercial relationships and if you really think about it i think you'll see that that is the main thing holding back the vast majority of the world it's people's ability to pursue their economic uh goals because they can't engage in productive commercial relationships basically because their local economy their local legal system doesn't enable that interaction once you enable that interaction then people can pursue their economic goals which is generally when everything improves for everybody so this is just kind of a view that i have on on the value of what our industry does is that it's similar to like the invention of the corporation or the invention of written contracts there there's a kind of a step function increase in how people are able to relate to each other and how people are able to collaborate and that ability to relate to each other reliably and collaborate reliably across borders without knowing each other because those collaborations are now cryptographically guaranteed is an entirely different world just like the world before the corporation was a very different world and the world before written contracts was a very different world i think it's a similar step function improvement coin

sort of intersect in such a way that you know what the internet did to information we both view web3 as doing to value transfer into finance and i'm wondering to to pull a thread a little bit more about decentralized identity i i think that identity when you have repeat interactions allows for more positive some games because you start to recognize your counterparty you see the reputation of how they've interacted economically in the past and because of that identity is a huge vision for me of what a regenerative decentralized society could look like in the future so i'm wondering if there's any parts of decentralized identity solutions that you think will change how individuals and institution relate institutions relate to each other and if so which standards are you excited about soul bound tokens dids verifiable credentials how does this interplay with the chain link vision sure so i would say that chain link right now is the largest provider of identity data on chain i would say we have the largest amount of identity sources that are available for consumption on chain and those sources generally result in um more and more use cases that have uh legal requirements right so one good example is something called regulated defy so regulated defy would meet various um ml kyc and other requirements that other people may have for using d5 at an institutional level or or at other levels of interaction with defy which frankly has a huge amount of value that can flow into defy into insurance um and into other categories of smart contracts i think identity is one example of one type of data that the chain link network already provides and there's already people using to make innovative new use cases and i think we're just going to continue doing this there's so many categories of data right there's weather data identity data market data many many other categories so identity is one of the categories that i think the chain link network is the largest provider of data um in the in the blockchain industry and i think we're starting to see a slow uptick in in what people want to use that identity data for um i think that it is a requirement to open up a new market so so basically right now there's still enough markets that identity data isn't a necessity you can still capture markets where identity data doesn't exist but those markets will continue to have more and more competition they'll be they'll continue to grow and have competition so i think there's entire other markets that apps can open up if they meet this identity requirement and our goal as the chi our goal as as a group working on the chain link network is to make the infrastructure provide that capability right so if you want to make regulated defy the chain link network should give you access to all the identity data you could ever want you could get it in a consensus-based form you could get it in a single source form where the data's signed by the source you can get it in a privacy preserving form using your zero knowledge proofs you can get it in whatever form you want from whatever source you want and so once again our goal is not to build the use cases it's not to build the blockchains where the app's core logic might live on where the token value might live it's to build all of these additional computations in their own small building blocks right so you we we have a pretty large number of identity data sources it's growing each of those could be viewed as a building block that somebody can combine into an application and realistically we now have many many teams combining multiple chain link services multiple chain link networks into one application right and and i think that's for data if people want to be really reliable and i know uh sorry with identity there's different identity data sets for different geographies so i fully expect applications to use one data source through chain link for one set of data about identity another data source about another set of identity for another geography and to kind of cobble that together the same way that people do it in web 2 where they use multiple identity sources because of multiple geographies once again our goal is to enable that i think on identity we've gone very far on that already and as identity gives people access to markets it'll become a more and more useful building block um which is why the chain link network has spent so much time and energy and effort on making it available right yeah i mean i think it's interesting to think about uh get coin passport which is a civil resistance protocol that the get coin dao has released most recently and uh bitcoin grants is dependent on quadratic funding which is dependent on civil resistance and because of that uh civil resistance is just something get coin cares a lot about and i know that one of the things that that the coin dial is looking at right now is how to create a contract gate on a smart contract where if you have a certain amount of civil resistance then you can call a certain function in a smart contract and i know that they're taking a look at chain link oracle's uh in order to bring that information on chain so i don't know if you have any comments on that if not i'll move to my next question just thought it was interesting to call out another intersection of the git coin and chain link uh visions yeah that's that's very exciting i mean i mean that's that's a really good example right like there's a more advanced functionality and there needs to be an environment that provides that functionality to allow you folks to build a more and more impressive application that that's what's that's what is exciting to us it's very exciting to us to enable other people in our ecosystem and in the trust minimized application blockchain ecosystem to build more advanced versions by providing them the compute data or whatever capabilities that they're not getting from a chain so so the fact that you guys are doing that is great i think it's a more advanced version of of your application and i and and i and i know that i and many people here are very excited about enabling that great yeah i'm curious to uh to learn about the the privacy preserving oracle protocol called deco the eco that was just launched so what what is what is what is that what novel use cases does it unlock whether in decentralized identity decentralized finance or other fields sure so so we're excited to have some some more upcoming news about that sometime soon but but generally speaking um identity and many types of personal data personal personal identifying data um don't really work well with systems that don't preserve privacy right and and blockchains are inherently very public so there's this kind of dilemma around i want identity data to be proven but i don't want the identity data itself to go on a chain and this has to do with all kinds of requirements from all kinds of um legal frameworks whether that's gdpr or hipaa or just very basic privacy uh laws right so generally speaking people don't want their private data in public databases and legally that that isn't a realistic thing in many cases which is what's held up a certain amount of identity data reaching blockchain applications deco in addition to its many other great properties for d5 and other other other other parts of the smart contract ecosystem allows the verification of a piece of personal identity data without putting that data on chain so it uses zero knowledge proofs to prove things about a person's identity for example that they're a certain age or they have a certain amount of money in their bank account or that they're in a certain geography or whatever other properties you want to prove about somebody to assure you that they meet a certain condition or that they're a real person or whatever property you want to have proven and that property gets proven through zero knowledge proofs without the personal data going on chain and and this is the kind of really big leap forward where you can prove something about an identity but you don't need to put that data into a blockchain which in many many cases of personal identity data you simply could not do that for for legal reasons people actually don't want to do that people don't want their personal information in public databases where anyone can go get it at some point in the future um you know people like their personal information just remain personal and private not public and uh accessible by everybody so this is the one of the things that deco achieves uh it successfully has achieved this already in uh research implementations it's now successfully achieving it in various proof of concepts that we'll be put putting out there sometime soon and it's it's well on its way to multiple production implementations that'll have it provide the value of all kinds of information identity data as well as back-end systems data market data all kinds of valuable data using that data in a smart contract while not forcing the data to become public which is a condition for using the data so that that's a kind of a firm condition that certain types of data whether it's market data back-end systems data personal identity data that condition simply cannot be removed if that data is going to be used and so this goes back to the earlier point of our goal is to enable more and more applications so if there was a certain type of data high quality market data import back-end data um critical personal identity data without which an application could not be built that is no longer a hurdle right so you can now build smart contract applications using that personal identity data using that highly sensitive um back-end data using that highly valuable highly protected market data without having to reveal the data uh so that is you know the kind of innovation and invention and uh originality that we are very proud of because it allows the protocol to enable entirely new categories of smart contracts and and i have to say that that's just kind of the most exciting thing for me on a daily basis it's the ability to enable entire new categories of smart contracts that then become their own markets such as d5 and i i generally don't believe that d5 would be anywhere where it is today anywhere near where it is today without chain link oracle's providing you know over four billion data points and and and providing massive amounts of data without which d5 was a great idea for many years but without which it did it didn't take off and if you actually look at the rate at which d5 grows on different chains you'll see that the point that highly reliable oracle network data from chain link arrives in that on that chain is the point at which there's kind of this huge inflection point in how d5 starts growing so so d5 is really kind of the case study of how oracle networks enable entire new categories and entire new markets but there are many many markets uh there are as many markets as there is digital human activity that needs to become trust minimized and that is obviously hundreds of trillions of dollars so so that is the the kind of opportunity that i think we're really going after is how to enable hundreds of trillions of dollars to become trust minimized with the help of these oracle networks that give rise to these more advanced hybrid smart contracts yeah i mean i think it really is a pretty big opportunity if you think that the opportunity for oracle networks is as big as any human economic activity and so i'm curious you know i i i want to end on this point what is the ultimate vision of chain link in the smart contract economy and where are we in that journey i think we've covered it a little bit up in the conversation so far but if you could just paint a picture as we close for the ultimate vision for the chain link and smart contract economy i think that would be a really great place to end sure so our our internal goal at chainlink labs as one of the one of the organizations helping build chain link is to build a world powered by truth and what what that means is that oracle networks will play a critical part in creating key cryptographic inputs outputs and decentralized infrastructure to create a world powered by truth and when we say truth we mean cryptographic truth so cryptographically guaranteed relationships there's a certain kind of cryptographic guarantee when you hold a bitcoin or when you have an ethereum token um even in a smart contract the deviation that can happen that could affect that token or that bitcoin negatively is a very limited universe of things and that very limited universe for us is a source of truth it's a source of guarantees it's it's a way that the world should work where instead of brands promising you to that they will fulfill their application their obligations as an application they become unable to do that and then you know the the experience you expected with them doesn't happen so i i think there's this world that's probabilistic today where there's a lot of brands promising things and not not reliably delivering them and there's a deterministic world which is defined by cryptographic guarantees cryptographic truth and everything being a trust minimized application so the the goal of the chain link network in my mind is to become the computing resource through which all trust minimized applications go into production get all the reliable services they need gain all the capabilities they need to become useful outside of what a blockchain provides right so blockchain can provide the block space a blockchain can provide the token ledger a blockchain can provide a private key infrastructure but it cannot provide it does not provide all of this other computation and all of this other computation i would say is a huge category of work because as i said earlier we already have multiple smart contracts that use multiple oracle networks so if you look at the percentage of the application that's running in an oracle network versus the percentage running on chain those percentages are starting to look more and more equal which means that oracle networks are continuing to provide greater and greater value whether that value is transferring tokens transferring messages between chains sending data doing computations providing randomness providing identity information in a privacy preserving way there is a very large and growing array of computations that need to be trust minimized that trust minimized applications cannot exist without so so just just to keep it really brief our goal is to build a world powered by truth by transitioning all the world's application applications into a trust minimized state right so we want everything to become trust minimize and i feel that that chain link network makes the infrastructure that will allow that transition to happen together with you know the other key infrastructure of our industries like ethereum various other chains and and so on great quite quite a great beautiful place to end i'm curious if there's anything that i didn't ask that you want to say i i guess i would say uh you know i'm i'm really impressed by by the work you've done on git coin and you know quadratic funding and the way that that's positively impacted the ethereum community and the the commitment that a number of other people have made to fund a series of public goods that benefit them and benefit a larger community so i think aligning this kind of certain degree of self-interest so that we all have a good reliable infrastructure in the form of ethereum together with the creation um of a public good that we all want to see happen kind of marrying those two interests is uh is a really impressive feat and i think it's it's going in the right direction and um you know i've just been impressed to see how it's developing and really really thrilled uh to be a part of it and excited excited to see you know the the next shape that it takes right well thank you so much for saying that on behalf of get coin dao which is now hundreds of people and um i'm actually not that deeply involved anymore and thank you for your support of git coin grants and public goods in the past uh looking forward to building a decentralized regenerative future together so thanks so much for joining me thank you for having me cheers [Music]
