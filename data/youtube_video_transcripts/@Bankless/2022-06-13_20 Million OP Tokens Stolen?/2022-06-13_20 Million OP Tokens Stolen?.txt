20 million in op tokens hacked stolen yeah so optimism in the winter mule team made a deal where the mule team would liquidity provide for optimism tokens to carry out this engagement optimism gave a temporary grant of 20 million op tokens to send to winter mule as part of the foundation's partner fund the whoopsies that happened here was that they used one of the very very old versions of the gnosis multisig that has since been updated and as a result of that quirk the address on the ethereum layer 1 is not the same as the address on the ethereum layer 2. and that resulted in the op tokens going to a multi-sig address that had not yet been initialized and so there was an attacker that i think basically just like spammed the initialization of a multi-stake address until they got the right one giving them control over the 20 million op tokens winter mute is going to be buying tokens off of the secondary market to replace the losses and they committed to all of this stuff before like crypto twitter got up in arms about the drama about it so i think this is going to be just a very small pickup in the very long story of both winter mute and optimism
