welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david awesome podcast today in a subject i didn't know too much about who did we talk to we talked to michael shalov from the firebox company which just raised 310 million dollars which is all going to infrastructure to help people that get scared coming into crypto which is kind of more or less everyone especially when there's a lot of risk at stake so tended to be geared towards institutions firebox is a infrastructure for getting into the world of crypto but not just getting assets into cold storage but getting them into safe storage yet also hooking into all of the cool powers that defy and the rest of the crypto ecosystem gives you so we talked to michael about what it's like to to build that company and really how this company fits into the overall sphere of the crypto world and what they have really unlocked and are enabling over at the world of fire blocks yeah absolutely this is like a huge bridge to crypto to me and it's an institutional bridge not only to crypto but it's also an institutional bridge to defy so that's what's super exciting about what fire blocks is doing there are a lot of crypto custodians out there you know coinbase gemini they will hold your keys there's companies like bitco that sort of thing but fire blocks does more than that for institutions they actually give them exposure to d5 protocols so if you're an institution you want to trade something on uniswap but you want to do it in a way that secures your private keys or if you want to deposit funds into compound or ave fire blocks does this so david this is really cool because i think it is um i guess living out uh one of the predictions we've made for a while which is kind of the protocol sync thesis that the most decentralized credibly neutral protocols will kind of tend to fall to the bottom of everything else and everything else will be built on top of them we also talk about a little bit about the d5 mullet which is sort of an extension of the the crypto protocols thesis the idea that finpex are going to start building on these d5 protocols and become these these hybrid crypto fintech type things and we're really seeing that play out with the fire block story that's like exactly what they are doing they are the bridge to uh to this entire thesis for me the most interesting part of this conversation was how the similar skills from the tradify world which we would consider to be like cyber security when you take cyber security skills and then you apply them to defy and you use ethereum and bitcoin as your back end like all of a sudden you have cyber security not around you know information in it for you know a traditional company but now you have cyber security around bank accounts right like your ethereum wallet your bitcoin wallet and that fundamentally changes the role that fireblocks has for going from a cyber security background to just infrastructure security and protection around your bank account which is your private key and so it really just like is a new evolution as to what cyber security means because now the cyber security is now fintech now it's now it's a fintech service not just you know protection around like your servers uh and so the changing nature of the role of similar skills from from tradfy or from the legacy world into defy i think it's a really interesting through line that that if you pay attention you can glean a lot of lessons out of this uh episode with with michael yeah i love this conversation hugely bullish on what's happening with d5 like the institutions now have a way to enter directly into d5 protocols not just one or two but like all of them make sure you stay tuned where michael talks about how like through fire blocks they basically have access to all of the d5 protocols that are available that can be connected through wallet connect um one question though david we did ask him near the end and i was sort of concerned about thinking about this is like fire blocks is not bankless you are giving up your private keys to uh to another entity in order to use it and institutions kind of have to do that anyways in order to play in the space so what happens if everyone starts giving up their private keys do we get a less bankless world so he answers that question i think he had a pretty nuanced answer which i really appreciated so guys we think you are going to enjoy this episode before we get into it we want to thank the sponsors that made it possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your dapps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrome so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrometer layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest we have michael shaloff he is the ceo and co-founder of fireblocks what is fireblocks firebox is like the aws of crypto banking he's grown this company to crypto unicorn status already so in late july they raised over 310 million dollars at a two billion dollar valuation just blows my mind if you're in the crypto institutional space you already know about fire blocks but if you're not maybe if you're a bankless listener it's kind of a d5 power user and fire blocks is probably one of the most important companies in crypto that you've not heard of and here's my favorite part fire blocks is defy friendly so i definitely see fire blocks as providing an essential bridge between the institutions we've been craving to come into crypto and defy this is part of the protocol sync thesis in action we think where the decentralized money protocols become the base layer for everything else michael after that long intro sir wanna say welcome to bank list how are you doing thank you thank you thanks ryan thanks david for having me doing great and you know exciting to join you guys in this session well i bet you're doing great because you guys just raised 300 million dollars at a 2 billion dollar evaluation i have two questions about this first how does that feel and then and then second what are you going to do with all this money um so it feels great i mean i think that it's i wouldn't say just the valuation and the money i think it's the fact that it happened in a fairly short period of time right because we started the company back in 2018 and we launched our product about two years ago and probably the most important um actually the most important numbers for us is the are the fact that we have 500 clients right and the fact that we have uh about uh one we grew the company to about 160 employees right in that period of time so just uh we're seeing the market expanding and uh yeah generally exciting um the the main thing around i think uh the funding itself right or the big question is what are we going to do with the money is uh is mostly around the fact that we need to continue and invest first and foremost right in engineering and to be able to support the client base to support more and more institutions that are coming to the space both from engineering standpoint operation standpoint customer success customer support and so on and the second aspect is that for our clients it's sort of very important to understand that they're dealing with a stable player that can you know work with them on the long term right and the fact that we have now the balance sheet and the money and the um and the ability to stay independent is um extremely important for for our current clients and especially for the people that we are currently working on doing business with so you mentioned michael more and more institutions coming to this space so is that what you're seeing are institutions starting to flood into the space and give us a flavor for who these institutions are maybe some names listeners might recognize yeah so um we are seeing we're seeing quite a lot of the banks it's it's a bit weird right because you know i guess in many ways the entire essence of crypto right was to basically maybe this intermediate this intermediate banks right but inevitably what happens is that at least right now a lot of those banks they do have um whether it is fomo right looking at the fintech players and trying to sort of like tap into that amount of into that activity into that revenue stream into the opportunity right so that's you know one reason why they're doing it and i think that the most interesting aspect of it is that the more intelligent group of i would say uh financial institutions traditional financial institutions you know banks exchanges uh some of the more traditional fintechs right they're basically looking at the underlying technology and i guess in many ways what we call d5 but eventually the essence of blockchain right the ability to have autonomous finance that is driven through smart contracts and this sort of smart programmable money and they understand that this is might be the most impactful and interesting technology um that they can you know that on one hand if they're there early they can use it as part of their competitive advantage right and on the flip side if they're late uh they can be completely disintermediate right so i think that there is a broad realization of that and that's why i think people are sort of those institutions are coming in right so i guess a good example that we always give and they invested in us in serious sea is a bank of new york maryland that we are working with uh to basically deploy the technology with a and build those capabilities and for you know for the listeners that are unfamiliar with bank of new york well it's like the oldest bank in in the united states and they're the biggest custodian in the world in fact i'm not showing the exact number right now but they hold somewhere around 40 trillion dollars of assets right so the majority of the assets in the world are actually sitting in bank of new york melon and and they do see um it's sort of public information but they do have a fairly extensive uh plan around not only how they do you know crypto like bitcoin ethereum but really how this is sort of uh prog what is the progression to really touch on the uh traditional assets or the existing assets that they're currently custody and how they can basically bring them into blockchain tokenize them and so on michael uh you mentioned um fomo in the context of institutions uh we talk about retail fomo all of the time is it true that institutions can also get fomo um the individuals within the institutions can get formal right now i guess like you know people are people right and and yes i mean in reality uh the what happened was is that ins all those banks and institutions they somewhere in between fomo and basically uh you know being caught off guard right if you take jp morgan chase as an example right and i think it's a it's an interesting example to look at they sort of switch side over the last uh i don't know 12 months 18 months right from the ceo of the bank saying yeah this is a complete fraud i don't remember the exact wording oh i remember i remember all of that you know jamie dimon said this and crypto twitter went absolutely berserk on these comments but yes yeah but i guess his his main comment was uh i think he had two comments one he said like you know or three comments that is like the biggest bubble of all time you know it's fraud and and his third comment which which i appreciate the most is that he said that he will uh fire any employee that will touch crypto because he's stupid enough to basically uh invest in crypto right that was uh that was basically is the most probably interesting comment um yeah i appreciate that you know very opinionated gentlemen of course but but the reality is right that the bank sort of uh publicly changed his stance in you know very quickly within almost 12 months um but probably the most the the the crazy story which i think is sort of uh maybe not very obvious to people from the outside is that think about a situation where basically your employees are penalized for uh touching this asset working with technology right and then the everybody wake up one morning and and basically they're telling like okay now we need to go and execute against something that we basically have zero internal knowledge right no one in the bank have ever done a single bitcoin or a crypto transaction now let's go and offer it to our you know tens of millions of clients right and um that's like a very difficult situation where uh you're basically trying to go from you know 0 to 60 very quickly but you never took any driving lists right um so so i think that a lot of those institute now when i say fomo what i basically it's sort of reflecting the situation because if you think about how this should have happened if it was well planned they had you know 10 years right to basically investigate educate themselves you know do you know test testing and just accumulate the knowledge the same way that i and you guys did right uh but they are being they've been cut off guard and and the fact that they sing some of the biggest you know uh biggest uh fintechs right moving so quickly into the space sort of forces them to react quickly in a way that is really unplanned and i think that actually offers a great explanation as to why fireblocks has raised such a large amount of money to with such a strong valuation is because when institutions fomo and when they realize that they are behind the curve with regards to infrastructure development they realize that they need to outsource some of this and then they turn to fire blocks and so that brings me to i think what we should really get into next michael which is exactly what is fire blocks and why do why would an institution choose to leverage fire blocks rather than going and building out all of these same things in-house and doing it themselves and while you give that answer i'd like to ask the listener to put this into the context of the protocol sync thesis which if you're not familiar with you should definitely go and do your homework on the protocol sync thesis because i think that's going to be a theme of what fireblocks is and what it's doing throughout the show but uh michael question to you what actually is fire blocks and what is the products and service that you guys have to offer yeah so we basically make um those crypto make making the ability of businesses to um to offer uh making making the ability for businesses to basically offer services in crypto easy what does it mean the first thing that means that we basically provided them a secure access to uh to storing uh those assets and so essentially a water technology that is secure and design for institutional usage right so hot storage cold storage worm storage all that is being basically packaged the technology they can consume and install and use right with all the complexities regulations policies and workflows that they need the second capability is around the ability to transfer assets between themselves and between their counterparties or business partners in a secure way so i assume that like that most of the people on the show familiar with the fact that when you sending the transaction you're sending a bitcoin transaction you're sending ethereum transaction to your favorite exchange or for you to your favorite d5 protocol there is those you know depending if it's bitcoin or ethereum 15 seconds or 15 minutes of a heart attack right that you don't know if you actually put the address the right address if you made a mistake right even if you're a veteran you still get that by the way it never goes away yeah it never goes away yeah that's that's part of the extreme fun in this place so yeah so you know i mean i think that most uh most retail users and most consumers and even prosumers uh they would do a handful of transactions per day right if you are operating a brokerage uh an institutional brokerage you can end up doing hundreds of transactions like this per day right if you are um a big exchange right you we're talking about thousands right so um clearly to scale up and by the way an average transaction size in our network is around 100 000 right so if you make a mistake it's going to be a very costly mistake right um and therefore what we basically created is this concept that is called the firebox network which is essentially a directory a set of apis and plugins that basically creating um sort of like an off-chain protocol that allows you to securely transfer those deposit addresses and identify uh the destination wallet or the counterparty that you're sending this transaction to and guarantee that you know uh if you know i'm i'm i'm sending a transaction to to david this transaction will go to david by selecting him in the directory uh it's not going to go to ryan it's not going to be sent to the you know to the void right so that's basically the second capability the firebox network that is uh became you know sort of almost the de facto platform to to work with uh with digital assets and then uh the last capability that we have is around um um all the access to tokenization smart contracts and defy so it it is slightly like you know different things in our offering but it's basically all the packaging around secure access to um yeah what we will call the centralized fund finance so you just said uh three things there michael one is wallet custody storage right the second is a network to route transactions and the third is access to what we call money protocols d5 protocols right and staking maybe i'll bundle in there too so those three things but i want to ask an obvious question you kind of alluded to this if you're like the person who just sent at an institution a uh you know transaction with five million dollars in it and you're not quite sure whether it's the right address or not right like you may have missed a character like oops right that is not a good feeling and obviously institutions can't do that on a daily basis but like is that like i think some people are still sort of wandering right like um why can't institutions just custody things on their own like the individuals listening to bank lists they do all this all of the time right so why is it so difficult for institutions to enter this space why do they need those those three surfaces why can't they just use you know hardware wallets and metamask and deposit in ave themselves why do they need fire blocks because of the complexity and the security level that they need right so when we started fire blocks that's what institutions were doing right they would i remember my the first time i walked into one of our bigger customers and they had a ledger nano with you know 80 million dollars worth of bitcoin on it and they were doing you know 50 transactions per day probably and the way that it was controlled is that one guy had the ledger nano the other guy had half of the passcode and the third guy had the the the pin code and the the third guy had the other half of the pin code right and every time that they wanted to do a transaction um they basically had to come all of them together and and you know collaborate and sort of check do all the check and checks and balances right to basically guarantee that they're sending the right amount they're they're putting all the protocols in place and those protocols can be um the pro those protocols can include first and foremost are we sending it to the right recipient right but have we they have compliance obligations right so they need to take that deposit address scan that deposit address in something like chain analysis or elliptic right to guarantee that it's not a bad actor right because they do need to operate within um um you know the applicable law right depending on the on the jurisdiction right and and for sanctions and things like that right uh they might have all kind of a procedures that they guarantee to the regulator that a transaction above 100 000 is going to be uh reviewed and approved by their accounting team right and you know and last but not least i mean let's assume the scenario that i just explained you can have maybe like three people that uh is involved in that process but what happened happens if you need to have five people or 10 people or 20 people right that are involved and maybe like you know those they're working in shifts right so um the complexity that is required to really do it in a robust way with high availability uh with all the policies and procedures that those that those entities need to comply is well beyond uh what something like a hardware wallet can provide right and and this is basically where firebox excels right that you on top of those basic offerings you have a policy and workflow engine where as a customer you can essentially codify all those workflows and all those approval processes at the fundamental level of the wallet it's actually enforced cryptographically through this technology it's called mpc multibody party computation right so you actually don't have a situation that you're relying on one single device to hold your private key the private key is distributed uh in you know among a set of servers and endpoints and mobile devices and even if one device fails lost or actually like you know a quorum of even even under a situation where a quorum of those devices fail fails or or being lost you can still recover right so all those functionalities are you know fairly complicated and it takes time to build right it requires pretty significant expertise both uh from cyber security domain domain id cloud mobile and so on and most institutions they just don't have that skill set and even if they have that skill set it takes several years to basically build a product with all the functionalities that we have and you know they are required that they need right to actually to operate michael i just want to rewind the clock for the listener here back to like 2017-2018 there was this mantra when the when the bull market the crypto bull market was getting a little long in the tooth but it was still rising everyone was euphoric everyone was excited and this is this mantra that people kept repeating the institutions are coming right that was supposed to be the next wave of crypto adoption to send prices even higher and higher um but like i i remember at the time what you were saying about um like large crypto funds storing uh funds on hardware wallets like that's that was how everyone was doing it back then in in 2017 2018 i know a story of of a crypto fund i i won't name them but like they used to talk about how they would hide their um recovery keys in a safe deposit box in a bank and they would like use glitter and glue on top of the envelopes to to create like a like a certain pattern of glue that couldn't be like repeated and tampered with and and um you know uh i guess i i guess made phony and this was kind of and you couldn't really bring the institutions into that environment because if you are a large bank or a large um you know pool of capital uh you're not going to enter that level of wild west so we needed like this layer of infrastructure in order to actually get the institutions to come first what i'm saying is 2018 2017 2018 the institutions are coming wasn't even possible for them to come that was a pipe dream we did not have the custodial infrastructure on top of this to allow the institutions to start pouring capital in and i think that's basically what you've built over the last three years with fire blocks does any of that resonate yeah i mean i think that uh um definitely that's uh the majority of the story right i think that we there was lack of infrastructure right for for that to happen at the time honestly just to reflect on 2017 2018 i think in a retrospect right there were a lot of uh probably yeah um regulatory issues right that uh even if the institution if the bigger institutions would have tried to enter the space i think the regulation was still not there for them to really you know jump fully in right but honestly those are i think the two main things that been resolved over the last three years or so which i think that i think allow a much more um you know a real interest and a real movement of institutions into the space and and honestly you know with how much i want to always say like you know the institutions are coming it's not there you know when a big with big institutions even small institutions even some of the smaller banks that we are working with it's a fairly lengthy process it takes them somewhere between you know six to nine months to basically go from inception to really signing contract and start deploying the technology and probably takes them almost 12 months to go from zero to production where they can offer offer those services right so uh we are sort of in the middle of of of that process and in the middle of that happening um so i think we're already starting to see some of those vehicles uh coming into the market we are going to see even more of them towards the end of this year and i think there will be quite a lot that we're going to see in 2022 when we talk about uh some of the 500 customers that you have like i i see a couple categories here um there are kind of like the crypto banks as we call them like the the block fives of the world um these are a bit more you know crypto native and i'm curious what they use you for um i'm there there also seems to be the second persona of like funds you know galaxy digital might be an example of that large capital pools i don't know if they're staking i don't know what they're doing but i'd be curious to hear a user story for them and then there are these these fintechs and new banks you mentioned uh one of the banks melon but also these fintechs like revolut that are using uh fire blocks for things so like walk us through what each of these groups are are using you for is it across those categories is it like you know custody and also like you know payment and trade or like when i deposit funds in something like block fi how is how is fire fire blocks potentially getting involved yeah so the the way that we segment the market right now in a very high level is that we have what we call crypto trading fields right so that can be galaxy can be uh you know block tower it can be proprietary trading hedge fund broker but essentially it's either they're basically trading their own money they're trading money of their investors or they're some kind of intermediary that is facing businesses from one side or credited investors in one's on one side and then liquidity exchanges and so on on the other side right so that's basically category number one that category is about 45 like basically 45 of our client base and then the other category is what we will call business to consumers right a business to retail that for me although maybe a year ago there was a clear distinction between someone like block fight celsius and you know voyager to someone like revolut but i think that over the last 12 months [Music] those categories they become more or less the same type of entity right because you know for revolut which is the biggest it's the biggest neobank in europe and you know for for for the listeners that are not familiar with rebel they sort of build a name for themselves for offering uh a credit card and and an app through which you can if you're traveling through europe you basically have very low interchange between um uh you know different currencies right so they they came with a very interesting offering you you know captured a very large customer base in europe and then sort of expanded to offering a regular banking services right and then they basically went into offering crypto uh you know buy sell and you know recently also withdrawals and they have a pretty interesting roadmap over there and then you know when you look at blockfire and celsius they basically almost start from the other side of that uh of that spectrum and they basically said oh you already like a very sophisticated user you already have crypto deposit with us we will basically generate yield on that but then they basically went downstream right they basically said okay maybe you're not that sophisticated you can uh you know buy through us or sell through us and by the way you know if you have crypto why won't you also use our credit card right so they almost went down towards what revolut started with right and yeah i totally agree with that like case and point block fight just rolled out a credit card right they started purely crypto now they have a visa card right so so i think that at the end of the day broadly speaking those are uh you know in the long run that there will be fintechs neobanks however we want to call them right but basically world providers that will have maybe start from crypto and then diversify into fiat or start with fiat and diversify to crypto but eventually i guess there is a hybrid world that all of them are trying to compete to be your main finance app and allow you to do whatever you want and i think that hopefully as we all believe here over time there will be this like more and more shift into things that are digital assets so there is a question of like if you want to basically pay uh or or send a transaction that is cross-border why would you even use a credit card why would you just use a stable card right so um so that's i think like you know just the holistic vision for all of them um in terms of just you know to your question around where firebox plays in that flow right um so for all of those offerings as a retail client you're basically facing a custodial service uh that is operated by um you know by the company by the app that you're using right it's uh it's not that you have your keys on you know on your on your device right you're basically sending your assets to a wallet that is operated by whether it's block file or celsius or someone else right and what happens behind the scene is that firefox is the technology provider that powers those wallets right so your payment the deposit address that you see is basically a deposit address that is generated by from of a firebox technology wallet um the funds will be deposited over there um each one of those entities has a different way of doing treasury management right so especially if we are looking into sort of those yield accounts right they need to basically take your bitcoin and do something with it right to execute some kind of strategy that in if you basically post one bitcoin in a year from now you will be able to receive you know one bitcoin point zero five right like you know five percent interest or whatever they they're currently promising and you know usually there are a couple of strategies right to to generate uh yield right one strategy which i would say is one of the most popular strategies essentially to lend it to high grade borrowers most of those borrowers are probably uh very sophisticated hedge funds or crypto funds right that um they they borrow this crypto to um too short you know in some cases too short in some cases they have other strategies right but basically they would borrow borrow this crypto to execute their trading strategies um another option is to basically service as a gateway into d5 right so you're depositing it with a c5 provider but the cifi provider will take advantage of the fact that they have they can basically face something like compound or rv and they will generate yield through compound or ravi and then the third one is that they might have some kind of prop trading or proprietary trading strategies by themselves and they will allocate to that portfolio right so in general all of those activities that i just described um you know from a settlement standpoint i mean they all require movement of the asset right whether you're forwarding that asset to someone else that is boring from you whether you're trading it now on some kind of centralized exchange or whether you're basically depositing it into some kind of defect protocol and basically the institutional desks in those entities that are responsible of executing those strategies and usually there isn't like one strategy that those entities will go after they will try to diversify to minimize the risk of some kind of you know specific market event they would use firebox right for the management the treasury the movement of the asset when you say treasury do you mean custody is like is that what you mean well when i say treasury i basically mean how do you [Applause] how do you move the how do you move the asset between like treasury operation how do you move the assets between uh or settle the assets between different venues like a very simple uh treasury operation might be that you know i'm using cold storage within coinbase like coinbase custody it's like their institutional offering i'm using them as my code storage provider uh but i also trading on four different exchanges right so i need to pull funds out of coinbase and now i need to basically deploy that crypto on you know bitstam kraken ftx right i need to do all this movement maybe now i have too much crypto ftx i need to go and move that crypto to to beats them so all those movements this is what i call treasury got it so it's not in those cases when you say treasury it's not that you're always providing custody uh for those assets though in some cases it sounds like you can and you do but when you say treasury operations you're talking about kind of the movement of those assets you know wherever it needs to go wherever they need to go yeah so we we do provide a lot of the custody for those assets and it really depends uh on a client some clients would use us for 100 of the custody some clients will use us for a portion of the custody most clients would use us for a certain percentage of custody in the funds um but we also we are sort of not uh religious or fundamentally obsessed about it all the custard is supposed to be with fireblocks in fact we do believe that it's a good thing that you have it diversified across you know multiple high uh you know high grade repeatable providers just you know in terms of risk concentrations and things like that that kind of brings me to how you see yourselves michael so i i think you uh i understand your background is like uh cyber security right and so you probably started this with like a cyber security mindset right like okay how do we keep these crypto assets safe and like there are these hacks and there's mount gawks there's all of these things that bad things that can happen to your private keys right and lots of incentives for people to steal them but now it seems like you're something else there's some kind of a fin deck maybe even like a bank i i said in the intro in aws for crypto uh banking basically and that seems to me to be a good definition how do you think of yourselves that's actually a good summary of the of the journey right so when we when we started our thesis was that um it's a cyber security play for finance so just as an addict though right i i really i've been in the cyber security space for about 20 years right before starting fire blocks uh both in you know very technical roles and eventually in you know commercial roles you know sold my previous company to the one of the biggest vendors in the cyber security space and then was running basically their innovation products which was their mobile and cloud and when you're in the cyber security space there is actually a very interesting uh uh again an interesting number right that 40 of the cyber security revenue is actually coming from the financial vehicle okay so what you basically understand when you i had no idea by the way yeah and that is in a pre like that is in a pre-private key world no that's just that's like uh selling firewalls to jp morgan okay yeah we're not dealing with bearer assets in this instance no i think i think there is also like a lot of by the way misconception around in the crypto space or the crypto space is being accused for this sort of uh extreme um fragility around bare assets and the fact that you can lose those assets i think people just don't realize the amount of assets death hacking that is actually happening in the traditional space right yeah and by the way like for anyone on this call every time that you hear that people accusing crypto at being uh the main driver for ransomware right you know google uh google fbi um business email compromise and what you would discover that the amount of fraud and the amount of extortion that is happening on traditional rails with us dollar across swift and and and ach is tenfold then everything that is happening if not more than what's happening with ransomware because the number for just a very stupid way of doing extortion and and and phishing which is called business email compromises basically someone hacks my account at the ceo and then sends an email to my cfo tells her we forgot to pay to this vendor in china 40 million dollars we need to do it today otherwise they would stop our supply chain and and the cfo actually like you know goes into the bank accounts and and wires that money through china that's like a three billion dollars per year fraud wow okay i had no idea yeah so and that's an fbi number right so if you if you google it you actually land on on a on a website of the fbi and that's the the number that they publish and you know they have all those um sort of recommendations of how you're supposed to avoid okay and nobody no one accuses the banks that basically they are the main driver for uh or they don't excuses accuses swift or ach that they're the main driver behind a three billion dollar uh loss per year for the u.s industry so um so so maybe like to go back to to to my point is that what you do realize is that the financial uh what i've realized right is that one the financial industry is at the end of the day probably the most interesting industry to start building to build like some kind of a cyber security plan right and it was also very clear for for for me at that point in time that uh when we look at blockchains it's a transformative technology right that uh you know assuming that everything plays out right that all those banks well either they will disappear right or they will have to re-platform into this technology so it's not going to happen in five years right but you know over the long horizon it will help and and what we initially said to do is to basically build a security solution in some ways you can think about it like an antivirus or a firewall right for crypto right um where very quickly we find ourselves well you know i personally find myself in probably the most intense crash course around finance uh that you know i had to understand what is an option what is derivative you know what is settlement how clearing houses work and how um the entire plumbing is of both the traditional world and the new world is basically structured and to basically realize that we are actually not a cyber security company we are a fintech infrastructure company that you know maybe in some ways you can you can think about us as the aws of this space or you can think about us as the shopify of this space but it is a fintech infrastructure company by all means and you know that's what we are and and and i think it also required us to think very differently around our business what are the risks what are the regulation we need compliance people we need things that you know as a cyber security or just like an enterprise software business you simply don't have those people in the company but if you're a fintech company okay this is sort of the bread and butter and the cost of running the business and michael i actually think that that is the most interesting part about this conversation where like if if fire blocks was a legacy just you know security company maybe it's one of his customers would have been like goldman sachs and you would have just prevented fraud from goldman sachs but now one of your customers is ethereum or or one of your customers is defy right and you are connecting you know ethereum to other customers right where uh and so that is the new infrastructure the new security that you are providing and that fundamentally changes the nature of your business as you just said and so they talk about that evolution from just going from a software security company to realizing you are now actually dabbling in the world of financial services and kind of to what ryan said starts to make fire blocks kind of feel like a new bank right like a kind of a place to deposit your assets would you would you agree with that taken talk about just the evolution of fire blocks from going from a from a security providing company to more of a fintech company yeah so i don't think we don't view ourselves honestly as a new bank we do view ourselves as maybe the you know if you want to take the parlor to the bank right then in the most traditional way to think about it maybe we are the uh company that sells the saves that are being installed right in the bank that's our prince security yeah yeah and area is the bank right yeah yeah and bricks right and there is and i think that there is also a fundamental question that i always mentioned to people i think you know at least for the more traditional financial folks it just like blows their mind right but what is really custody right in the space because at the end of the day the blockchain is the custody right the the the real sort of custody solution is actually not fire blocks uh it's not uh block fi it's not bank of your ml right the real custody is bitcoin right the real custody is here right because the ledger like of who owns what right and the gatekeepers to to your account is eventually the blockchain and the miners right um what we are doing and the banks and and is basically the access control here right we are the one that are basically helping you to secure identity helping you to basically secure your password right if if maybe like you know we're trying to maybe put the analogy in place if in the traditional space citibank is your bank in your custodian and you know you have uh one password on your computer which is basically your login into your account to transfer the money right you know fireblocks and all the people that are doing wallets is you know the one pass right that that helps you to to securely control the password now it's clearly like you know to do it in an institutional way it's very different but um that's basically i guess uh one way to look at it i think another way to look at it is really okay we are the financial infrastructure uh that uh is more related to maybe at at the most basic layer it's like brings on the folks that put the safe into the bank but more broadly today it's almost like a core banking system right so for people that are are unfamiliar with how banks are run in practice right um there are sort of a dozen companies worldwide like uh you know pfizer finestra and [Applause] and so on that those companies basically developed all the um you know databases and all the software that the banks are running on right the the bank itself is basically a regulatory license a bunch of people you know a customized ui but on the back end there there is basically a technology that is usually not like the bigger banks but it's like you know the mid-size banks it's usually off-the-shelf software that is essentially running all that it has a bunch of plugins for your credit cards for your for for the compliance for for wiring money and so on for lending and borrowing and fire blocks is sort of the equivalent of that for digital assets right your business you have the license or you don't need the license so now you want to to do that you consumer software and you know we make it very easy for you and very robust for you to write it's funny because this is all a a new paradigm you know like when people are new to crypto they'll get a a hardware device like a ledger or something right and they'll be like oh my tokens are on this usb stick and it's like no they're they're actually not they're still on ethereum right what you have on that usb stick is private keys to go unlock a vault on ethereum that's why when you're saying like uh fire blocks is like brinks it's almost like lastpass because you are doing that the private key management for unlocking the vaults that are on ethereum or or bitcoin or or pick your other blockchain right but the actual storage of the assets as weird as this is happens on the chains themselves right that's where the assets always are it's a new it's a different mental model that i think people need to wrap their heads around and it's new for crypto it's very it's very difficult for people to it is it's weird a little weird at first let's talk about something else that's weird and that is this defy thing it's kind of weird kind of strange for people and i think um i've heard you say before michael some of your past conversation interviews that you're you're a d5 bull and it seems like you guys have oriented your products that way too can you tell us why why are you bullish on defy um in one step sentence because or maybe if it's like in one word because that's the assets right i mean at the end of the day um right there is bitcoin and bitcoin has some specific property around a reserve right a reserve asset but everything else the reason why we're doing it is because we are able to create those tokens that represent some kind of asset right i mean it can be uh you know stable coin it can be nft it can be uh a kitty right a digital key uh on on the blockchain it can be a real estate asset by the way i mean funny enough i think people don't don't really remember but the nft standard was actually i think originally was invented because people wanted to tokenize fractional real estate right and and and then what we're actually able to do is to build this unbelievable machinery that are the defy apps right that replicate what traditional financial institution had to do in a centralized way with huge amount of counterparty risk with human procedures and human oversight and human errors right and we are able to execute those things in an autonomous way without with governance right uh and with autonomous governance and and basically allow interactions from between two people over the internet from you know two sides of the world uh without having with having zero trust both between them but also like you know there is no um intermediary that they both need to trust that might default the fraud or make a mistake which will impact both of them let me ask you this though like you're from cyber security michael like it's not a little bit terrifying defy terrifying like one hack one air in the code 250 million dollars gone you know parity wallet hack gone yeah yeah i mean i am okay but uh i think that it's a maturity right there's sort of like a maturity curve that's happening over there i mean i'll give maybe like a very different example you know i a year ago i bought a tesla and most of the time i drive on autopilot right and it works like you know i was like i i i drive at 60 miles per hour you know on autopilot and i sort of trust the the vehicle to be able to perform something that probably three years ago or even five years ago would be terrifying right and and it's not like you know there aren't examples of bad things that happen right um and you know you you you talk with people that were uh using autopilot uh you know three four years ago they tell you about those like you know crazy clunky experiences that it would just like stop in the middle of the highway and it was just a complete disaster right but over three years basically tesla was able to bring it into something that look you know i can try for two hours without essentially you know trying to interfere with with with the driving right so i think you know that the unfortunate reality is that there will be a lot of money will be made a lot of money will be lost by the time that will get the point where uh we see full maturity right of d5 but with that being said you know you look at the main on the massive protocols that we have compound aves uh uni swap right i think that you know knock on wood right with those protocols we're already approaching a point where the technology risk is substantially low that will allow people to deploy it without huge amount of concern right um and i think that the real point of that really happening is that when those protocols will be insurable right and there is also a question of what would be the mechanism to insure those protocols because it might also be the work the case that they will be not being sure by uh you know aig or municre they will be insured by also again some kind of a decentralized finance-based insurance capability but you know i i think that with the with the bigger protocols we are slowly getting there um but but it takes time right but i think that if if three years ago uh it was you know somewhat delusional right i think we are the point where you know we are launching um we're launching with i mean together with compound we launched compound treasury and you know we're working with ave arc on things that for people that understand the technology risk they are willing to go in with massive amount of capital and use those protocols michael earlier in the show you talked about how a lot of your clients will migrate funds across different exchanges uh i would suspect that that's a decent amount of just people just taking arbitrage opportunities across c5 exchanges but what about people's activity what about your clients defy activities can you kind of compare and contrast the amount of activity that your clients use in a cfi world and then also how much activity is it in a default world how do those things compare and then when they are using the d5 things that that fire blocks is hooked into what is the frequent activities that you see your clients doing yeah so let's start with some again numbers right um right now we have about i would say 80 clients that use our d5 plugins right out of let's say 500 clients so let's say like you know 450 live clients right um so we are approaching right the almost like you know the 25 i guess right um of clients and you know we see i think on a daily basis more and more clients basically asking us to activate those those plugins for them right so there is uh like a daily progression into into into that and just to be to sort of the the time frame we basically launched our d5 beyond what we had with compound which we launched over a year and a half ago the main uh capabilities we launched at the beginning of this year right basically around january right so in six months we basically managed to almost activate one quarter of our client base to to work with d5 or they activated himself that surprises me by the way 25 is a lot higher than i thought yeah i mean also for me i think that we didn't expect that there will be such a huge uptake um i mean i think that as of right now there is still uh a lot of you know we see a lot of crazy things that are still you know happening um so i think a lot of people are still experi experimenting with you know liquidity mining and and they uh they um every day they are trying basically new protocols and you know it's not only ethereum we we see people doing it on on on on on binance smart chain which we support also we're seeing them doing that on polygon and matic and those protocols right so you basically see some kind of like you know all over place activity uh and and and i think a lot of that is somewhat of experimentation we do have quite a few clients that they have very clear strategies right in terms of how they work with defy how they work with for example um you know for for example something which i always found a very interesting example is stable coin arbitrage opportunities right so basically you have this temporary arbitrage between synthetic stable coins right and and and the asset-backed stable cards like usdc right and you have different uh yield curves between them and and there is an arbitrary so there are there are people that are essentially matching that arbitrage and i guess the fascinating thing about that right is that first and foremost it's a strategy that is not like a a crypto native strategy it's basically a strategy that is taking from effects where you know people will basically do um you know foreign exchange currency arbitrage and the second aspect of it is that because of what those people are doing they're essentially stabilizing right the uh the the value of the synthetic stable coins right because they essentially the activity they're doing is is continuous sort of like you know bringing them closer to the actual dollar right um and yeah and and that's you know it's not the vast majority of what people are currently doing but that's maybe just a very interesting example of uh of things that i've seen people doing there's also maybe another example with that that is just our personal example of how we use defy internally right so about 30 of our clients instead of paying us with wire ach or credit card they pass with stablecoin and in general in the very beginning we basically told people only to send us usdc um and over time we basically started to allow people to pass with both packs and usdt now the main issue that we have is that we don't eventually we do need to at some point we do need to off-ramp those uh tokens to fiat right for accounting reasons but what are we doing in the meantime right the first thing that we do is we do use when someone for example pays us with usdt we use either uni swap or curve right to immediately swap it to to usdc with a very fairly minimal slippage right the second thing that we do is that we do use compound and avid to basically generate a much higher interest rate on those deposits then any bank can offer now for you know the money that we raised from the vcs that is currently sitting in the bank and you know in a good day we're basically getting you know 25 bips right so um and that just this is just sort of a really interesting example where i think when i think about the real value of that that's for me it's it's a mystery how come there isn't sort of a huge amount of businesses trying to do exactly that yeah i totally agree i love by the way that you are dog fooding your own tools to go bankless and like dog fooding these these crypto protocols basically and like what we found too is like while we can't completely severitize with the traditional banks of the world right the the defy ecosystem is just better right like lower wire uh transfer fees higher interest rates like just immediate uh transfers like it's just a better financial system so like you know good on you guys for uh leading the way and actually using the tools that you're building yeah i mean we start we the first time we've done it was actually when we had a client that wanted to pass 30 000 with a credit card and our option was to basically take it on stripe and then to pay one thousand dollars to strive as a commission right three percent yeah yeah and that's all like okay so so the stable card i was that was you know a year and a half ago when the gas prices were low right so it cost us maybe 30 cents on the gas right but yeah instead of 1 000 and 40 48 hours to get in our bank account it was 15 seconds and you know 25 cents right so it's not uh 10 times better it's like 10 000 times better right yeah michael earlier you talked about how uh firebox is both the service provider for compound treasury and ave arc the respective like institutional versions of those two major d5 protocols and before this conversation i kind of thought that compound treasury and ave arc would be doing their own kyc in order to do their own onboarding for institutions but it sounds like they are outsourcing that to fire blocks and allowing you guys to do that that lift of the journey for institutions to start to start to use these defy apps which brings me to my question is when you do the a is that true and b when you do the onboarding for an institution so they can start to use compound treasury by definition does that also make that same institution ready to be using ave arc is that how it works so what we do with avi is different than what we do with compound and it's and i think that the way that i look right now on the institution of defy is that we are currently in the ex sort of experimental phase around the compliance issues over there right and that's why i think we are taking different approaches with each right for for compound we actually for compound treasury we actually not the uh the um we are not the uh kyc provider uh because of the way that they basically structured their uh um their offering okay um and and what what is basically being done over there is that we do have an entity uh that [Applause] is not our main entity it's it's a it's a subsidiary that has specific licenses that help them to do what they need to do and clearly there is a technology that is used by them to do it in a secure way uh which guarantees the both their you know on ramping the funds deploying them into the protocol and so on uh with with other the situation is actually somewhat different with ave what we are really experimenting is around creating um what i would call as an institutional pulse right where they're sort of gated right and they're gated by kyc and it's true that at least in the experimental phase of this fire blocks is the uh fire blocks of the firebox network essentially is sort of the kyc gate right uh because we uh the advantage that we have is first of all because of uh some specific capabilities that are related to that uh entity we do have um uh and the machinery and the technology to basically property kyc clients or institutional clients which is not not a trivial task and the second thing is that we know or we are able to basically enforce um a linkage between your identity and your wallet right uh that that is related to both the technology it is actually related to mpc and uh and therefore uh when we allow you to enter through that gate um because there is a white listing over your wallet we can guarantee that this is your wallet right we can guarantee that this is your wallet we can guarantee that the assets that are flowing through that wallets the path that they belong to you um you know if you take if you took assets from uh a bad actor and you're trying to throw them into the pool because we have a partial control over that while through mpc we can at least block you from doing that right so uh the technology there's a there is a more interesting sort of combination of a mixture of technologies which basically allows us to operate those gates michael i i'm curious like if you were to summarize this for us when you're talking about those d5 plug-ins that your clients have access to right um this could be the institution say that wants to just invest and get a higher yield look for compound right so you've got like funding and borrowing what other protocols do you have too just high level do you have like trading if i'm an institution can i click the uh the unit swap plug-in or the sushi swap plug-in and start trading these long tail assets and how about staking can i just like switch something on and suddenly start staking yeah so um first and foremost initially we started with building the experience into the product itself as a very intuitive experience where we actually have it still this compound where you have an asset that you see in the wallet you can click on it and one click you basically it's being deposited into compound right but what we discovered very quickly is that there is this sort of like huge long tail right of applications that everybody want to access into some of it is because you know the really you really use case and some of it is just basically chasing after some kind of uh temporary yield right that exists over there so we had to generalize and the way that we generalize it is by essentially creating three main approaches the first approach which is sort of the easiest to understand is api so there is an api if you want to interact with any smart contract you have what we call the firebox d5 api you basically can invoke a function that function is a function of a smart contract and that is has policies that are being checked and so on the second is a browser extension so very similar to metamask but instead of basically using a wallet that sits in your browser or a hardware wallet it's actually links into the secure wallet platform of firebox the firebox fault and the third which is my personal personal my personal most favorite plugin is for wallet connect right so you go to a website you basically click you go to compound or you go to one inch right and you basically click connect my wallet you click wallet connect and then you're basically taking your phone there is the firebox app you scan it and behind the scene it basically creates a bridge into your vault and then you can basically interact through that through the wallet connect bridge so those are the three uh capabilities that we have as it relates to defy and um because of the generic capability there yes you know you can use compound you can use ave but you can use uniswap sushi swap you know dydx you know anything you can use anything on d5 yeah uh interaction point yeah anything that has basically metamask or what connect you can yes so what do you think of this idea of institutional defy so we're seeing it start to play out with ave start to play out with with compound is this going to be a thing so you said you had 25 of your customer base start on d5 i'm guessing that's just all happened within the last year or so like like a d5 summer and post d5 summer phenomenon but like what's it going to take to get institutions really comfortable with defy is uh is institutional defy going to become a thing yeah so so i think it's it's it's important to clarify right that the 25 that are using it right now they're using just the regular protocols right they're using they're using those uh three extensions api wallets connect uh web browser extension and they're accessing the same pools as anyone else the same poses the retail right there is nothing unique about the specific protocol that they're accessing so i guess that's one that's one version of institutional default which is just like institutions now have a managed way to get access to all of the other d5 protocols that we have i guess yeah they have they have a convenient highly secure uh way with in internal guardrails that allows them to do right the next phase of it is to solve the compliance or the regulatory issue right and i don't know uh [Music] what is the percentage of the 75 percent that are not in the fire right now from our customers that the reason why they are not in defy is because of the compliance regulatory issue but at least from the subscription that i'm seeing into testing some of those newer initiatives right like the compound treasury and the avi arc it it is like you know 10 20 at the very least right that are interested in in that type of product there is an overlap by the way between the one that are using it right now and the people that want to be part of that offering as well but definitely there are unique names over there that are not in the file because they don't have because from a regulatory standpoint they are uncomfortable with participating in a pool where there is uncertainty around where is the other crypto that is in that poll is coming from right and that's just basically i guess some kind of a regulatory limbo situation and i guess like you know i don't need to basically i mean we can but i'm not sure that i need to give like a 30 minutes uh overview of uh all the different uh approaches that you know from fat after vincent to you know uh all the other regulators everything that they're trying to and you know the crypto bill in the united states but i think that that that entire um um the regulatory environment around defy is unclear and is in flux right so their only way to deal with it is basically to say okay what are the most extreme procedures that i can take to still benefit from it and that means that i'm going to only access basically a subset of the protocol that is gated and it's guaranteed that i'm basically entering into this game with uh people that are in the same compliance level as i am hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with michael thus far in the second half of the show we bring up the conversation of regulation and how michael and firebox has had to traverse the changing regulatory landscape as well as how are they positioning themselves for future unknown regulatory headwinds ryan asked michael the question what happens if firebox is too successful is that a risk vector for ethereum can they suck in too much money and become too much of a centralized risk for the rest of the ecosystem i thought his answer michael's answer to that was particularly fascinating all that and more is coming in the second half of the show so don't go anywhere but first before we get there we need to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless let's let's touch on regulatory for for a minute it's like difficult to speculate what's going to happen next but but i'm curious how uh regulatory issues have impacted your business what you really think about like what keeps you up at night with respect to regulation i think we've seen in the past couple of years definitely some tailwinds right for crypto like you know good you know regulatory initiatives occ said um banks can hold crypto for example i imagine that was impactful that was a great thing we also have seen some some headwinds right there's the gary gensler speech that just came out as we're recording this this week there's like comments like shadowy crypto coder coders in uh in the in the senate there's also if you if you look toward the east um central bank digital currency in china what they're doing to like get crypto miners out of uh out of china well like what's your take what what do you think about where we are with respect to regulation now and what kind of worries you keeps you up at night um i wouldn't say that i'm not worried right but i do think that um on the long run certain type of regulation is both necessary and good right um the the main concerns that i have is that you know when you have you know hammer every problem looks like a nail right and that's and and and and that's the situation right now that the regulators they have frameworks that were created whatever like in the 40s in the 1940s in the 1970s in the 1990s right but those frameworks are one can argue if they are useful or not useful for for a specific type of ecosystem signal or finance i mean for everyone who spent enough time with the technology he understands that the uh and i think like you know there's a different slight difference between the scc sort of view on things that they're coming in and they're basically saying look you know let's make sure that people are not being defrauded right through illegitimate icos to um trying to enforce um you know travel rule and compliance and bsa aml through tactics that just technologically do not comply right because at the end of the day let's take like you know the the most extreme proposals over there which basically we're trying to force kyc on hosted unhosted like you know take a uh take defy developers to hold the five developers as accountable right for what they are building i think anyone who understands technologies you know enough understands that hey you know it's just going to hurt the people that are doing the legitimate things and the people that are want to use this technology in an illegitimate way right the cyber criminals the you know just the regular criminals or whatever they can bypass all those things at the click of a button right there is nothing that holds you from you know taking a paper wallet right i mean let's take like you know uh the the latest one of the latest proposals right that were put in front of the senate that they basically said oh by the way uh you know unhosted wallets need to report on tax well guess what i can print the qr code on this piece of paper and it becomes an unhosted what so now this piece of paper is responsible for reporting tax right so so like people basically i think don't understand the extent of the technology and then what they're basically doing there they're they're preventing the good usage and but they're not really blocking the bad usage of the technology so i think and that's like you know what honestly uh worries me um i think that or from everything that i've seen also in other domains in my experience and i've seen i think similar situation in the past you know just to give a maybe an interesting example from their privacy space right maybe some of the uh listeners remember the famous case of the fbi against apple right that yeah they're basically telling out we're telling apple hey you know we don't care unlock this iphone and apple was like no well we're not going to unlock this iphone because we don't have the keys and two we are not going to introduce the backdoor because that goes against the will of our consumers and if you want like you know go past the law which will force us to do it which clearly would not something that will fly in a modern democracy right so i think that uh you know we will eventually face a similar situation where the technology will prevail and and and eventually it will we will have tools that are self-regulated there are quite a few exciting companies that i've seen recently that are coming to basically deploy identity deploy compliance into defy and to do things you know i don't know if like solve the problem 100 but it's definitely going towards the right direction rather than trying to essentially um you know come with this hammer and basically say well you know everybody need to report every suspicious transaction you need to kyc everyone and and and and and and send stars everything is suspicious like yeah that will not work right uh so that's just like you know my personal view michael is there anything about regulation that has impacted the trajectory of your business over at fire blocks is there anything that you wanted to do but your lawyer said no due to regulation that you also think is silly and should be changed um i mean okay i think actually for us regulation was somewhat favorable around the occ and a lot of the things that happened last year right which basically mobilized uh what is a very important segment of the market for us right so i'll give them that um you know there were things that we worked hard recently to put in place uh for example we block offic uh transactions right in the world so there were things that we had to do or comply with um you know there were customers that we didn't agree to service them because we thought it was uh too too high of a risk right so there are things that i believe that whether it's regulation or just like our own reasonable judgment that prevents us to to do that and beyond everything else there is uh i think beyond the regulation there is just like you know pure reputational risk right so eventually when you play the game that we play uh you the reputation is important and i think you need to basically uh be thoughtful in terms of how certain things will be perceived by by your customers or by your prospects michael this has been a really interesting like thanks for watching us through this we have just a few more things that we want to cover with you as we close here but i you know i want to talk maybe about a worry that listeners might have and it's it's a worry in the back of my mind too right so this uh this podcast is called bank list this entire movement is called bankless right this is a movement to restore self-sovereignty to to the individual right peer-to-peer type transactions my worry is not that you guys won't be successful but my worry is that you'll be too successful so picture a world where fire blocks or someone else like fire blocks has all of the world's crypto assets they're all institutional they're they're uh all custodied uh they're not fully bankless and then and then what happens what if you guys get acquired by jamie dimon at jpmorgan or worse wells fargo right david wells fargo could be that acquiring company then we're back to the same spot well then then they were just open accounts right for people that don't exist that's right well so like so can you allay these fears right so there is there is this important thing that we are trying to build which is a new financial system that is not a financial system full of the same banks we just left like hey here's here's the new boss name is the old boss um is what you're doing as important as it is right now as a bridge to institutions and define crypto does it also have a trade-off here uh could we be centralizing the the system in this way what are your thoughts yeah so honestly uh it's a very important concern and something that actually philosophically we think a lot about right uh and you know in other politics you will hear me saying that one of the reasons that firebox works the way fireworks works and not the way that for example coinbase custody works is that at least in our case the institution that we serve is in direct custody right so firebox like firebox as a company right we don't have access to to the keys or to the sufficient amount of key material to really operate on behalf of our class clients so first and foremost i do believe at the very least in the institutional idea around not your you know not your keys not your bitcoin right so basically each one of our individual customers is bitcoin right not our case um on the long run i do think that what we are seeing over here and maybe i'm just like sort of shooting myself a bit in the foot right is that we we we we actually looking into um a temporary situation right and i i think that like that the thesis that we have is that eventually the reason that it's now important to work with the banks and it's important to work with jimmy diamond it works important to work work with wells fargo is to bring it to the masses right i think that once we will bring it to the masses right and my you know grandma will have access to bitcoin this is where we will actually be able to unlock self-custody you know wallets that are completely non-custodial and people will like you know will start to see an outflow right from those institutions and then you can ask yourself okay so you know then you guys fireblocks are are doomed right because basically what what's happening right now is that you essentially uh you know selling a service that that eventually will disintermediate your own clients so the way that i think about it is that look in eventually like you know financial institution and not financial institutions at the end of the day we have businesses right and those businesses need to run and they need to do their own finance and i'm actually looking forward for the world where my clients are not necessarily only wells fargo or jp morgan but my clients are airbnb and you know uber and booking.com and spotify and all those guys that are internet companies that honestly for them probably this technology means more than i mean except for the retail you know if we think about uh you know unbanking um i think that there is unbanking for the retail but there is also unbanking for the businesses right because right now all those businesses that we value and we use their services right they're big bank right and you know sometimes they don't get the best service right sometimes they're being overcharged and the main question is how can i eventually go direct to them enable them and do and help them do what they want to do here's what we have michael so dave and i have talked about this a lot so bankless listeners would be familiar with this this is what we call the d5 mullet thesis and this is what we think is happening uh in general with fintech right now which is a whole bunch of fintech companies are about to grow out their d5 mullet right so fintech in the front defy in the back crypto rails in the back and that seems to be what's happening so your comment about like hey when i look at block fi and when i look at revolut they're actually converging on the same thing they're all like fintech companies that are hybrid crypto right so i'm curious if you could make some predictions in this area since you're so close to it right you see visa they're getting into crypto they're hiring blockchain people we see paypal what are they doing we see um you know a square jack dorsey is talking about defile these things um how is the d5 mullet going to play out in in the coming let's say one to three years do you think all of these fintechs will convert to crypto rails and how's that going to look yeah so i guess it goes to my previous comment around this is the assets right i think that um is that going to happen in the next three years well i hope right i'm not entirely sure that uh it will move that fast but i do think that for the the two things need to happen right um one is definitely sort of the access and what firebox is doing and sort of just helping them to do it in a secure and compliant way which is either paramount for for for the access or like you know for the nice hair that they have back right uh like you know someone don't come their hair and then and the and the second aspect there is that we need more assets right on d5 right or we need more instruments right because i think that one of the problems that we're seeing that i i i'm also quite concerned of right is that right now we have bitcoin we have you know a bunch of tokens that are protocol tokens that you know their values sort of derived from what that protocol utilization will be but beyond that it's not that much of a interest right we have some governance tokens that are important but again it's not um you know really meaningful and then we have stable coins right stable coins for me it's like a really uh any very important instrument i don't think that cbdc will happen that quickly and therefore stable coins are really really good uh um uh you know instrument but now we need basically like to bring more you know real world tokens into this ecosystem for the defy protocols to be effective right because you know the value of swapping uh usdc with ethereum is only a v is only valuable if you're speculating on ethereum right or you need to buy gas right but um the value of basically swapping usdc to an nft or to tokenize real estate or to you know i don't know mortgage or something that can actually represent a financial instrument is um is actually like you know very very useful and i think for for for this ecosystem not to sort of like you know just collapse into itself we need to see uh the fintechs and the fis basically starting to deploy means you know and bring more uh representable assets into the blockchain for the d5 to really become maybe like you know not only the back but also the front really cool insight i haven't heard that technique before michael it's been a pleasure to have you and you thank you for fire blocks thank you for being the hair spray in the defy mullet to tie all of these things together sir uh it's been a pleasure to have you on thank you so much guys appreciate that it was fun all right guys action items for you um one is
