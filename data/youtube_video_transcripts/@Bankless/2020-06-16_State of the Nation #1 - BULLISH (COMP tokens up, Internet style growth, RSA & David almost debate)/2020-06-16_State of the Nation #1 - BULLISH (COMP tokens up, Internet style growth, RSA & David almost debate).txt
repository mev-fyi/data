all right guys welcome to bankless this is the first time david and i are trying something new this is the state of the nation videocast we're going to be doing this every tuesday guys uh david it is great to see you on video my friend we usually i it's usually just your spoken voice but this is the first time we're doing it live video on youtube yeah this is it turns out you're a real person and not just a voice voice in my spit in my headphones um so yeah uh we've always wanted to kind of amp up our youtube content uh and and get people watching uh watching what we are also looking at while we talk uh talk about it and so this video format is going to allow us to go a little bit more in depth about some subjects share some images and also just have like a more personal conversation so i'm really excited about it yeah it's gonna be fun i mean we started doing this big picture type of stuff like the topical events that were happening in the bankless nation at the start of the youth at the start of our podcast but it became like um it was a lot right and it deserves its own dedicated air time and its own dedicated show where we can do deep dives so that's what we're going to be doing on the state of the nation webcast where we talk about what's happening we're going to talk about how that relates to the big picture in the bankless nation we're going to try to drop some insights and action items as we go and we're going to be publishing this every tuesday on youtube we'll also probably roll this into a podcast episode too so you can catch on youtube and video you can also catch it uh in the bankless podcast by subscribing it'll be kind of the second episode of the week that we release and i think it'll give us a really cool format for for doing this sort of thing yeah uh the podcasts that we were turning out were turning out to be like an hour 40 minutes long because they had like a 30 to 40 minute state of the nation and then an hour plus long interview or an hour plus long just you and me riffing on one central idea breaking these things apart i think is definitely the way um the way that they deserve to uh to be yeah all right so uh let's do it we get no breaks i mean this is uh we can't edit anything so this is going to be raw this is going to be live but why did we call it state of the nation david what like why nation uh because it is a nation uh for those that read my recent article a bankless nation the thesis is that what we are building here is a new way of organizing ourselves across the world and we as in human humanity we as in the humans we are building a new nation uh that works for all of us that has very strong correlates with the previous nations that we've known uh and not just nation states but the nations the versions of nations that have come before it like religion uh and the claim is that these digital nations bitcoin and ethereum uh are this new paradigm for organ organization how humans organize around each other uh and i also think that the reason why we're calling it the bankless nation uh is because bitcoin and ethereum are likely going to stitch themselves together into one like cohesive unit i've always kind of considered bitcoin and ethereum as like this binary star system that is rotating around each other they're brothers right like older brother and younger siblings yeah yeah the mother and the father the archetypes of of the universe right yeah like they they require each other like there's no way that that bitcoin can have a a fully sci-fi future without ethereum uh and so it needs ethereum and and bitcoin has a ton of liquidity and a ton of value which is exactly what dfi needs so these things are going to become one cohesive nation which we call the bankless nation yeah and it's bankless because that's the entire point of crypto right i mean go all the way back to 2009 satoshi's white paper where he talked about a peer-to-peer digital cash that word peer-to-peer it doesn't it's not pure to bank it's not bank to peer it's peer-to-peer it's a bankless digital cash so from the very inception the entire point of this crypto movement has been to create a bankless financial money system um bankless nation really for the world and i know in your articles david you talked a lot about the patriots and the and the uniforms of um the bankless nation i would consider both of us patriots and we're wearing our uniforms today too so um i'm gonna have to get some more of these shirts uh so that we always have them on on tuesday people want them people want them anymore yeah i know we gotta open up the storefront soon um so before we dig in david we've got to talk about uh two of our sponsors so i'm gonna talk about the first one uh maltese so multis is a bankless way to uh run your business basically doesn't require a crypto exchange doesn't require a bank account we've written articles about multis on bank lists actually uh in the next week or so we're going to be doing a video walk through live on this channel it under this behind the scenes it uses the mult the gnosis multi-safe so your funds are always secure and it creates like a banking interface on top of a smart contract system and allows you to run the entire thing without a bank so really cool sponsor great to have them we'll include a link to them where you can sign up and get some special bank list perks just check the youtube notes our other sponsor is ave you guys know all about ave it's a borrowing and lending platform but it's also much more than that uh it's a suite of services that started with borrowing and lending and it has spawned into many new things there are a tokens which are tokens that receive the supply rate of all the assets on ave and what's more is avei allows for stable interest loans this is a very crucial tool in the legacy financial world to be able to pull out a loan from somewhere without having that interest rate change under your feet and so that's what ave allows you to do it allows you to plan out your financial future far in advance because you know those interest rates aren't ever going to change uh you can check them out at aave dot com is that right dot com dot com yeah and maltese by the way is m-u-i-l-t god what is maltese check that just check the video notes i think it's a dot co though you check the video notes all right david uh what is the state of the bankless nation right now my friend the state of the bankless nation is bullish dude much is happening is that going to be your answer every week well i mean in my last week yeah the reason why it's bullish this week is because of the d5 tokens really is is defy tokens our our sponsor had a has their own token which i'm categorizing as a defy token that has gone like 300 like in the last like six months maker just jumped up by like double on its listing on coinbase uh comp just got added to uniswap and comp is the token a governance token of compound now comp unlike ave or or maker doesn't give you access to cash flows but like we all know that's coming right so it's a governance token so so like it's people are going governing over compound which has cash flows and eventually it's i'm thinking everyone else is assuming that in the future they're just going to vote in cash flows for themselves it seems inevitable that there'll be a convergence right right so uh we published something in bank list called like voting in cash flows which is basically what cop holders are incented to do if you're a holder of comp you want to turn that comp token into a higher value comp token right so what's one of the initial things that you're going to do is you're going to vote in cash flows so that you take a cut a percentage of all of the assets under management in in compound and have that accrued to the token that seems inevitable to me and it also seems to be the case like that's where we ended up with stocks right so like stocks were invented in the 1600s and the 1700s um by the dutch right and they slowly converged into what they resemble today where they are capital assets uh so they can be essentially valued based on future cash flows but they but they combine that and they also combine a governance a piece as well so they're both part of the governance and the cash flows are both part of the same thing it i definitely agree with you it feels like there's going to be convergence here too which is cool because this means it's like the birth of a new asset class i know chris branitsky wrote that paper about bitcoin back in 2015 or so um but this is a second asset class right that was sort of the bitcoin is like a money monetary asset class this is a second asset class it's a capital asset with everything all of the cash flows settled on chain so it's like completely transparent and brand new super exciting yeah absolutely and harping on that the point of voting in cash flows like if you don't think this is going to happen like the onus is on you to prove to why this isn't going to follow the same path as like as history right uh i can't remember who said it but they they said something along the lines of like uh the cryptocurrency industry is just relearning the lessons of finance that the human species has learned throughout time but in a sped up manner and now it's now it's the time for capital assets on ethereum like now is the time for tokens that represent some sort of equity in these defy applications on ethereum to start producing cash flows which some are already doing and comp our compound has been doing and now there's this governance token called comp that governs over the cash flows of compounds like it's just it's just a direct line like this is going to happen yeah totally i mean i feel like it feels like we're in the maybe the 18th or 19th century in terms of like traditional finance where we're just starting the joint um stock company right it's like brand new um we're just starting with lending but it's all uh collateral-backed so there's no notion of reputation everything has to be backed by real collateral but i think we're accelerating at a much faster pace so um it's going to be really exciting as we like reinvent this parallel bankless financial system but i want to ask you something on that we're going to get into comp in a bit more detail i think but um some people have criticized this as like ico mania 2.0 right all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna show comp market cap in a few minutes we're gonna go through it but uh it has quickly risen just in like a day of trading just yesterday started trading on uniswap 900 million dollar market cap like it's almost a silicon valley unicorn one billion dollar company this is a protocol right and it's worth 900 million dollars so people see that and they're like oh my god i'm having flashbacks to 2017 ico mania for where everything went off yeah already above mkr in market cap it is the highest highest token value on ethereum other than right right all right so people see that and they're like not again right like so like what's your take what's uh what's gonna happen here this is why i'm saying i'm bullish right when when all these tokens are accruing these insane evaluations like right off the bat and an important distinction is that compound and the and the next lowest value market cap token on ethereum mkr they totally deserve it or at least deserve something right at least in stark comparison to like the ico mania right like where the ico mania was total vapor and it was an actual bubble that just needed the smallest pinprick to pop like the there are real cash flows behind these things like mkr has real income compound has real income uh and so like you know it was easy to criticize the ico tokens of 2017 and there is a lot of parallels between the d5 tokens that have like gone up 300 percent over the last you know x number of months but the point is is that these things are real right these things are generating real cash flows uh and and i remember vitalik tweeted about this in 2017 2018 after like the market cap of all crypto hit like a trillion dollars and and then and then the bubble popped and it started to deflate he said something along the lines of like the next the next uh bull market is going to be based off of real world fundamentals like real real things that are are tangible and that's what we are seeing here yeah absolutely and as you're talking david i put this up um this is the d5 market cap which is one of my favorite it's you know better than coin market cap in some ways because it shows the actual like d5 bankless a few times all right so i'll blow that up there so you can see compound yeah market cap uh 9.45 million dollars today and there's maker as you said and you know this might not last right it's like right you know very limited liquidity just on uniswap it's entering this this price discovery phase but i absolutely think you're right this is going to be this is different than ico mania because in ico mania the tokens had no value accrual mechanism whatsoever it was kind of like like buy my token we haven't even shipped a product maybe we'll ship a product maybe if you buy my token right and like you know how is the how is the token value the answer is like fat protocol thesis bro it doesn't matter it's just going to work itself out right um and this time around we might see some crazy value like valuations and we might see some mania enter i don't think we're at that stage yet but at least it will be based on things we can fairly value as as capital assets things that are real producing um actual real world value and actual cash flows so to me it's a lot different the other thing is the the distribution mechanism is a lot different and i know we want to talk about that but the icos it was um you know very the early icos very much retail mania you gotta you know buy the token uh in this model of sort of the d5 token area you sort of you have to earn them right so so uh compound just released a mechanism for earning comp tokens yesterday and we're going to talk about that but but do you see that as a something different as well is that important yes and also no right so like part of the ico mania was that like you would contribute work to the protocol and then you would receive tokens as a reward uh and the only problem with that is that like it was inside the context of the mania right and so like it and and we really hadn't figured out the distribution mechanism but the main thesis of the distribution mechanism is that you use the token to align incentives with your users so that you can grow your ecosystem right like the token was a community management tool where like it would attract users attract the community but it happened inside of the context of this absolute mania with zero fundamentals but like the token these days are doing the same role that ico tokens earlier claimed to do but this time they're actually doing it right so like if you want comp tokens if you want balancer tokens balancer token is like doing the same thing where like you get the token if you supply liquidity but like the work being done is the type of work being done is much more valid right like for for compound you would submit capital and there's zero way to fake that you can't fake capital uh their their previous ico tokens were totally gameable um yeah but like if you want to supply if you want to get the comp token you got to supply liquidity to the compound protocol which makes the compound protocol better which makes more people use the compound protocol which which just generates the whole the whole feedback loop the flywheel that these tokens were claimed to have created in 2017 and so like it's almost comical to me like exactly the how how perfectly these new defy tokens are resonating with the original thesis of ico tokens but actually doing it correctly yeah i i totally agree and uh maybe we should walk through sort of an example of what what comp actually uh looks like so folks can see how this works because what you said is exactly right david that this is um essentially a growth hack for these d5 protocols so what it's going to do is incent to liquidity and juice liquidity inside of these uh inside of these money protocols these d5 protocols and as we've talked about before liquidity that's the end game for everything there all of these protocols even uh ethereum and eth the the asset itself they're just liquidity monsters the more liquidity you have the more like a money system you become so these things are chewing on liquidity so um can you see my screen david okay okay so this is the the original comp medium post where they talk about distribution allocation of the comp tokens how their governance tokens uh about uh let's see is it um 10 million or so of these tokens yeah i think it's a total of 10 million of these tokens are going to be created close to half of those are going to be reserved for users of the protocol so that's what they just launched on monday a way to issue these tokens for users of the protocol and by that they mean liquidity providers but here's essentially what that what that means um it means that as you provide liquidity to the comp token you get an increased return and this is where it's kind of an action item or it's something interesting for the bankless community to to look into a a friend of mine put together a predictions exchange like a basically a calculator so you can see how much comp tokens you can earn and so if you if you go through this exchange we'll include this in the show notes if you go through this calculator rather uh you can sort of see how much how much you can earn in comp tokens by supplying the various liquidity numbers so if if i supplied a thousand die and i press uh calculate my annual comp returns um we can see right here by supplying die to the compound protocol normally you'd you'd earn a supply rate of 1.09 right so die again as a stable coin that's a bit better than what you might do in a traditional bank account for something that's like pegged to the us dollar but those returns are juiced by the comp token that you're receiving so you get the the 1.09 but then you also earn about 10 per year um well let's see here yeah you you earn 1.21 comp in on an annual basis in additional returns and at the comp valuation which again as we've talked about is you know it's just one day of training yeah it's it's trading but it's currently trading at um at you know 919 million market cap with each token worth i can't believe that i'm saying that over uh over a hundred dollars um so anyway your net apy return is going to be twelve percent so in addition to that one percent that you're getting from the compound product i think they may have totaled this so it's the one percent plus the comp uh to give you a total annual return of 12.2 percent um i think they may have totaled it but that's your total return so it's it's absolutely juicing your returns and it's increasing the incentive to provide liquidity to this to this protocol so it's a it's an ultimate growth hack and that's just with dye so let's check out um tether and so another token has its own interest rate that it gives you in income tokens right or are they the same for dollars of capital different curves different um different up you know drastically different amounts of comp tokens that that you can earn um so if i put a thousand dollars in usdt i click calculate so usdt is regularly going to give me far more than die interesting 0.83 but look at my apy right and that's going that's going down right now this morning it was over a hundred percent so um arbitragers are getting in there like they're exchanging uscc for tether and they're taking advantage of this opportunity but that's a 99 return right now so this is also a way to like smooth out the differences in different pools right so like you are yes i think i think you get more comp for supplying tether because there's more demand for tether and so this is a way for the compound governance system to like nudge capital to be supplied in a particular uh pair is that is that correct yeah exactly and it's also a way to compete i think with the crypto banks so the crypto banks have many different advantages right including uh you know better user interface and in some cases the ability to provide additional incentives some in some cases their own loyalty tokens and this is defy kind of um you know striking back against that and putting its own growth hacks in place to incent liquidity and i think it's going to be absolutely absolutely massive for all of d5 all the protocols are going to implement something like this yeah totally totally crypto banks don't stand a chance yeah i mean there's other there's other stuff you can get into too which i'm which i'm trying to figure out at the moment which is um you know instadap is allowing you to actually take leverage on staple coins and further juice your returns wow instadap already has a tool for this that's crazy they shipped that fast i know so they just built it on top so anyway more stuff to figure out here but uh we will include links to these interfaces in the show notes so you can you can see just how much apy your annualized return can be by depositing some of these various uh assets into into comp um and you could really see i mean i get why you're bullish david i understand it it seems like this is a very bullish move for defy and um yeah could could be part of the next bull run for sure so not only that but like d5 tokens are bullish in their own right but also because of the way that market cycles work right if all these defy tokens have gone like 3x to 30x over the last six months like that's gonna rotate back into east dude like if if the all the tokens on ethereum went like collectively 3x in price people are gonna people are going to rotate well that's how it worked in in 2017 very much right and if you look at sort of what's the the leading trading pair for comp right now on uniswap which is the only exchange which is basically um selling comp tokens it's all eth it's all in each pair off the top of your head do you know how much ease is in that trading pair i don't we could look that up i mean i know the vault the volume is about a million a day right now so not a ton but um it's just gonna suck up a ton of ether it's gonna suck up a ton of youth yes and not quite like 2017 so right 2017 basically all of the ico raises um sucked up youth because you had to contribute in kind right with eth right um but but this has advantages in that it's it's still sucking up youth as kind of a trading pair it's growing the economy certainly and these are real assets now that's not to say uh like if you do it net present value calculation of comp tokens right now like if you work backwards to get to the 900 million number um it probably doesn't make sense right like the you know the p e ratios price earnings ratios have to be absolutely insane to wrap up that valuation so it's not to say that this won't get crazy and speculative but the difference as we said is compounds are real like it's a real protocol it's working people are using it and like potentially there's some real cash flows associated with this right and and we can actually calculate it which did not happen in 2017. you actually have numbers to go off of we have numbers to go off of we have models i think we're starting to understand this more so yeah i mean that's that's huge i think and you know what here's the other thing is um stocks don't have any room to talk right now because they are like dude like it's it's the fed it's it's not it's not the company anymore it's like are they gonna print more money okay so is is that what's going on with like the robin hood is like the new finance right it's just we buy all the all the the stock like ship ones that can right like so what what's happening are people like getting their their check from the fed their stimulus check from the fed they're just like oh nothing to do i'm going to robin hood may as well like buy some hertz stock buy some cars aside man it's no longer what it once was it no longer is a place to find and discover value it's a place it's turning into a casino which is what finance was like it is turning into something that is separate from reality like the stock market couldn't be more separated from reality right now it's a it's a decent amount of the stock market is at all-time highs and 50 percent of the united states have not has not opened up for business like it's it's disconnect it's a huge i feel like i feel like so i feel like you know to the smps like you're drunk bro go home like we take it off sleep it off because we i feel like uh people in crypto have lived through this we know what drunk looks like because we had 2017 where things were just stupid it was just dumb yeah i mean i thought i thought eath was going to to 20 000 like in six months but you know it turns out i was drunk turns out i was drunk at that time right i mean and it happens with all markets but um i mean how does this end do you think for robin hood traders um does the fed just keep bailing them out man so so this is uh what i was talking about with christian on pov crypto pod the if we were to witness a dollar inflation event or perhaps dare i say hyperinflation event we would see exactly what we have seen so far like inflation shows up in the stock market first and if they keep on printing money because because like you know another hurts went bankrupt like it's just going to blow up confidence in the whole rest of the system while these particular stocks just moon because stocks are now a savings technology not a way to invest in a company it's just a way to preserve wealth but can't the fed just continue to print the money like forever infinite quantitative easing i mean does it have ever run out yeah yeah after after it blows up sure yeah but not before it blows up yeah they can keep on printing money as as long as people are buying the dollar that's the thing is like they're they also have this interesting position where like there is a global deflation of dollars right like the world wants dollars and so the dollars it going up in value and so when they print dollars actually means more um but like it's not going to go up the demand for dollars isn't going to go up forever especially when they're flooding the market like the amount of new dollars in the world is staggering yeah i mean it feels like that's the last thing that's that's you know we talk about kind of debt and you know 20 trillion in debt that the us is in all of that um but the the bigger debt and the debt that we are taking out right now is debt against the us's future status as a reserve currency for the world right i feel like you know baby boomers i love you i love my parents they're great but like it feels like that's the last thing that the baby boomers are taking is like on their way out it's like well this is the last honey pot we're gonna you know it's the reserve currency status of the u.s dollar now i guess i want to retire in luxury right at least not in poverty right right i i guess the saving grace is that you know all of the other fiat central banks are doing it too so maybe like everyone's you know playing the same game and so it matters less that the us is doing this right now but i think all of the economic theories like if you look at modern monetary theory and the ability like the the idea that we can just continue to print money as long as we keep inflation in check it all seems based on this assumption they all make this core assumption that people uh the population the citizens of the world don't have another alternative like they don't have another non-fiat alternative right right and what if they do and what if they do yeah no that i i've heard this from bitcoins over and over and over again is is bitcoin isn't the bubble it's the needle it's it's the thing that pops the bubble and there's no better way to inflate a bubble than money printer go bear yeah absolutely all right bullish yeah you know what david we should talk about our uh our second round of sponsors so i want to talk about ramp so ramp is a fantastic way to do fiat on-ramp so if you are a defy app developer one of the biggest pain points you probably have is when the the user goes and tries to do a transaction in ethereum and doesn't have funds doesn't have any heath to pay for the gas so ramp solves that in like five minutes um one of your users can get access to fiat right in their account connects directly to their bank account so it's super easy it's a magic experience and it's one of the biggest pain points that defy needs to solve so check them out in the youtube notes go to ramp.network for more info on ramp the coolest thing about the bankless nation is that it knows no borders and so if you want to store your money and your wealth on in the bankless nation on ethereum you should absolutely get a get an account set up with monolith because monolith will spin you up a smart contract wallet and then they will also give you a defy visa card and visa is basically accepted all over the world but instead of using dollars in your bank account it uses die in your smart contract wallet so you can go from country to country when chronovirus is over and we're all doing that you can go from country to country place to place hop on a plane and swipe your visa card and it will still use the same die smart contract wallet on ethereum because the bankless nation knows no borders so go to monolith.xyz and sign up and get your d5 card today very cool all right man so that was topic one second topic we wanted to big top out yeah big topic big topic too let's move um so second one we want to talk about is crypto and the internet so i know recently david we've been comparing crypto to nation states a lot and you've got your second article coming out shortly on that which has kind of a similar table as this like with nation states but there's another comparison we can we can make and that's comparing crypto to the internet protocol the communication protocol it was really interesting to me so just last week ethereum hit a hundred million bank accounts um i say bank accounts but but what i'm talking about is etherdresses right so a hundred million each addresses created on this new protocol this new value protocol this new settlement layer um it took the internet until about from from 1991 to 2006 to get to 100 million websites now i know those yes apples and oranges they're kind of different but those numbers like feel significant uh anyway right like you can you can see sort of the network effect and the saturation of that and so i was thinking a lot about the comparison of the internet as a communication protocol and that's really what it is versus what crypto is bringing and crypto is really it's it's part of the internet right like so crypto and the internet they're not different things what crypto is basically is adding a another layer to the internet so the internet was all about communication another realm right another like property that the internet previously didn't have so the internet is all about global distributed permissionless credibly neutral communication right so we saw that in everything that was built on top of it email and social media and um you know even like e-commerce those sorts of things but crypto is doing to value what the internet did to communication it's a different protocol and it's layering that on top of the internet and there's a lot of different uh a lot of different parallels i mean do you see this too yeah yeah absolutely and it makes it makes a ton of sense and it fills a missing gap that the internet has always had right and the there's a even the web 3 movement the web 3 movement is kind of nebulously defined uh and i kind of i i there's the internet of value which can be considered web 3 but also the web3 movement is also about rebuilding the web too which is like taking the internet the old internet systems the communication digital media attention economy and rebuilding it in the crypto land but using the crypto money systems at the bottom and i'm really excited about that marriage but what you're talking about ryan is like the correlates between every single thing that has made up the web 2 movement and how you can find an equal correlate in the crypto world for for what it does uh when we had it mar from uh from argent on on the bankless podcast we talked about how like the argent wallet is kind of it could be like the netscape browser but for crypto where the netscape browser that you know that the the internet before the browser came around was this very dense and difficult to navigate system and the browser made it usable it made it uh sexy to use and that's really what we see like the argent wallet doing with with ethereum and d5 right like it makes the experience easy it's it's a it's a x it's a sexy ui ux on top of defy on top of crypto and then you can you can make all these same comparisons for all these different um you know actions that you've made here and and and i think they they we we say it's an apples to oranges comparison because it has to be but it's the best it's the best apples to apples comparison that we can also come up with yeah yeah apples and oranges you know both are fruit so you can't compare them that's what we're doing i mean but one of the big things i i feel like um folks in the crypto space or in the blockchain space uh one of the big mistakes they made early on is looking at the wrong metrics right they they came at this thing from a internet world from like a web one web two world and so even when they were like in the early phases measuring success in uh networks like ethereum they were measuring it still in like how many daily active users do you have right right like how many views do you have oh i mean there's only a thousand only a thousand people using maker like that's a thousand addresses that's nothing it's just but those a thousand dresses each of those addresses could be a bank account right essentially that has millions tens of millions in value in it and like they were measuring the success of crypto by internet metrics when they should have been measuring the success of crypto by cryptometrics so like the metrics are value liquidity volume that's the real you know currency that's that's the real uh thing that you're you're seeking you're not seeking attention anymore it's not the attention economy this is like the the money economy the value economy so it's different so you have to look at everything in crypto with that orientation absolutely you can't you can't use the internet uh metrics in order to compare it so now we do need people right like we do need daily active users some to some degree like we if crypto and ethereum and the bankless world ends up being just like you know 50 000 people and that's it like that's not that great like we do need those right it's not great but the way that that we get daily active users is by getting you know volume liquidity money total value we get that first because those getting pumping those numbers up is what makes these systems operate better for a wider audience and so it's got to be the the volume the liquidity numbers that get up first because that's what attracts the daily active users the daily active users doesn't bring the liquidity the liquidity brings the daily active users yeah for sure and i do think that uh we are starting to realize this like like two years ago i was talking about this and it was maddening to me or people were talking about like maker being a failure because there are only a few thousand users on it and you know yeah those people are probably still saying maker's a failure but right so so maybe but like it's crazy to me because what you should be looking at what we're starting to look at now is like like d5 pulse so value locked in d5 that's huge right um and then like loan originations so the way to look at the success of maker is how much in loans did it originate oh wow you know turns out it's already originated like 2.4 billion in loans right it took um lending tree like peer-to-peer lending for like you know five years to reach 250 million right like who whoever like asks wells fargo how many daily active users do you have like that's just a nonsensical question it's a stupid how many times do you open up your bank account like hopefully not very often yeah it's a it's a very internet like silicon valley like question and we need to be starting to look at this through the lens of finance so i think we're doing that more but man two years ago it was a mess and hopefully people continue to look at this as a protocol for value and not um you know not a protocol for attention and communication it's totally different absolutely absolutely all right man anything to add to that or should we discuss topic three let's let's move on all right so we've we've not discussed this all right so i put out a tweet um last week a week and a half ago or so i said uh and this is a little snarky you know twitter's fun what's the security uh cap on your blockchain i mean supply cap same thing so what i was saying there is basically there is this relationship that bitcoiners do not acknowledge between um the the fixed cap of their issuance policy of 21 million and that also being a security cap so if you you fix the issuance of your monetary policy right by definition you're also fixing the amount of security budget that that you're providing so it's a little you know snarky it's like you know i i think i was maybe triggered by somebody who was uh celebrating um fixed cap as like the best thing without looking at the trade-offs of fixed cap but then you jumped in you were like oh bad take ryan i said i said oof don't like this one yeah yeah exactly so so tell me why don't you like it so what's um let's talk about it i i think it's because maybe i'm taking it literally um and and maybe you don't mean it's it's quite in such a literal sense but like the the security of a blockchain doesn't doesn't come from its issuance right uh not just that it can um however if you take it literally uh like when bitcoin reaches maturity and has 21 million and it is captain not issuing any more like it is still going to have people paying for its security so like the security the where you get security doesn't come from only issuing um issuing the currency and it also comes from transaction fees is that what you're saying yes it also comes from transaction fees right and we also are going to see that dynamic play out in ethereum as well right and so in ethereum 2.0 when they're sharding when there's a bunch of total uh transactions per per time and those transactions are being burned in eip1559 those transactions those that are paying the fees are going to burn ether which makes it more scarce which means that when we issue ether that that ether is more valuable which increases the security and so it's there's there's a yin and a yang here there's like the issuance and then there's the fees and you also get security from fees and fees are really really important in the long term security because if you are only relying on issuance then these the value of your asset is going to go down which means you have to issue more to make that make up that same security which means you have to issue more which means you have to issue more which then just totally ruins the whole value of your of your asset and so the more you can actually get security from your fees the better because that means you actually have to issue less all right well that's a little disappointing because i thought we were going to like disagree on this or something but um yeah i um yeah yeah so exactly i mean i think the tweet wasn't a um a complete thought on that right it wasn't um you know it didn't it didn't say but if your network successfully transitions to receiving you know security budget from transaction fees then everything's okay which is like the addendum to that um i do i don't you know i think you share this but i don't know like do you share the concern that so um what what bitcoin is doing it's got to cross this chasm right um and people like kasu and the bitcoin community have talked about this by the way we're having hassu on the podcast um tomorrow we're gonna put that out next week uh so catch that guys we're gonna talk about this issue um but but so he recognizes the issue here is bitcoin because of its monetary policy has to move from a security budget that's paid for by issuance so the memetic power of the bitcoin is is gold meme right that's like really strong for for bitcoin so it's got to move from a security budget that's paid for by that in all of its strengths to a security budget that's paid for just pure demand for its block space and what can you do with bitcoin block space right now um the thing you can do with bitcoin block space primarily is move bitcoin like that's that's it and so if everybody's holding no one wants to move a lot of bitcoin right or like i i'm not saying that they're uh that bitcoins economic like its security budget will collapse to zero just that it's very likely with that sort of a monetary policy uh and issuance policy that it will be exceeded by another network that doesn't make those trade-offs right right because if you look at big if you look at ethereum right now um it feels like it's on a trajectory for a flipping in terms of blocks based demand like ethereum blocks are more useful i mean why because you can put stable coins on them you can you know run compound transactions you can vote on you do tons of things with them and um you know its block space might be in higher demand than bitcoin so it's kind of you know playing to its strengths anyway i i just see that as a mostly unacknowledged trade-off in the bitcoin space when they're talking about the the virtues of fixed supply so even the most avid bitcoiners will say like either bitcoin works completely or it doesn't uh and there's no there's no middle ground uh and that's to say like either the transaction fees become enough or they don't and what worries it worries me is like the communicated narrative the communicated value proposition is that you can buy and hold bitcoin forever and just store it and and that'll be enough for you but it never ever talks about like and you need to like have block space a band nowhere in the bitcoin narrative is there room for um that room for increasing the demand of the block space bitcoiners just kind of assume that the the block space will be in demand if the asset is is valuable which is like it's an it's an okay assumption so long as we are aware that we are assuming it and the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is like ethereum re-prioritizes things it says that we are going to put security first and we are going to do our best to make our block space in demand and so that we are no matter what there is no you know binariness in the success of ethereum it will rise or sink to the level of its success and so that and and bitcoin it does this hard it's hard hard plant of the flag and say 21 million hard cap and people are going to love that 21 million hard cap so much that it is going to ultimately make the system extremely successful to the point that it memed itself into existence by generating enough fees and ethereum is doing the opposite where it says we are going to make our blockchain so incredibly secure that everyone will believe in its existence into the future no matter what and then that will create value in the assets and so we're doing these same things but like for me the existence of ethereum into the long-term distant future seems more secure because that is what the goal of ethereum is and i think that is the right priorities whereas bitcoin you kind of have to take it on faith and ingrained in the in the social contract of bitcoin is that you don't talk about how it couldn't fail because that also increases the likelihood of it working so yeah responsibility to do that if you doubt you decrease the security of bitcoin if you doubt don't be a doubter you can't you can't doubt you can't doubt okay so so here's something interesting is right so um i mean you we we just talked about the digital nation analog right where we compared um crypto to mostly we compared it to the nation state right yeah and you did it right so what about a digital religion it they're they're both it's definitely both and there is a different and difference in balance right i would say ethereum is closer to a nation state and bitcoin is closer to a religion that's interesting right because you do have many aspects of a religion with these digital nations as we've called them in particular bitcoin right but you just you just used words like you got to take it on faith right and there's definitely profits so we were talking um on twitter just last week uh gavin andreessen like he he tweeted something about ethereum um he's clearly a fan uh and we said hey gavin you know and he by the way for folks who don't know he's one of the ogs he's like he was like the third guy second no he's the second right it's like satoshi off the kings of the kingdom to gavin right he was like he's like you're the number one like you know continue this without me i've got other things to do so but but we said gavin you should come on the like podcast come on bank list let's talk about bridging bitcoin and ethereum the very first you know tweet after that when they got the most likes from the bitcoin community uh somebody goes no gavin's not not a bitcoiner like he's not a beginner anymore no he failed the purity test right like he's he's out he's ostracized it's like it's like it's like the church it's like a religion saying like you no longer believe the canon of acceptable beliefs therefore you're you're out you have to keep everything pure you have to keep the faith pure you have to keep so so but you know that's both a i think a weakness but also weirdly a strength huge bitcoin huge okay so so you're saying a limit on its scale however you cannot scale the bitcoin community that way why because you need a whole bunch of people who are going to like be dogmatic enough to exactly yeah and and then be the followers to believe in that but i want to make a distinction because you don't need the bitcoin blockchain and the growth of the bitcoin blockchain can be independent from the growth and scale of the bitcoin community so the bitcoin chain can still grow and serve the needs of the world it's just the bitcoin community can't scale because of how dogmatic it is yeah if i if i hold bitcoin i don't have to be a um maximalist who believes all of these things right i don't have to be a downhill i don't have to i don't have to be i don't have to be a dick i can like but i can just hold it right it's like it's like independent of that but so but you think that's interesting do you think ethereum would be uh better off if it injected a bit more religion yeah um maybe perhaps i kind of like ethereum where it is um but does that limit its you know here's here's your counterpoint does but actually does that limit ethereum's scale i don't think so because i think in the same way that nation states eventually s assumed religion that like the fundamentals of ethereum will eventually take over the role of faith right and and what you and i have been doing and all the people that have been like ethan's money ethan's money each value go up we have been trying to get the fundamentals based side of ethereum to like be a little bit more religious but at the same time i would rather lead with fundamentals because fundamentals are facts and facts you cannot disprove uh and so i i put facts above faith all the time and i think the the the doing that in your crypto nation is also the right way to do things well we'll see i mean i do think that these are these uh these kind of different visions and different experiments that are that are playing out and um you know naseem to lab has talked about the value of an intolerant minority that's very much what i see in their ability by the way it just takes like one to three percent of the population being a tolerant minority to like bring about major change right as long as they're allowed right because they are allowed they are steadfast and they are immutable they will not change uh and in some ways oddly though i can't get there like because it's just not how i'm wired um oddly that's a weird strength for bitcoin and um you know it's something i'm just in the process of wrapping my head around but um gotta see how it plays out david i think we hit all three subjects man this has been a good first state of the nation first state of the nation state of the nation is bullish all right so what are we doing state of the nation's bullish uh we're going to be releasing this every tuesday sometime during tuesday and then when's it going to come out on the podcast we're going to put it out wednesday thursday yeah let's we can do it let's do it wednesday wednesday morning right that's great that's it that's it stay the nation guys um your one action item we went over that comp opportunity uh we will include that in the in the show notes uh so you can take a look at how much you can make in comp tokens right now by depositing some assets this has been ryan sean adams david hoffman signing off state of the nation episode one fantastic thanks guys thanks
