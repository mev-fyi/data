[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs live from new york it is not saturday night uh i am here with gabe frank in person here from nft nyc gabe frank is the founder and ceo of arcade um and i was really interested in talking to gage today because arcade is a lending platform you can put your nft up for collateral and get a loan off the back of that which i think is really interesting right now in these bear market times to discuss and i think financial primitives in the world of nfts are really interesting generally speaking but gabe has a particularly interesting background which is he's worked at crypto companies for a while bitgo curve but prior to that comes from a family of pawn shop owners and so is very well acquainted with the world of creating liquidity out of like physical non-fungible goods so i think you have a a special perspective to share here and thank you so much for joining me gabe sure thanks for having me so i want to start by just like painting a picture of how i think uh like an example of how arcade works so this is like how i picture the typical scenario going and then you can correct me sure so i have a crypto punk and that's 100 eath of mine that's just sitting there locked up that i can't really access because i don't want to sell my punk but i'd love to have access to that 100 eth so i come to arcade and i say okay i'm going to i want to loan a 50 eath and i'm going to like escrow this crypto punk and so if i ever default on this loan somebody else gets my crypto punk and i now get to go take this 50 eath and put it into some yield farming protocol where i can earn some money back on it and maybe i start paying off the interest of my loan that i just took out with that yield farming i'm doing and isn't the world a lovely place is that like the typical use case for arcade as it currently stands yeah so that's one strategy um i think that strategy is better fit for a bull market because in a bull market you have apys on these d5 protocols that are higher than the interest rate on the loan would be so an example is get a loan for 50 eth on that on that asset um say you know average rates right now in our platform are like 18 apr so borrowers just need to beat that apr um to be able to be make a profitable trade so let me just clarify that so that basically the interest rate on that loan would be 18 right they're paying 18 in interest rates they have to beat 18 how many people got wrecked from luna trading on your platform so no one on uh from luna because we are we're building on ethereum um and we're folks like swapping eth that they'd taken out in loans for luna to get that 20 percent no i don't think we saw any of that that probably did happen though um but i think our borrowers are are a little bit more sophisticated and sort of d5 power users um so when luna was crashing we didn't have any any users take out loans for that for that use case well when it was crashing i would hope they weren't taking out the loans i imagine they were taking out the loans before the crash right and they didn't buy the dip by taking out a loan so yeah that's a good thing yeah uh you other use cases you're you seem to say like that's one strategy what are some of the other use cases you see folks employing yeah so now that we're in a bear market rates are apys have gone down it's not a profitable trade to yield farm anymore really um so other use cases are it's it's a hedge against your long position on your nft so taking out a nft loan is like buying a put option um because if the collateral value goes beneath the principal value then the bar doesn't have to come back to pay that loan he can just let it go um and buy the same asset for cheaper in the market so in a way it's it's like buying a put option um another strategy is just levering up so guys that have millions sometimes multi you know 10 20 30 million locked up into nfts and they're somewhat sophisticated traders d5 power users funds dows that have treasuries um and they're investing the money elsewhere so it's like opportunistic plays maybe taking the loan um levering up on eth um or some other asset and kind of the third use case is just people wanting to buy more nfts so typically collectors have tons of nfts the value fluctuates quite a bit so taking out a loan for capital efficiency um because it's just idle capital that's sitting there that's locked up in the nft taking a loan and putting that money elsewhere putting it to work and reinvesting in yourself that's kind of the third use case we see so i want to talk about that that second one where you described it as almost like buying a put option like you know going extra long on the nft itself you're saying so it's like going short the nft um oh boy all right see i'm gonna just just break this down and if if this seems like it's gonna bore the audience we'll cut it out of the final cut but so just walk it through me one more time slower yeah so say you buy a punk that's worth a hundred each yeah um say you get a loan on that punk for 70 eat okay now in three months when the loan is due if the value of the punk is now 60 eath why would you pay back the loan because you're the club the value of the collector the 70 each you got was even more than the what the punk itself is worth at the time the loan is due correct if the bar if that's the case then the borrower doesn't really need to pick up the loan so the so the borrower will basically intentionally default say great you can have this punk for 60 right or for 70 east is what you've now paid for it i can go buy a punk for 60 eth and i've now made a 10th difference on that yes wow that's really interesting and now the the lender's bummed about that dynamic of course well the lenders are usually long these assets anyways and i think if they can get an asset at any discount they're going to take it some lenders have different profiles so some may be long punks some maybe long basis some maybe long clonex just kind of depends on the on the lender profile so um yeah and in that example specifically you mentioned like you got 70 eth off of a punk that at one point had a hundred eighth value say that loan to value ratio that ltv right is you're looking at you know you get 70 eath off of 100 eth asset that's high am i right like crypto punks board api club some of these more liquid collections you can get a bigger loan off of the asset than in other uh other cases of that right speak to a little bit what's like a typical uh that's that's correct so like punks and bc they're more liquid there's secondary bids um there's transaction history to price the assets so lenders are more comfortable going a little higher on the loan to value ratio um punks we're seeing anywhere between 40 and up to sometimes 80 percent ltv basey sort of the same but the average sweet spot is around 40 percent and who makes these determinations is it the person who's looking to borrow that goes on and sets the parameters of what they're hoping to get and then a lender can come along and meet those parameters yeah it's a little bit it's a little bit of both so a borrower can go and they can they can set their their terms that they want in the marketplace on our dap and then a lender can come and choose to fund that loan based on on those parameters that are signed on chain um a lender can also make a counter offer so if he doesn't like those terms he can make his own offer on that specific asset um and then the third way is we operate sort of this otc white glove service where we work with high net worth counterparties that have high value assets where we actually appraise the the asset and value the asset and then match them with the lender and then they meet on the on the dap to to escrow and settle alone once once all those terms are figured out so that's a more manual process where if you have a like a fine art piece that's not highly liquid but that is clearly worth a lot because it's a whatever insert it's a who did the currency you know or damien hurst or fuocious or one of these pieces that can go for a lot you'll kind of personally handle those cases in a more manual way yeah exactly so we it's it's it's like an otc desk but it's an agency desk we don't make the loans we're just the the infra provider um so that's that's correct it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces needs robust financial reporting performance analysis and the peace of

bids to join pfp communities and dm with some brand new internet friends i want to get into how the bear market has affected things you've already started alluding to some cases but i want to talk about like have defaults gone crazy but before i get to that i'd love to understand what's happening on the back end of these transactions from like a technical perspective um i know you're taking these nfts into escrow but like what does that actually look like on chain yeah so we we built our own smart contract protocol it's called the pawn protocol um ties into my background well and basically the entire loan process and loan life cycle is governed by our smart contracts so the the protocol is non-custodial we don't take custody of the nfts nor do we have access to any of them we also don't control the money movement so when a loan is funded it's all governed by by the smart contracts one concern let's call it that i have about this concept of smart contract determined like outcomes which on the whole i think is really exciting and that's part of cutting out middlemen and all the rest of it but is you lose that human touch so we'll talk a little bit more about your pawnshop background and what you've learned from that but it strikes me that like there's a little bit of humanity in there where like if i pawn my grandmother's ring and then i'm like i need one more day to get you the money back so i can get my ring back like i can go to you and plead my case whereas if something's being managed by a smart contract it's very automatic and you lose that humanity are you finding that how do you respond to that that's definitely true um i think like in a pawn shop people are are getting a loan on um assets that mean something to them maybe it's a jewelry that was passed down by their by their family or something like that well with nfts there's also like a mind like a human connection because a lot of these these collectors it's it's their online identity so when they pawn those assets um or get a loan on those assets they don't want to lose it it's it's it's somewhat their online identity and how they interact so um there is a human element though our otc desk um the way the protocol works is that when uh when a bar doesn't pay back on time the loan goes into default so there's no auto liquidation um so when a loan goes into default the lender has to manually claim the assets out of the protocol um now if the lender doesn't claim the assets out of the protocol uh even after it's past due the bar can still pay off in in a default status is there a way for me if i was a a borrower for example in my my asset or my loan goes into default can i make contact with that lender in some capacity and say hey i need literally two more days please don't please don't liquidate it and and for the next two days that does happen um borrowers and lenders are in in contact with each other usually in like a telegram chat or discord um but sometimes the counterparties don't know each other and so that can't happen uh but that's something we're addressing in our v2 protocol that makes it easy for different lenders to bid on um uh collateral so it's like a competitive bid market for lenders and so borrowers will end up getting getting the best rate that they can you mentioned like at the end of the term things going into default maybe let's just clarify for folks my understanding is right now you you almost exclusively work with term loans right so a i want this loan for three months and then at the end of that i'm owed money or i can roll over and keep the the thing going if both parties agree i'm assuming you can clarify that for me but we don't have is like a margin call situation where like if something goes below a certain you know if the punk falls in price enough i have to put up additional margin or capital do i have that right can you clarify for folks this this term loan what that really means yeah that's right so um there's no margin calls there's no liquidation event um the loan just goes into default when when at the end of the term a borrower though if he doesn't have the full principal and interest can roll the term over so what we have in our v2 protocol is for different lenders to bid on rollovers so when a loan is coming due for a borrower a lender can place a bid to extend the term and so that's also a competitive bid market so borrowers might be able to get better terms on the next rollover if a lender sees this wallet address is paid off before or is paying interest um so so yeah there's always this scenario of like perpetual borrow you really don't ever have to pay your loan off an arcade um you can continue paying the interest and extending the loan and keeping your money at work which is a lot like how traditional art lending is done like people get loans against picassos for 100 million at two percent from bank of america and then they reappraise the value of those assets every single year and take more money out so i think we're going to see the same type of finance kind of play out in nfts the big difference it would seem is that two percent to 18 percent rate if i have a picasso and i can get a loan against it and the interest i have to pay back on that is two percent it's you know reasonable to beat two percent 18 seems like it would be very hard to beat for sure i mean we are in a very risk-on asset class i think there are plays that can that you can opportunistically place you can beat the rate but yes the the the profiles are a bit different here than trad art yeah in my final questions around just quite literally how does the platform work how do you determine pricing and how do you see price determinations maybe evolving over time yeah it's an interesting question so we have a data science team uh data engineering team that works on valuations and data and models for appraisals of the assets um there's no there's no best way to value nfts today they're somewhat too illiquid there are enough transactions on certain collections like punks and basey but when you're pricing illiquid assets it's tough it's it's it's not a specific number that's important it's more like a range so people use floor price quite a bit to price nfts and assets we use a combination of a t-wap a time weighted average across similar assets in that collection and and so we what we do at our otc desk we provide those valuations to our counterparties to help them um come to terms on the dap and so to give some examples maybe this is obvious based on the conversation even up to this point but it's something like the blue chip collections maybe you can name some you've mentioned punks and and apes but like doodles would they be in there like our cool cats in there like where do you kind of draw that line and make those determinations and then and then is it like what we would consider almost like fine art pieces otherwise and one of ones yeah go beyond that i think we're starting to see different sectors within nfts emerge there's the art space there's the profile picture space gaming assets digital land each has their own different risk profile and lenders will price them differently so with illiquid things like like the 101 art stuff it's based on comps of similar works from that artist with profile pictures since there is somewhat a little bit of liquidity you can base it off a weighted average right there was at one point liquidity right we lost a few bids this last week um but uh yeah we we think we have a good model to value the assets that help that help our lenders kind of make determination and you have things like gaming assets it sounds like then you're saying on there as well or like land assets so gaming hasn't really taken off too too well in web three i think you had axion affinity um i don't know how well they're doing now but uh god's unchanged like you have a few i think that are yeah there's a few launching stuff i think that'll get more relevant as there's games that people actually want to play and not just like because they want to earn a token um but we we're seeing a lot of profile picture avatars so so it's like clonex doodles uh azuki's punks basie um and then on the art side it's it's it's creators like fuocious like pac people um and uh yeah it really just depends on on the lender's risk appetite what he wants to lend against that's really where the demand is do you have minimums like assets have to be worth at least a certain amount or can be somebody get a one each loan from arcade no i think our i think our lowest loan has been half an eth wow so it really is totally all-purpose i asked a little bit about where you think the future of this plays out and that comes from i interviewed jake brockman uh who's the ceo of coin fund i believe it was he who sort of said this to me where he's like just price discovery like all of this stuff is gonna be run by machines like and in some years time all of like the pricing mechanisms are gonna be determined by like machines is that your view of this as somebody who's deeply involved in pricing assets in this space yeah i think i think jake's right i think we get to a point where it becomes so sophisticated like if the pricing is down to the exact trait um until that matters though um there is a human element because it's it's hard to price a liquid asset so there there has to be some discretion okay i'm going to ask i'm going to preamble this question one of my concerns around this stuff is is leverage and the way we see that leverage makes the crash even harder what's interesting about what i hear you saying is if we look at previous crashes like 2008 right part of the problem there was nobody knew how to price these like mortgage-backed securities right and it was like a tangled web of like what the hell is any of this stuff even worth as things were crashing is there a world where that's actually better in this new digital future if we do have like total price history transparency everything's on chain and we have machines that can tell you to uh instant what the price of these things are worth or am i naive that's that's probably a better world i think any time you have more liquid economies and assets it makes everything move move better so access to credit is very important in any economy and and i think nfts will capture quite a bit of value going forward whether it's digital ip or art or profile pictures but being able to take liquidity and get accurate pricing that lenders and borrowers feel comfortable with that's that's important like instant pricing across all assets is a fascinating concept yes you think we'll get there i think um i think we'll get there for digital like native digital assets yeah yeah very interesting okay it's a bear market it's totally changed the dynamics have you seen a big uptick in defaults when since the bear market has hit so not yet but i think in the next month or two we're going to see quite a bit of defaults interesting and and why is that just because it's the three month term time horizon is is typical right so some loans we made two months ago they're still waiting a month for the loan to to come do um also what's interesting about these term loans is that like people don't want to lose these assets even though the value goes down because of their social identity so they will probably extend the loan until the market turns around maybe but that's the risk that they're gonna have to take do you feel any qualms about helping to put like excess essentially leverage into the system which again then make these crashes all the harder no i think i think these things are going to get built i think the infrastructure is going to get built um i think that we have the right dna and background to build safe systems to do so do you have like education pieces what do you do to help folks really understand what they're getting into if they're maybe new to this kind of trading yeah so there are a ton of um dashboards that you can utilize for like floor pricing and trait rarity and things like that we developed our own community tool um called metadata.xyz which is basically just a floor price dashboard and trait rarity for the top 15 collections um so that's something we're releasing soon kind of to enrich our users to help them come to terms make better financial decisions on the dap and orienta so when did you launch arcade we launched arcade in april 2021. and i know you've got some i was seeing like 5 million dollars i think it's probably different now of like trading volume or give us some of the orient us in terms of like how big this market is right now or has been yeah so we've done 25 million in loan volume notional loan volume um most of our loans are funded in in west wrapped ether usdc but total it's 25 million i think niftyfi has done now 200 million um so the entire market you have also protocols like bend down jpeg that have done some volume so i put the size of the market and loan volume probably at 300 million today um whereas i think the tam of this market today is probably half a billion just because the universe of nfts and what nfts are has to grow for the loan volume to pick up but yeah i put it at half a half a million right half a billion do you happen to know what and this is so hard to quantify but like what like the pawn shop market is or what some sort of equivalent i don't think that's actually the right equivalent yet we'll get into that but like what the equivalent irl market is yeah so there's i think three public pawn shops right now um they probably all have a loan book of like three or four billion and so they have three billion of loans on the street possibly and on that three billion pawn shops earn a lot of a lot of uh it's it's high interest so they're earning maybe 10 a month on that on that uh on that money so yeah i think the the in real life non-fungible loan market is pretty big but pawn shops probably aren't the right comparison i mean i think that's an interesting background you come from but it strikes me that you're dealing with like high net worth individuals or people with a decent amount of disposable income and maybe financial sophistication certainly enough disposable income or got lucky enough to find themselves with these like six figure you know jpegs and pawn shops strike these people who are on the lower income side and are pawning something not because they're going to yield farm and get you know a couple percentage interest points higher but because they need to make rent next month right is that comparison in this in the bear market we're more like a pawn shop now okay um but but yeah i think you know these borrowers have disposable income they can think they can they can buy jpegs um uh i do think though with this market we will see different use cases of just people needing money to take out of the crypto ecosystem and into dollars um so i think we'll see different use cases what's like the most interesting because okay there's lots of people and they're just going and putting in another protocol and like getting more interest on it and paying back the uh yeah okay whatever like is there like are there some really like interesting use cases you've seen of people leveraging this to change their lives for the better yeah we had an interesting one um last week with mike magelick he's this i i didn't know mike before um now i know him and he was buying a home in la i think for four million he'd been looking for a house to buy in la um his podcast i think it's like one or two million views um so he's like same he's got some he's got some influence um and he reached out to us because he needed dollars in the bank for his down payment on that house so he has a board ape um that he sent us the token id we valued it and then gave him terms on on the asset so we gave him a 200 000 uscc loan at 10 apr for two months um and basically what he's doing is he's he converted it to cash on coinbase and then he's using that money for a down payment on the house but then he has to pay you back in two months but he can pay just the interest piece on that is the idea right if he doesn't have the full principal um then he can just pay the interest back and then default on his ap no like he he probably has cash that's coming in the future and so he didn't have the cash at the present moment he's gonna get paid on in the next two months two or three months and so it's almost like just like a payday loan at that point to some extent right like yeah performance i used to make payday loans so they're much higher interest but does that feel predatory uh i didn't think so i mean people really need it's like a last resort for for people they love when they get the loans because they need the money they don't love when they need to pay it back it's a different story but yeah payday loans are i think almost a necessary evil because people need access to credit in real life and why not get a loan on a asset that's sitting in your home that's not doing anything for you so so i'm fascinated by buy now pay later because it's credit getting around all like the usual without like charging the consumer for using credit right they're charging the retailer because it'll get more people to buy into their goods right like how does that map to a digital economy world yeah so by now pay later is basically a loan um so it's in our wheelhouse of products that we can offer so it's it's um and and the way by now pay later works um is that these platforms offer the lenders rebates for actually providing the the access to uh well let's spell this out because my understanding of buy now pay later is if i'm lululemon i don't know insert here right it's shown that somebody's more likely to spend money on my online shop if they have the buy now pay later option because it makes it look cheaper to them and they feel like it's cheaper so they're going to spend more money in their cart ultimately if i buy now pay later so i pay a buy now pay later company basically to integrate their tech in there because i'll make more money by charging consumers more and then i as a consumer basically i'm able to pay it off over time which is like credit except that i'm not getting charged an interest rate on that right is that right that's how it works yeah exactly so in in this scenario like you would be like a tech thing that the crypto punks marketplace could integrate onto their marketplace and maybe would pay you a cut and i now can come on and buy a crypto punk but pay it off over the course of six months that's correct yeah so if we're not like if and by now pay later if we're not charging the consumer interest how does the lender get paid well it's usually on rebates um for more people using that platform the companies find to give rebates to the lender so you still end up being the lender like by now pay later it like that company is basically is fronting the money to lululemon for the consumer that's correct i'm not an expert on buy now pay later there's companies like affirm and um they're not doing too well in this market either i'm pretty sure i think yeah yeah i have apple that's that's going to do it themselves um but it is a loan so what are the regulations around this let's actually even just talk irl about like payday loans to prevent people from just being like truly exploited when they're in a desperate situation are there are there regulations like are there rules for for payday loans pawn shops i know i think you've mentioned actually pawn shops are pretty tightly regulated and very standardized i'm hoping it's to prevent people from just being exploited out of money when they're in a moment when they're like really desperate yeah i mean definitely i think that's why banks don't make small dollar short-term loans because they're not profitable for banks so there there are regulations for payday loans and pawn shops it's all state by state like in our pawn shops we were governed by the occ the office of consumer credit compliance something like that and yeah each state has their own regulations on how high rates can be what like what types of collateral stolen goods all that stuff it's it's heavily regulated i'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's zero regulation for this in in our digital world do you you can correct me if i'm wrong on that but like do you all take steps to make sure it's not a stolen board ape for example that you're getting a loan against so so everything's on the chain right so we can look at the chain and verify that it's the correct asset as part of the correct collection um if it is stolen it it'll show up we do use um kyt so we don't do it kyc on the platform we are a d5 protocol but we do do know your transaction um so we check we scrub users wallets that that are on the platform to see if they've gone through a mixer or if they're blacklisted um but that's one way we filter the platform you mentioned niftify and some of these other protocols and platforms earlier it strikes me that the the service offering is one that ultimately can be replicated many times and i want to maybe stay short of calling it like a commodity or a commoditized type of service but but maybe it it should go as far as that how do you think about maintaining a competitive advantage and you know doing this when there could be a ton that crop up a ton of protocols yeah it's a good question i mean we built open source code anybody can fork our contracts and build their own back-end ui do the same thing we're doing i think it's very hard to do that especially with with all the work that goes into the infrastructure that that goes into building an application a d app um but basically our edge is our our brand so arcade is a consumer application uh we have a brand name around it we have marketing we do pr um users are starting to trust that brand as sort of a category leader in nft loans um so there's different things we can do also to sort of build a moat one of which is providing utility to all the assets that are in our escrow so like users still being able to access token gated discords or alpha chats and also claim air drops and and anything that that that gets dropped to that nft i'm obviously like presenting some of the skeptical cases here and some of the you know ways that this all this stuff makes me nervous but can you explain really on a macro level the importance of providing this kind of liquidity and and how you think this feeds into just the broader ecosystem and the future of the digital ecosystem yeah i think that um so today there's like 15 to 20 billion probably less now because because everything drops so probably 10 to 15 billion of lendable nfts that lenders are comfortable lending against um i think we at rk think of nft as a as an underlying technology it's at the end of the day it's a token standard and what can that token standard capture and value well a lot of things online could be digital ip it could be music it could be ticketing it could be digital land financial uh nfts like uniswap lp tokens um so when you think of this online economy and the ownable internet um it's gonna be massive i think jpmorgan is is has a quote that's estimated like a trillion dollar in yearly revenues uh for the metaverse economy so when you think of nfts as a technology that's capturing all of this digital native ip um a good portion of those assets will go towards loans so it's really like a new asset class being developed and that's why we're seeing lenders like nexo and genesis and um everybody building a marketplace because it truly is a new asset class that um is starting to emerge and the the importance of being able to inject liquidity into it like you can any sort of like irl market is that just it's internet you see it just kind of as an inevitability so y'all get there first is that sort of how you view it yeah i mean i think it's a simple product it's like stake your nft and get a loan on it um but it's it's it's it's first mover advantage um you know you have protocols like ave and compound and urine that were really born in the last bear market um well they have brands that users trust now and they don't you know they're okay sticking money in their protocol so um if we get users and we show volume um we're also a non-anon team so we're all docs we're us-based which i don't think matters but i think we're building a lot of goodwill with our community and so continuing to build out features to provide enable access to liquidity is something that we're trying to do and and you joke that you in the bear market feel a little bit more like a pawn shop but realistically probably not still not a full uh fully analog or whatever the the phrase would be there do you see down the line that this truly will look like a pawn shop and as well as servicing the high-end art lending market or do you think those two things um decoupled from each other so again if i have a few oceans i can get that two percent interest loan and this will be exclusively a pawn shop how do you see that play out yeah i think when when the market matures um and we see lower value assets come on chain maybe gaming assets that are that are being minted on l2s or other chains like solana that have lower transaction costs um i think we do start to see these lower value assets where people use use the use loans as a way to get money out of the system and into real life but right now it's these these high value nfts are digital like luxury goods i i look at the collections as um digital country club so if you want to join the country club with like-minded people you buy the nft and being able to leverage that asset for liquidity is important just because there's a lot of money tied up in these things so it just it makes sense to be able to enable a lot of that liquidity to happen you mentioned your community uh do you have like a discord like do you have you set yourself up like any number of these protocols and all that and you all chat in a discord somewhere et cetera yeah that's one of our channels uh we have a discord i think there's four 000 members in it we have twitter it was another one of our onboarding channels um but uh yeah anybody can sign on to the app so and what is their tie to y'all do you have a a token are you like one of these who are like we're going to move to being a decentralized protocol someday or or why are folks hanging on your discord i guess is the question they're trying to find lenders um they have questions about the app the way the protocol works support tickets things like that so just a way to educate the community and and provide uh somewhere they can speak to other users of the protocol so no token at the moment for for no just product market fit any plans for a token possibly but not right now what are you thinking about for the future and have your plans changed since the bear market hit i think everybody has sort of had to readjust their strategy their hiring needs um i think that conversations even from two weeks ago are widely different with like investors and and and in terms of roadmap i think these protocols will now be focusing on revenue instead of um generating a token that subsidizes usage you're going to see protocols that really go after real retail usage and institutional usage without the need for a token to incentivize is this your way to like casually be like we got that from the beginning we were focused on revenue where is that uh so i think we were always sort of thinking about the protocol as a way to monetize whether that monetization goes back to the community with a token is yet to be seen but investors and um really anybody building a protocol is going to have to focus on revenue or they're just going to die out or they're going to get acquired before the whole market turned around i think that the focus was on loan volume growing loan volume growing users but now it's the conversation is really about um providing decentralized access to our protocol but also monetizing it um from a team perspective i'm assuming y'all monetize simply by taking a cut of of these transactions that go on on the platform are there other ways you're monetizing as well right now it's just um we the protocol takes an origination fee that's 50 bips so half a percent on the principal value you mentioned institutional folks coming in earlier and i'm curious about institutional uses on your your platform but you also said something to me previously that i thought was interesting around institutions and maybe feeling more comfortable with this kind of a format than these like automated market makers we see in other d5 protocols because this is easier to kyc you can again this peer-to-peer thing is easier than just like pools of liquidity i don't know if i'm getting that exactly right but i would love to hear you speak a little bit more on that yeah so you have protocols like maple and trufi that work with institutional capital [Music] i think on undercollateralized loans they do kyc because these institutions that provide capital they're required um from their compliance teams to to do kyc can you name like give us give us give some examples of like who would be institutions coming in here in in this case um so someone like a genesis would do kyc um uh someone like a blockfi would do kyc someone like a bitco all these guys are are heavily regulated so they need to provide some some assurances that the capital and the the money they're lending out is not going to to fund anything illicit do you see like jp morgan's getting into this like truly like the mainstream the most buttoned up or not feeling like they have to be the most buttoned up getting into the space eventually yeah well i think i think the ones that understand art lending are getting into it are are looking at it like we were speaking to um this fellow that was uh at bank of america um he had a 10 billion book against fine arts so he worked with all the big collectors and he was very interested in what we're doing from a perspective of one data but also um uh making loans on like creative works would he want to partner with you all or buy you up or is he just trying to figure it out so he can go replicate a similar system at jpmorgan or at bank of america i think they're just trying to figure out what the heck's happening like they want to be able to be ready for when it does sort of hit mainstream and and these banks can't ignore it anymore in terms of the infrastructure and the amount of money that's being settled on these smart contracts so they're very interested from that perspective you said they're interested about the data say a little bit more about that yeah so um like take sothebys for example they're they're one of the major art auction houses um they do auctions but they also have a lending book that they themselves lend against this art um so being able to have the correct data in terms of how we price the assets uh where it comes from who's the creator a lot of that stuff they don't they don't have um yeah there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the d5 exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect po-apps nfts and use it for all my default things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger treasure keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 i want to talk broadly about where you're seeing arcade go uh one thing i know i've heard you mentioned in the past is becoming lenders yourselves and and being sort of principal lenders is that still on your radar is something arcade would like to do i think that's always going to be on our radar um a lot of our team has backgrounds and traffic lending our cto john terzis was the first employee at blockfi um actually so he knows very well how they sort of bootstrapped early days of their lending marketplace um i think that uh we'll start to see more institutional capital coming in because this is a new asset class with a new source of yield that's a little bit somewhat uncorrelated from the rest of kryptos it's kind of interesting um so i think as the universe of nfts expand um and uh nfts start gobbling up a bunch of value that uh yeah a lot of these lenders will be interested well but you specifically like is arcade interested in becoming like the person who's giving but not the person but the in the entity that's giving these loans i think we were um before this this crash we're not looking at it too close anymore um mainly because if we want to become principal lenders we have to take out or we have to take on a debt facility ourselves and so we have spoken to a few like credit funds that specifically lend to alternative asset classes guys like us that want to lend out but um with the recent downturn and sort of everybody being risk on right now tightening up their parameters i don't think that's going to happen just yet but uh yeah we're always you know wanting to participate in our own marketplace would it make sense at any point to have a component of this that's like an amm that's not peer-to-peer but that is like a pool of liquidity that folks can draw from or does that not map to this business model yeah definitely i i think you have projects like jpeg and bendau that are peer to pool so they have a resting uh pool of liquidity that borrows can come and just take take right away instantly uh we have a different approach that we built for our v2 protocol that that allows for instant liquidity but um doesn't need oracle's pricing oracles doesn't need auto liquidations you can still work with our peter peer model and it basically allows lenders to sign bids across any collection on chain so say i'm a lender and i go to arcade marketplace and i say i want to lend 100 eth against any punk or against any basee and so i signed that message and then a borrower on the other side that has those assets can come and look at those bids and accept which one they want so what is on the horizon not thinking about doing becoming like loan originators for the time being what's what's up coming yeah so i can't reveal our entire strategy right why even bother coming on but uh definitely building out more more loan features we want to become the the category leader the the premier place for nft loans in a peer-to-peer fashion so you can think of different extensions to that marketplace which is maybe like a buy sell market different features like one click buy and borrow mortgaging and nft buy now pay later a lot of these financial primitives built into a buy sell market buying open later is fascinating again all of this stuff feels like it's adjacent to like things that feel like a little bit icky you don't feel that i used to make payday loans so i but i i mean i i think that these are all finance games that happen in real life and all of everything that happens in real life is going to happen on chain as well i get it like obviously if folks need access to capital you're providing them access to capital and fundamentally that's both people are agreeing to this both parties want this so it is that that you know it's great that we have folks giving payday loans you know it's it's a it's a tricky area so i totally understand um you i think i've heard you or your co-founder or folks in previous interviews talk about just expanding the pool of assets that folks can get loans off of even insofar as maybe expanding out of the ecosystem or expanding to like layer two assets or solana or other chains which i don't think you support right now not yet so i'd love to understand when that might come in and i think i i heard somebody somebody on your team say it maybe even been you um that some of it was pegged to like are they offered on openc and we've now seen solana nfts on openc and i think immutablex has announced they'll have their assets on openc what are you looking for to start integrating those assets and and when do you think that might be yeah i think i think we base demand based off um lender appetite so whatever lenders are willing to lend against uh will support it doesn't make sense to support every collection because uh deals are not going to get done so we're only focusing on really the high high value sort of long tail assets for right now i think you have chains like solana that are starting to really pick up in terms of being an nft chain because you have lower transaction costs um different capabilities so even like i saw today magic eden i think the biggest marketplace on solana just rolls around just raised like 130 million yeah in this market that that's massive um and they're gaining traction like real traction i think well i don't know if it's all real traction or if it's any you know bit of wash trading i'm not sure but um you know greylock invested in them just now it's kind of kind of interesting that is interesting see so so lana would be the first one you'd be looking at no no immediate timeline on that solana no and it could be a scenario where we acquire uh maybe a team that's that's that that has solana experience because it's a completely different chain engineering um also looking at l2s like arbitrom and um polygon i think we start to see like when we're talking about game fi and gaming assets i think a lot of those will be uh issued on l2s um so being able to support those chains means lower value assets means you know more more transactions you mentioned the the magic eden y'all closed your last round in december january territory yeah at the pico top i was gonna like is that nerve-wracking are you like our valuation is no huge and now it's a bear market how does that play no i mean i i don't think our valuation is public but it it wasn't crazy um we we raised a seed round in april 2021 uh out of 15 million valuations so it much different than you know pre-product pre-revenue raising 100 million valuation um so no i think we're in a good spot uh we have 22 full-time on the team we've got good runway um an ambitious road map so yeah so it feels good it feels like all right we got we got money when we could when people it was easier to get money but it didn't screw us in terms of yeah being too over hyped we maximized i think what what we could have done but it we didn't um shoot ourselves for the next round so i think i think we're in a good spot you mentioned earlier sort of staying decentralized can you explain obviously you don't have a token you have sort of this like collective ownership piece per se what where does the decentralization play in so the the decentralization is in the smart contracts um so we don't take custody of the nfts when they're in escrow it's the trustless piece correct yeah so when you're using the protocol you're you're you don't have to trust you can verify because it's on chain um so that's that's what's decentralized the governance of the protocol and how it gets built um is not as decentralized yet um that's why we see protocols like dydx that move to a dow model but once they really have traction and a good product built i think it's a lot harder to build products when you're in a dow it takes some level of leadership and top-down management at times to build really great products so i think that's where you know centralized teams have an advantage over over dao specifically but uh we are building web3 we're building community-owned protocols eventually so i think we will look to decentralize the whole thing does the community ask for that like are you getting constantly told like when collective governance or whatever not yet no i i think i think our niche our our little sub market is so nascent and new um people actually like that they they know who the team is on the other side and they can talk to somebody and walk them through start using using web3 and smart contracts i want to close though maybe additional questions will come up with a little bit of the the pawn shop experience what do you feel like you most learned from that that you've taken into your role now that's a good one um i think i learned a lot so i was working closely with my dad uh right after college for six years in the pawn shops my grandpa started one of the first pawn shops in texas in 1947 so i was a third generation pawn broker i spent a lot of time behind the desk working making loans on diamonds on rolex's on purses xboxes playstations kind of everything under this under the sun that that didn't eat we didn't take things that didn't eat i mean that that did eat we don't it's expensive to feed live things wait so that's like a thing we don't take that okay i know but that's a thing that uh like you have to specify that because people will come in with like pets i'm sure people some somebody has pawned a chicken before or something like that i but not us if you could eat it or it could eat you that was a hard roll got it right um and and like usually in the pawn shop you say um if somebody bought it once somebody will buy it again that's not true in nfts um oh interesting um yeah so that makes sense so yeah and also just about consumer habits um uh you know i spent six years making small dollar short-term loans against cars um against pretty much you know anything that that somebody else would buy um in the vent of a default so so i think that's really interesting that if somebody bought it before they'd buy it again because you're talking about super mature established markets right where it's a diamond and that's been worth something for x number of centuries at this point so you know there's always going to be a market for diamonds and at this point xbox probably same deal until gaming consoles become in our eyeglasses or whatever um how long do you think it takes for the digital asset market to mature to the point where that's true in in this market in the digital market as well as it is in that i think i think we're three to five years off from a it's not that long right i think it's going to happen fast um the idea of of scarce digital money is is like bitcoin and ethereum um the idea of scarce digital goods and collectibles um i think uh if you can understand digitized scarce money you can understand digital scarce collectibles also did you loan against art at the pawn shop or that's again reserved for highbrow something or other i don't know yeah i mean there's like high-class pawn shops that lend against um like academy awards or like a golden globe or 25 000 purses or five carat diamonds that are worth 10 million um we did uh some art pieces like we did an old newspaper from like i think um abraham lincoln days um but like vintage items like that that are that are you know provably scarce and in that scenario so you're out there up front on the cash register like you're having to determine a price and evaluation for something like on-site is it just you like you don't have your team of data scientists experts in the back calculating it based on like historical average like how do you i mean like like ebay helps amazon helps you can price anything just by looking at it on the internet see what it's going is that what you're doing they bring it in and you're like pulling things up on the computer at the cash register being like pretty much yeah um you start to see the same things come into the pawn shop um and you know what to learn you know you know what to lend against um but yeah are your parents still is your dad still in the pawn shop business so he sold the business it got acquired by a larger chain in 2016. is he like excited about what you're doing is he like oh he's ecstatic yeah he's like you're continuing the family legacy in the new modern era exactly he's like let me i want to be an advisor i i know this space like i'm i'm a pawn broker um he also wants me to talk to all the pawn shops because he thinks that's very relevant because we're up the pawn protocol i don't think it's real it's not relevant yet i think there's some things we can do with like uh tokenizing notes low notes um getting that on chain but uh it's very very different explain that like say a pawn shop so pawn shop makes loans and they have a pawn note that they that they get in return that the borrower signs um so maybe you can imagine a world where loan notes get tokenized to allow anyone in the world to invest in pond loans oh wow so you're no longer limited by geography right you can actually just say by needing a pawn license so i could just say i'm looking upon this thing and i'm trying to summarize this yeah it's not well thought out but just like i could put an image i'm trying to figure out how you verify it right but in theory you would get it verified in person at a physical store that does have a geo location but it could be open to right anyone globally who could then loan against it right pawn shops themselves though that's not peer-to-peer right that the pawn shop itself has a store of cash that it's loading it is originating yeah appear to pool correct right so the pawn shop itself has the pool right which is what you all don't do well this is fascinating is there anything i've missed that i need to better understand or the audience needs to better understand about arcade and or like this market generally its place in this whole macro picture no i think we i think we touched on a lot i think that um the the very interesting thing here to me is that we have institutional capital that are using web3 rails um right now and but that institutional capital is very web three institute like gemini is a is a product of web three block fi is a product of web three so are you talking about them are you talking about you know your bank of america like like take 3ac blowing up last week for example so 3ac borrows money from all the other marketplaces and and market makers and desks so they borrow from blockfi they borrow from bitcoin nexo i don't know if those guys are taking collateral when they lend that money out um well they're clearly wildly under like collateralized right but we don't even know sure and so they're signing term sheets in the back room that that it's not transparent the market doesn't know about so that's like the beauty and proves the use case of smart contracts and d5 is that the blockchain is literally the term sheet it's all out there it's transparent so i of course agree it's like cfi it's centralized finance so the fact that celsius can freeze withdrawals is not web3 in the sense of decentralized trustless permissionless like it's trustful and you and they were a bad bet to trust as it turns out right that's what you mean yes okay so institutions in the sense that it's like centralized players even though they're sort of born out of crypto right because most of d5 in the last few years has been retail money um degenerates that are using protocols that haven't been audited but i think we're starting to see a real use case for using web3 rails um with like non-native crypto capital coming in also my final question is about the name arcade how did you come up with this why did you name it arcade yeah so um we changed the name we were originally pawn um dot phi so we bought that domain in like 2020 um wanted to tie to the pawn shop so obviously he named it pawn.phi but there was like two or three other pawnfis protocols that that popped up i think um that had had raised money or did a token sale so we knew we had to differentiate um and my co-founder rob maciello is actually the one that came up with the name arcade um at the time we had built a minting contract um that we were calling internally liquid mint that was on a bonding curve um and so rob was thinking if we had this minting contract and we had a marketplace maybe a good name would be arcade because of the arc representing the bonding curve so we didn't end up even using or we haven't used that contract yet but when you think about arcade and you think about putting a token into a machine it really makes sense to have it be a crypto marketplace okay so i thought it was like a little bit gamified a little bit getting into like yeah it's all a game i think i think the name pawn.phi limited us to just like loans and and and a lot of our investors when we were pitching the idea was like why is the name pawn that's like a negative connotation and i was i was personally offended but um uh yeah so we ended up changing it i think it was a good good feedback on the name change um but yeah all credit to my my co-founder on that one awesome well thank you so much gabe for joining me always fun to do an in-person interview so i really appreciate you coming by and i am fascinated by how all these financial primitives will play out in this space for better and for worse again a lot of it makes me nervous but i also understand a lot of it provides tremendous value to people so it's it's a mixed bag but uh really really grateful to you yeah thanks for having me on and hearing me out and asking uh good questions [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this
