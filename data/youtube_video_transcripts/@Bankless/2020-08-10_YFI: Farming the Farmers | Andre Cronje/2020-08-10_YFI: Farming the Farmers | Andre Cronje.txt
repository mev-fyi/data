[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we are here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today just fantastic ryan it came out of an inter interview with andre cronier the creator of the why earn protocol and the wifey token uh some people may know this token as the yfi token the yiffy token the wi-fi token uh apparently according to andre it's the wifey token and this protocol uh yearn just kind of came out of nowhere and exploded into the defy ecosystem and got everyone really really excited specifically with about how the token came to be how the protocol came to be and also the fact that the creator andre allows the token to govern his life and so that is how andre came to be on the bankless podcast we submitted a proposal to the uh why earn governance page that asked for uh opinions as to whether or not andre should come on the bankless podcast of course it passed with flying colors at 95 and so here we are recording with andre cronier creator of the urine protocol so he was compelled to come on the podcast in his words he had no choice and you know as we were interviewing andre i was kind of thinking like what should the what should the episode title name be for this in fact like what is andre he you know he calls himself just an ordinary defy dev but he's almost like this king of yield farmers because he's he's raised both this group of money robot robots to do yield farming out of all the defy opportunities that are out there and he's also created a a cohort a group of other yield farmers that are writing strategies for this why earn protocol thing it's incredibly fascinating the the group that he's built and the capability that he's built out um this is probably one of the most effective yield farming technologies and yield farming strategies that's out there while interviewing andre i'm reminded of that that old uh comic i can't remember who who made it but it was an engineer that you know made us wrote a script worked his ass off for 36 hours to write a script so that he could automate his job for the rest of his life and so he goes into work and just like scrolls through reddit and doesn't do his job because he made a script that did his job for him and to to make that metaphor concrete that job is yield farming and the script is the urine protocol and and so we kind of go in to andre as to like what he was doing that you know spun up the wiring protocol like first first he was using uh using these various uh protocols to earn interest on his stable coins and then he had to update it to add a new protocol and then liquidity mining came out and so all of these technologies stacked on top of each other and so he finally came out with the urine protocol which is this thing that automates everything together all at once so that he doesn't have to do any more work uh unfortunately he's super busy and that's kind of what we got into the episode a little bit because uh this turns out this is this turned into an absolute uh cannonball of a protocol into the defy ecosystem and so we kind of we go through uh the protocol step by step with andre to get him to explain it to us so we can understand it so we can pass that knowledge on to the bankless nation absolutely the one thing i was left with with this interview is that andre really cares a lot about defy and he really cares deeply about defy users particularly people like him the liquidity providers as he calls them and i think in this in this conversation you're going to hear a lot of acronyms thrown around things like lps andre says often that means liquidity providers flash loans for instance you know that's a split second sort of loan that happens in a block within the protocol you can hear all sorts of different asset names so we get pretty deep into defy geek talk in this episode i think if you have hung with us for the previous 24 episodes you should be able to to keep up but we do try to take some pauses and explain things throughout the interview and summarize things so i think listeners will be able to to keep up with things but we will include a few other resources in the show notes with some definitions and prior episodes that you can listen to yeah i've gone through a number of different attempts to fully comprehend uh yiffi and and yearn and it's just it's so it really stretches my capacity to be able to understand these things as a listener if you are listening to this and you don't really get it the first time around like don't blame yourself this this is complicated and and why andre has built is one of the most uh integrated and composable applications which makes it really requires a ton of prerequisite knowledge and so this is this is like d501 level content that that we go through and so even i had a hard time keeping up so don't don't stress about that yeah totally and you know what you just did there you called it david instead of wifey hang me up see there you go so yiffi wifey same product same token name for the wire and protocol but that's the kind of thing these these terms you'll hear throughout this episode it is a fantastic episode for you advanced folks and i do think beginners will be able to to keep up as well uh we should get right into it but first let's talk about our sponsors the first sponsor i want to tell you about is ave ave is a defy protocol that you absolutely have to check out what can you do with it you can lend you can borrow banklessly all on ethereum so you could do things like lend die to the protocol it will magically transform that die into an interest bearing die account not just die all sorts of crypto assets on ethereum you can also borrow against it um ave has been climbing up the leaderboard as well and they've recently released avonomics which is their token economics upgrade you can read more about it we will include a link in the show notes so avenomics grants key decision making to ave token holders it creates more safety and economic incentives to reward protocol growth one of the coolest things is it actually introduces a safety module so there is staked ave becomes a collateral of last resort you can find out about ave avonomics start using the protocol at ave.com that's aave.com for those of you that have been transacting on ethereum you've noticed that the gas prices have just been insanely high you know 60 grey on a good day and sometimes all the way up to a hundred way which is really reducing the amount of activities that is really feasible to be able to do on ethereum this is where our newest sponsor loopring comes in loopering is a zk roll up scaling protocol for ethereum for both trading and for payments zk roll ups that stands for zero knowledge rollups it's basically cryptographic magic it allows you to combine activity and transactions into one single bit of information which means that massive amounts of transactions can be bundled into a very small chunk of information which reduces the gas per transaction at loopering.io you can find a zk rollups based exchange and also a payment mechanism all with the same security guarantees of the ethereum l1 blockchain which is really important so loopering and zk rollups allows you to scale up transactions tradings payments into thousands and thousands of transactions per second but with the same security guarantees of the main ethereum blockchain which is just incredible in september loopring is releasing the loop ring wallet this will be a mobile smart contract wallet with zk roll ups tucked in natively i'm really excited for how this is going to impact the adoption of ethereum the rest of the world will be able to experience venmo type transactions but with the same amount of trustlessness and security of the decentralized future ahead of us so if you're a trader that's being eaten alive by gas fees visit loopering.io to get onboarded into ethereum's cheapest and fastest exchange all it requires is an ethereum address and you can trade on a high performance order book completely gas free and transferring ether and erc20 tokens on the platform is completely free if you visit loopering.io enter the code bankless in order to get the highest vip tier for six months so check that out there's a link in the show notes visit loopring.io enter code bankless all right guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with andre cronier [Music] bankless nation we are incredibly excited about our next guest this is a first i think first in crypto history first in podcast history maybe we have a guest who is on the bankless podcast by way of token vote and we're going to explain what that means in just a moment want to introduce you to andre cronier you may know him from the wyrn protocol or the wifey token which has been going crazy for the last month or so but he'd introduce himself as just another d5 dev andre how are you doing today sir uh you want an honest answer or you want to polite answer so we continue this quote you know what let's see the honest answer because that's how we roll on the bankless podcast honest answers only oh yeah honest answers earlier well then i'm kind of like i haven't really slept in a few days and i um i i there's everything's just a blur at this point there's just so much going on um yeah i don't know i'll i'll probably be close to tapping out in a in a few days and then i'll take it from there again is this all because of stuff that's going on with the urine protocol yeah yeah there's just too much happening and um like it's it's it's gotten too much traction to the point where where i i don't have the support infrastructure to keep up with it so so it's murdering me like um there's there there there is such a thing as too big too fast okay uh tell us a little bit more about that like what what grew too big too fast and what is sucking up all of your attention and energy well it's it's expectation management mostly you know because like like the the building part that's fine like that that i do i love building i'm going to keep building i'm going to enjoy building but but there's so much extra onus now you know there's there's there's a lot more interaction required of me on like the the social media side like i i have so many inbound requests i'm like i i don't want to be that guy that doesn't respond so i still try and respond to each person that contacts me um there's there's sort of the governance stuff i have to jump in every so often because that's just they i i don't know it's it's it's turning into a little bit of a circle jerk on that side um there's just you know and and and ever since that's that's that's why i was i was very apprehensive about i i i knew it was going to happen um i was worried about the token having a a price component because as soon as that as a price component people's mentalities change and and i've noticed this in the governance forums and in in the communication people have with me because the the the the people that farmed it they're they're chill um and and they're some of the strongest supporters and they're actually quite actively engaged and they're trying to to benefit the the ecosystem the people that bought it they they feel they're owed something um all of a sudden there's there's a a responsibility towards them um and like like there's a lot of negativity on that side that that that drags me down quite a bit um so so yeah it's just i'm trying to keep up with the pace is is is definitely um is definitely gearing me so andre yeah i think what you're saying is it sounds like what you're saying is it's more it's not the building that's tiring you out right that maybe maybe maybe you get energy from that i'm not sure but it's more it's more the social side that's really uh exhausting you and tiring you out and now with the launch of the wifey token and governance and the expectations around that it sounds like the social aspect of things has just accelerated to a degree that is frankly exhausting but you've always been someone to uh dampen expectations right so like famously uh go to your twitter profile right now go to andre's twitter profile right now guys here's what it says in in in the bio uh i tested broad right you know that's a that's a lower your expectation type of statement it means look guys i'm not doing all of the audits in this thing i'm not like well you know what why don't you explain it like why do you make statements like that why do you make statements when you rolled out the wifey token that this token has zero value um why do you have disclaimers that say things like when i build software i build it for myself if you interact with it use caution there will be bugs uh why do you do that sort of thing so so a big reason why so so so originally when when i i i built out the the first iron um sort of first iteration back in in jan fair by i had gotten my audits i published them and and people flooded in capital and what i realized was people use people use audits like a blanket safety net when when you say it's an audit they think oh okay it's it's fine let's i don't have to do my due diligence i don't have to do my own research i'm just going to throw my money in so a big reason why i emphasize to people that look i i mean in all honesty i do still get audits i just don't publish them when i refuse to publish them because i don't want people to have a sense of of false security it's important to me that when you manage your money that's what you should be doing you should be managing your money now i don't necessarily mean actively i mean most of the urine protocol is there to automate your management but you should at least at a high level know where that money is going and why it is going there i think those are two very important questions to at least answer before you put your money into something and i feel that's that's like a baseline due diligence but if you have a protocol and you start shouting numbers like 100 million tvl 30 apr and you know 12 bit audits then all of a sudden people people don't think about that stuff and they just throw money and i think that is that is more dangerous than me trying to shout at the top of my lungs the stuff is dangerous please be careful i didn't build it for you you're going to lose money and then they actually investigate at that point i have a lot more comfort with them putting their money in it than if they were to just blindly follow because there's a report i published so i i'm seeing a lot of uh contrast between you know a yiffy and white wifey and yearn and uh and why it's so special why people are so excited about it is the way that it was it's genesis how it was created and so many people like it because it wasn't created by like a vc group that funded a team that you know did all the the tied off all the things before they released it right instead wifey was you know kind of put out there put out to ethereum more more or less like using ethereum as like test production uh and then it got into the hands of the community basically instantly and that's why people love it so much but that's also what i'm hearing from you is kind of a big detriment where like there's not a team that got venture capital to you know help support you andre like the ceo or the leader or whatever one title you would theoretically bestow yourself like you are uh the kind of there's a lot of weight on one single individual who kind of just built out this protocol just for himself and the beautiful thing about it is that you know you turned over the king the the keys to the community but then the community is trying to like have things both ways where they're like they love that it's genesis and they love that you donated this this project to the greater ethereum ecosystem and they love that the vc backing never was there but also at the same time they're they're they wish there was this vc backed team that had like these salaries that could go and do all these things how do you see that juxtaposition kind of like playing out in in your experiences uh uh so so first things first i agree 100 with what you just said um i as a little bit i mean i i also proposed that out of necessity but also proposed as a little bit of a social experiment because i was curious so so so the platform generates its own rewards and fee systems um and and now that it's a very positive um market cycle the the fees are actually high enough to cover like audits server expenses you know all of those things i mean it's it's it's not hard to run but but it is there so i propose look instead of any further issuance of the token because i'm i'm actually quite against any further issuance um i i don't believe in liquidity mining at all so instead of any further issuance let's use the reward systems and let's take expenses out of that uh and it's it's if you want to have a read on the forum the the general consensus it's a good idea but dividends should flow to token holders so so everyone says there should be like a minimum cap so 5 or 10 or whatever and everything else should go to the token holders now now i as as a social experiment i find that very interesting because again i did not sell this token to anyone like i i was very adamant if you if you gained this token be sure you earned it without spending any money other than gas costs um but the people that bought it they feel they bought it for a reason and that reason is future revenue from the protocol versus the ones that formed it that were most likely already using the protocol and that's why i did pool one as a the y curve token because that means you're already using the protocol and i want people using the protocol to be governing the protocol as a logical sort of next step um they're they're the stronger supporters um but again like like i um the best way i see this playing out um and kind of what i was expecting but i guess it's i don't know maybe it'll still fulfill or not for full but but the the price has to decline to the point where it's again only in the hands of the people that actually want to govern the protocol and not in the hands of the people that bought it with the idea of future revenue so so so i think it's a lot about um it's a lot about the the intent with which people gained access to the token um and and there's you you can see it in the voting structure as well because the the the votes are are more often than not either not quorum or or last minute flips and and it's often quite a big difference between you know the the the original miners let's call them liquidity providers and the the token purchasers so so so there's a definite conflict between those two and um i i actually um last year or the year before i i need to go check but but i published a few articles about this specifically where where you you you have this conflict between between a token's purpose and an investor's value so so so even if we look at ethereum right if we look at ethereum ethereums there's a lot of ideologies so i'm not going to go into all of them ethereum's money et cetera at its base ethereum is gas and it's meant to be paid for computational execution now now there's a certain equilibrium there between how much does it cost the network as a collective of miners in the amount of electricity they're spending to execute that instruction and thus secure it and how much are they being rewarded in financial value for that now at equilibrium it should be it should the value of the token should be slightly more than the cost of their electricity but now if you add speculators into the equation they're not using the token so it's not cycling between these two so all of a sudden you're removing supply out of the equation and at the same time this this this ban keeps increasing because it's not circulating you're moving more and more and more supply demands supply side crisis and you end up with a token that increases to the point where where the users who are supposed to be paying for this execution no longer want to pay for this execution because it's too expensive miners are still happy they're they're walking away with extra profits but the users don't want to use it anymore so so as soon as you add speculative value to a lot of these tokens you end up destroying the reason they exist and that that only cycles back to its equilibrium point when when its value normally decreases but now at the same time we're in a market where it's predominantly investors and your your product is only as good as your green candles or your red candles so if if you're if your token is going up in value you're you're a wonderful product and you have the most amazing leadership and everything is wonderful if that thing starts going down you're a scam and you lied and and this this insert any random thud you can possibly think of and the second it switches to green again all of a sudden you're the most wonderful project ever so so i'm i'm very worried about that because on the one hand i need that value to significantly decrease for it to have its effective value in the ecosystem but when that happens people start saying the protocol is the platform is  and it doesn't work as intended um and and i'm i'm curious to see how it plays out like i i i have no ideas how this is going to turn out i i in none of my models that i expected to turn out the way it did um but but but right now there is a definite conflict between between governance and speculators that much i can see in the forums this has been so helpful to um to understand sort of how you think about things and i've got some other questions i want to dig into your background a little bit later but um you mentioned so much there one of your points was about you know speculators versus sort of the the users and there being sort of an inherent mismatch there uh in terms of alignment um part of that i wonder maybe we could dig into later is like is there a difference in your mind between the uh the short-term speculator investor and the long-term uh investor right so um that's something we could talk about but but let's let's put that aside for a minute because i'm not sure that everyone listening is actually familiar with some of the things that you just said and sort of the story of wiring and the story of of yfi so we want to set some some context for them for folks who might be new to it new to to what's been going on can we start with maybe the why earn protocol what is the y earn protocol can you do and explain it like i'm 5 for what the critical actually does yeah um the the the very original first iteration i'm i'm just gonna start there of um of wire and back when it was iron um which by the way the the the name swap um nodar from zapper actually recommended the y because then it's you earn instead of i earn which had a much nicer collective idea which which i enjoyed um but very simplistically back then i i i there's a longer background that we can dig into if we want but but i'm just going to start from i i was at x point where i was managing a lot of friends and families money and i i'm not a trader i'm not a speculator i don't understand any of these things i think ta is flipping a coin and good luck which side it's going to land on um so i i had moved almost everything into stable coins but i still wanted to offer people certain amount of of returns because they hadn't trusted their money with me so i started looking at options of putting stable coins to work and at the time there was ave there was fulcrum there was compound there was dydx there was a bunch of different services and i would wake up in the morning and i would see which one's the highest apr and i'd move my funds around and i did this for probably a few days until i finally got annoyed at one moving it around and two having to pay gas fees the whole time so i started thinking look i can automate all of this so the first thing i did was just write a few normalization smart contracts that reads in the different apr numbers from the different systems and that gives me standardized output which i can compare so that at least i don't have to compare them individually and i can just look at the script in the script smart contract will tell me where to send it so that was sort of step one and then step two i started with this concept of having the tokens do it themselves so i wrote the first iteration of the y tokens which y die y usd c y use dt and y t usd and very simplistically they read this normalized apr output and then they see which one it's supposed to be and then they have integrations into all of the downstream sources and depending on what that response is where they're supposed to go they move between one of those um and and i use that as my baseline for for quite a while until i got to the point where i started realizing um number one there's there's no net loss to me opening this up to other people which is fantastic number two the more people that interact with the protocol the the more effective it gets so what i mean by that is every time someone deposits or withdraws it sees if it should rebalance so the higher the frequency of interaction the more it shifts between protocols to maximize its own yield return so by opening it up and allowing other people to pull into the protocol they're getting the highest yield from any of these aggregate sources because it's moving and because there's more people interacting with it it's moving more frequently which means in aggregate it gets a higher api or return than any of the downstream sources um and that was the original that was the original iron now yearn um so so a really a really simplistic concept and a simplistic idea it's it's what it's what lenders do nowadays as well you know you you move your capital to where you get the highest returns just automated them with smart contracts um i don't know if you want to stop there or you want to now continue digging into how the rest of the platform continued expanding a few quick questions there as to the technical details so you said that the tokens move in order to find the best yield can you just go into the details as to how the tokens know where the best yield is and then who pays for that who or what pays for that gas for those tokens to move so so gas is paid during interaction so when i deposit or i withdraw then it checks if it moves that gas is added onto that deposit or that withdrawal so it's basically an unlucky lottery whoever is going to hit the contract when it's time to rebalance is going to be paying that extra amount they were going to be paying some amount of gas anyways right it's kind of just like they're also the the movement of the tokens are kind of just free writing on that transaction correct i mean i mean back then you know gas was what six square so so it wasn't um you'd be paying two bucks instead of you know 1.5 bucks now it's a little bit more significant but the system also works very differently now um so so so the tokens themselves are are the the wide token is really just a think of it as a pool and in this pool you have a bunch of let's take die and you have a bunch of dies so when i deposit i deposit a bunch of die and when i deposit or withdrawal then it asks the apr smart contract for practical purposes think it's oracle i don't like using the terminology oracle specifically because it's not using any off-chain sources it's just normalizing on-chain information for practical purposes let's call it the apr article yeah it asks the oracle where is the highest apr currently and the oracle tells it ave and if it sees ave then it goes okay so now i take this all of this dye i have and i deposit it into obvious now i have a tokens and ava has made i and now i'm i'm sitting with that and i'm earning interest now next depositor comes along and deposits it checks that again it sees oh okay i should be going to compound so it withdraws the dye from ave and by returning its a tokens deposits into the compound and now i have c tokens and that's all it does so every time someone interacts it asks the question where should i go and then it simply withdraws from where it is and it goes to where it's supposed to be so it's like a robot that finds the high highest yield okay so i think that's pretty simple for folks to understand i have one question on that so uh when we talk about reward right like putting on an investor cap we think about risk-adjusted reward risk-adjusted returns right so it seems like the the the money robot the wired money robot is basically you know showing you the highest yield protocols and investing in that but it can't quantify risk is that sort of a blind spot of the protocol in the v1 version yeah so so in the v1 version um i remember we were at about 2 million die and that was just when um bzx had their their their whatever you want to call it black thursday event or or however um and and we managed to pull that out i i told the script to no longer use fulcrum and then it removed fulcrum as an option and then it pulled everything out and we were very very lucky at that point but after that we started looking at things like how much how much tokens is it the downstream source in other words how liquid is the source i'm putting cash into now and it would check how much of that liquidity has moved in x amount of time with a v3 i also wanted to include the phi score i believe it's called um what jordan and them are working on but but i never ended up getting to that v3 because v2 ended up integrating with curve and it just it's not going to get much better in terms of its healed um than where it's currently sitting at so so so it started adding a a few smarter things like it would start looking at at how big is the pool that i'm moving to and and will i affect its apr because when when i first started you know there's this ten twenty thousand dollars in there and that doesn't affect apr when it moves within a few months there was there was two to five million in there so now when it moves to to one of these downstream sources it actually changes the apr from ten percent to five percent so i have to start calculating in okay what what is the apr going to be if i move and only move if it is a net benefit with move plus that and then it would look at how much liquidity is the downstream source in other words is it safe can i still get out um and it would do smaller adjustments so it would see okay i can move half of it here and get this amount of yield in the other half that side and get that amount of yield and an aggregate that's more but but in terms of in terms of intelligent risk uh no such thing exists as data on chain currently so it was largely my own perceived perspective over these protocols risks and their dangers uh i i i'm not sure where defy score is at in terms of their on chain codification i think they have done it as an oracle stream already but i haven't touched it recently unfortunately yeah and so so for folks that aren't uh totally familiar with some of the things you talked about so you know do just so i can kind of understand so what you're talking about is um obviously annualized returns right that's when you when you were saying apr that's annualized returns and the risk modeling that that why earn is taking into account is from two places right now uh or in in the future versions will be maybe in v2 it is which is the liquidity of the underlying protocol which is certainly one measure of risk um not necessarily an intelligent measure of risk but but it does help somewhat and then also there is this uh i don't know agency i don't know what you call them but a project called um uh defy score which is a consensus project that is actually trying to quantify risk um almost like a uh like a morning star i suppose or something in the traditional uh finance world where there's sort of a you know risk quantification of an underlying asset uh and they're trying to score each of these protocols uh and possibly you could you could integrate that but even those two to i guess sources are are fairly primitive i suppose not i don't know if this is a this is a problem for finance right how do we it's not just a problem for d5 it's a problem for finances like how do we quantify risk like humans are really bad at quantifying risk but do you think we can start getting better in d5 about quantifying the risk across various protocols and if so how um i mean like like as a baseline what what do humans consider as low risk versus high risk when it comes to financial things you you'll go to the bank that's been around for longer because they've got the track or record and you'll go to the bank that has more capital because they have less chances of going over so so you know those are sort of the the normal human psyche things we quantify um so i think for a large part that's still very much true in d5 as well because because even in d5 in in in which product do you rather put your capital you know the the one that's the that's the the sf backed vc backed funded 100 million dollar protocol or the non-user that no one knows who they are but they deployed a bunch of smart contracts onto chain i mean right off the bat i can tell you which one i'd feel safer with my money even if that is completely you know just based off of human perception so i don't know i mean i mean if so so my general rule with anything i code is if if i can quantify the steps in a logical way then i can codify the steps in a logical way i i can't i can't in an analytical way tell you how i measure risk so i'm not sure how that would be codified other than a certain member of a certain level of perception list so andre let's pick up the thread with the development of the urine protocol we we left off with talking about how stable coins move around in order to get the best yield in the various d5 protocols but the urine protocol didn't stop there what's the next step in the composition of of urine and wifey so so after after we after i now had this thing where these tokens moved between lenders uh about the same time curve came out with their um stable swap system which now is the curve protocol and the very first pool they launched was the c dye which is the compound dye and cu is dc which is the compound usdc and i started speaking to mitch um and and we we started discussing this idea but okay if you can do these swaps with with these heel tokens could you do them with with the the yield profit switching tokens and we ended up deploying the the y pool which is built off of the the four base layer urine tokens the y die the y usdc the y usdt and the ytusd and we also later launched the b usd pool which is y di y usdt usdc and ybusd yeah binance usd one um so so so this offered another layer on top because we knew that that if you're in curve there's there's a certain level of stability based on the tokens as long as i can manage to keep peg and that allows you to have the the yield maximization with trading fees on top um and when it started it was fantastic because the the volume far outseeded the liquidity so we would have 100 plus days which was phenomenal um as liquidity increased you know we're at less than 10 utilization now so fees don't make up as much as they used to um but but that was basically the pinnacle of yield at that time uh there was there was there was nothing other than centralized services where you could get higher heal than you could in in the y pool um and and that that sort of stayed for for quite a while so so there was a bit of a a lack of new yield opportunities so to stimulate yield opportunities i started looking for things to build that improves yield so one of the first things i started looking at was how do i get people to trade more on curve because the more you trade the higher the fees the higher the fees the better the yield so i started building things like why trade and why leverage we both were just leveraged um stable coin trades why leverage was based off of flash loaning usdc from yeah flash loading usdc from dydx putting that into maker as collateral this is just when they release their usdca vaults minting die off of that selling the die to usdc because die was trading above peg at about 1.02 um returning the flash loan usdc and you get the difference in profit and then when you want to close the vault again it just does the inverse so in other words borrow the the the die close the vault take the usdc cell back to die and then return that if you close it out of profit you have to add in the rest if you close it in profit you get profit on both sides why why trade is the is the leverage system it can go up to a thousand x leverage um on the ui we limit it to a maximum of 250. you can go higher but then we want you to interact with the smart contracts because any higher than 250 and you're liquidated in less than a day so so that's for a lot more experienced people and for the the basic website we only allowed up until 5x because then at least you have a few weeks and months before you get liquidated because your borrowed position and that simplistically lps could provide their y curve token when a trader comes in it unwinds the y curve token into the one of the native assets die usdc tusd or usdt and then it sells it into curve for the opposing asset whichever you want to do so you'll do die to usdc and now you have a short die position and you have a ud usdc amount on the books so this just allowed people to do higher frequency trading i i had closed that down i think around either early june maybe late just before that because i wanted to rework the whole way i did design that and everything while i was busy with that rework i started looking at why swap which is the single-sided amm solution that's that's a lot more technical um so i don't know if we want to go into that because there's quite a lot of detail to unpack around that um but but it's just a way to to to do uni swap basically with just providing a single asset on the one side and having heal the wear systems but but everything i build and everything i designed and the whole urine ecosystem and even the vaults that i have now and the vaults had to design because the healed world just became massively complex in the last two months so it needed a whole new solution but but but everything has a singular goal maximize yield for lps that provide um that provide liquidity into the ecosystem but but i have i have two very fixed rules when it comes to this number one i i don't swap what you put in so if you put in die i'm not going to swap that to t usd and put that into m stable because it's going to get a higher yield i'm going to keep it and die so you might not get the highest possible apr strategy but you will get the highest one for die and the reason for that is i did have a solution back in the day that swapped between the stable coins for the highest one but but i've noticed that most lps aren't long-term lps they're lps for a few days so so they ended up losing more because of slippage than they would actually make in in interest gained so for for purposes of keeping it more simplistic for them i i decided i'm always going to keep it token to token and then the other rule is no experimental systems but that again is based on my own perceived level of risk which you know i i try and do as much due diligence on these platforms where the money goes as possible because any of my solutions my money will be the first one in so i expose myself to the risk of wherever that goes so i'm very i'm very apprehensive about that so so it might also not always be the absolute maximum apr you could get in d5 but it is what i consider to be the the safest apr without having any losses on the original asset you put in hey guys going bankless is a journey and you don't have to do it alone so we're going to pause the interview with andre so we can talk about some of our fantastic banquet sponsors that offer you tools to

jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5x6x 8x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed k we've written articles about this on bank list that we'll include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off all right let's go ahead and get right back into the interview with andre so we can finish up learning about the urine protocol okay andre so let's let's do our best to recap where where we are so far so you first built out this stable coin system that moves stable coins around to access the best yield in the various d5 protocols and that was that's kind of like layer one and then uh curve gets introduced which has the curved tokens the curve stable tokens which kind of do this in a more or less automated way and then you started to stitch that into the urine protocol as well kind of like as a layer two on on top of it right and so and then you ins created these products um from the urine system that uh were are useful products useful building blocks in d5 useful money legos and that they also encourage activity in the curve system because the curve system and the urine system are very are like siblings right they're like stitched together very very tightly um and and we're not done yet right like we still have like another layer to uh perhaps even two layers to go before we're really finished off with the all-encompassing urine system however at this point in time how would you describe in a concise way as possible how would you describe the urine protocol up to this point like what is it what does it do for people at this uh stage in the game it automates healed um that's that's the most apt description i've managed um i i sometimes refer to it as a smart savings account um which i'm not a huge fan of because you know your money is always spendable like like you never lock it up um but but but it's it's it's a yield optimizer that's that's its entire purpose okay now what where's the next stack because at some point in time uh yield farming with uh governance tokens comes into play here are we at that point yet this this is now when comp launched yeah so so when comp launched they they they were very kind to to both destroy and recreate the whole game which was very exciting because it it it gave me um a lot of reinvigoration to to engage and and so so technically this isn't actually completely true so so in after y pool at that time the synthetics team were looking for for something to help their their s usd keep stronger to peg so started working the urine protocol the curve protocol and susd and we launched a new pool which was a meta pool between the y tokens and the susd token and the output token of this the lp token you get for depositing into this pool you could stake in the rewards contract and it's that same rewards contract i used for my wi-fi distribution and that's how i knew about it because back then you would stake the lp token and you would get snx every week and it was it was by far the most profitable strategy of all of the yield strategies so so so technically i stand corrected in saying that that um like like the cycle definitely started because of that hype but but liquidity incentives or liquidity mining started there like that that mentor rewards pool from snx was was was the first of its kind and i think everyone else is just playing off of their playbook but what did happen with the the the comp token it added a new option so so now it was a question of which one is higher healed and and the intricacies of the comp token made it also more interesting because for the first few weeks you ended up borrowing as much bat as possible and then winding a leveraged position so that you could earn as much comp and that's because of the comp distribution model at the time which was based on the size of the the the debt that has accrued on the market and then they changed that model and it changed to to a leveraged position and die um so you would again wind your position like that um and and that had the best ratio and then and then i think next was balancer that came out with mta and i mean shortly after that it was um ah balancer with bell and then it was m-stable with mta and we're still waiting on the curved token to come out and there was another one that i'm missing oh um uma with their y usd so so all of a sudden all of a sudden my my yield system was insufficient because it it no longer was aware of what the best yield strategy was because what the best yield was the definition thereof had now changed a few months before that it was it was um it was which lender provided the highest interest rates and in aggregate which of those could i get while depositing into into synthetics to be a liquidity provider there and get the liquidity incentives but now all of a sudden you started having to do calculations about okay but what is my what is my wound up that position and how much debt am i accruing and what is the token value so what is the financial dollar value of that debt versus the amount of comp i'm getting and the comps dollar value which offsets this interest so so so now there's so many data points that that all of a sudden becomes a lot more tricky to manage and and one thing we know is that price data on chain is a very dangerous thing to use that's a very easy way to get attacked and that's why we need secure oracles the available secure oracles though don't have data for all of the things i just mentioned so so yield farming now all of a sudden was at a point where where where robo advisors could no longer do their job because they could not get sufficient data to do their job and they could no longer predict how to do this job so i started thinking about okay but now i need a model how to crowdsource this information because there's a bunch of us that are constantly in defy and we're constantly hooked in and we we all have sleeping problems and and none of us get more than half an hour sleep every every hour four hours so so so we know what's going on and we know where to be so a large inspiration of why why the token needed to become into existence is to have a a protocol to to to help these these healed farmers be able to make decisions such as what is the best strategy so objectively speaking what is the best heal strategy at this time and then based off of this decision they needed to be able to update which strategy we go to but now now i i have this problem where on the one side you've got people that that know that's the best strategy but they can't necessarily codify the strategies and i need someone who can codify these strategies as well and i needed a way to incentivize them to actually codify these strategies and then of course on the other side there's the lps that still need to provide the liquidity for the strategy and then get the rewards so so that's where that's where the v2 came out and that's that's my new y-volt system where where strategy writers can codify these strategies and if approved and voted in by governance that becomes the defective strategy for the current lp volt and as i mentioned before you'll have one for usdc one for die one for y curve etc strategy writers are incentivized because they get a percentage of additional profit so what i mean by additional profit and this is where the system generates its rewards as well is based interest that the users get and that's to lps and nothing else that's not touched then there is additional things you know there's there's comp there's mta there's bell there's snx there's there's all of these other things in this ecosystem that that has additional value and and off of that additional value that's where their rewards come from so so the strategy writer for argument's sake gets five percent of all of those liquidated rewards that go back to the lps and the governance decision makers they get let's say 10 or whatever governance needs to decide on those numbers the ones i've been using have just been i think uh no i'm going to lie to you now it is 80 10 10. um so so i needed to create this new ecosystem to be able to move fast enough to keep up with what is now happening in this market now i don't necessarily think it's going to last this way very long because i i i do think liquidity mining is a is a negative game and we shouldn't try and incentivize it for too long but while it lasts i need this ecosystem that can manage these heel choices and do it in a way that is not based purely out of analytical data it can get on chain and that is the current that's the the first iteration of why volts i did which was things like the the y usdc and the y curve vault and then as a little bit of a sideline i was doing this delegated vault work with um with ave where they want to do delegated credit so they want to be able to say okay well i'm a i'm a depositor in ave and i have ten thousand dollars worth of of a credit line and i'm going to assign a thousand dollars of that to my to my buddy um so he can then borrow from my vault he can borrow his credit line so the delegated votes were actually a continuation of that idea where i use the original capital and then deploy the underlying best asset for the highest yield strategy and then it ends up being this this whole buyback strategy that benefits the vault and i'm actually really happy with how that turned out it actually turned out much better than i had originally expected um and that's that's sort of the current iteration where we're at so so it it's it's gone from everything happens on june to i need collective information off-chain to be able to to to manage and dictate the system okay so this is brilliant and i hope people are starting to understand the brilliance of what weiner's put to get what why iron has put together what andre has put together but but let me just recap for folks that are getting lost in some of the asset names and that sort of thing like here's the through line so we've been talking on bankless about uh yield right ever since inception the first chapter of yield has been lending and borrowing yield in d5 and then the second chapter which opened up we had a dan elizer on the podcast we'll we'll add a link in the show notes but that chapter um started with the comp token and then yield was supercharged with these governance tokens right and i've i've often joked that like i'm in the space 24 hours a day so is david and we can't keep up with all of the yield farming opportunities i've joked that i need to hire somebody to go deploy my capital to keep up with all of the yield farming opportunities and optimize that so this is what this is the beauty of wiring in andrea's system is that rather than hiring someone in a fund you can hire the wire and money robots andre's money robots that's why people love this because the money robots are really finding the highest most optimized yield farming opportunities in both lending and borrowing and now these governance tokens and what andre just said is the first phase of all of that has been money robots that he wires up and programs himself for his own use but then he makes available to the public but now the next stage of that is to get strategy writers to tweak the money robots and create these new money robots and then sent them with wi-fi tokens wifey tokens um that's what this is that's really what we're talking about guys i hope you see the the through line this is sort of a a way instead of you know hiring the guy to go find all the yield farming opportunities you just hire the robot and everyone kind of crowdsources uh the the the most optimal uh way to do it it's um it's really genius i andre i wanna ask a question here before we get to the wifey tokens themselves and talk a bit more about the the crowdsourced yield farming strategies can you just do a quick recap of what some of the risks are here just like high level so if i'm depositing my funds into you why earn what are the risks like i could lose it all but how how would i lose like what are the protocols that are dependent that urine is dependent on that are are critical to its function uh i mean highly dependent on the strategy so so um i i in if you look at the protocol top level um and you look at what it operates on top of i'd say everything there's there's nothing in d5 that there's nothing in ethereum that it doesn't touch us um if you look at a specific vault in a specific strategy then it's more isolated so you know then it's then it's it might be a balancer pool or it might be a bank or v2 pool or it might be lending and compound so so so so then it's slightly more isolated i mean your your your numbers what your number one biggest risk is is always we i i always start that where where is the money so so if if the the money is sitting in a balancer pool then that is your highest risk point because that's where people see the money and that's where they attack it now luckily and this is why i also only like to use protocols that have you know stood a little bit of a test of time um or are so simplistic that that it is only a smart contract and nothing else can happen um so so so that's normally your number one point but but that's normally also a little bit safer because these are normally large corporations and lots of audits and lots of eyes looking at it and lots of scrutiny which is good your your next layer is is always my code they're as as as much as i i try and make sure as i said my money goes in which means i i i need that for my livelihood but at the same time that's your your technical biggest risk because it's one guy that wrote it while he was sleep deprived it's not a good combination like like that's not that's not where you should be putting your money um so so and and since that can be the the entry and the exit point which means it does the calculations on how much of the underlying asset you get so that's that's a very high danger point because that can be manipulated and i've seen it be manipulated so so definitely a high risk there um you start talking about about lower risk but probability risk stuff so like a a a if if usdt now for example were to add a fee to their token transfer which which they can do because it's in their smart contract a lot of my systems would break and when you deposit you'd actually get back less than what you put in um if if there's a if there's a compiler bug in the version i use um which i'm i'm normally i i have a leniency towards some 5.17 then then that can be exploited in all of my contract systems um if there is a liquidity crisis in one of the the downstream sources and this can happen a lot because remember you're you're you're often in in a lending position which means there's a borrower on the other side and if if something horrible happens and there's a price collapse that's when you want your money out but that's also when most people are borrowing the money and the utilization rate is high which means you can't actually get access to it so so so that's definitely a systematic risk i i like to call it impermanent locks because you know based on the time it can be locked but in in its entire position you you will always have access to it unless it's drained from the underlying position um i've mentioned code vulnerabilities i've mentioned the the asset the the composability is always dangerous i mean any system each time you add a a a building block you're you're exponentially increasing um potential risk and and mismanagement um so with regards to the various d5 protocols that are uh an option to receive yield in urine like there's you know compound balancer and stable like all these different d5 protocols and each one is a risk but with regards to where the funds are currently deposited by urine there's a chance that like something breaks that doesn't actually impact the current uh way that urine is receiving real yield right so like urine could be depositing most of of the funds into a combination of like m stable and balancer and compound breaks and and compound breaking doesn't actually impact urine at that present moment because the funds haven't been deposited there but yeah urine governance needs to remove compound from the uh algorithm correct before something does happen that is that right that is a hundred percent accurate so so so i've been i've been manually managing that since jan fed but again it's based purely on my perception which is a lot nicer if it's you know a crowd-based source decision so but but 100 correct if if there is all of a sudden a a scare that there is high vulnerability somewhere so there's some rumors that something bad is happening at x and it's up to governance to pull those funds as quickly as possible so one other primitive that possibly could be incorporated in this is if we had some sort of defy insurance primitive right yes we could use the composability of d5 to our advantage um nexus mutual any anything popping in mind for that because i'm sure you'd love to incorporate some insurance if it was available and if you could yeah now i've i i actually spoke to to to you from um nexus mutual in this week um they're they're gonna roll it out either i think this week or next um that that it has a a base layer staking system which allows me to take a percentage of deposits at the user's opt-in choice and then it takes that percentage as a as a base layer stake in nexus mutual which then gives them cover on the other side very cool and that would cover them for smart contract technical style hacks is that correct technically no because the way the way nexus mutual works it's it's like like i i i always like to say it's not actually insurance it's more like a binary option so so the people that are the people that are staking funds against a smart contract they're saying they have confidence it's not going to fail the people taking insurance are saying i have confidence it's going to fail but but it's actually just a hedged binary bet but but it's up to it's up to the people staking on that contract to actually decide what they pay out for so so so nexus mutual has paid out for things that were not smart contract tax because they they felt it it it was good to pay those risks out so so they it's it's a lot more about perceived about what happened so so from from the payouts i've seen basically nexus mutual pays out when they feel the the there was nothing the user could have done to prevent it but if there was something the user could have done to prevent it then they don't pay out so so so it's it's less technical and and more what do those stakers vote for when someone submits a claim so andre we've gone through what happens when you deposit stable coins crypto dollars into the urine protocol we've gone through how you've developed this yield maximizing system then we went through how you integrated the yield farming and liquidity mining uh revolution of defy so that the value of the governance tokens being earned or is also integrated into the profit maximizing system now we're at the last layer the the yfi token the wi-fi token this is the the capstone to the whole thing and i in my mind i kind of view this thing as like a it's a structure right and it's building itself and then at the very top of the structure is the yfi token can you explain uh the re the role and reason of the yfi token uh in the urine protocol so so as mentioned with with this new vault structure um there needs to be certain off-chain decisions that need to occur in terms of what is the highest yielding strategy um and and at its at its at its highest level that that is its pure function it is to make those decisions but if you drill it down there's there's a lot of minutiae you know there's there's what percentage goes to the contract creator what percentage goes to the original urine protocol and the people using that system if if if a new token were to be airdropped for whatever reason um what goes to lps and what goes to whomever so so so there's a lot of unknown i want to say and a lot of known which are protocol decisions that that need to occur and and for the longest time i've been making these decisions my whole time but it's it's also getting to a point like like like you mentioned you need to hire someone that's that's capable of of watching this the whole time and being aware of this the whole time and then i'm i'm in that same position so i need to crowdsource that information i i i would like to have a solid eight hours sleep not having to wake up every two hours because there's a new heel farm that popped up and it's only going to last for the next 40 minutes so in those cases it's good to have this ecosystem and and like like i said and it wasn't tongue-in-cheek it was sincere the original reason i distributed this token and i also want to emphasize that it was a token distribution it wasn't a liquidity incentive but the original reason why i distributed this token was to be able to hand off some of these responsibilities so it's not just me taking care of it it's not just me making these decisions it's not just me implementing these strategies and deciding where the capital should go uh that's how your skate that's how you're scaling it basically that's that's how i get to scale the system that's that's how i also get to take a little bit of time off and and i know it's in the hands of people that are also as healed obsessed as i am and and and that's why i distributed to the the three protocols i considered to be where the yield farmers are farming the most healed because i wanted to get it into the hands of people that are as intimately familiar with everything that's going on as i am so as a mental model for for our listeners this is not unlike mkr and mkr governance where you know we call maker dao a dao when and in the name dao we it's a decentralized uh autonomous organization right and so the important thing is like autonomous is a little bit nebulous because maker dow needs concrete like proposals for the dow to vote into the protocol right and so at the end of the day humans with mkr vote in governance proposals you know what collateral to accept what risk parameters to provide them they manually vote in those parameters and that's the same thing that's going on with the yfi the wi-fi token in the urine protocol where somebody is proposing a a strategy and then with yfi holders are accepting or denying that that contract right that's exactly it so so so at its highest level it is is that is its primary function and purpose it is it is to enable people to be able to make those collective decisions on the system and the protocol for for their own greed and the greed of the lps and with the the wifey token it means those two are aligned so unlike how mkr was distributed and unlike how any other defy token has been distributed why uh wifey token was distributed in this very unique way can you kind of go through your thought process and your decision making with how you enabled the the wifey token to be distributed among ethereum i i wanted to distribute that's that's i i needed to distribute a a mechanism whereby people have a voting right to these decisions um thanks to the as mentioned previously the the yield farm with the asusd um i had intimately worked with the the snx rewards contract which was developed by anton from one inch along with um kane from synthetics and and it was a very elegant distribution mechanism so simplistically every week they would they would transfer tokens into the contract and then they would notify the contract that they have transferred tokens into it and then over that week the tokens are distributed to the lps to the people that provide liquidity to the husd pool um so i thought this is the perfect mechanism because the the people using my system are using y curve because y curve is built on top of yarn so these are the people that are the healed hunters and that is why i launched the pool one and that is why i i distributed to there the first time now now people always want to know why what decisions and and and what rationale and i i like i i i think people want to believe i'm smarter than i am when when the the most logical answer is usually the correct one i'm a very strong believer in occam's razor and and the reason i chose 10 000 wasn't some meme it wasn't it wasn't for any purpose it was just i wanted some low number that can represent voting shares you know i didn't want someone to have 1.3 billion voting shares and i also didn't want someone to have you know north point note 4. so so it was just a nice round number that i could use that that when it comes to voting is sufficient um and originally i wanted to do i wanted to do four pools because i actually wanted to incentivize my other products as well why swap and why trade but after the first two pools blew up um i didn't want to incentivize those two because they were they i i consider them higher risk than the rest of the protocols because they haven't withstood the test of time yet and they haven't had much aum and as much much eyes on them so so i decided not to incentivize those two uh because i was worried that the capital goes in is going to attract the wrong type of attention so so i switched that instead to to things like um like balancer and the curve pool again um but but really the the there was no there was no master plan there was no thought out solution it was it was a a accidental and somewhat lucky sequence of events um with a positive outcome but it was really as simplistic as that it was i needed the distribution mechanism for people that use my system and years ten thousand tokens to make decisions on so some people in d5 would argue that this is the fairest launch of any token ever there was no pre-mine no founders reward no vc you know some people are even uh comparing you andrei to the satoshi of d5 which which is kind of funny so but but when you launch this in your opening post you emphasize you couldn't have made it more clear you said we don't we didn't stress it enough this token wifey has zero value don't buy it earn it and yet when i look at the charts it's like wifey is one of the most explosive price charts i've ever seen in crypto so uh it started at three dollars you know kind of at launch and then a week later was up a hundred percent so people don't believe you andre people think it does have value can you explain why a rational actor would pay for wifey tokens no okay why are they do like so so i think what you're saying in that is that these are not rational actors so so so so the one thing i really like um and the advance um the framework guys he was the first one to pick it up which which i i i had it in the back of my mind but but i never really thought about it and it was very interesting because because i i i had always thought about the yearn system from an lp perspective because that's what i am you know i want to put in 100 bucks and i want to see 10 whatever growth over the year and then when i pull that out i want to see 110 bucks and then i'm happy um but at the same time you know now this thing was sitting with with with 100 million plus in capital i mean at its peak i think it was just over the the 600 million dollars which by the way terrified me to no end it's far too much money to put in my contracts don't do that 600 million i mean what that was got to be the top five in the total value lock charts right i i i that that's a different discussion i mean tvl i think is such an absolutely pointless metric for us to use in the space it is insanity sure because like you you can have a billion tvl but no fees and then it's it's it's much less than the guy with a thousand bucks but 50 fees but anyway that's that's a different conversation in terms of pe ratios on systems um but but a lot of these a lot of these vcs and trading firms and things they they started looking at from the perspective of being the controller of this ecosystem because now if you're the controller of this ecosystem all of a sudden you're you're not just this degenerate yield farmer that just wants to maximize your own gains because you're an lp but but but but you're a capital deployer you you have 100 million dollars of capital now that you choose where it gets deployed to and that is also an incredibly powerful leverage tool because now all of a sudden you can start having a very different conversation with you know a a ava or a compound or whatever and you tell them okay but i can deploy this capital to you um can you give us extra incentives so so so so all of a sudden being able to make those choices is basically being able to make the choices of you know one of one of the biggest funds in the decentralized space because that's what urine has ended up becoming one of the biggest funds of deployable capital um and and i it it it was this amazing like like light bulb moment when when he tweeted about it and i read his tweet and i was just like holy hell this guy gets it um so so i sort of understand it from that perspective and i i get it from from the lp because you know his money is in that system and so he wants to have a vote and where it goes because he wants to maximize it otherwise he's going to move it out but but there isn't really an alternative to move it to other than you need to do it yourself because a lot of the guys i speak to on a daily basis even even they when when they want to go away for the weekend they they they they take their funds and they throw it in my vaults because you know they they they know how to farm themselves but when they just want to take a little bit of a break they'd rather have the vaults to it because they know that they don't have to worry about it so so so from the lp there's a reason why i want i want some say in it from the capital deployment there's a reason i'd want to say in it so so i i i guess that is my most logical explanation for why someone would attach a financial value to that kind of control um i still don't get it but but as mentioned like fairly early in the start i i don't understand the speculative side i've never understood why a token really goes up or really goes down other than something to do with green frogs and something with 4chan so so so i i can't fully understand the why um and and i'm not someone that that that bought tokens for speculative reasons other than if i was going to use it so so i'm i'm also probably not the most informed to answer that question but but if i had to look at it from a very from a very governance control perspective i'd i'd i mean i want some of the tokens so that i can at least ensure that it doesn't go to a place that i don't trust right so so i think so um vance you mentioned from framework right they're a they're a fund basically and i believe they announced this week or maybe it's last that they purchased a bunch of wifey tokens and the bankless thesis for some of these governance tokens is basically sort of along the lines of what you said but you know it's it's sort of a next step too so once you have tokens once you have governance over the protocol that gives you voting rights that gives you the ability to vote in cash flows potentially and convert a mere governance token to a capital asset essentially i think that's along the lines possibly of what vc groups like uh investors like vance are thinking does that sound plausible to you i i do not have enough knowledge or information about like like that world um so so i i can't make an informed decision there unfortunately so i'm gonna hammer on this one more time and see just to see if i i can get something out of you andre uh the way i evaluate with the wifey token is that it it's a great way to um earn interest on your crypto dollars on your stable coins and at the same time it's also a great way to responsibly earn governance protocols and so why er why earn is not only a you know a crypto dollar yield farmer but it's also a governance token yield farmer right and so it seems to me that it kind of fits like this barbell strategy of investing where like you have your you know your non-speculative stable coins and you earn an interest on that but at the same time yearn is also earning the governance tokens of other protocols right and so the wifey value capture system has baked into it like two upsides it's the interest it's the uh earnings on the stable coins and then it's also the earnings on the governance protocols uh so like it's a the yfi is a governance token that earns you governance tokens over any defy protocol ecosystems governance token and so like you know insert your next d5 protocol here compound balancer metastable curve anybody that has like a governance token that governs over the cash flows the yearn and and yfi token is a system for accruing those tokens and so it's like a meta governance token accrual system um does that did i go wrong with that is there something wrong with that analysis or is that generally on the right track so so i don't want to admit that that's on the right track because then there is a a definable financial value you can attach to it and i really don't want people to do that like like stop attaching financial value to the dumb token just use it for governance just make protocol decisions people we'll see but but but yes your your your your summary is correct in that by virtue of having that token you make those capital deployment decisions and by virtue of those decisions you you you end up choosing which of those i i don't know if we can call them governance or liquidity tokens but whichever it is you you you indirectly can make the choice of which ones you actually farm up the funny thing about markets is that they are so unpredictable and who would have predicted uh that such value would be assigned to the wifey tokens uh certainly it's hard to predict even for folks who are in the space every day but let's let's talk more about the the governance itself so there is a thriving wire and governance community it's one of the most i would say organic communities i've seen in in d5 and i think um why aaron and yourself andre should be really proud of that can you talk about some of the decisions that um governance has made already maybe you know one that comes to mind uh for me was actually a a fixed cap for the token itself like an issuance schedule for the token itself maybe talk about that or some of the other governance decisions that have already been made i i i don't really think there has been an impactful decision made yet the first vote i thought was going to to cap issuance and i was kind of happy with that and then that got overturned at the end and now we've we've got this open-ended issuance which was interesting and then substrate had done his synthetics based proposal which which i really liked um but i'm also i'm also glad that it didn't pass um specifically because you know there's there's there's no reason yet to mint more token um and and and i like to do it the the the need first way around so so i'm a very strong advocate of of let's identify an expense and then let's vote on that expense you know instead of let's have capital and then decide where we deploy it um there's there's definitely a a a lack of of quorum on that one and and which way it's going to go so so so i find it very entertaining watching um i was annoyed with the the proposal 30 because that was that was the issuance of the snx style system which i had then coded those contracts and then an hour before and and i mean four was winning by by a resounding mention and then andrew kang went on a whole campaign on twitter and he ended up getting a bunch of the big holders to to swap their vote um i think it was like an hour or two before closing and then i was sleeping then so so i i wake up and i see the vote failed and that means i wasted all of that time building the smart contract so i'm annoyed about that wow but but that's that's fine i i i would have preferred spending that time on my vaults but anyway um the the which vaults get voted in next was quite a cool one um because that that allows other communities to rally around it as well um that was vote 33 and the the link marines managed to to overthrow that one quite easily um me being on this podcast another another good example um maybe the best so so we'll put that right at the top um so so but it kind of makes sense because we're still early days but but for now i'm still seeing a lot of indecisiveness when it comes to to the way forward and i understand that as well because i i think a large part of it is a knowledge gap because like a lot of people a lot of people bought into this and and they want to get strongly involved but but i i am just a div like like i build i deploy so so i'm i i don't have a bunch of marketing materials i don't have executive summaries there there aren't you know extensive pages of documentation um so so so a large part of it i think is this knowledge gap between what i've built and what they know about it and like catching up to it and then understanding where are all of the points of control and all of the decisions so so i think the indecisiveness is good from that perspective because it it's indicating to me that people need to learn more first but it's i i can also see the engagement is decreasing because of the indecisiveness because a lot of people feel okay but you know if no decisions are going to be made there's no point in me participating in the decision um so so i do like to sort of flip it between more serious decisions and then smaller decisions just just to keep it a little bit more engaged uh but but it's it's interesting to see how it involves and and it's very interesting to see the very distinct different communities you know the the people that are are looking at from a a purely a purely token governance perspective because there's definitely a group that doesn't really care about governing um yearn but instead care about governing the token itself um and and i i i i do attribute a large part of the token success and when i say success i mean it's it's it's it's acceptance it's distribution um because i'm very happy with the the distribution percentage and you know how how how how little is centralized to to a single entity or group i damn it i lost my train of thought there because i went into a different thought from the first one what did i say just before that you know so i have a question for you so you know i i was mistaken uh you why why wifey issuance hasn't been decided yet by the governance process but you have the platform today on on bankless what what would you like to see like personally what would you what would be your choice for wifey issuance i don't see any reason to issue more i i i don't see value in incentivizing liquidity providers because they're just going to move their liquidity as as soon as as it's no longer there the the the the rewards and the fees generated by the system if so chosen can cover the current operational expenses which you know are small because that's the beauty of deploying stuff on ethereum there's there's almost no opex other than the website and you know that cost me a few hundred dollars a month um so so depending on on how you want to scale this thing up there there isn't a requirement for additional capital now the one reason why i originally wanted a longer distribution schedule was how i had pictured this play out was the first week goes by and probably no one gives a damn about it and it's just me sitting there with the little bit of money i have in the reward system earning this tokens and i end up having the majority of them and then i use those tokens i earned as the next week incentive and then hopefully someone else comes in and you know takes five percent of it and then the next week i use the ones i got again so so i i had originally considered a much longer issue in systems because i thought it was going to take a much longer time to get it to a level of distribution where it wasn't just you know two or three guys that have all of the tokens in their wallets but first we cleared that without any issues so so and and i'm i'm confident that a very large portion of the token holders are are yield farmers or at least involved in the healed space in some fashion so that they are the right people to make the the protocol level decisions um so so personally i i would like to see a little bit less focus on the token issuance and and just touching on the previous point i forgot to mention is is i i wanted to comment that i think a large part of the success of the token is because governance controls the token because i think that's something that definitely differentiates it from most other tokens out there um but but but that not being the point now is that is that there's there's there's no what what benefit is there assuming non-financial requirements to issuing more the the only reason you would is if you wanted to to add a a new partner that you think could add value and then you do a standard shared illusion which i don't see happening anytime soon i don't see purpose in doing liquidity incentives there isn't a capital requirement it's distributed enough to the point where where the correct people are making the governance decisions so so why why why add more so i have a potential answer to that question because at the beginning of this podcast you you came on and said that you're really tired and that you don't sleep very much and that you're kind of overworked and and you kind of want to take a break and i see that as a symptom of this super fair distribution that has gone on which is a one unfortunate repercussion of that is that we don't have a way to fund development right and and again this goes back to why vcs exists in the in the first place and so do do you see a role for uh urine governance to uh direct cash flows to a a fund that de pays for uh you know urine development and that could even go to compensating you andre if that's what you're interested in or it could just go into hiring a an assistant for you or just building out the development and formalizing the development of the urine system out of either wi-fi issuance or capital um you know fees on the capital in the protocol being directed toward the team are you interested in either of these two things playing out yeah so so the proposal i proposed on the forum currently um and i'm waiting for people to to discuss before i open a a new improvement protocol is specifically let's let's redirect all of the current system rewards into a a capital pool and we take expenses from that and then whether it's you know quarterly or annually or or whatever it is at that point in time payout dividends to the token holders but before then everything goes to to to um to opex expenditures so so so that is the proposal i made but it seems most token holders would rather have the dividends than an operational company um so we'll see how that one plays out i'm curious to see but but but that is what i i currently have suggested um and and to to add on to i i think a large part of my current fatigue is is that that informational gap that knowledge gap i spoke about like a few minutes ago just now is that is that a lot of a lot of my energy is being pulled from people trying to understand the system better and that's a good thing because they're trying to to to educate themselves to the point where where they are then capable of autonomously doing it themselves but they need that knowledge transfer first and and that knowledge transfer is is is tapping me out because that's that's that's where all of the engagement is happening and like i've i've spent feb until now you know i i haven't really spoken to anyone it's it's full lockdown year so i haven't even left the house since then so so now having high social interaction is is is very draining um but but i think it's to do with that knowledge transfer and i think when that knowledge transfers has occurred and everyone knows all of the caveats of the system then then that picture will look better and and then i think there is enough operational cash flow to incentivize those people to do it in a more full time or at least committed part-time perspective um and and and just closing the loop that's why that's why again i i don't think additional token issuance is required other than people that you know want to increase their own capital value and or increase their own rewards which which neither i think are are healthy so andre with the urine system the urine protocol no one can really predict the future because it's up to the governance right like the governance decides what the future is however if you had to guess what urine would look like in two three four years or maybe what you are hopeful it will look like in that time period can you kind of paint us a picture of of what you are envisioning when you see a maximally successful urine protocol yeah so so there's there's always this quote i like to give people um because people always assume that i have a plan or they always assume i thought any of this stuff out um it was in the the heath ledger batman movie where where where he tells um harvey um do i look like a guy with a plan i'm i'm just a dog chasing cars i i i wouldn't know what to do with one if i caught up to it uh summarizes me perfectly so i i know what i want to build tomorrow and after i've built that i know what i want to build after that but there is no way in hell i'm even going to try and predict what this thing looks like a month from now let alone two years from now um a month ago i couldn't have told you we would be having this conversation now about what has happened and when i started building it in feb definitely not so so so i'm i'm not even going to attempt to to play that prediction game um if you want to know what i'm currently working on i'll gladly share but don't tell me don't ask me further than that because i i i'm as informed as everyone else's yeah okay so what is actually concretely in the roadmap or not in the even in the roadmap but currently being worked on what are the concrete things that are in development quote unquote well the the delegated vaults i'm very excited to finish off now um after i've finished the delegated vaults and we've voted in a few more of the the native vault and we've added a few more strategies which probably the next two to three weeks um then i'm planning on going back to i trade and finishing that off because those leveraged trades are still very very good in terms of of of yield on the on both the lp side and the additional volume on the pool side and now that we have so much capital sitting in those pools we can do much larger trades which is also very nice so i'd like to see that as a sort of you know stable coin trading platform um i after that i did want to go back to to y swap my amm but at this point you know one inch is launching one um black hole swap is coming out with their one uh bankroll v2 is now released so so so i'm first going to see if one of these guys covers the bases the way i wanted to do it and if they do i'm just going to use their systems because i also don't want to spread out my development capacity too thin um rather do one thing well then three things kind of shitty so so so so that i know i'm going to be busy with for like the next month um and then after that i'll reevaluate and see what's going on in this market andre i want to thank you for coming on the bankless podcast um even though you didn't have a choice this was you were voted into it but uh you know we had fun and we hope you did i i'm hopeful that you get some rest in the coming days i know the defy community in the ethereum community is thankful for the work that you've contributed uh and i love what you said at the ending it can be a strategic advantage not to have a concrete plan that stretches far into the future and just be agile and flexible uh thank you so much for spending some time with us andre now thank you for having me guys it's um it's it's it's nice to have a little break and then be able to talk so that there's a little bit of perspective coming back as well so i really appreciate it absolutely all right bankless nation some actions for you guys we will include a link to the the urine protocol and remember this code is tested in prod so if you put funds in andre would be the first to tell them to tell you you could you could lose them all we'll also send a link we'll also drop a link to the urine governance form and you can see all of the organic activity that is happening there lastly last action item for you we have a state of the nation episode seven where we talked with daryl lau who is a governor of the wifey protocol so catch that if you haven't yet that'll give you some more background on uh the insanity and the the craziness and the fun that is going on with wifey right now lastly and this is super important in an episode such as this risks and disclaimers none of this has been financial advice ethereum is risky defy is risky we say it every single show you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
