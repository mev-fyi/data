[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today absolutely fantastic we had ben hunt on the podcast ben hunt is a very well respected writer in the legacy world he is the writer of epsilon theory newsletter and he does a fantastic job bringing in new ways to think about the world to an audience that might not have gotten exposed to it and the the need and demand for the thinking that ben hunt offers to the world is definitely well reflected in the size and community that he's generated around his epsilon theory newsletter yeah i've been reading epsilon theory forever david it's just a fantastic body of work and i think the main ideas the core ideas ben started this this newsletter in 2013 the core ideas have really played out like he's been right the world is turning into a place that is valued more by narrative than by fundamentals and he caught that switch very early and i think he's got a lot to teach us in the crypto space about how narratives and game theory affect asset prices and virtually everything around us they really are the base layer of the human experience that's the social layer and so we get into these topics and then we get a chance to apply them to crypto at the end we really wanted to get ben's perspective on crypto and to bring these mental models that he's come up with in creative for as he said david the legacy world to crypto and uh get his thoughts on it so he shares that at the end too this is just a fantastic interview incredibly fascinating i think you will pick up new mental models you'll be able to apply them both to the legacy world and equities and what's going on with central banks and also to apply them to crypto so i really think you're going to enjoy this one we talk a lot on the bankless podcast about narratives about memes and how they are baked into these systems and so the crypto world is pretty familiar i would say with the world of narrative in the world of memes and i think we appreciate it more than the the rest of the world right and what ben hunt is doing in my opinion is bringing that perspective to the legacy system using different words other than like memes because you know it's very that the word meme is is much more relevant to to crypto but in in the legacy world it's it's it's the narrative right and ben hunt calls this the epsilon where he talks about the alpha and the beta but then there's also the epsilon which is uh the the human side of things the world in my opinion is separated into the physical world of atoms and science and physics but then there's also the world of the stories that the human that that humans create in order to determine what is valuable right so how to act based off of what we know and that's what ben hunt is doing in the legacy system and so why ben hunt is such a good guest for the bankless podcast is because he's taking some of the things that we know the story side of things the narrative side of things and he's applying it to the legacy markets and applying it to investing in a world that we thought was perhaps based off of you know hard facts and evidence and and fundamentals but turns out it's actually based off of narratives and stories and so this is really where we overlap with ben hunt and so getting him on to the banquet podcast to talk about these things was an absolute treat all right we're gonna bring ben hunt on in just a few seconds but first we want to tell you about our sponsors as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent-seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks monolith coming soon to monolith is an on-ramp directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today so the biggest thing that's holding crypto back is actually getting fiat into the system moving from that old world to the new crypto world what you have to do is create an account with an exchange you have to wire funds that's also holding your app back if you are a d5 developer and are building something on a network like ethereum what that means is in the fiat process your users drop off when they're signing up and you're limiting your market to the hardcore crypto people but what if you could make it super easy to on ramp to your application using a fiat on-ramp ramp is that it is a delightfully easy a fiat on-ramp it lets first-time crypto users get eath and die usdc whatever asset they want in five minutes or less so this reduces the dropout rate and lets you build products for the real world zurion is using it ethereum is using it taurus is using it d5 apps that you probably know and use today are using it what you need to do is check this out and visit ramp.network to see how easy it is you can get set up in 10 minutes or less and 100x your addressable market size as a develop this is like the ultimate growth hack and when you mention bankless they'll on ramp the first 100k in us dollars for free so go to ramp.network mention bankless and get started all right guys now that that's done let's go ahead and get right into the interview with dr ben hunt [Music] hello bankless nation we are incredibly excited and honored to have dr ben hunt he is a former fund manager tech entrepreneur poli-sci professor he's the writer of epsilon theory which i read frequently he writes narratives about game theory for investors and in general for people trying to understand the world and i would be remiss if i didn't say he's actually part of the inspiration for starting the bankless newsletter for me personally ben how are you doing in these uncertain times sir i'm doing great ryan well well thanks for that introduction and i'm uh so glad to to hear that you know something good came out of out of my work if it if it helped inspire you guys and uh also hello to david behind the glass as uh as they say on the radio hello hello cheers and welcome well absolutely we we are just so excited to uh to talk with you today because i think i mean you talk so much about communities and about um you you call it the pack um and you know bankless we we sort of we we sort of use the analogy of the nation for the bankless pack because it's kind of a tribe that's rallied around some similar ideas to the ideas you're talking about on epsilon theory all of the time so what we'd really love to talk about today is some of those common base values between our communities between crypto and between epsilon theory movement i would call it a movement um you've talked about the lowercase l values like freedom and liberty uh you know and thought in the lowercase c values yep yep yep small small l liberal and small c conservative yep exactly and uh those are i think our values base values that our communities share so we just want to explore some of those and honestly expose the bankless nation to some of your fantastic ideas because they are so relevant to crypto what else is crypto except narratives and game theory and that's that's a lot about what you talk about um so um i guess ben maybe maybe to start we could uh set some context for one of your biggest ideas which is rooted in the epsilon theory name itself um you know kind of where you got the name where you came up with the name what this what this epsilon uh what what the meaning of epsilon actually is and maybe we could talk a little bit to introduce folks to a an idea that comes from science which is the the three body problems so could you describe maybe the three body problem and then let's talk a little bit about the meaning of epsilon and uh how can explain the world yeah yeah you bet ryan in fact if you know if you don't mind i'll kind of flip that around i'll kind of describe what what epsilon is first and then kind of why i call what i do um and you're right i i do hope it's a it's a movement right i do call it uh epsilon theory and kind of where that comes from so you know in i started writing epsilon theory uh this would be the the summer of 2013 right so just a little over seven years ago and you know i i i wound down my hedge fund and we could talk about that a little bit it was a big hedge fund we had about a billion dollars there and uh i was trying to make sense of a world that from an investment perspective didn't seem to make a lot of sense to me anymore and you know my background from from academic days and you know professorial days was in game theory you know it's always so silly you know people say oh there's you know game theory and it has become kind of a meme in and of itself kind of of kind of silly silly science so yeah i mean it's not it's it's a it's a real thing and i've in a lot of years oh oh we love game theory we love games we're in crypto so i you know i i i knew i wanted to to write this note and blog whatever you want to call it uh i was trying to figure out what to what to call it and what i finally hit on was that in in investing the core i'll call it formula right the core uh econometric description of what investing is is that the the value of your portfolio the the performance of your investments depends on alpha you know we you see that in places like blogs like seeking alpha and you know people talk about hedge funds and what's your alpha alpha is basically your out performance right alpha is the the idiosyncratic performance of your portfolio what's what's special about you right that's your alpha and then your performance is also your beta which is how much of your portfolio your performance goes up and down with with with broad markets right so so so beta it's it's you know the performance of the the overall market and how closely linked you are to that and then alpha is your idiosyncratic performance you know what what what you do that's special to you but those those actually aren't the only two terms in this econometric formula uh and in fact in almost every econometric formula there there's a third term or a final term that's tacked on to the end and it's the epsilon term so in in this formula the the full formula if you write it out it's not just oh your performance is alpha plus beta it's alpha plus beta plus epsilon and and epsilon is you know the greek letter e and the way people think of it is well that's e for error yeah right it's it's everything that's left over that you can't explain from your uh variables and your formulation whatever goes into your calculation of alpha it's all the stuff we don't understand it's all the stuff we don't understand that's exactly right all the stuff that's outside of your formalization of alpha and beta like i say look at any econometric formula in any field and there's always this tact on epsilon term e for error and the truth is and this is a truth that comes after you know a lot of years and a lot of scars in you know lots of different fields but but including investing is that you know there is a lot we don't understand and just because we don't understand it just because we don't formalize it in whatever we are putting into our conceptualization of alpha and beta doesn't mean it's not real and doesn't mean that it's error it means that it's outside of our scope of thinking well you you've used the analogy of dark matter right ben to describe that yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a great way to think about it that's a great way to think about it so so so the epsilon term is you know think about is like the dark matter in the universe which you know as you know you know dark matter and dark energy you know it's probably 95 of what's out there in the universe it's just we can't see it or measure it or understand it so we just kind of put it over there to the side and we spend all our time talking about the the five percent that we can see and measure and visualize and all that so in investing what is particularly left out of alpha and beta and what is particularly i think frankly something we can extract from epsilon is the strategic behavior of market participants that's a mouthful right what i mean by that is there's this old poker saying right that you don't just play the cards you also play the players and the cards think of those as the fundamentals right so that's going to be in alpha and beta but playing the player that's not an alpha and beta that's an epsilon and playing the player is as good a description an informal description of what game theory is as anything i know that's what game theory is is trying to understand how do you play the player right not just playing the cards or playing the player so so that's what epsilon theory is all about it's trying to look at the strategic interaction of market participants it's trying to look at the strategic behavior of investors of voters of of of any sort of social interaction because you know like your example about dark matter and and invisible matter i i really think that in a lot of times in circumstances it is that strategic interaction it is that playing the player that's so much more important than just playing the card you're dealt so you know that i started writing epsilon theory i sent it out you know an email to about 100 people and today we've got you know over a hundred thousand people on that on that email list and you know get about a quarter million people a month to the to the website and that's all from word of mouth you know we've never done any marketing never any advertising or anything around it and i look i think i'm a pretty good writer and and i think that's you know i like to think that but but that's not really what's responsible for the appetite for this for the growth of this what's responsible and i'm certain of it is that you know we are told over and over again you know these these these overly scientific and i'll say overly didactic kind of pronouncements about how to understand the world and and when you're in the world for a while you realize hey you know the world's a lot more than that that the world is so much about stories and narratives and the way that impacts our behavior all of this stuff is outside of the rules that we're told that that govern markets or voting and all like that and and i think that as as people have frankly woken up or been forced to confront the fact that these old rules don't work i mean i mean frankly i don't think they ever worked that well but we all believed in them so that they did you know it's it's it's a it's really interesting to see over the last seven years ten years whatever you want to call it that i think everybody is now thinking in terms of narrative and playing the player in these strategic interactions and i think that's so important for coming to grips with the real power structure of the world and frankly what we can do to change it so anyway a long involved conversation but but it's but it's it's it's important to me this notion of epsilon and and why i call what i do epsilon theory so ben i i've always thought that like if you want to win in the investing game like you have to do what you said which is to play the player along with playing the beta and also trying to play the alpha right like you can't you have to pay attention to all three of these things they're they're interlocking with each other and there it's like this rock paper scissors game but it's the playing the player side of things the epsilon side of things that we are thinking is perhaps underappreciated or undervalued and when we discuss about like how to play the market what we're really talking about is like trying to understand like if i do this then they do that and if they do that then i'll do this and we and it's this uh hall of mirrors of trying to put yourself in the shoes of other people playing playing the market right and so and this is it just converges back onto game theory right so like if i do this uh if my if my opponent does this and i'm going to do this and then that recurses over and over and over again and what to me what epsilon is is the substrate for thinking what your opponent is going to do right and so it is the the narrative of sorts of the world that we live in what we perceive to be valuable based off of the narratives that we share are how we try and frame what we think our opponents are going to do right and so um it works i'm speaking in very general terms so it's pretty difficult to make something yeah no but but listen you're you're exactly right because this this strategic interaction game playing right it's not random and and there there are i'll call them rules but what i mean by rules is there are predictable uh patterns predictable because they're very rational predictable patterns in human behavior in these sort of strategic settings so the the one that i think is most powerful for markets the one that i think is is is most powerful for really any sort of social market and that can be investing markets that can be voting markets is certainly true for for for crypto markets is the the strategic interaction of what's called the common knowledge game and you know we're all familiar with a couple of games right we're all familiar with prisoner's dilemma because you see that on every police procedural tv show right that's that's one where they they question two people in separate rooms and the the the predictable behavior you know to use the ten dollar economic word the equilibrium is that both prisoners will rat each other out it's it's the smart move it's the rational thing to do now there are ways to get around that right by setting up structures of the game that reward or punish ratting someone out right so if you know you're going to be sent to prison with the buddies of the guy you just ran it out that's an incentive structure that changes the parameters of the game and may you know change the the the predictable behavior the equilibrium but but it but there really are these sort of predictable behaviors depending if you can understand the structure of the game and the one you know like say we're familiar with most of you are pretty familiar with prisoner's dilemma most people are familiar with uh the game of chicken right if you've ever seen any you know movie like footloose right or you know driving your tractors at each other with kevin macon you know we're all familiar with that game yeah some people familiar with the game called the stag hunt which i think is is actually pretty important particularly when you're talking about politics and international relations but the the common knowledge game is is one that i think most people aren't so familiar with even though like i say i think it's the game of markets and and it's hard to get familiar with it because it doesn't lend itself as well to a tv show or a movie right it doesn't boil down to a you know a single tense moment right of tractors going at each other or you know an interrogation in a in a police squad but the the common knowledge game and this this goes back to the 1930s when a you know very famous economist then and still today john maynard keynes came up with this idea and and i think it's so right it's it's really think of it as like the game theory for crowds right and what what the example keynes gave was what he called the newspaper beauty contest and this was you know back in i mean it sounds crazy today but but in the the 1930s the newspapers the social media of the day uh they would frequently run a contest where they would run they would print the pictures of 10 pretty girls again it's inconceivable to think of this today but this is really a thing right in the 1930s and they would invite their readers to vote for who they think the prettiest girl is and send in your vote and if you the people who the if you vote for the girl who gets the most votes then those voters will be entered into a sweepstakes drawing you know we'll we'll pick one of those voters names out of a hat and you'll win an all-expense paid trip to atlantic city for the miss america pageant right so i again inconceivable today but this is really this is a thing and so kane said well you know let's think about how you play this game i said you know what he called the first level of thinking is that you really would look at the pictures and say oh i think you know top row third from the right i think she's the prettiest i'm going to vote for her and so you would fill out your little card and you'd send it into the newspaper that's my vote and kane said well you know it doesn't take too long before you realize yeah hey that's that's not the way to win this game right the what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to win that prize that trip to atlantic city i i shouldn't be voting for the girl i actually think is the prettiest i need to vote for the girl that everyone else thinks is the prettiest you know what's the consensus view of who the prettiest girl is because i i want to be in that sweepstakes drawing so he called this the the second level of thinking and then he he said but but then you figure out he said well somebody said a lot of people don't get past that second level of thinking but they said well most people ultimately do get past it because they realize well helen am i the only one who's smart enough to figure out how to win this game right i mean otherwise in other words the thing is is everyone else so stupid that they're going to vote for who they really think is the prettiest girl or is it as cain said is there a third level of thinking where it's everybody trying to figure out what everybody thinks about the relative prettiness of these girls right it's it's not the consensus it's kind of like what's the consensus of the consensus and it's that third level of thinking that that cain said was so powerful because he said look forget about these newspaper contests and you know voting for pretty girls what about the stock market where what you're doing when you buy a piece of stock is you're voting you're saying oh i think that's a pretty company i'm going to vote for that and and kane said you know the first level of thinking would be to say oh i i think that company is very attractive it has great fundamentals and it's got you know good cash flow and a sound management team i'm going to buy that stock and then you realize well no no no that's not how i'm going to win what i would have to win is that second level of thinking i want to i want to buy stock in a company that everyone else thinks is attractive and then you go to that third level thinking where you say well every isn't everybody doing this isn't it the crowd looking around to see the crowd who we think is the most attractive and cain's kind of left it at that and and then in subsequent years the and this is how the common knowledge game comes around the question then becomes well how does the crowd figure out what the crowd is looking at in terms of you know a pretty stock dubai and and the answer is you introduce this concept of the missionary uh the the the missionary that we call that in game theory because the there's a famous thought problem about how the crowd figures out what the crowd is thinking and the the the game or the game the thought experiment usually goes by the the name of the the island of the the green eyed tribe and so the the setup for this thought experiment is all right there there's there's there's an island all the people there on the island have blue eyes it is taboo to have green eyes meaning that if you do have green eyes you have to leave the island immediately the the next day you have to get in a canoe and you have to leave the island uh uh immediately but what's also taboo on this island is to talk about eye color and in this thought experiment there are no mirrors on the island so you know so there could be people on this island who have you know green eyes but they'd never know it because nobody's going to tell them hey you've got green eyes you need to leave the island and there are no mirrors so you'd never look at yourself and you'd say oh i've got green eyes i've got to get off the island but then one day you know so this this island even though it has this taboo structure where green eyed people have to leave the island uh it can nobody ever leaves the island and life goes on happily you know for for for generations until one day the missionary comes and the missionary gets there and you know he's going to tell you know the truth to people and so he gets up there stands up on up on a box and he says to everybody on the island because you know he's not part of their taboo system he says i just want you to know there are people here on this island with green eyes and so the methodic question the thought experiment is okay well what happens next and what happens when the missionary comes up and makes a statement like that is that the missionaries creating common knowledge common knowledge is what we all know that we all know right so before the missionary said that each of us each of those islanders individually knows that there are people on the island with green eyes but that thought stays inside their head right after the missionary makes that public makes that public statement the people in the eye it doesn't change what each individual islander knows but now they know that everybody knows now they know that everybody knows so so the question is what happens well the answer the question is if there's the answer is trivial if there's one person on the island with green eyes right because now there's common knowledge that there is at least one green eyed person on the island that one person who has green eyes looks around he looks at everybody in the island you know it's a small island you can see everybody he says well everybody on this island that i see has got blue eyes and he goes oh that must mean i'm the guy so the next morning with one islander with with with green eyes one one islander leaves on his canoe the the next morning but then there's a question well what happens if there are two islanders two tribes people that have green eyes what happens then the answer to that the answer to this thought experiment is that for every in islanders with green eyes they all leave simultaneously in days later right so how does that work well the two the the two islanders are there with with with with green eyes each one of them looks around and says oh man joe over there he's got green eyes he must be the guy that the missionary was talking about so he wasted the next morning and he says well wait a second joe over there he he must have seen that we've all why did why is he still here on the island i mean he must have looked around he must have seen that we all have oh oh no joe must have seen somebody with green eyes and if i see that everybody's got blue eyes except joe that must mean that i have green eyes and this same process is going through joe's head so both joe and and i myself we both leave the morning of the second day right so i've gone through this long example and the the the point of this is this this is so much you know how markets work where it's nothing nothing nothing for a long period of time and then boom a lot of people leave the island on the same day this process of creating common knowledge and then all of us looking around at the crowd to say am i the only one who's out of step here that's the way this works there's a time element to the creation of common knowledge and the way that it hits a market the more people who share the i'll call it the the the non-common knowledge view the longer it takes for the break in the narrative but the bigger it will be right so you these are the kind of principles these game theory principles that once you start applying it to the creation of common knowledge these missionaries these people who create narratives once you start analyzing and measuring how much these narratives are successful in creating common knowledge how many people are let's call it off target right have green eyes when the common knowledge says you need to have blue eyes that inserts a time element and then a magnitude element for what the dislocation is going to be for markets it's an incredibly powerful framework for understanding very predictable patterns of crowd and market behavior and it's the sort of thing that is totally ignored isn't even the right word it's the dark matter for how you know we are told that we need to spend our time doing to try to understand how markets work so again sorry for the long-winded talk but man this stuff is so powerful once you start wrapping your head around it ben there is so much to unpack there because what it does is it absolutely flips investing on its head but it's basically saying like all of the models that you thought were real and true and imbued in the fabric of reality investing they're manipulatable by missionaries by the you know by social structures like like the social system is at the base layer and that can be fundamentally manipulated well it makes them it makes them time dependent too right it makes them have an expiration date there's a half-life to these narratives it's once you start measuring and visualizing narratives and that's that's the that's the focus of our research so so the the the company you know i started two years ago uh partners we call it second foundation partners you know after the isaac asimov second foundation and uh which is a whole other story right but uh but but the the research we're talking about is called natural language processing nlp and these are ideas that have been around you know i was writing about this stuff 30 years ago in academia the the problem 30 years ago though was that you know we had all the the the ideas and the formulas and the you know the models for how to look at this we just didn't have the computing power right we didn't we didn't have the fire hose of data that we can get where i can get everything that's published in the world and transcripts of everything that cnbc you know vomits out there during the day or even twitter or oh my god or twitter right i can get all of that and i can run it through as much computing processing power as i want through aws or azure or whatever and our ability to now measure and visualize the structure of narrative it's it's like discovering a microscope right it's like somebody handed you a microscope in the 1700s and and and they said yeah here look look at this under the microscope and they they they put a little piece of glass and a little drop of dirty river water on there or and you look at you through the microscope holy there's a whole world that's inside there yeah and it it's the base layer of everything absolutely absolutely because that's what it means to be a social animal of you know humans there are four incredibly successful species of animals on the planet there's the bee there's the termite there's the ant and there's the human it is not a coincidence that these four species that dominate the world we're social animals and and they're you know a few definitions of social animals it's uh you know multiple generations that live in the same nest uh you know shared taking care of the young the brood right but the but the most important characteristic the the the cinequan known for what it means to be a social animal is that you swim in an ocean of intra-species communication right for the b the ant the termite that's mostly pheromones it's mostly chemical communication which they literally swim in we are no different it's not chemicals it's our words and and you know think about during the day how many messages you receive from other humans and and the answer is it's for a typical human is like five or six thousand discrete messages every day and we don't recognize them you know discreetly and and and consciously we could we'd go nuts right but we all know that we that we swim in this ocean of communication and just over the last couple of years it's possible now to actually measure it to visualize it what i like to call narrative world and now it it it's really possible today to to actually start to measure and put some some numbers behind these games like the common knowledge game so that we can actually try to predict and anticipate human behavior in ways that just weren't possible before so ben i think this has two really interesting implications right so the first is a bit of a red pill probably for some of our listeners yeah that the things that we call fundamentals right um you know stocks have fundamentals uh profit margin these sorts of things um the things that we thought were so sturdy the found like the foundation it's not actually the foundation the foundation runs deeper than that and even those fundamentals are based on narrative because the social system you know uh is is what essentially puts in fundamental metrics right like why do we think discounted cash flows should um be the basis for valuation of the company well because wharton school of business teaches it basically right and every all the mbas believe it and therefore the market believes it right yeah that's the first step you know let me let me interrupt you there right because it's not that it's not that things like fundamentals and cash flows and the like it's it's not that any of these models and lessons and principles it's not that they're wrong right it's whether they are useful so so so let me give you an example so you know it's the difference between newtonian physics and einsteinian physics right it's not that newtonian physics is wrong it's that in certain circumstances like you're going really fast with you know you know grab you know something the size of the sun right it doesn't work very yeah they're non-predictive right so so that's right so so einsteinian physics it's not that newtonian physics is wrong it's that it is a subset of a broader concept that we'll call einsteinian physics right and in markets it's exactly the same thing so you know ray dalio the founder of bridgewater uh just down the street from me and and look for my money bridgewater is the best smartest hedge fund on the planet and i i i've got i've got honestly i've got nothing but good things to say about those guys i mean they're weird as right don't get me wrong you know i could never work there and you know there are a lot of stories and but but i think they're fantastic right for what they do and managing other people's money and being really smart about it ray's writing alone it's just fantastic it's it's really good right i mean anyway below that's a whole other podcast right but but but you know ray's core idea around markets is what he calls the economic machine right it he describes frankly everything as a machine including humans and the way we think it's which is the whole other conversation we can have but what what dolly was talking about when he says there's an economic machine and that's how you understand markets and and stocks he's not wrong right it's it's it's like it's like newton isn't wrong when he says f equals m a right but there's a larger system that encompasses the economic machine i'll call it the narrative machine that in certain periods of time your old-fashioned narrative economic machine your old-fashioned newtonian physics it just doesn't work very well and ever since the great financial crisis and this will finally return to that idea you introduced early on the idea of the three-body problem our our old ways of understanding like newtonian physics like the economic machine they just haven't worked right they just haven't been very useful and i really think it's because not that they're wrong per se but because there's a larger machine the narrative machine i like to call it like i say that is all that is like einsteinian physics right it's it it's the thing you need to to really focus on to to be useful when you know the world the world gets a little crazy like it has over the last two absolutely so the world is getting super crazy right now and i think this is where the conversation is going to start to converge on the topic of crypto but how we are getting there first i feel like starts with a conversation of what happened in 2008 where the the markets were in turmoil and the fed they start uh started to integrate itself into the economy into the market um by propping it up right yeah and the yeah yeah and ryan it wasn't just that the markets were in turmoil right so it it was that there was a non-trivial chance that the entire system would collapse right and so i i remember this day so vividly so the the hedge fund i was running then man we we we killed it in oh eight right we had i mean we were we were early we were right we were doing we did really well in 08 and in our mirror i guess this was kind of september well this is right before lehman was you know was taken out in the street and shot and you know we had a great day i mean we were like five percent that day because the you know the shorts the credit default swaps everything was working for us and and and i was kind of you know smiling to myself after the day and uh and then it kind of hit me and it was like hmm what if nobody's around to to to pay me what they owe me yeah what if the world goes to hell it's not a victory exactly right i i mean you know all these big banks you know jp morgan owes me a shitload of money on these contracts i have with them whoa what if jp morgan's not there tomorrow right and you know and that's that was what was really at stake there in in in 08 and what happened you know as you're describing to me it's the for going back to the analogy that we were discussing what happened was the missionary came and started to dictate what the rules are right and so the fed came and said like hey you know jp morgan is going to be there tomorrow we we guarantee it right we are stepping into the free market and we are gearing guaranteeing a future and the reason why we are able to do that is because we have the money printer this is this is coming from the crypto narrative right and so in 2008 a new narrative stepped into play right like a and the epsilon grew stronger in in the face of alpha and beta because the the central bank said that the we are going to make sure that the market the free market moves in the direction that we want it to which i think has generated a substrate between 2008 and now coronavirus that uh some people may call um moral hazard in some ways uh which would uh the messaging from the federal reserve which controls the dollar which gives them the power to control the narrative in the first place offers the market the backstop the perceived backstop that will always be there and has thus created this insanely strong v-shaped recovery because of the narrative that the federal reserve is there and it's the entire narrative it's the belief in the fed that is creating the current um economic conditions that has arisen some of the most crazy manifestations such as like hurts going bankrupt and then rallying we have the davy day trader movement where he he said he he saw he solved the markets he solved stocks where because the rules are that stocks only go up and so we i think we are now starting to see uh the the the fact that this missionary comes and makes these statements what it really is it's the uh emperor uh emperor's clothes uh uh captioning not all available under now right like yeah it really is it's going to yeah the defense got your back the fed's got your back and and so you know one kind of historical point and then you know on with this what before we got the creation of common knowledge and i'll call it the fed as missionary right that that really starts in 2009 with with what they call forward guidance and the like before we got there though and i i just want to you know it's important that you know kind of get this out there to your community right or for everybody to know because this the history gets rewritten so much what the fed and the us treasury did that before they started you know their common knowledge their narrative missionary work was um you know we're familiar with with lehman going bankrupt but but then what they did was called the temporary liquidity guarantee program and this was in october of 2008 and what they did there this is where they really took action not words but action to prop up to rescue the big banks because what they did in this program was they they put the full faith and credit of the united states government behind the unsecured credit of federally chartered banks all right what the hell does that mean what that means is that the next day goldman sachs became a federally chartered bank and over the next few weeks issued about 30 billion dollars worth of of corporate debt that was backstopped that was co-signed by the us government and it was it was that program that saved the system i understand that but it was that program that also makes me so angry when i hear guys like lloyd blankfein and you know all the other goldman sachs guy says oh we weren't bailed out we you know we we started our own two feet that's that's yeah right so in in in late 2008 the federal government put the government to backstop the debt of every federally chartered bank and and and so the you know like i like to call you say you know what the the pleasant skin of capitalism for me was ripped off in 2008 and i could see just the the naked sinews of power below that right and so that exists right so what what and so what's what's been created over that the new skin is this skin of narrative and missionary work and the like which which which you described very well and by the way dave portnoy is exactly right right that's the thing he's exactly right oh he nailed it because he's absolutely perfect and he's making money off of it absolutely absolutely and he's like you know to use your story of the emperor's new clothes he's like the little girl in the crowd who says hey the emperor is naked absolutely it's not fundamentals and oh what's what does this analyst say about the earnings potential for stockxyz next week porno is exactly right he's saying the quiet part out loud hey guys we're going to pause the interview with ben real quick and just talk about some of our fantastic bank list sponsors ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum so what that means is that you can deposit your assets into ave and then take out a collateralized loan or simply deposit just to earn an interest rate so you pay an interest rate for borrowing you earn an interest rate for supplying but what the magic of ave offers you is stable interest rate loans which is a really important money lego for building out a bankless revolution having an interest rate that doesn't change under your fee is really important for long-term thinking and being able to plan out your own personal finance futures but also make strong business decisions based on an interest rate that you can depend on in addition to their stable interest rates there's also flash loans and flash loans are where you can borrow any amount of any asset for without any collateral so long as you are also paying it back in the same transaction the use cases for this are absolutely endless and i'm really optimistic that some creative developers are going to make some really cool tools using the ave money lego system we have been watching ave climb the d5 pulse leaderboard just growing and growing and growing in the assets deposited into their application which just shows how strong of a system they have created so you can go and check them out at ave dot com deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any ethereum while it works so check it out i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5 x 6 x 8 x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this on bank list that we'll include in the show notes we've written articles about this that we'll include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off all right let's go ahead and get right back into the interview with ben okay so so so the byproduct of this right so missionaries are incredibly powerful because they can set narrative particularly missionaries that are already in power nation-state missionaries might be the most powerful of all and those are the ones at the central bank so now we're operating under this new common knowledge narrative that stocks only go up because that's what the fed wants but the byproduct of this is something we talk about an awful lot on bankless right like the name bankless is like the goal of doing less with banks adopting protocols rather than banks where we can being self-sovereign over your money because the byproduct of everything that we've been talking about is we've created what you call the nudging oligarchy can you talk a little bit about that yeah so look i i talk about the nudging oligarchy and i talk about the nudging state and and what i mean by that is that you know we don't we don't live in a orwellian 1984 world where the you know in that that book famously the the image of the state was a boot you know crushing the face of humanity for all time right that was that was the that was the uh the self-proclaimed image of the state and that's that's not the image of our state even though in in in many ways it and the oligarchy you know the corporate interests are and and i know it sound tinfoil haddish with this stuff but but maybe not to to your audience you're in good company sir yeah it's really real right this this shit's real it's not a jack boot you know smashing the face it's a it's a smiley face button that's what it is i say you know i use a lot of imagery and pictures in in you know when i write on epsilon theory and i think the image i've used the most and some of your audience will get this reference is the um you know there's this this you know fantastic um you know graphic novel uh it became a you know an okay movie right watchmen right and so the the image of watchmen is that is that smiley face button uh with the the blood dripping down it you know a few drops of blood dripping down it and and that that to me is like the perfect imagery of what i mean about the nudging state in the nudging oligarchy it's it's it's not done by you know jack-booted thugs it's done by narrative by this smiley face narrative of oh what wait wait you're you're going to buy crypto don't don't you know that you know crypto is used by terrorists what are you are you supporting terrorism you know what right that's what that's what a nudge is that's what a nudge is and by the way they're so powerful they have to do that nudging in the west because of our social contract because of western liberal democracy social contract but in other places in the world you know it might be a bit more like 1984-ish um china for instance uh russia is just a in the open oligarchy yeah yeah russia for sure but but china's interesting case right because because you know china is moving much more in the direction of nudge so so so take their kind of their social credit system right you you know familiar with this right where there's this national database where everything you do and it's a very black mirror kind of thing i mean it is a black bear thing everything you do every action you take can be recorded and goes into your score right it's like your credit score except it's your social score and that's the citizen score this is right and that includes the people you talk to you know you know where you travel what you do and so what you find is that people they they they self-control right they they they they start to censor themselves it is this self-censorship that is the goal of the nudge right because and look it makes a lot of sense it's so much cheaper to get people to censor themselves than to force compliance you know with you know more policemen and everything else it it's it's the it's the whole notion of is this jeremy bentham this this uh late 18th early 19th century british thinker you know talked about panopticon and it was his model for how you would design a prison with minimal guards right and and and the way the panopticon works is on self-censorship on self-regulation because you see in the middle of your prison you can see all the other prisoners and again this is game theory you know that the other prisoners can see you and and when you are when you are being watched like that and you know that others can be watching you you censor yourself you control yourself and and it's again it's a very predictable pattern of human behavior and you're increasingly seeing governments take advantage of this and now then what we have is the panopticon meets moore's law because they can be so much more efficient when they power of when they have the power of digital technology so you know one thing that china's doing for instance you talked about nudging right and uh yeah i agree with you that's they're doing it digitally as well um but they are uh creating a central bank digital currency basically so the ability it's just an entry and a ledger and centralized ledger it's nothing nothing from a public blockchain or crypto about it nothing really free about it's a state apparatus and that gives them the power to freeze your bank account to take your money at a will to track every single commerce transaction that you do to eliminate you from the economy tie that to the to the good citizen score hey ryan guess what come coming soon to a liberal democracy near you exactly right right i mean the nordic countries have pretty much already moved to this as well right i figure i figure it'll be the you know the the 2022 um you know dollar rescue or you know anti-terrorism bill that'll do that in the united states well especially and you've got you've got more fodder because uh you just game theory and you just say nation state against nation state well the us says in order to compete against china we need to recruit mark zuckerberg and team to create libra for us libra absolutely yeah i wrote a long piece on this i mean it's the co-opting of and this is what governments always do with financial innovation right which is which is one of the reasons and you know maybe you know is one of the paths for us to go down is one of the reasons why you know i'm not a what's my attitude towards alcohol towards bitcoin i'm it's not that i'm a skeptic or a cynic is that it i just i've what always happens is that governments co-opt these financial innovations and they take i like to call them the the coyotes the clever coyotes i'm a coyote right we're too clever by half we're too smart for our own good we don't see the forest for the trees they they kill the coyotes it you know governments are in the business of coyote control and and and i've just seen this too many times and i i just i i see the path this is on i am so sympathetic to the goals and the ends we agree so much on the where we need to be going in the world i am so certain is the wrong word i i'm but i'm i really believe that the the tactics and the strategy to get to that desired endpoint i don't think you can fight the nudging state and the nudging oligarchy on this battlefield of money i i think that is that is the cinequan that is the raison d'etre here i'm using lots of foreign languages here that's why governments exist is money this is this is what a government is it is the control over money it is existential to a government they do not want to give up that power and will not do so easily they can't they can't it is their power and so there's a direct relationship between the size and spending of the military and the ability to print money to back that system like the the the power and spread of the united states of america as a um empire regardless of whether we actually like we don't actually control the eu or south america but we kind of do because of the dollar right it is the power that backs the united states and this is kind of where i want i i know you just expressed um maybe some apprehension or some cautiousness about uh bitcoin as a successful alternative to this however uh when we talk about the nudging state uh we do have to also include the fact that that bitcoin and ethereum me and ryan are are more um representative of the ethereum community more so than the bitcoin community although although we do believe in the power of bitcoin what these things represent is the ability to exit right and exiting this the option to exit this system we hope offers a check on the ability of the nation state to nudge because if the nation state nudges you in in a direction you don't want to go you may have the option to exit out of this system and while i don't believe that like the this is just going to be a peaceful transition there's going it's going to there's going to be a ton of conflict in a bunch of different ways these the mere ability to exit might put limits upon how far a nation state can nudge its citizenry it kind of puts the navy state almost you know rather than nation state versus crypto it's like nation state versus people right are you going to strip away the people's ability to buy bitcoin or transact in it that's a slippery slope for a western democracy yeah i think yes and no it depends it depends how existential it gets for that nation right right so i i i actually think that the and look i i i totally get what what you're saying there are clear i hate to use this phrase but i will there are clear use cases for bitcoin that are crucial and critical um in lots of places around the world where where in a sense the government is at war with its citizenry right you know you could use you know venezuela right or you can say you know you know in lebanon right um which is why you know you're in lebanon what people want is they want us dollars right they don't want you know whatever the you know i should know what the lebanese currency is i don't right but but but nobody wants their domestic currency right they want dollars first and foremost or they can get you know the you know if you're if you have the ability to do it they they would want to get bitcoin right i get those use cases i get those i guess i'll call them store of value uh use cases because it's very similar to the argument around you know bitcoins you know a store of value like gold you know digital you know the these sort of arguments i know this exists i think that works and i i i'm not arguing with that what i'm saying is that that for me for me i i think there's a bigger game afoot that we're all interested in right we're all interested in liberty and justice for all we're all interested in how do we reduce how do we mitigate this nudging oligarchy and nudging state which which aggrandizes which takes more and more control over our our bodies our minds that's the worst part the our autonomy yeah day after day after day and i i think the risk of focusing on the use cases that you're describing which i'll call it kind of the the gold store value use case you're describing they're absolutely right what i think we all have to be mindful of here is that the ability to be ghettoized the ability to for powerful states to patch you on the head and say oh that's right yes you go over here and you play with your little friends who you know also talk about gold all the time yes yes yes isn't that cute right that's what happens and that's been the life of the gold bug and i'm using that term that pejorative term i i think of myself as a bit of a gold bug right i believe in these use cases you're talking about for bitcoin right but what what you see in the community of people who follow gold and the like is they've been ghettoized it's a miserable way to live because basically what you find yourself doing is you find yourself in a sense and over time hoping for catastrophe right because you think oh i just you know man if the system really collapses i'll i'll be sitting pretty then and and it's like really dude that's they could they call it bitcoin citadel idea that like hell and winners are in the citadel and they just watch from their palaces yeah and and i've at least i've lived that to an extent and it's just it turns you into a grumpy grandpa it's it's a it turns you into a maximum using using crypto terms i think yeah yeah yeah so i i get the use cases you're describing i believe in the use cases you're describing i personally believe in the use cases you're describing i think though in my in my professional life and in the this the movement i'm trying to create though i'd like to i'd like to go after bigger game you know and and and that that that may be a a longer game i have to play it's a longer hunt right i don't think that that the battlefield i want to fight on is not really the battlefield of money per se uh because i do think it lends itself either to when the chips really get down just to be outright crushed on that battlefield i.e outlawed right but even before then you end up being you know like say ghettoized and and turned into this you know patch on the head and oh you stay over here and do that so so ben i have three things to throw at you but before i before i do just on the top on the topic of crypto to get your thoughts on before i do david i think wanted to say something maybe well i was actually just going to make a a distinction between so like like i said the the the bankless nation that we are trying to build out uh incorporates bitcoin but not not just bitcoin and i get it from i get it from the from the greater outside perspective you know i think people know the name ethereum but they're far less familiar with it and what it does and it's and what it does is not any one particular thing and in the ether in the ethereum world and the bitcoin world we kind of consider these two different nations that are similar but different and the the goal is to even even though that the nation state does have some control and influence and they can nudge perhaps people away from bitcoin and reduce its meaning it's also a race right because bitcoin is a global nation it's a global financial platform which every single nation state is is or every single citizenry of every single nation state can take part of and ethereum is even the same thing but ethereum is even more generalizable and so while uh i'll totally concede that like bitcoin because it is one singular thing it's perhaps weaker to the nation-states uh influence ethereum isn't one single thing it is a platform to host many things and so the the nation listen i'm really glad you brought that up because that that is where what you're describing is exactly where i would love let's call it the crypto community to use that kind of innocent silly term where i'd like to see things go right because because what what i'll use kind of a you know even kind of broader term i'll call it what i'll call is distributed ledger technologies right which underneath that we can include all different you know instantiations of that right what what all this does is i think attack in an incredibly elegant and powerful way what i think is the achilles heel of the nudging state and the nudging oligarchy what i think it does is it solves a problem that must be solved in order to go after the the the bigger game that i that i think is is is possible here and that is that it solves the problem of distributed trust solving this problem of distributed trust is at the core of the again highfalutin word movement i want to try to create around yes investing but but but more importantly a fuddy-duddy world citizenship right how how do you know that that person right that that that that touring entity that you're you know talking with on via email or whatever yeah how do you share trust here and and and finding that sort of permissionless and i know there there that's a that's a spectrum right where we can talk about that depending on what you know instantiation of distributed ledger you're you're talking about and then and then different use cases will have different places on that spectrum but but attacking that spectrum problem of distributed trust is at the core of what has to be accomplished to really get at the big the the big game that we want to play here so i get it right so so you know moving towards decentralized finance in whatever form and fashion man i am i am i am a total ally of that right what what i would like to see is i and and it's and it's difficult sometimes because there's not money directly associated with you can't trade this but i'm looking for finding these these decentralized ways of of i'll say taking back your identity taking back your data taking back uh you know your your your vote and your actions it's it's all underpinned by these distributed ledger technologies i think really get at this attack this question of distributed trust and that's why i'm so hopeful about the the the the energy and the shared goals here i'm i'm just i'm not particularly interested in playing on that battlefield of money per se and and and i and i get the 30 years ago the you know the the 26 year old ben would have been all over that right so i i get it right but but but but that's not where i am now and and and that's at the heart of i think we're you know you know not that i get misinterpreted but but the you know the issues i have around a lot of the the the finance applications of these distributed ledger technologies more generally so so so ben i i think you know so many millennials uh read your work and resonate with it because you know you're talking about issues that they care about um i totally get that you are um less bullish on the bankless kind of these bangladesh systems um usurping or replacing aspects of the nation state and the banks but maybe you could give us some advice because we think there is still some hope there and there are kind of three paths um i think by which we might be able to achieve it so i would be interested in your advice on these three paths and just thoughts given your game theory experience given your sort of narrative experience because those are the realms we're playing in so let me let me kind of give you these three different paths and then maybe comment on each of them so the first path is this that there's game theory involved between competing nation states and the way crypto economic systems work is there is incredible extraordinary value in getting in early right so us is the reserve currency of the world how much does china as a supernational power want the u.s to remain the reserve currency of the world so china adopts a decentralized currency it doesn't have to be china it could be russia it could be you know another a smaller uh country one nation state adopts it gives them an unfair advantage and forces the other nations to adopt it the way it gives them an unfair advantage is through uh price appreciation potentially um the first you know central bank who starts buying bitcoin what's that what's that going to what path will other central banks have to go down so there's this idea of game theory of nation states the second is this this is kind of how the internet was adopted it became so damn useful right so um did did centralized state governments want an open communication uh protocol did they want cryptography embedded in things like you know https not really but the us adopted it in the early 90s and you know essentially put it out pro regulation because it was good for the economy and because it would give them an unfair advantage relative to other nations so there's the potential we're seeing things like uh stable coins on ethereum that are reaching 10 billion dollars that are essentially bank issued uh we're seeing jp morgan with around stablecoin we're seeing um coinbase go to an ipo they become more embedded in our existing financial system and it becomes so damn useful that essentially nation states have to adopt it or they get left behind sort of like the internet they have no other choice other than to remain sort of like a north korea right so that's the second the third is this something we've been talking about which is narrative shift and this could be generational so there is there is definitely a sense of disenfranchise enfranchisement with uh younger generations um you know millennials feel it gen z is going to feel it even more so that we've missed the boat that they have missed the boat that um the boomers have kind of rigged the system essentially um god bless boomers we love them you know our parents are boomers uh but there's less opportunity today than there was in their generation so they rise up they switch the narrative the missionaries succeed dave and i would would consider ourselves missionaries of a sort for sure they succeed in uh bringing common knowledge that uh eth is money uh that's ethereum's cryptocurrency that bitcoin is valuable that because it's a non-sovereign store of wealth it's worth holding and uh you know it's necessary so essentially the millennials rise up so those are three paths that possibly this could take and kind of intersect with game theory like what's your what's your take on those what advice would you give you know the 26 year old you who was into crypto yeah so i i i think that of the three paths you described i think that the third path there is a variation on the third path that i think could be extremely powerful uh the first two paths you you described i think are are i i i think those are those are blocked paths and and so let me just quickly describe that first and then i'll go on to the third path which i think there's a viable version of that right so on the the game theory of nations you know talk about strong nations first like a china it's yes china would like to see the dollar as reserve currency dethroned but not because they really care about the dollar what they care about is their own currency what what they're looking to do is to supplant right the the us or protect their own centralized currency that's the goal that's their strategy that's their goal so adopting a decentralized currency uh is is not aligned with their goals right it's so it's it's not just taking down the dollar for saking taking down the dollar it's taking down the dollar to the degree that it either protects or elevates their own centralized currency for weaker nations that might say hey you know i could get some some you should describe competitive advantage by adopting a decentralized currency and and and the like you know thucydides you know he's the historian the peloponnesian war like 3000 years ago and again this whole notion of repeated patterns in human behavior one of the great lines from thucydides is that the strong do what they will the weak do as they must and let's take example of a country like switzerland right pretty strong powerful country right right there in the heart of europe right there in the heart of the international banking system for a long time they had a competitive advantage by not having a decentralized currency but by essentially having a decentralized banking system right so you'd get your swiss bank account and you would effectively be shielded from taxation and other controls that other countries wanted to put on the financial system well that's gone right because as soon as the u.s said hey you know what switzerland this is um someone said yeah you need to jump right that's what the u.s said sources and said how high right so so i think that first path and you know we can talk through the different permutations about you like i i really think that's a dead end the second path about i'll say being very useful i totally get the use cases i think that that can exist what happens when you allow or when jp morgan kind of takes you under their their wing come over here young fella let me let me show you how the game is played what happens is you become yet another table in the casino right and that's all you become right you're now oh we're going to set you up over here next to the blackjack section you're now table here in the the wall street casino and you can make money from that you've developed pai gal you say fantastic great congratulations right but that's all you're ever going to be you're going to be just another freaking game in the wall street casino so you're saying that they co-opted it essentially to co-opt the movement that's that that's right now now the third that that third approach you're talking about the narrative what what i think is possible in terms of the i call it again the distributed ledger the distributed trust solution narrative is to do some co-opting of your own to find an alliance with there are two ancient languages of investing there are two populations of investors you know use whatever kind of analogy you want to use here there are momentum investors growth investors same thing and there are value investors for the last decade for the last 11 years value investors who believe that fundamentals matter have been crushed just crushed for the for the dave port dory reasons right that's not what makes stocks move well what what's possible today is to say you know what let's play a different game right let's not play the the public market game of of of you know the casino here and you know the this lifting tide for all boats whether they're crappy companies or you know whether they're bankrupt companies like hertz or or really good companies that that have you know a great management team and cash flows and all that stuff that used to matter well you know what what what distributed ledger technologies what ethereum can play a role in particularly less of bitcoin but especially ethereum i think is in assigning value to and trust in private markets such that the fundamentals matter again meaning that i can trust what the stated fundamentals of this company are right it it in a way that i can trust it because they report it but it doesn't matter in public markets today i honestly think that there is an enormous reservoir of desire of hunger for an alternative financial i call it financial system an alternative financial network of investors and markets and trading that is outside of the public market casino utility that we have today and that what this your community has is the integral part of that so you know that's the kind of stuff that i'm i'm really thinking about and and writing some stuff on now because i think there is a natural alliance that can be cemented through the right narratives between value investors who are as fed up and discouraged with public markets as the gen z and y and millennium that you're talking about when you're talking about there's no path for us in this the system we've got i think there's a real potential marriage or alliance there that could could shake the existing financial system um and and really create something interesting so you know that's that's really how what i'm working on right now and i i think that that third avenue you described i think it's got legs so ben you think there's a chance like it's not too bad i mean you think yeah and i don't mean that in the dumb and dumber way right where you guys are telling me there's a chance yeah that's not what i mean i i can see this i can see this that the you know it's just that i mean like so the oligarchs been they feel so entrenched at the moment and more and more you're powerful so we've got nasdaq reaching all-time highs and we've got the prospect of 20 to 28 million americans being evicted that's happening at the exact same time how does that happen like it's you know uh bankless and and crypto is sort of our escape hatch right it's the thing that we are investing in in order to beat back this all our uh oligarchy but i guess my question is like is there hope is it too late like no there's there's absolutely hope and and i tell you why and and this is the because you know i started writing epsilon theory seven years ago i was a pretty dark place right and it was like what the hell what the hell is going on with the world and to start writing this and send it out to 100 people and then again through word of mouth there are a hundred thousand people it's like and this is you know before your time but it's the old you know police song where you know you you toss that message in a bottle into the ocean and then you come back the next morning and there are a thousand bottles that have washed back up on your shore right that's what my experience with epsilon theory has been and it's been the most intrinsically powerful and rewarding thing that's ever happened to me and and that's why i tried and and i think that you guys are experiencing some of the same thing right where you're you're saying look guys that you realize you're not alone there are tens of thousands there are hundreds of thousands of not just people right but successful people people who are in this world and they are successful in this world but they are not of this world right they they're look they they're not happy with how things are going either they know that this isn't right and they're willing to hey you know what let's do something about it so that's what i mean about finding your pack the pack is there it's just that you can't recognize them right so so look we've got you know epsilon theory's got subscribers in every it's a kind of a game we play you know name a financial institution anywhere in the world you know a hedge fund an asset manager a big bank a central bank i i will guarantee you i've got at least one or two subscribers there that's amazing now but it's like fight club right i mean we're everywhere but the difference here is okay to to talk about you know being part of epsilon theory it's okay to talk about being part of the bankless nation right you don't have to keep it secret but the problem is you don't know who these other people are maybe it's the person sitting next to you in your cubicle maybe it's not and it's it's it's finding and it's linking people all around the world and what i'll call is an epistemic community a community of knowledge not just just a community because oh i sit next to you in an office this is a incredibly powerful thing it it it's it's new to the world the ability to create these epistemic communities but man this is how the world changes and so i'm i'm really optimistic about the what i know this sounds crazy because i write very pessimistically about the power again of this nudging state in nudging oligarchy but man it's happening i and and i and i feel it i see it it's it might been my own life i suspect it's in your guys lives as well you you see how this grows and spreads and how there's a hunger and a desire for it and so i i i'm not pessimistic about where this all ends up i just want to be very thoughtful in how we fight this so that you know we don't get wiped out on a battlefield that has got really bad terrain for us i don't want to charge a machine gun nest you know okay so not leading by telling congress that uh crypto is money it's here to replace you don't lead with that that's what you're saying exactly exactly but i think i absolutely you know it's not the dumb and dumber chance i i think there are real avenues here of of creating alliances of similarly both disaffected yet successful in this world and having you know good hearted people who want the same thing which is a world of liberty and justice for all right you know imagine that and you know it's going to take a long time but man it's happening so so ben you spoke about these two types of investors uh one of which are the value investors who have have been disenfranchised right if you've been a value investor you've been uh looking for the wrong wavelength and uh what's been going and crypto and one of the reasons why we wanted to bring you on because so much of what you talk about is so incredibly relevant to crypto which is the narrative right crypto is primarily narrative at the moment but baked into the narrative of crypto is a return to value investing because of the way that uh bitcoin and ethereum and and all the sub protocols on ethereum are inside out you can see everyone has access to the same amount of information what is baked into the narrative of you know investing in ethereum investing in assets on ethereum is that you are actually given the assurances that you need and the information data that you need to allow a resurgence of value investing and so that's exactly what i'm saying that's right so you're sharing these same principles that there is some bedrock that you can trust right and and for value investors is the fundamentals of a company you know can i trust that and moreover can i trust that that work i put into understanding that that that matters and won't go away for for what for what it for what it the value that people assign to that right and it's the same thing with with with you know ethereum or bit and bitcoin as well there's there's there's a bedrock there that you can point to and say okay this you can trust right is is this whatever you want to call it proof of work or whatever you want to call it say this exists i can trust it that's the bedrock i'm going to build on and that sort of shared principle combined with using the right words and right language hey man i i like saying i think that's got legs well i think we need some d5 missionaries who can speak the fundamental uh investors right because that's a cohort that would resonate with what we're talking about the transparency less power to the bankers like a more market-driven economy um we'll get there you know i think the the crypto anarchy uh narrative is you know for some people it's not for this group though and uh yeah it's uh it's part of adapting that narrative um ben what one more thing i've got to ask you so um this v-shaped recovery in equities like were you surprised how is this happening is it going to continue to happen so you know we saw the same thing happen in 2008 uh and i wrote a note about this you know what i guess what people forget is that in march of 2008 the the market was down about about 20 percent and at the end of march the us government took an investment bank bear stearns they executed it they um they again i use this phrase and talk about lehman this really happened with bear stearns they took it out into the street and they shot it in the head and they gave the carcass literally the office building to jp morgan and that was supposed to be it systemic risk was off the table bear stearns was the bad apple and by eliminating bear stearns all was well and then in fact what you saw in markets was markets went right back up to where they were when they started the year in in 2008 and you know if you weren't living it you tend to forget that stuff right because it you know we remember 2008 oh my god markets ended the year down 50 right and that's true but in may of that year markets were back at their peak for the year is you know this classic v-shaped recovery in markets now the answer of course was well bear stearns wasn't just a bad apple it was all the big banks and then starting in may and then really accelerating in the late summer the markets collapsed to we know what happened in september and october so would i if if we were thinking about this you know in 2008 i would say uh this is this is just what happened then uh v-shaped recovery because systemic risk is off the table quote unquote but you know we're we're we're heading back down the difference today is that this is that three body problem that we kind of never quite got around to but we'll save for another time yeah the central bank intervention in these markets is so much greater today to dave portnoy's point right this is the difference between today and 12 years ago that the central bank is there to actually buy right and to to lend money directly to corporations and if push comes to shove they'll just buy stocks they'll just buy stocks like japan already does and the swiss national stock must go up and yes stocks will go up right if the central bank is buying it so you know that's that's the difference today i so i don't so the v-shaped recovery did not just surprise me because that's what happened in 2008 and that's what always happens when people say oh it's a short-term thing we'll have some solution around the corner i don't think that's the case when it comes to covet 19. i don't think a solution is around the corner i think that things are getting worse and will continue to get worse in the united states and other countries not in europe but but i think it's i think it gets a lot worse before i think it gets any better here in the us how does that impact the stock market should make it go down whether it will will depend is you know will the fed say oh yeah i guess we'll stop now or will they do more and my guess is they'll do more and that's the common knowledge we have today and you know that's why the stock market stays up it's tricky tricky to predict in fact impossible to predict that's what the three body problem says and and by the way we never quite got to it we won't have time today but there ben you did a great description of the three body problem on our friend dimitri's podcast and hidden forces we will include that in the show notes there's a good section in there yeah so yeah we won't we won't leave the bankless nation hanging on that they yeah well you guys got the uh the the island of the uh the blue eyed tribe so yes you've got will be a reference a little different yeah okay so um communities from uh uh you know last thing i i i think we want to quickly talk about um we've been talking about how governments have failed us um but communities are the hope and that's the future one thing that you are doing with n95 masks is getting them to healthcare workers can you talk about getting ppe to healthcare workers and what you guys are doing on that well well thanks for bringing that up it's something that's very important to me and it it and and i mean that both for what we're doing directly which is you know to date we've we've bought and we've distributed about a hundred thousand well more about 110 uh n95 and kn95 masks these medical respirators to more than a thousand hospitals and clinics and fire departments and prisons and shelters uh you know all across the country about about 46 states we've sent them and we we don't send them in big batches we send anywhere from 50 to 200 masks directly to doctors and nurses and emts and social workers who have an urgent need for this because we live in this freaking trickle-down society and it's not just trickle-down when it comes to money it's also trickle down when it comes to ppe you know the the medical supplies that these heroes these who are fighting this battle on the front lines need to protect themselves so we we started a charity to to to raise the money and then we we we buy the masks from you know all over the world and you know it's like an underground railroad of masks we set up and then we we deliver them directly to you know the the people who are really needing it and i and i um i always want to talk about it because it's hey i think it's it's it's really doing a lot of good in the world but b is an example of what we can all do right we we all think we have to participate on some grand scale right and and that's what the oligarchs and the states want you to think the fact is that we can all make a difference from the bottom up we really can particularly if we find our pack we find it doesn't take a lot of people it's it's your family it's your friends it's you know it's just getting five or six people together and saying i'm gonna do something in my community to make a difference for the other human beings who are in this foxhole and and maybe they'll have very different politics and maybe they'll have very different whatever race class it doesn't matter and this is how the world really changes it doesn't change from the top down because the sociopaths take it over it changes from the bottom up and and it's it's not sexy it's not glamorous and it takes a long time but this is how the world really does change is why the work you guys are doing is so important to create this pack this nation like you're calling it it's why i think frankly what i'm doing is important too in the anyway i get passionate about this stuff i i can go on and on i'll just leave it at that find your pack work from the bottom up and watch how the world changes because it's not just virus that's contagious it's good works like this it's even more contagious and um anyway man that's that's why i'm so happy to be on you guys show it because i i think you guys are are doing exactly the same thing and getting this message out here yeah we're going to change the world absolutely nations and communities and and everything that we try and organize people by is all underpinned by passion and purpose and so then to to the degree that that you are leading that charge we will absolutely follow you so thank you in that you got it man thanks for having me on this was a blast ben it's been a lot of fun bankless nation that was dr ben hunt we have common values liberty and justice for all bankless is about a money system for all going bankless is how you join your pack as ben mentioned and i've got a strange feeling that our paths with epsilon theory and ben's work and the bankless nation are going to intersect in some way in the future there's just too many commonalities too much common value that um common value system that um i like i would not be surprised at all actions for today one thing you need to do is sign up for epsilon theory that's ben's newsletter it's you know kindred values and uh it's a fantastic read every time it comes out in my inbox i am all about reading everything that ben and his fellow writers uh are writing about also take a look at his n95 program the epsilon theory and 95 program they've talked about will include links to both the second thing you can do is send this episode to someone who's crypto curious that's that's how you invite your friends and family to the bankless pack give them some exposure if they are seeing the issues that you're seeing with the with the nudging oligarchy in the nudging state this is definitely the community for them last thing we need david i saw that we're at about 70 five-star reviews on itunes uh can we get to 100 you know in the next month or so what do you think hey you know it depends on the bankless nation if the bankless nation will get us to a hundred it's it's in their hands and so if you please could go to wherever you listen to podcasts and give us those five star reviews so we can grow the bankless nation louder and prouder than ever before that is your duty that is as a patriots of the bankless world that is what we need you to do so if you could go ahead and please do that we would greatly appreciate it and the bankless nation would thank you as always guys risks and disclaimers we talked a little bit about bitcoin and eth both are risky crypto is risky none of this is financial advice you could lose what you put into crypto but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are excited that you are with us on the journey thanks a lot
