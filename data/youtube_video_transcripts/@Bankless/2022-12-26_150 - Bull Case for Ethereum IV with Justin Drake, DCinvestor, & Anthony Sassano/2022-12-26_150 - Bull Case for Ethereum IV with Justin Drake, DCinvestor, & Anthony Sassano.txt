[Music] welcome bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more thankless guys the greatest ways to go bankless is to hear the Bold case for eth and then I think at the end of this episode if you are bullish to do something about those bullish feelings we have the bullish panel here the ultimate bullish panel Justin Drake Anthony sassano DC investor we've done this like every six months or so David uh since uh late 2020 the youth Bowl case and this is uh this is another episode of this type the installment number four and Ryan while you were doing that intro you said this is Ryan Chan Adams here with David Hoffman and we are here to help you become bullish eth because if you're not already is that what I said no but you should have but you should have uh because that is what this episode is designed to do we want to get back to our roots and get back to what we are good at which is becoming bullish uh and I think everyone is uh perhaps scared right now if you're a first cycler um but and they're flipping they're going from optimistic to pessimistic they're just like pessimistic on the future of crypto things hurt right now I would just like to remind listeners that when the prices are in the tank that is the time to be bullish uh the time to be bullish is not actually at the top is it's at the bottom it's when the most of the opportunity lies uh and so I think out of out of all the installments of the bowl case for ethereum that we've ever done uh Ryan I think this might be my favorite uh this is Justin Drake's first uh full case for ethereum uh I think he's definitely invited back to is fantastic and it makes like uh completes the completes the panel because he has technical reasons to be bullish which is super important to to kind of ground this and then also uh well we'll get into it his description though of the total market cap was just crazy chills um some housekeeping before we get into this episode as well Dave and I are revamping our sponsor strategy in 2023 and uh we're putting a focus more on a long-term projects that are playing long-term games so we're really excited to be building a relationship with uh Kraken David Kraken is one of the few exchanges um I still trust with my Fiat trades doesn't mean I keep a lot of funds on an exchange of course you can always go bankless but when I'm trading and you need to go from Fiat to crypto um like Kraken is one of the few exchanges left standing it's why we wanted to strike up a partnership with them going into uh 2023 so you'll hear more about that in the future they've implemented proof of reserves before anyone asks them to and and I plan to take more of my business personally to uh to Kraken in 2023 thanks to Kraken for uh for sponsoring this and with that bankless Nation listener I hope you are ready to get bullish first in order to get bullish you need tools to get bullish so we're going to talk about some of these tools to help you go bankless and then we'll begin the bull case for ethereum episode number four happy holidays guys trufi is d5's largest credit protocol connecting Global lenders with institutional grade lending opportunities trufi

on the episode on the fourth episode of the bull case we have Justin Drake Mr Ultra San found money himself the guy who created the most bullish meme to ever come out of the entire crypto space Justin Drake welcome to the show thanks for having me and as always Ultra bullish as always coming up next in the left corner we got Anthony cesano the man who is literally the most bullish person about ether he is so bullish that he makes a 30 minute YouTube video every single day because he can't stop talking about ethereum and then after he's done doing that he writes another newsletter also about ethereum because he is so goddamn bullish Anthony cesano welcome back hey David then Ryan thanks for having me I'm also Ultra bullish also bullish on nfts he's got an nft portfolio that blows all of ours out of the water yet his ether portfolio is also just as strong DC welcome back to the show thanks for having me on guys excited to join today's discussion uh I'm really looking forward to this one guys I think this is going to be some great end of year content on what was a very destructive year in crypto uh yet the ethereum blockchain continues to produce blocks I want to start the conversation here because this is something that has been a frequent theme about ethereum up until recently uh that I want to start this conversation with and that is the general conversation of has ethereum fulfilled its original promises that it made even before it was in a live blockchain in 2015. Haz ethereum fulfilled some of its original promises are We Done Yet uh Justin can I can I start with you on this one yeah for sure so the way that I see it is that uh you know vitalik when ethereum got started was a bitcoiner you know he basically wanted to see Bitcoin evolved and I I was a bitcoiner in 2013 and I had the same feeling the reason I was building on bitcoin specifically is that I had this you know Common understanding this almost social contract um that you know Bitcoin would evolve and I felt rugged and I feel vitalik kind of also fell through again so from that perspective I think ethereum has fulfilled its mission in be being like the continuous place where Innovation is is pushed to its boundaries and the the frontier of what's possible is pushed forward I guess you know now that we have some hindsight seven years of hindsight I think we can kind of more crisply Define kind of the the end game kind of the mission of ethereum and for me it's you know ethereum is a is meant to be a settlement layer for the internet of value and I think in order to get to that end game we still have a lot of work to do you know on the order of maybe one decade but I think the most important thing is that we we have the culture we have the people we have the the mentality um you know that that is basically Innovation friendly and will get us to this very ambitious end game Anthony you came into the crypto space a little bit later than Justin I believe you came in 2016 2017. so you're fully aware of the the promises that ethereum has been been making uh ever since it was originally accepted how do you feel about where ethereum is on its original intended purpose yeah I I think I agree a lot with what Justin said there I also think that ethereum has been executing on its long-term roadmap it's just taken longer than I think anyone would have thought especially things like major upgrades like prefer steak right that had been talked about since day one and it really only I guess like fully was realized uh this year right in September when we did the merge so obviously it's not something that happens overnight in ethereum when we have these roadmap items that are kind of major changes that have been promised for for quite a while but I think we eventually get there which is I guess one of the reasons why I'm so bullish on ethereum is that we can actually ship right but in terms of I guess ethereum's changing use cases and narratives and what it was known for over time it has changed pretty substantially right I mean originally it was called this world computer where people could execute this arbitrary code on and build whatever they wanted on and then obviously we ran into lots of issues with scalability and and we didn't actually know what people were going to build or people were going to use D5 was I mean talked about here and there I mean I think vitalik actually was talking about Dave if I still back then but it wasn't called D5 back then and I think we had a general kind of uh or at least the people back then had a general idea of what they wanted to see built on these things but I think some things got way more popular than others uh like Dows and web 3 stuff didn't really take off like if I did and I think that was due to scalability and also just the the Frameworks not being in place for those things but as I said ethereum does take a while to ship certain things but eventually it does ship and I think that's very important and I think that the what ethereum is useful for has evolved has evolved so much over time that it's actually come to a point now where we understand that a lot better and we can actually see like a kind of a clear path rather than Meandering through the many use cases that we were talking about we actually see okay you know this works this works this works you know how do we optimize for for these use cases but how do we ensure that we can actually have new use cases pop up uh over time as well DC as one of ethereum's heaviest power users how do you feel ethereum has stood up uh over the years well I think it's I think it's stood up well and I think to start with Anthony's point you know there was this discussion around ethereum it certainly is a world computer early on and I think at that point people had a different conception of perhaps what ethereum especially ethereum layer one might become I think it's fair to acknowledge that the vision for layer one has shifted a bit and I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily I think it's accepting the realities of limitations in the technology I think it's accepting the role that ethereum can play in the current environment um and you know a lot of Bitcoin Maximus would probably crucify ethereum for for for being bold enough to say that because like oh you didn't deliver every promise you ever had in the white paper although if you go back and read the white paper by the way it's actually aged really well a lot of the most interesting use cases that we focus on today were actually identified in that white paper um but where I think ethereum has succeeded is it's become the most important multi-asset decentralized Ledger of record in the entire world and I think that is a huge accomplishment and even through this crop of new layer ones that came into the market during this cycle I think that record kind of remains unchallenged as far as opportunities and things that ethereum still needs to do look ethereum does need to scale further and it needs to be more accessible to more people and for more use cases and I think we are seeing that through the heavy activity that's starting to emerge on on ethereum layer twos in the in the scaling roadmap that still exists for ethereum layer one so I you know what what is long-term success for ethereum layer one I think if we ever reach up point where nobody wants to change it anymore then it's probably succeeded in what it meant to do and I do think that day might come at some point maybe decades from now because things are being built on top of it and people don't want a layer that might be changing um but we're a long way from there and there's still a lot for ethereum to do and so I'm excited about that as well DC you mentioned kind of a pivot and like a little bit right and maybe some pushback from other communities on ethereum pivoting in what ways do you think it's pivoted from maybe its original Vision right I know there's this meme of the world computer I'd argue that was always a dumb meme like that was never what people meant by a world a computer of like being like a decentralized Amazon AWS but in what ways do you think that the critics have a point on this about sort of a pivot and maybe not living up to its promises I think in the earlier days there was a lot of perhaps delusion about how much activity layer one could accommodate particularly um and and so for a lot of these newer monolithic blockchains that have emerged over the past let's say four years that have promised higher transaction throughput and cheaper transactions and so on they make huge sacrifices in terms of decentralization they make huge sacrifices in terms of liveness and ability for people to use them at certain times when it really matters ethereum has made a different set of trade-offs ethereum layer one is like a honey badger it's like a tank it's it doesn't go down it's it's never really gone down and that is what the community and the engineers prioritize more than everything else but I think so I think that vision of like hey everybody's going to be on layer one around the whole world and we're all going to be buying coffee for you know super cheap transactions on layer one that's not realistic I do think the shift to thinking about ethereum more as a settlement layer has been a productive one I think it's kind of changed the conception of how people think about it a little bit but I think you know now ethereum is is really emerging as this trust flare as this base layer of trust that these other layers then build upon so I don't know if that's necessarily a pivot I think it's we can call it a refinement but it's you know I think there's probably some change there and again I don't think that was a bad thing so a question for for all the Bulls and maybe I'll start with Anthony on this so like uh 2022 like what a freaking crazy year that was uh and yet there's an element where I feel like I'm ending uh 2022 and it's almost like a Michael Bay movie like there's like explosions and cars blowing up and like airplanes crashing behind me in a helicopter has just gone down uh you know Fireballs whirling to the sky and like we're just kind of the ethereum communities like walking away from that like like everything's fine clean crisp soup sunglasses on just like walking ahead and you know I I guess the reason for that is is sort of like look eth the asset didn't take a massive hit uh when we look at prices I mean it is um down but it is down comparable to what uh Bitcoin is from all-time high anyway like last time it was actually up one more percent versus and we're talking about like the 75 from all-time high range which like people who are new to the cycle like oh my God 75 were like the bear Market okay it's just a flesh wound but then also like um other communities are down far harder like alt-layer ones are completely wrecked I mean we're already talking about down 95 plus from all-time high I also think that um look if you kept custody of your keys and used defy you didn't get absolutely wrecked if you went with some of kind of like even members of the Bitcoin Community who are like yeah this crypto bank is probably fine well it turned out not to be fine if you gave someone your custody of your private Keys like you're also feeling the pain and so D5 decentralization ethereum the merge last year like it feels kind of okay in the ethereum community coming out of 2022 and yet there's a massive amount of Destruction behind us Anthony what do you say to that sentiment do you think there is that me being too bullish or like what do you think about all this no I think the sentiment is is very accurate and it's funny when like the analogy that you use because so much stuff happened this year that was negative and then we had the merge which was like the most positive event in ethereum's history happening among all that negative uh that that was happening to the rest of the crypto ecosystem and I know in in Bitcoin our land they love to make this distinction between like Bitcoin and crypto right and as much as I kind of hate them for doing that because they put ethereum in the crypto bucket and they don't never make the distinction about ethereum I think there's something to that because there's a lot of crypto that is hot air that is just crap right we've seen a lot of it blow up and there are things that are kind of labeled crypto that shouldn't be like a lot of these C5 services that people say oh this is crypto I was like No it's it's not crypto right it's it's kind of a service that works with crypto but it's not what we know as crypto right the on-chain stuff that we do um the networks behind uh this industry so I think from that perspective you know sometimes the Bitcoin is have a point that there should be a little bit of a distinction there between those things but in saying that uh I I think on top of all of that as well in terms of of Market action yeah I mean it's it's quite surprising uh to an extent of like how I guess resilient eighth has been I think for a lot of people it's not surprising to me I should be clear like I I fully expected it to play out like this given the uh position ether's in right now not just on the fundamental side but also with erp1559 and the merge having that massive issuance reduction which definitely impacted uh AIDS performance this bear Market I mean if without that I think post FTX collapse eth would have gone to Triple digits again it would have been pushed down by all that extra minor cell pressure because miners were capitulating on the Bitcoin side and there's no reason to believe they wouldn't have been doing the same thing on the ethereum side so I think that a lot of the fundamental work that has been done has come to home to roost so to speak like at least there's years in the making as I mentioned earlier ethereum has a long road map it takes years to do things but it does things that are extremely impactful and continue to impact the network and the community and the ecosystem over longer periods of time whereas a lot of these Old Town ones they try to take shortcuts right they they tried to get to a a position where they think that they can be as dominant as ethereum and sometimes they can get to a position where they grow really really quickly right both on the price side and and see some kind of adoption maybe that's because they have a massive liquidity mining program but then it's all short-term games it doesn't last very long it doesn't even last a year really I mean we saw the Altair one Mania happen basically the second half of last year and then we saw it all fall apart uh fall apart this year and it fall apart in a very spectacular way not just on the prices as you said a lot of them are down 95 but their network activity is down even more and even the the biggest competitors that people considered to be you know actual ethereum Killers like we always hear that term but people were really serious about it this time like no you know ethereum's finally done it they've failed to scale so now these other networks are going to take over I mean just to name one Solana for example uh they have less kind of tvl than a change that I haven't even heard of before so like to put that in perspective Solana last year was considered the eth killer it was going to be the thing that finally dethroned ethereum but as DC mentioned these other ones have taken shortcuts they've compromised on on specific things and Solano is definitely a poster child of that compromising on decentralization to achieve this scale and and in my opinion they've gone the wrong way about it and I think we've seen that but you know you can take the the other side of that and say okay well this is just Solana and the other Hotel ones trial by fire and I'm like uh I don't really buy that I I feel like ethereum is in such a strong position now ethereum is solving its scalability issues and it's it's never it's never just been about scalability it's been about so many other things but ethereum is in such a strong position compared to what it was last bear Market I mean 2018 and 2019 was was very brutal for ethereum and for ether's an asset but this time around people can see that as as Ryan said is not down uh like anywhere near the amount the other uh the other the other coins are down right and it's even up or performing better than Bitcoin I mean the BTC ratio is flat on the uh in 29 the 2018 and 2019 it went down like 90 plus percent which was just crazy compared to now where it's flat on the year so taking all that into account uh ethereum is in an incredibly strong position even though there has been so many blow-ups this year of just all the crap like C5 and within the on-chain ecosystem and other altel ones as you mentioned uh yeah it's kind of hard for me not to be like stupidly bullish on ethereum it I was really bullish in the bull market I'm even more bullish in the bear Market just given how resilient ethereum has been we should have warned you guys at the outset um this is uh not for those who do not wish to be bullish on eth this entire episode we should have put a full warning on this but um Justin what's your take on this question do you think Anthony over here is just kind of grave dancing uh you know is he like other odd ones down but my favorite asset is is not down as bad and you know that's a good thing uh or uh or do you think there's Merit to what he's saying here right so I guess one thing I want to do is kind of maybe highlight the the good stuff about the fear before talking bad about the competitors and I think I would agree with with sasano that you know and and and and and and you Ryan though you know we've come out unscathed now not only have we had a perfect uptime such Genesis we've never had downtime 100 this almost never happens in software and it's even better up time than Bitcoin but you know now we're in a position where we've also removed a lot of the fudge you know there was this execution risk fat around the around the merge and that's completely gone and not only has it gone but we're in a position where we have five consensus clients none of which had really any issues and the fact that we have so much redundancy makes ethereum even stronger than it's been in the last seven years so one of the reasons why we've had so much uptime in the last seven years is because we've had two clients we were we had gef and parity and sometimes geff would go down and parity would would uh kind of be the fallback and and vice versa but now we we're in a position where we have five clients and like arguably now ethereum is like potentially the most secure piece of software infrastructure ever built um now in terms of um kind of coming out unscathed another thing that I'll note is that um you know if you're continues to be a talent magnet right I'm just seeing this year after year after year and not only that like the it it it has a very low churn in the sense that all the settlers all the people who really understand are here to stay and not only that but it seems to be attracting talent beyond its its reach right we have uh you know the Phantom wallet for example from Solana and I'm I'm seeing more and more projects kind of regrouping around around ethereum now in terms of the competition and all the other stuff I actually think it's good from an experimentation standpoint right because some of the technical ideas for example we're able to inspire ourselves and and use that to improve improve ethereum so you know bitcoiners have this kind of this meme or what he's had this meme in 2015 or whatever saying like ethereum is the test net of Bitcoin um and this has failed miserably because they've been completely incapable of you know even copying one single you know good idea from ethereum but I think we're in a position where you know we can really use the the rest of the ecosystem as as inspiration and uh you know I'm very grateful for that in terms of kind of definitely if we could actually hang on that one moment really quick because uh the one in an elaboration of that Meme that many many bitcoiners would echo in my early days that I remember is that they would say that if it's useful it will eventually come to bitcoin if something else that's not on bitcoin some other chain invents something then we can just apply it to bitcoin uh that was a frequent meme that they they were chanting uh and it this meme I think is a great meme it's a great narrative uh and it's something that it does speak to some very fundamental truth about the way that that Network effects in the crypto industry work and I think that this meme is correct philosophically uh because of just a broad aggregation of network effects and this is what has always made me so bullish about a general purpose turning complete fully expressive blockchain because that Meme can actually become true on ethereum and so this meme started to wane off from the Bitcoin space and it started to become true with ethereum zcash shielded transactions oh we've got that that's Aztec uh if you guys remember EOS we tried that on ethereum it was Loom Network turns out that idea didn't really work there's so many things that has been created in the generalized at the crypto space that eventually got plugged into ethereum and this was one of the things I will always give bitcoiners credit to correct in ideology correct in philosophy missed the execution like Miss just the wrong chain and so Justin I'll hand the mic back to you to add anything to that 100 like bitcoiners have all the memes correct they are Visionaries they're able to see a decade into the future but unfortunately they they don't have the fundamentals to back it now in terms of you know being able to copy ideas from the ecosystem there's various layers at which these ideas can be incorporated they could be incorporated at the service layer you know basically the the centralized layer like the for example you know we've seen lending in Bitcoin we've seen all sorts of you know C5 that and and there has been Innovation at that layer um I think the other two layers would be the application layer now unfortunately Bitcoin is you know this it's utxo model with almost no scripting it's just completely inadequate for for the application layer like people have tried to build stacks on top of it people have tried to build the all sorts of of of hacks it just doesn't work like in theory you could use IO which is like indistinguishability obfuscation a very very fancy piece of technology and you can run the evm on top of Bitcoin but that will happen for another maybe three decades um and and um and then like the final place where kind of innovation can come in is that layer one in in consensus and you know it the way that I I think of Bitcoin is basically a social experiment in in premature you know ossification at the consensus layer and and and so really like the only place where they can innovate is that these like really higher levels you know including the meme layer this is why maybe they're so good because this is the only thing that they can work on um meaningfully whereas you know we have an ability to uh to to to to evolve the layer one over time and we have this notion of escape velocity at the application layer so all like the the centralized lending all of that stuff you know actually we're a we're capable of building much more decentralized Alternatives uh within the application layer DC I wanted to throw this one to you because you're the veteran investor in the room uh and uh as someone who's like sharpened their teeth in uh the traditional equities markets before coming to crypto and then seeing all the shenanigans that we do in the crypto room uh one of one of the things that I try and convince people who are like um thinking about leaving the space right now or like they they have flipped from bullish to bearish and right now at the price of Thirteen hundred dollar ether and like 17 000 Bitcoin they're now bearish uh my response to them is like well no no no this is like it's it's it's all the pains already passed like this is the time to be bullish Tech you actually wanted to be bearish at 4 800 ether that would have been the time to be bearish uh and so this it's time to put on the bullish cap but I want to also draw some attention because I know we are just you know all all you know five of us here have uh uh a decent amount of our portfolio in ether uh and we're going to talk about that for the rest of the podcast but I just want to play devil's advocate for one moment in that same vein where like okay Solana outlayer ones they're all wrecked right they're all down well is the is the risk to reward of ether right now justified in comparison to some of the deals that we can see in the public markets in the crypto space for example cardano at 11 billion dollars is 14 times cheaper than ether polka dot at 6 billion dollars is 26 times cheaper than ether Solana at 5 billion dollars 31 times cheaper than eth Avalanche at 4 billion dollars 40 times cheaper than ether so in this moment at the depths of the bear Market when perhaps some of the these Altair ones are as wrecked as they were ever ever been is the risk to reward for ether justified in your opinion and not only do I think it's Justified I think it's actually far superior to all of the assets that you just mentioned despite the fact that they've had bigger drawdowns that's no guarantee that they're going to make up the magnitude of those drawdowns and I you know first I want to start with the broader Point um crypto goes through cyclical bear markets it is an asset class with a lot of potential there's a lot of potential on what's being built on networks like ethereum and when you have that kind of potential Market excitement tends to sometimes get ahead of itself that's why we get these really exciting bull markets we are now seeing the reverse side of that and the consequences of that are we are seeing the bear where we we have people who are in in this space as Taurus they've left you know we've had this spectacular collapse of multiple trading funds and now FTX um you know one of the most prominent consumer exchanges it's bad I mean it's definitely bad just from a market sentiment point of view not from a fundamentals point of view but from a market sentiment point of view things are very bad it reminds me very much of the early days like 2013 when Mount gox kind of got it got hacked and had their issues um the market just lost confidence you had a lot of lower information people get fleshed out um so I want to put that on the table but I think that what differentiates ether from all of those networks that you just discussed is that ethereum is a successful multi-cycle asset ethereum is a network that has proven itself time and time again and continues to gain users it continues to gain developers sure interest is down during this bearish period but ethereum isn't going anywhere I actually feel a lot more confident about ethereum and ether this year than I did in 2019. in 2019 you guys all know we're all there together it was it was bad that was rough times and there were some existential questions like was ethereum gonna survive I mean I had confidence but it was just that it was confidence I didn't have that degree of Surety I feel like with ether and ethereum now that Surety is much much stronger with a lot of these other networks look I'm not saying that they're all going to die or go to zero but some of them very well could right some of them most of those are first cycle assets to the extent that they aren't first cycle assets they never delivered anything of value before the cycle and you could argue some of them didn't even deliver anything of value this cycle to be perfectly honest not to be too harsh but you know when I look at ether and ethereum I think it emerges with actually a much stronger and more exceptional and unique value proposition ether right now is the most decentralized programmable asset in the world period we've we've taken this in incredible step of moving it to proof of stake which was one of the big clouds hanging over ether and ethereum like is it going to successfully do this um we did it and we did it without a hitch we've moved ethereum to to become a network that is economically secured by Ether which is also incredible so I suspect that during the next cycle ether is actually going to get a lot more Market interest it's going to be sought after by Financial types who want to earn a yield from the staking it's going to be sought after by people who want an alternative store of value to something like Bitcoin which is secured by proof of work and so I just and it's going to become an increasingly popular medium of exchange for things like nfts and other digital goods and services so I I'm I'm hyper bullish and after the FTX collapse I kind of came out on Twitter and I said I'm I'm going to start buying again now I've been dollar cost averaging one to two times a week since then um and do I think all the pain is over it's really hard for me to say that with certainty we could definitely see like spikes down we could even see new lows but for me I'm not gonna try to play that game and the the example I know David you saw this tweet when I put it out there a few weeks ago and I said do you think the people who bought ether a hundred twenty dollars are upset that they didn't buy it at 80. and I I'm one of those people I didn't buy ether ad during the last bear Market but I did I bought a lot between 100 and 120 and I didn't worry about the fact that I didn't buy it at 80. so you may have missed 800 I don't know if that's coming back right now you can buy it for 1200 maybe you'll be able to buy it for cheaper more expensive tomorrow but I think that you've got to have like a long-term Outlook if you're in the space right now it's so funny by the way DC that the numbers are so similar just 10x right rather than 80 to 120 it's you know 800 is the kind of the low range to you know 1200 right now it's like literally the same type of decision um but but I just want to Zone in on that DC so are you saying the return the risk reward ratio of a thousand dollars into eth is higher than say Solana which is a 31 times cheaper by my by my calculus yes and if I felt differently I would buy Solana but um and I'm not saying but but there's there are clouds that are hanging over some of these coins right and I'm not trying to slam anybody else's Investments or anything like that but one of the structural factors that we have seen over the past probably a year at least with the FTX collapse part of what happened there was Sam bankman freed and Company we're selling their consumer deposits of ether and Bitcoin okay I mean in the flows while we don't have direct visibility into the flows what we know is um a lot of money is gone and we know that he had a huge incentive to pump up the value of Soul of ftt of serum of some of the other Sam coins if you will and so that structural buying that structural selling it was structural in the sense of he was unloading billions of dollars of those customer assets so that he could you know do whatever he wanted to do that seller is gone we don't have minor selling anymore um right we are going to have an unlock of staking deposits but even that will be a one-time event and it's not clear how many people are going to move their coins at that point so I I a lot of structural selling that was in the market before has just evaporated and so I can't like just being dispassionate looking at the market I'm like I can't not buy ether when it's below the 2017-2018 all-time high given how much has happened in this market since then Anthony you have uh you and I have talked about this subject so I want to throw a similar question to you I recently put out a tweet not too long ago uh saying hey good luck to the Solana Community out there this is when FTX was imploding uh people were really realizing that it was going to be a ton of Soul cell pressure I said good luck to the Solana Community I hope this is your 80th moment a strong and Community committed communities waiting on the other side of this and what I what I really meant by this was that I remember when we had uh Amendment all of us here in this room and a few others all had our 80 eighth moment when there seemed to be like no bright spot on the horizon for ethereum yet we all still bought because we believed in it and it really um put our our community the ethereum community together it was very disconnected uh it wasn't really banded together and we really needed that 80 East moment in 2018 to have some sort of camaraderie and so this is what I wish the Solana community that same moment for them like sometimes times you need to be stress tests in order to have that camaraderie to come out on the other side however I'm hoping you can unpack is this Apples to Apples or apples to oranges with me because that was 2018 and that was ethereum and this is 2022 and this is Solana I'm wondering if you can unpack the differences behind is this the same or is this different yeah so I gave you a lot of grief about this tweet uh in in DMS and uh you know what though you're always good at taking feedback so that's that's one of the things I like about you but generally I don't think it's Apples to Apples I I think that the just the ecosystem right now is in a completely different spot than it was in 2018. I think that no longer is are these altar ones just competing with ethereum layer one I mean I view them as competing with ethereum Layer Two and for these old Tau ones generally especially for something like Solana their main value prop was those lower fees right like that was the whole value prop for from for the majority of people yeah okay maybe they have different ways to to create smart contracts programs smart contracts maybe they have different uh virtual machines and and different kind of like intricacies there but for the vast majority of people it was about the fees right the cheaper fees and with layer twos on ethereum now we we have that yes okay we don't have like the subset transaction fees yet you know we're hoping to get to that point with things like proto-dang sharding but we we do have those those cheaper fees and and no longer do you need to be stuck on ethereum layer one you can now seek refuge on these layer twos just as people sought refuge on these alt l1s so I think that generally for the Old Tower ones that are evm based and I'm going a bit wider here but the ones that are evm based I don't think they're going to survive because they're competing directly with arbitrum and optimism and the ZK VMS which are just vastly Superior on on every front right and they're in the ethereum ecosystem already they get the ethereum community and ethereum network effects as in terms of Solana they've taken a radically different approach I think generally not just on the scalability side but also on the architecture side of things but I don't know and I I'm kind of I I don't really think it's going to be enough for them to have this community that was formed like ethereum did in the earlier days because there's just much more competition out there there are much more other I guess chains and communities that that pop up and as you mentioned or as someone was mentioning it about like FTX I did DC was saying it about kind of like Sam bankman freed being a massive supporter of Solana propping up a lot of the value well where is that buy pressure going to come from when that massive structural buyer is gone like who's going to buy Seoul right now like uh it just seems this in such a such a poor position where people are asking these questions and people are asking the same questions about eth in 2018 and 2019 they're like you know where's the eat by pressure going to come from and back then we had answers though like there weren't certainties but we had answers we were saying well people are going to buy it to stake right and then when we're burning each we're going to be uh you know making eth um deflationary like during the bear Market we knew about 1559 as well we knew about proof of stake obviously we knew about D5 we said you know people are going to buy D5 I mean I wrote a post in January of 2019 talking about all of these things so can someone write the same kind of post for Solana can they prove to me that hey you know this is where the Soul by pressure is going to come from this is why people are going to buy a soul this is why they're going to use Solana instead of other other networks not just ethereum but like every other network out there yeah because there's so so many of them now and how is Solana going to fare in the face of something like Aptos and sui and say like all these other chains that are coming online that are promising the exact same thing uh it just feels like this this cycle of just you know use one chain make the money from it move on to the next whereas I never felt that with ethereum I always felt like ethereum had this core contingency of a community that was that would go through anything and it would go through hell and wasn't just there for any any one particular reason as I said I believe the majority of people were in Solana and are still in Solana for those kind of Cheaper fees right they feel like they can make the most scalable blockchain ever and preserve decentralization but they haven't done that in my eyes I haven't preserved decentralization at all so they have they definitely have a very different set of community members than ethereum and they definitely optimize for Mercenaries a lot more than ethereum did and yes ethereum had its Ico Mania which serves as a has a massive amount of buy pressure for Ethan 2017 but I think ethereum still had a lot of fundamentals outside of that that I'm just not seeing in in Solana and on the on the community front as well like I'm obviously not very versed in the Solana Community I don't spend much time there but from everything that I've seen it is still very mercenary it doesn't feel very put together it doesn't feel very missionary and it feels very and they still go on about you know cheaper fees they're still going about ethereum being too expensive and on all this sorts of stuff and they never really mentioned layer twos so it seems like they're both behind on what ethereum is doing and also trying to find their own new narrative to take them to you know that take them through this bear Market take them to to success so in terms of comparing the two yeah I I don't really see it to be honest and maybe that's because as I said I'm not in the community maybe it is there but uh but yeah just taking it all and I could go on about this for a long time I'm not gonna I'm not gonna keep going but just taking it all um yeah taking that all together yeah I I'm not bullish on any of the Old Town ones to be able to get like even not just Solana but like any of the other ones to form a community like ethereum has I feel like ethereum is home for a lot of people the layer two networks are forming their own communities that may not be you know ethereum but they're still on ethereum and they're the ones that's where a lot of the activity is going to settle and and be taken taken of but you know who knows maybe the next bull market rolls around we get a bunch of new people coming in they all go to these other networks but I'm talking longer term kind of sustainable stuff not just flashing the pan uh kind of things so this is where the three Big East balls think ethereum relates in relation to the other smart contract chains that exist in crypto uh and this just placing ethereum into the grand scheme of 2022 and all of the crypto industry I think is pretty useful but I want to focus and zero in on some ethereum-centric uh conversations uh and I actually think that I'm going to pull in Justin Drake to lead some of these conversations because he's given us a little bit of an outline a three-part outline as to what is bullish on the ethereum roadmap uh proof of stake eip1559 those things are behind us so what about the future ethereum roadmap is bullish uh and then after that we'll cover the size of the opportunity how bullish is the opportunity that ethereum has in front of it if ethereum can execute on its timeline on its road map and then the last bullish thing we'll talk about the timeline the time frame for all of ethereum uh so when can we actually expect some of the Innovations that's coming out of the ethereum develop Camp to show up in the in the price of ether in the overall bullishness of the industry at large so Justin uh let's start with this uh the bullish Tech road map for ethereum what's left what are the three big uh what are the big parts of the uh the road map that we have left to be excited about what I'm excited about uh regarding the roadmap is that you know we have a very good understanding of it um you know when I joined the research team in 2017 we didn't really have this roadmap and now I feel like things are have really crystallized that in our mind that at least from a research standpoint where we're we're essentially done and one of the things that makes me particularly bullish is that people don't seem to really appreciate the how good this roadmap is um and I want to kind of take some time to highlight a few kind of nuggets you know maybe some Alpha leaks for people to to help them appreciate the the this roadmap so one of the things that I want to to start with is basically a dank shouting I really think dank shouting is is a massive breakthrough event like what one of the the the reasons which is uh kind of underappreciated is this idea of synchronous composability right like in theory you could have all sorts of blockchains and and and and contracts composed of each other but um there's like really these these two types of flavors there's like asynchronous and and synchronous and it turns out that dank sharding is is not shouting at all right it's like this one monolithic shot where everything happens in the synchronous world and it turns out that it unlocks synchronous composability just like we have today which is the the best class of the best type of composability and specifically when you have two ZK Roll-Ups and this is kind of a requirement they can compose synchronously and that's that's one of the reasons why I'm particularly bullish over ZK Roll-Ups is that they have this superpower you take two of them they can compose synchronously unfortunately if you have an optimistic roll up on the uh on then it can't compose synchronously with with anything else uh India is that is that just when you say synchronous is that like Atomic compatibility same kind of thing like the same sort of experience we have on main chain where like I could do something with uniswap and some other app in this in the same kind of block the same transaction yes and I want to give you like one very concrete example so you know how um we have these aggregators like one inch and and matcha and the way that they work is that they uh there's all these fragmented pools of liquidity you know maybe on unit swap maybe on Sushi swap or whatever and like these aggregators they're capable in like one fail swoop like one Atomic transaction kind of taking the liquidity from from everywhere and this is what's going to be possible with ZK Roll-Ups um there will not be this fragmentation of liquidity um you'll be able to kind of benefit from real like strong Network effects across the across the Roll-Ups um and like Justin just to really drive this point home uh one inch The Exchange aggregator works on both optimism and arbitrum but when you use one inch on optimism it Aggregates the liquidity inside of optimism and it stays inside of the optimism layer too same thing with the implementation of one inchron arbitrum it doesn't extend beyond arbit Trump what you're saying with ZK Roll-Ups and with Dank sharding is that in the ZK liquidity pools which there is a proposal for uniswap to be deployed on ZK sync for example I would expect it to be eventually deployed everywhere as it will uh and so all of the ZK Roll-Ups where there is uniswap and other any other liquidity Source one inch or any other Dex aggregator will work atomically across all liquidity pools across all ZK Roll-Ups all at once seamlessly so it escapes unlike the uh the optimistic Roll-Ups like optimism and arbitrum the liquidity actually escapes from the bounds of that particular layer too because of how awesome cryptography ZK roll up magic all that kind of stuff and so it is one single Universal Dex aggregator for all of ethereum I just really wanted to drive that point home yeah that that's correct um there is like this one kind of subtlety which is worth highlighting is that there needs to be some element of opting in to this shared liquidity pool so basically um unfortunately you we can't have synchronous composability over like the whole state of the Roll apps and the reason here is that you would need to have one kind of Mega prover who's kind of aware of all the the state of all the rubs at the same time and so really what needs to happen what's going to happen is that the the ZK Roll-Ups will have a relatively small surface of of intersection so they're all going to intersect in this kind of uh liquidity pool and that will be kind of the the the Eye uh where where where all the liquidity is is Consolidated and is that on in the ethereum main chain um it doesn't have to be the main shade no it can basically be uh you know a a subset of every single roll up simultaneously okay okay I didn't know that by the way I did not know that I yeah very few people realize that but it's one of the superpowers of ZK Roll-Ups amazing and it is in day charting specifically enables this or is that uh a nature of ZK roles themselves yeah well thanks shouting doesn't ruin it so it up the previous kind of sharding was that we had these 64 shards or 1024 shots and they were each kind of their own kind of synchronous Zone and and if you wanted to compose between them you had to pay the cost of asynchrony now we have this one monolithic Shard where all the kind of the clever shouting happens in the back end you know at the consensus layer and you don't realize it as an application developer as a user as a user it's just one big synchronous Zone and when you said dank sharding this is uh this is Supply to Proto dang shredding as well or do we have to wait yeah it does yeah bullish amazing extremely bullish I did want to quickly note as well like uh uh as Justin was saying um you know there are these ZK Roll-Ups that do this but optimistic Roll-Ups uh don't uh both arbitrine optimism can convert themselves to being a ZK roll-up as well so a lot of people get confused by that and they think that oh German optimism are going to be obsolete because of these EK Roll-Ups no it's just as simple as trading out fraud posts for validity proofs at least that's my understanding of it Anthony can yeah and that's can Solana convert to a ZK roll-up is that possible technically the state should be able to be carried over but I don't know what that would look like I mean they're never going to do it but yeah it is worth noting that it's like actually explicitly in the optimism uh roadmap to do that to uh eventually turn into a ZK roll up so that's not just an uh a theory that is explicitly part of the optimism roadmap and really just to also talk about the second and third order consequences from this um one of the reasons why uh people generally just are more bullish about the ZK roll-up uh uh design philosophies a lot of second order consequences um and a lot of that ultimately comes down to usability and allowing ethereum to kind of just work for so many people uh things like account abstraction and and other ux increase uh ux breakthroughs I just allow ethereum to be kind of this intuitive blockchain technology that doesn't have to inject uh the clunkiness of crypto into the fit in in front of people and a lot of that comes from just ZK magic in the the ux improvements and um uh in that this kind of technology can bring and so not only do we get just like increased scale increased speeds increase composability but there's a significant number of other second order consequences that comes with CK technology that allows people to just have the ux that they Envision that that crypto will have ultimately I wonder if Justin if you're able to make what I'm saying any more concrete than I'm able to yeah so I I do believe that there are going to be some some standards that are going to emerge across the the Roll-Ups just that like we've have standards at the erc20 level or standards at the nft level um one of them I think you know will be around this this liquidity pooling aspect right and this idea that you're going to have synchronous composition that's going to be an important kind of standard to to to come up with um maybe another one could be around the exact proofs that are being put forward um so one of the exciting things about ZK Roll-Ups is that you can actually aggregate the proofs of multiple roll ups into the one master proof um and so um the the the amortized cost um is is is is is of of settlement is essentially zero because one of the worries here is like you know if you want a post Quantum snark proof that's going to cost you let's say a million gas or something I just picked this number it's it's it it doesn't necessarily have to be a million guess now let's say we have 50 Roll-Ups we don't have 50 million gas per per block and so we really need to go this extra layer of aggregation and this this I think will will happen partly through free standardization um another important thing you know for standardization is the ability for for users to to um you know have this seamless ux and I think what we're seeing here is that the the evm is King right it like it's kind of uh it's become the shelling Point around which all the Roll-Ups or most of the roll ups are are are converging towards and one of the things that we're we're seeing is is this is you don't get there in one step because you know the DVM is like full of intricacies and complexities you get there incrementally and we know we saw this for example with optimism they had their initial uh version of DVM which was almost evm with some exceptions and now there's like essentially zero exceptions they're fully compatible and we're seeing a similar trajectory with the the zke VMS right it's very difficult to get full compatibility in one shot but with enough engineering uh you know we we can get there um and then eventually you know that will bring us to this idea of an enshrined roll up where we can bring all this technology um at layer one uh that middle point that you were talking about where we can have this aggregation of ZK Roll-Ups together it starts to look like a root structure or a tree structure this is what people are calling fractal scaling and each one of these specific rollups can Implement a very specific purpose for example optimism uh has op craft where you can run Minecraft on optimism for whatever purposes that you want to do this and this is really what allows ethereum to uh find its way into every single nook and cranny of the internet because it can produce a particular chain that's uh built for a specific use case wherever that internet part of the internet demands it to be because of ZK Roll-Ups uh and what you're saying with the scale the more that this root structure converges on the same roll up rather than all each individually setting down to ethereum that just makes the whole system faster and cheaper uh so there's a flywheel effect here uh Justin you ended that conversation with talking about the evm a lot of there's a lot of um fud out there if you will about the evm there's a lot of startups that are taking ethereum's evm and saying we're going to make it better we're going to make it parallel it's going to go faster we're going to make take the evm but make it better can you talk about uh the evm and its baggage that it brings to the ethereum ecosystem and if this is a concern for the future of the ethereum roadmap right so I guess two or three years ago there was a very common narrative around technical people that the evm is trash um and I was I was one of these proponents where you know it just seemed that there was this laundry list of bad design decisions and really um you know it this could be like one of the Achilles heels of of ethereum and you know there was even research in Alternatives right people may remember the all the the wasm you know um you know research that that we did now one of the Striking things in the new roadmap is that there are no evm Alternatives there is no wasn't box you know in in the roadmap and this this is basically the the the the the the fruit of the realization that um DVM is good enough and this is this is kind of really kind of shocking for you know for for me like I did not believe for example that DVM could be snoquified and could be fraud provable and that you could build uh optimisms and arbit rooms but you can um another thing that uh people had doubts about is can you even build secure small contracts with the evm you know it's not it's not friendly to formal verification uh we don't have uh you know the the tooling and and they're not and it just turns out that all of this uh you know fear and uncertainty has dissipated we now have excellent tools and we are capable of building secure contracts uh that are efficient and we even have formal verification of of evm uh bytecode which which is amazing um so yeah this this massive risk you know has been has been removed in the same way that you know the potential Break in composability with sharding has been removed with with tank shouting and one of the things that I want to highlight on the on the zkevm specifically is that until a few a few days ago um I I and you know various other people within the research team uh for example vitalik were kind of scared about ZK VMS in particular and the reason is that ZK VMS are extraordinarily complicated and we can't even get Bridges correct so it's very very likely that every single ZK VM when they come out they have at least one vulnerability and it's you know likely that these vulnerabilities will eventually get found and the the worry here is that we might have on our hands a 10 billion dollar hack um and it's just a ticking Time Bomb now one of the things that we realized very recently is that um there's a very simple set of training wheels that we can put on these ZK roll ups which involves uh using sdx so basically we can have a a dual engine system where on the one hand you have the stock proof and on the other hand you have an sgx proof sgx is like these trusted enclaves by Intel no one likes you know the Intel stuff because we don't want to be using using trusted Hardware but the it's a strict security Improvement it doesn't remove anything from the security of the stocks and it gives us the confidence that you know if you know there are bugs in the circuits which most likely there will be then at least we have this this this fallback Engine with this with with sgx and then you know in maybe let's say three four five years once we have very high confidence in the stocks we can remove the training wheels if if we want to so just to summarize what I'm hearing here uh the evm is inadequate well your response to that uh I think is uh we can pull from the lessons of the QWERTY keyboard if you will um there was once a keyboard I think it is called the Dvorak keyboard and it was built to be highly optimized highly like put all the good keys right next to the good fingers and you could type super fast um no one no one really uses that that's because the QWERTY keyboard is plenty good enough but you guys don't use am I the only one here oh and then also what you're saying Justin with uh with the ZK roll up the security risk of ZK Roll-Ups uh and uh getting ahead of the problem of uh Bridge exploits that we have seen so many uh so many of is that we actually have a very simple answer to this uh and so what would be a future uh perhaps cataclysmic problem that we've seen so much with like uh Crossbay Bridges um or a similar problem not equivalent we already have a problem a solution for for this uh okay so I want to I want to underhand you the last section here about the ethereum roadmap before I let uh Anthony and DC uh kind of interpret these for themselves as Mev and censorship will break ethereum um people are super bearish about ethereum uh on this subject I think you've got actually a reason to be bullish could you tell us what that is right so the whole story around Mev and social resistance all happened you know extremely quickly um and you know it's been great for researchers because there's been a ton of open problems to to to to to to work on but one of the things I want to highlight is that we have this new category um in in in the roadmap called the The Scourge and the tldr here is that at least at the research level we have 100 solve the censorship issue issue will not is not a fundamental problem it's just a matter of doing the engineering to completely remove it um and I would also make the claim that we have essentially fully fully solved Mev like toxic Mev you know with front running and sandwich attacks this this will be a thing a thing of the past um you know relatively soon with encrypted mempools and so here we've just been um you know we've just been extremely lucky in a way because uh to be quite honest we didn't really fully appreciate the the the open problems in Mev and censorship but it turns out that there was some low-hanging fruits with inclusion lists um with Mev burn um with encrypted man pools um and and other gadgets that actually solve this the the this this problem uh fully like on the on the topic of Mev burn like the the the reason why it was kind of uh it invented or kind of originally is to remove some of the volatility but um in in the returns as a validator so as a validator you know you might you essentially in a lottery uh wire you know one day you might receive a 400 each block and you've what you've you've won the lottery as a a as a validator and we don't we kind of want to remove that because it turns out it's a centralization vector and the reason is that you're you're expected kind of the the median return as a validator is much much lower than the average and so that's an incentive for you to go join a pool in the same way that as a Bitcoin miner you would drill in a pool to be able to to you know extract the the average um return as opposed to the median uh return now one of the uh amazing thing about the Mev burn is that it actually also helps solve censorship specifically of the validators like right now the the validators whenever they get chosen to build the next block they have full discretionary power to choose this this next block and in particular they can choose to censor transactions that's a decision that they can make and Mev burn basically removes that is it basically says that when it's your turn to pick a block you have to pick a canonical block specifically you have to pick the most the block that burns the most Eve which not only removes the censorship from the proposers but it's kind of bullish because it burns to if um and not only does it does it kind of burn the if and you know we're we're talking about half a million if roughly per year but it also um as a as a kind of double whammy second order effect it reduces the overall um you know rewards that go to the validators as as a group and so that means that we should expect slightly less validators to to be to be staking actually slightly less issuance and so there's another roughly you know 300 1000 if per year in issuance reduction from this and domaffy who recently joined different Foundation has been has been leading This research and been doing a a a a great job but yeah the Mev burn is just something I'm really bullish about uh it's kind of misunderstood I think there's a lot of Education to be done uh but it's what I'm excited about and then the final thing I want to kind of highlight in in the roadmap is this idea of moving to post quantum and the reason why I'm excited is not because we have to do this this upgrade or for the technology or for the fact that we're being more secure I'm actually more excited about the fact that it is it's it's almost like a difficulty bomb right so it's a forcing the current non Quantum secure cryptography is is a forcing function for us to rip off the the guts and the internals of of ethereum and and build and replace it with uh with post Quantum uh Alternatives and I think it's going to be the very last chance that we have as a community to basically remove technical debt from the consensus layer and put in basically a near perfect consensus engine from the older learnings that we will have in the next decade and then after that final upgrade I think will be in a position to say ethereum is done it's perfect we don't need to change it anymore Justin thank you for walking us through through that roadmap and a lot of newer bankless listeners people who are having finished going down the technical ethereum Rabbit Hole might feel a little bit underwater in this moment because it was it is very technical uh for people who

was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free Anthony I want to throw this uh to you for a little bit of digestion and interpretation as an educator in the ethereum ecosystem uh Justin just talked about like how we are able to restore composability with Dank sharding and ZK Roll-Ups we talked about how the evm is actually a fantastic shelling point which continues to be Innovative on and how we totally have solved censorship and it actually we've felt it solved it in a way that increases the eth burn which socializes all the revenue Beyond e-stakers to the just broad East holders when you're hearing all of these things how should listeners think about the the meaning and significance of these Innovations right just when you can you zoom out for us and just what's the significance of this at a high level to you yeah so I think I want to start with the AVM point which I think is very important because as Justin said not just was the community kind of bearish on the evm but also were the researchers and all the smart people and the developers out there who were saying that it was inferior technology we needed to rip it out and replace it it wasn't fit for purpose and all that sorts of stuff but it turns out that you know if your competitors are forking you if the oldtel ones are forking you and using the AVM and teaching people how to to you know make smart contracts in solidity the network effect gets really really strong right and as Justin said we got to a point where we realized that it's good enough it does what we need it to do we can keep improving it over time definitely but there is no need for us to go through this whole process of ripping out the evm replacing it with something else and then starting from zero basically because not only do you have to start from zero on the adoption front you have to start from zero on the security front which is something that I think a lot of people undersell is that the evm and solidity have been battle tested security wise there is a lot of documentation out there about good practices is a lot of people to talk to a lot of Specialists who who know more about it than other people and can teach other people whereas some of these other kind of like languages and other things haven't been tested in this environment maybe they've been tested in the web 2 environment but they haven't been tested in a blockchain environment which is extremely hostile right like it's much more hostile than the traditional environments that we're used to and everything's public right everything's uh transparent people can say okay well if I can hack this contract I can get this amount of dollars right it's very transparent about how much money you can get for exploiting something so I think starting from from zero just to I guess bring these improvements that we you know maybe they have major improvements maybe their marginal ones just wouldn't make much sense and at this point vvm and solidity are are a wrecking ball there's no stopping them the network effect is going to continue to grow it's going to continue to take over the space you know people are going to keep forking the evm keep using it for their own purposes so I definitely agree with uh with Justin on on that front that AVM is here to stay there's no point looking to rip it out and the other points as well I think speak to something at a high level of ethereum researchers and Engineers developers are the only ones really working on these problems right now these really really hard problems like censorship resistance and Mev related problems because ethereum is the only one that has to face it there's no real kind of like uh I mean you know we don't know for sure obviously we can never prove a negative but in terms of the ofact sanctions they only targeted ethereum they didn't Target anything else so the other networks at this point in time don't have to deal with this this is not something that's even on their radar same with Mev there's not a lot of value to extract on these other networks so Mev isn't really a big problem and because of the censorship concerns on ethereum and because Mev contributes a lot to that we have this co-mingling of things that need to be worked on and the beautiful thing is is that this isn't just something new this has actually been worked on for years and years and years I mean flashbot is not an organization that come came to life this year they've been around for it for quite a while and Phil Diane one of the the co-founders has been researching Mev probably the longest out of anyone right and developing solutions for it so the if the from a high level the ethereum ecosystem has been tackling these issues before they even became issues and has been working towards rectifying them working towards improving the ecosystem before they even read their their kind of like ugly head here whereas I feel like a lot of the other communities and all the other chains are more reactive than proactive where they'll see an issue and they're like oh I can fix that like the high fees on ethereum they'll be like oh well I can fix that whereas ethereum has been working on its scalability for a long time yes that's only materialized recently but it's not like we waited for the high fees to work on it we were working on layer 2 technology from but almost the beginning right they just came in different forms like State channels and plasma now we have roll ups but it was all working towards that so in terms of where ethereum is even though it's a slow-moving Beast the research side is always so far ahead of every other ecosystem if you look at it from a high level and it does take a while to implement things but they do get implemented and we do have these improvements and and it sets a culture within ethereum of uh tackling the hard problems and and as I think um Justin said at the the top of the podcast it is a talent magnet that is what attracts the best and brightest Minds to ethereum is those hard problems that no one else is really working on right now so that's my kind of high level take there and I guess I mean it really does make for a bullish case for both ethereum and and ether's an asset because it means you know when you have the smartest people in your ecosystem it creates wonderful wonderful things and you create missionaries instead of mercenaries which I think people still undersell as being incredibly important if all you have is mercenaries you don't have anything healthy if you have missionaries like if you're weighted towards the missionaries more than the mercenaries then you have a long-term sustainable ecosystem and I feel like ethereum has so many missionaries at this point so many people who just really wants to work on hard problem solve hard problems really want to see the community grow in an organic and uh and beautiful way that it it's hard not to be bullish on ethereum and eat because of that DC put your investor hat on here okay and you've seen many manifestations of the ethereum roadmap you've seen you know the 2017 version of the roadmap which was kind of like what road map and then you see it today um does this is this the kind of road map that is investable does this make eth more attractive to you what would you say about what Justin and Anthony just described absolutely I mean I'm definitely more excited now hearing some of the context that Justin's had added around the ZK Roll-Ups but I before I jump into that answer I want to kind of start off with why did some of these alternative layer ones take off during this cycle and I think there's really two reasons for that the first is like there's an Institutional um incentive to promote some of these networks because they give themselves early allocation they pump them up in the market they are then able to sell those tokens or or build additional projects on there to and do all that right so that's one set of incentives but the other incentive was I honestly think there are a lot of users who are earnestly interested in participating in ethereum they wanted to participate in ethereum they were priced out they wanted to but they wanted to participate in public blockchains or semi-public blockchains as I would consider some of these and so they went to other networks I think looking forward into the next cycle this next phase of development l2s will hopefully provide some of that throughput and that transaction capacity and we all hope that it would arrive for this past cycle I think it's here now and it's going to start being built upon in a very significant way so to hear about some of these developments as it relates to interoperability between those Roll-Ups I think that's absolutely massive because one of the biggest points of concern around Roll-Ups is are we just building these silos that won't be able to interoperate together but it sounds like there's been some meaningful progress in being able to address some of those in a way that doesn't require necessarily settlement of by users back to layer one to be able to move between rules so that's number one on the point of evm I'll just say for now evm is clearly one and I think as long as evm is in the lead ethereum is winning um and why do I say that look you can have other layer ones that are evm compatible but eventually and I think in the very near future here they're going to lose to layer twos who are also which are also uem compatible and have Superior security secured by ethereum and so at some point I think the market is going to look at that and say well why would I use some other layer one which claims to be evm compatible and I can use a roll-up secured by ethereum um and so and the other interesting thing about Roll-Ups is you can even have a roll-up that doesn't use evm and is still using ethereum for security and so you know even if you don't want to use evm you can still build on top of ethereum the strongest trust layer in the market and I'll also say look on the third Point as it relates to Mev look I I haven't made it a secret that I haven't been thrilled with how a lot of this stuff has evolved in the market um and but the reality is look even those transactions which are still potentially being censored or filtered um they're still getting through even right now but with degraded service but I think in a way we're kind of lucky that we have we're lucky in a way because proof of stake in the network have just been really stress tested and all of the developers and researchers have been working overtime trying to find solutions to potential censorship you know if we have actors who are potentially willing to censor how do we solve that and so I think in a way it's maybe put ethereum ahead significantly and so when I when I listen to some of the road map developments that Justin's talked about it just makes me more bullish I don't know if that's possible Ryan but I'm more bullish listening to this uh it's yeah it's definitely possible and like for people who who weren't there don't remember I mean the contrast between the road map that ethereum has right now and also the additions which even the like some of the Bulls on this on this panel weren't even aware about and the road map that we just kind of didn't have back in 2018 could not have been more more Stark it was just incredible uh and I don't see another Community with uh with this so look the Bulls are bullish the ethereum road map did you expect anything less of course they're going to be bullish on the ethereum road map let's talk now about the market opportunity all right that's that's a second question I think people have and it's mine and uh crypto in this market cycle has now dipped below a trillion I think we got as high as uh 4 trillion you guys you mark you guys keep me honest something like that uh but now we're below a trillion and I think there's a question in people's mind back to you the bear Market question everyone always asks well is crypto just a niche use case just for a bunch of like you know I don't know people who listen to bank lists and whatever uh daily guay and like just you you know whatever they have ledgers and that's a little cute but they're going to be the weirdos and mainstream as doing other things they don't care about crypto how big can this Market internet internet yeah internet gold bucks right and so um but I mean crypto people have talked about no this is bigger this is like property rights all right and property rights birthed 100 trillion dollar real estate uh boom an opportunity if we look at kind of total market cap uh how about the LLC well you got another 100 trillion dollars in stocks there's another boom like the limited liability Corporation and capital markets and all of that uh Bretton Woods with Fiat like that's a another massive opportunity to um combustion engine we got oil as a resource right so like justify why this why this asset class should be even bigger than a trillion dollars maybe it shouldn't be uh I'll throw this one to to Drake Justin what do you think about the market opportunity for ethereum why are you bullish on that specifically because maybe it's just an niche right so I guess first I want to give you know a bit of context of on how I think about this and I like to simplify things and then and think in terms of orders of magnitude and it turns out that the orders of magnitude actually very very close to to reality so one of the things that I like to think about is global wealth like how much wealth is there if you just add up everything if you add up real estate and Fiat and stocks and gas and oil and all the long tail how much do you have well it turns out you have roughly one quadrillion now there's not a number you may have heard very often it's basically a thousand trillion now let's let me just provide a little bit of perspective just to give you a feel for this number so we have about 10 billion people on Earth and so one quadrillion divided by 10 10 uh 10 billion is a hundred thousand dollars so what that means is that on average the average kind of per capita Global wealth is a hundred thousand dollars so if you have more than a hundred thousand dollars congratulations you have higher than average now of course there's uh there's you know huge wealth inequality in the world and so it you know it turns out unfortunately that the median per capita wealth is actually much much lower than 100 000 it's it's closer to ten thousand so what that means is that roughly half the world has less than ten thousand dollars to their name and the roughly the other half has more than ten thousand dollars um to to to their name okay so that's kind of like the the really big picture and then as you did Ryan you know we can we can zoom in and try and understand these asset classes within this big picture and I think you you highlighted you know maybe the the big four real estate Fiat and gold stocks and and and gas and oil Each of which are kind of roughly 100 trillion with the exception of real estate which is actually quite a bit bigger you know something like 300 trillion and like you can ask yourself you know how how did all this wealth you know be created like you should I really like the the the the gas and and oil example is like gas and oil was literally like this this black dirty kind of thing um and it was like it was dangerous right it could like explode in your face and it was it was you know you had to do a lot of work to go extract it and uh and then it just turned out you know out of nowhere we invented the combustion engine and then suddenly it was worth a lot and then you can think the this very similar story with with land right like before we had Land Titles and popularized like you know it was just trees and Fields and you know stuff and it wasn't very well defined and then I suddenly we had this this this changing of the rules changing of the paradigm and then suddenly we've created wealth out of nowhere um and I think to to a large extent you know Fiat and gold is a very similar story it's like uh you know a nation-states somehow convincing us uh that uh that that you know these pieces of paper have value and even that gold has value you know on a geopolitical um context and you know we can say the same thing for for stocks you know how it came from the The Limited company and I think one of the amazing things when you look at this is that three of these four asset classes are actually created by donation States right like these these uh the these kind of came from uh from this coordination tool the the nation state and now I think where we're in a position here where we have an opportunity to recreate the rules in a very fundamental uh Manner and and have the ability to to create a a really powerful new new asset class and the way that I think I think about kind of sizing that is first of all looking at the existing kind of Legacy infrastructure in this in this addressable market so what is there right there's what is basically I think of it as Financial coordination what do we have we have payments companies we have Banks we have Fiat we have gold and that's roughly a 100 trillion and I think maybe I know 80 90 of that will move to crypto just like the internet you know has basically eaten all of you know maybe 90 of of communication and I think not only are we going to see this eating process happening but we're also going to see um you know totally new things that get created you know just like you know suddenly we realize that that oil was valuable um now I think you know nfts is a great example like now suddenly dick box uh they are valuable and it's like it's it's crazy uh but it is what it is and I think this is just like a taste search that's the tip of the iceberg in terms of the assets that we're going to be able to create and you know you maybe that's another 100 trillion dollars and so maybe you know you know it's it's I I prefer to just talk about orders of magnitude but I have high conviction that we're looking at a 100 trillion dollar kind of uh asset class here and now you can ask yourself okay where are we now now we're at a one one trillion uh dollar asset class we're like 0.1 percent of global wealth we're like a rounding error right um which was just so early um and really what we can be is a 100 trillion dollar asset class and so we can grow roughly 100 a hundred times as an industry but if you look at uh ethereum specifically right what is its order of magnitude it's actually closer to 100 billion it's a roughly 150 billion right now then then then then the trade and then if I personally think that within the the crypto asset class ethereum and ether is going to become the dominant thing and so I think for ether specifically is actually the opportunity is actually somewhere between a hundred and a thousand so so you think ether specifically is um at the the bear case for eth the asset is like 10 trillion if this whole crypto asset class is 100 trillion total and that's the bear case that's like your your threshold yes and kind of just to be very very clear like this is in terms of the the long-term future like in terms of yeah we're not talking in 2023. we're talking maybe post Quant we're talking long long term here but like I want to get the Bull's reaction and one of one of my ways of thinking about this too is um you can look at uh the companiesmarketcap.com these are all of the the world's biggest assets right and right now at 150 billion uh Philip Morris is bigger than eth right now okay what are they what does Philip Morris sells cigarettes um we've got Wells Fargo our favorites bigger than eth right now eth is the 72nd largest asset in the world Wells Fargo a bank is the 66. we got a bunch of banks that are higher than this I bet um as someone point out a bit Bank of America there it is Coke is bigger than eth right now right so we got a ways that we could rise Bitcoin number 24. uh let's flip this over to uh to the Bulls DC what do you think about the total addressable Market size for eth and the way um Drake's thinking about it I I think Justin's points are spot on and while I can't give you an exact market cap number I agree with the orders of magnitude around the numbers that Justin's talking about and I think in the so just in in two sets of arguments in the near term look at ether as an asset and I think ether is a much higher quality asset than many people understand or give it credit for I think ethereum Bulls like us understand it but for a lot of the space a lot of them only really came to appreciate the value proposition this cycle and I think this is going to just grow to the point where it wouldn't surprise me if ether is the dominant crypto asset by the end of the next cycle too by the way is that bullish DC that a bunch of people don't understand either is that bearish it's bullish in the sense of that's potential Market opportunity right and I think as like another big Dynamic that I think people should think about by the way is like during this next cycle so you already see organizations like Fidelity which is a big brokerage house here in the U.S primarily focused on stocks and equities they are spinning up their crypto operation it will be live probably in the next year or two and once that goes live the previous generation of we'll call them the Boomers and above and slightly slightly younger they're gonna their reservations about getting into crypto because they didn't want to work with some sketchy exchange or whatever that's all going to go away and they're going to be able and willing in some cases to start buying but I do want to talk with just near term about ether look mining is gone okay which was a huge detriment and kind of weight that hung around ethereum's neck I think in a lot of ways but it's specifically with proof of work uh Opex right was expensive and so miners would have to sell their ether pretty much after they earned it to continue operating in a lot of cases issuance is at the lowest amount that it's ever been because of proof of stake we're burning ether via EIP 1559 line and a significant capacity and I I mean like I just look at these things and the prices below what it was in 20 at the at the top of the 2018-2017 bull market it blows my mind look I think honestly when I look at the space right now like the next two years are going to be probably ugly I'm not going to sugarcoat it I think if you're in the space right now be committed and be focused on this long-term Vision but ether in my opinion is on the verge of becoming the most important decentralized crypto asset and certainly the most important decentralized crypto financial asset and it's going to become the world's best natively programmable asset and there's basically unchallenged for that use case and for its level of liquidity and fungibility I think that's huge and I mean Justin alluded to this as well but as you guys know I'm super bullish on nfts as well nfts as a whole ecosystem and there's going to be a lot more than art and collectibles but some of these art and Collectibles have held up surprisingly well through what has been a heinous bear market so far these are being held by collectors as true store of value assets and I think having like store of value assets on ethereum that are not just ether only makes ether even stronger to be honest because it creates that economy it creates a virtuous cycle and economy that can build around that um so I don't know in the past I know some people have viewed those things as potentially threatening to Ether I think that's totally the wrong way to look at look at it ethereum is the only public blockchain which has a significant economy of digital goods and services on it period And I think that's just going to increase by Leaps and Bounds over the course of the next four years okay DC so DC DC is also bullish Justin bullish we got to get our final check mark here and one one comment I want to make about eip1559 uh you know to you Anthony's you kind of lead into like the big Market opportunity here is like I defy you anyone who's listening to find me someone who understands in detail ultrasound.money the website and the economics of this thing and each Supply and is simultaneously bearish on ether the asset I don't think such a person exists all right but that that's a challenge to anyone listening somebody who can also explain ultrasound Dot money and the metrics here and where ethus is going from just a raw economic supply side and also be simultaneously bearish on this asset uh but go ahead Anthony give us the uh take us home with the market opportunity Drake says 100 trillion the base case is you know 10 10 trillion of that is maybe ether DC's backing up and he's also like yeah and look at nfts alone that's a multi-trillion dollar asset class and that's all going to be kind of settled in some way on eth what do you think about the opportunity here yeah so I would say that I totally agree with everything Justin and DC have said um I will say that when we're looking at the total Market cup uh that takes into account stable coins which is just like based on the US dollar so removing those and just taking into account Bitcoin a thought and like actual crypto assets it's it's more like 600 billion right now rather than a trillion so it is 400 billion less there and eighth alone is only 150 billion so if the market opportunity is as big as Justin thinks it is and I think it is as well then yeah I mean it's obvious there's a lot of growth left there now of course you can't just say that oh well it's going to go to 10 trillion dollars because of reasons right you have to actually give reasons you have to actually give a thesis behind which is what Justin and DC have done but I think as you said there's this website ultrasound.money which shows the bull case if you know how to interpret it it's kind of like reading the Matrix if you can read ultrasound money and interpret uh exactly what it's telling you you can you can see the lady in the red dress right if you if you know how to read it so if people don't know how to read it I would suggest that they um they kind of learn because this is your Bible towards like uh being bullish on eth now I'll break down a few other things here just just for people so I think that for me one of the most bullish things that has happened is that I guess like Supply change that we had with the merge right that massive issues production which is basically almost 100 right it if we were still on proof of work we would have issued I think 1.1 million each net of the burn so that's including the burn um and then with uh proof of stake with you know post merge is then this is since the merge we've only issued 1 294 each which is almost a 100 reduction in net issuance in in three months and today it's been 90 days so it's been about three months since the merge now of course against USD eth has done nothing since the merge and we all know that right but I look at it against other assets and looking at against Bitcoin it has performed so extremely well against Bitcoin in a bear Market which basically uh destroys every narrative that has gone on about Bitcoin being the flight to safety asset in in Bear markets right now if atheist is the flight to safety asset in a bear Market if it is the best performing asset in a bear Market what's it going to do in a bull market when we don't have this minor cell pressure when we have the burn offsetting a lot of the issues because activity goes up what happens when people realize that the staking apis or apis are so good and you're getting it on an appreciating asset as well as time goes on what happens when people realize that eighth is the only decentralized digital commodity money uh programmable digital commodity money in existence and not only is it uh it not only does it exist it exists in such a way that makes it its value accrue to itself it doesn't just exist and the value leaks to everything around it the value accrues to itself the value of cruise to Holders no longer is value occurring to miners who don't who don't hold the heat they're forced to sell it is now accruing to stakers which are much less likely to sell because they cost are much lower but they're also much more aligned with being eat holders because they hold eth like miners didn't have to hold eth they held Asics right they held mining machines um so it was kind of like that split there and then we also have the burn which obviously all the activity or most of the activity that happens on the network Burns eighth and brings it back into the uh the uh the eighth as an asset as a valuable Chrome mechanism so you take all that into account and like I don't know how you can be bearish on eath I mean even in the bear Market the gas prices obviously are much lower but we're still burning millions of dollars of eth per day uh and and you know that's all going to pay dividends when demand comes back I believe and it's already paid dividends against BTC for eth but against uh I guess um USD we it's just going to take a bit longer to play out but as as people have said throughout this podcast like this is not the time to be bearish just because we're in the depths of a bear Market this is not the time to be bearish like I personally think that we're in an accumulation range as they call it where as as they said we're saying like no one's going to care if they buy at 1200 versus 800 in the future like in in a few years right just like I didn't care that I actually bought a lot at 220 um when and then eth went to 80 I didn't care about that um because it took like two over two years for me to actually be in profit on that buy but eventually I I didn't care so if you have a long-term mindset if you under stand the bull case for ethereum and Ethos and asset if you understand it really deeply and can see the writing on the wall so to speak uh then you're you know you're buying eth today basically and that's that's basically my reason or at least most of my reason for for buying now even though I bought much earlier too right like I was by I bought the majority of my eighth between one and two hundred dollars um just because I bought that doesn't mean that I'm not buying now I see the opportunity still I see the massive Market opportunity I say that Heath he's below its 2017-18 highest as DC said which is just insane to me and I think that you know people will talk about oh you know Global macroeconomic forces and all this other stuff happening it's like yes okay that plays into it obviously as rates go up and debt is harder to to get you know money's harder to get things will will kind of soften there but there's always people looking for opportunity there's always investors looking for opportunity now are you going to look for opportunity in uh you know Old World stuff that's Boomer that all the Boomers have like real estate like young people aren't interested in in real estate right they can't even afford real estate because it's so expensive they don't want to buy a lot of stocks because stocks are just I don't know they're boring right then you have this this new thing this new crypto economy this new exciting thing that has all these use cases and it's all happening on ethereum and then you want to stake in in the ecosystem well you you buy eth right like you buy a to have that stake and ecosystem and then you literally can stake it to have a literal stake in the ecosystem as well and then you you accrue that value too you accrue an ether nominated yield so like taking all that together uh I know I'm I'm going off in a million different directions right now but that's because like every one of these things that I'm talking about has a million different threads you can pull out and and kind of go down um I do think that eighth is the best positioned uh asset in the world right now to to outperform pretty much everything else and yes okay there are smaller cap things that in a bullish period might go up faster right because they're just smaller cap they're easier to move but I'm talking over the long term like bulls and bear markets something to store your wealth I believe that there is literally no second best to eat right now I know that's a meme but like I do believe there's no second best to eat um and that and you know that and a lot of the reasons I just outlined is is why I believe that Anthony you you claim that uh you are the ethereum's biggest ball the East biggest ball and uh you know I just have no doubt sometimes that that is actually true uh if I could actually throw my own hat into the ring uh something that you and I were talking about Anthony on a recent live stream is just to recap some recent history uh the 2017 Ico Mania uh I claim and a few other people will agree with me uh While others will debate it but I claim that that was ethereum's bull market it was called the Ico Mania for a reason for Better or For Worse icos weren't all that great but ethereum won the show it got so much adoption because of icos uh the 2018 to 2020 bear Market ethereum lost like we took the L then the the East price took the L you can just look at the East price versus the Bitcoin price um and you know it didn't it didn't do so great it did not hold up once the bull market came back in the defy summer of 2020 and the nft Mania of 2021 that was ethereum's bull market ethereum won once again because of D5 because of smart contracts and then also unexpectedly because of nfts uh and so as soon as the bull market came back if ether once again uh regained so much ground versus Bitcoin I think right now even right now uh there's like 95 percent of time ether has been a better buy than than Bitcoin uh and that is into the middle of this bear Market as we experience it right now I think ether is up just one or two percent more than Bitcoin is uh from its all-time highs and so if ether is starting to win the bear Market too and so when ethereum starts to win both bear markets and bull markets versus the whole rest of the crypto industry what do you think the next bull market looks like I will uh leave that in the imagination of The Listener well uh I've got a big imagination David so uh I'm thinking about a few numbers with some zeros attached to it because this is the bull episode um can we just touch base real quick on timeline though that was the third thing Justin do you have a take on timeline is all of this stuff going to take forever or are we like reasonably close are you talking about the technical roadmap you're talking about the opportunity right and not saying all of this will happen overnight but just give us a sense are you bullish or bearish on the timeline of this stuff right so my my favorite timeline is the the 10-year timeline and I think it was maybe Bezos uh who said you know that you're over bullish on the one-year time frame most of the time but on the bullish on the on the 10-year time frame or maybe it was Bill Gates who said that um and I I I really think it's the the same thing here like the road map is a 10-year road map but even putting aside the technology that's assuming that we had it all today we still need kind of this this onboarding phase we still need Network effects to play out uh we still need Lindy to play out and and like all of these things will will take a decade so my suggestion is just you know sit back and relax and you know enjoy the next decade basically um don't don't be too uh you know don't go on the one one minute kind of uh candles or looking at the price you might as well just uh just you know hold and forget about it um now in terms of the the the one year you know timeline which people you know a lot to talk about you know because we're at the end of the year and you know we're projecting into 2023 I I think it's very very difficult to to talk about that because it we're just so small that even like one person could have a very significant impact so for example you know on the upside you know we could have a billionaire we could have you know Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or whatever Elon Musk suddenly wake up and yes it clicks for them ethereum is going to be the settlement layer for the into the value I'm gonna put in 100 billion dollars into this thing there's only 150 billion dollars now you know the price would explode it could happen and um I you know I wouldn't hold my breath on it but you know the same thing could happen with with Builders you know someone might have like this genius killer app idea that we've you know never thought of you know a bit like the cryptokillies uh back then but kind of uh something just people don't expect uh that could also happen I think Regulators could also you know just one person in the world Gary Gensler could just say oh suddenly I understand The Ether I'm in love with it and uh I don't know I'm not bullish on that one no neither am I I take the point and you know same with macro you know it's like uh 12 old men you know in the in a room and you know they they can change their opinion on things um and I think it's a very similar thing on the downside you know you could have like one hacker who just decides to be a black cat instead of white hat and you know he found the bug and he's just gonna make the world burn um you know it's it it's very hard to predict but what I like to do is uh a couple of things like one is look into the past does anyone remember Mount gox does anyone remember the Dao does anyone remember this Shanghai those attacks or the parity wallet bugs or bitfinex hacks all of this is like long distance and so what what I think even like the recent stuff like anyone remember Luna like we're no longer talking about Luna it's kind of uh it's been digested it's gone um even like the Ronin Bridge hack right that was like a a 400 million dollar hack or whatever like no one's talking about it um so what I encourage you to do is just assume the worst case scenario just assume that by nines grayscale and jump all simultaneously collapse assume that if has declared a security assume that withdrawals are delayed to 2023 or 2024 2025 assume that if researchers hit goodbye bus assume that we get 51 attacks and we need kind of manual intervention I see all these good things it doesn't matter it doesn't matter on the 10-year timeline it's all noise um and you know it ether is going to win at least that's my thesis regardless of the noise that happens on the on the on the one year candle basically this is a a great way to kind of like wrap this up and uh and and end it so uh Drake is saying sit backs relax and uh and hold right or as we we've said on bankless uh stake it till you make it um I think that's the long-term play here uh D DC so you got me all right somebody's listening they're like you got me ethballs I'm leaving this episode and I'm feeling kind of bullish do you have any thoughts on how they get not Financial advice uh of course advice but like any any thoughts on how somebody should begin to get exposure to this asset class like what if we made somebody so bullish they're like oh second mortgage I'm yoloing in sorry don't talk to the spouse and they're just like all in is that what the way to do this or are there smarter more prudent ways uh with your investor cap on that that you would say to someone to channel that bullish energy it is this is specifically going out to the listeners who have bought ether while listening to this episode you know who you are you can't escape uh DC who do you say to these first of all I'd say definitely don't borrow money to buy cryptocurrency certainly not at a bottom I mean because you never know where the bottom is exactly right so this is me injecting my caution into the discussion um because we we don't know there could be further downside but I'm going to tell you guys rather than give advice to you I'm going to tell you what I'm doing um I'm accumulating um in a bigger addition to my ethereum Holdings over the course of the next at least one year uh probably up to two years and that's going to consist of weekly buys or maybe twice a week buys and I'm just adding to my ether Holdings and that's really what look there's going to be volatility in the market even in a bear Market if you want to see what can happen I encourage you to look at the ethereum and Bitcoin charts between the years of 2018 and 2020 and you'll see a pretty violent tale which a lot of people live there's a lot of blood sweat tears lost ether gained ether in that chart that and that chart has stories behind it and so if you're looking at this and you're saying hey I'm really excited about ether I would say start dollar costing averaging in the important thing I think is being consistent as Justin said over the 10-year time Horizon the the bull case for digital assets being ownable is absolutely massive it is a massive Paradigm change I mean I was talking to my neighbor and he was telling me how his daughter prefers to be paid in ether when she babysits their kids she's like 14 years old she's like she's got a metamask set up she's like minting nfts they think about digital ownership the same way that previous generations think about physical ownership in a lot of ways and so I really think that paradigms are changing that doesn't happen overnight but it will happen over time and I think you want to be here for that you know and don't make the mistake if you're a long time Community participant now is not the time to walk away okay I walked away in 2013 or whatever after Mount Cox and I didn't get back until after ethereum had already launched if I had stayed engaged I probably would have been engaged in ethereum much earlier DC asking for a friend what percentage of your portfolio in crypto is irresponsible just just asking for a friend I don't think any of it's irresponsible because it's all thesis driven and it's not it's not money that I can't afford to lose it would really suck if I lost it but I'm not going to be on the street and um I think that's what's important you know you can you can you can and you should have exposure to this asset class but you don't need to put your entire net worth into it like well most of us have well we are hopeful DC yeah we are hopeful do you see that next uh bull cycle you can get some furniture in that house though it's uh still working well we're working on it yeah I'm getting a new one so that's a supply chain issue though isn't it yeah that's I see DC going to the furniture store and looking at that couch shouldn't be like yeah no I saw a tweet from him this morning and he said he's been waiting on furniture for like a year that's why I thought it was crazy I'm waiting patiently all right uh Anthony be the responsible adult in the room okay we're all hot and bothered at the end of this podcast um what should we do about that I mean he asking me to be responsible like yeah give it tell us what you're going to put on why my suzu hat for a second and call eighth a revanchist apocal multi-generational assets is that quote he used to use these words that no one had really used before to make himself sound smarter but yeah but no no I'm being serious now um eighth is a multi-generational investment opportunity he's not going to kind of make you lots of wealth overnight you know you're not going to buy it today and be rich tomorrow sort of thing but in my opinion over the longer term Eve acts as a true multi-generational or store of value and the most amazing thing about it is that it is digital it is not physical right like physical stores of value have existed for a very long time and they will continue to exist right people use their property as a story value obviously there's gold and other precious metals but digital story values are something that's relatively new and as DC said there are people in the younger Generations much younger than us that are growing up in this environment right this is going to be natural to them it's not going to be foreign like it is to a lot of us uh at you know at this point in time like a lot of the older folk like why would I want to own something digital I can just copy paste it's like you don't get it right you just simply don't get it you thinking in the old world kind of way of thinking and and it's the same thing we saw with the rise of the internet and computers the older Generations had a much harder time grasping this than the younger Generations do simply because they didn't grow up with it it wasn't part of their world view before they got to that age which I feel like I'm pretty much getting to where you become uh jaded and you become ah you know there's that new thing the kids are into these days ah I can't be bothered with that like I just want to focus on on what I'm used to right but it's always the the younger Generations that that cause this change and it becomes natural for them so I think that they're growing up with this and that's why it's a multi-generational kind of asset they're they're growing up with this they're it's normal to them uh digital ownership is extremely important to them given as well as that physical ownership is is Out Of Reach For A lot of them they don't want to play the game that's rigged real estate is rigged a lot of stocks are owned by uh the Boomers as well right like by the older Generations they don't want to play that game they want to play their own game and for them I think you know it because it's digital because it's all online they they're used to that that's their world so they're like I'm gonna go play this game right and that can come in the form of ether other assets on top of ethereum or even other assets outside of ethereum just crypto as a whole and I think that to me is the bull case for crypto generally is that you you don't have um the reverse happening where people are you're becoming more less and less digitized you have more and more digitization going on and on top of that if we take the macro scale you have actual globalization physical globalization actually uh reversing but you have digital globalization just in continuing to increase so I think looking at it from that way Heath has a digital asset and other digital assets uh to me are much better Investments Than Physical assets going forward and much better things to to kind of hold the stores of value as as well guys this has been great full disclosure all of these balls including David myself we do own eth and at the end of this episode it'd be kind of weird if we didn't right if we were talking about this all right um uh you know I was just actually looking this up so guys uh mangoes listeners this is the fourth bankless the bull case for each episode that we've done the fourth um and uh yeah Anthony and DC were on the very first and that happened fun fact two years ago the time this came out eth was trading at that time around 630 dollars when the episode was published uh so on the way up went to 4K and we're we're still 2x up right pretty good return for two years so uh if you want to play another game you can go down memory lane and listen to the previous bull episodes we'll include a link to those in the show notes it's just kind of fun to see how the thesis really hasn't evolved at all it's just been bullish eth just more has happened to make us both it's been it's gotten more specific session never had that before uh anyway uh Justin Anthony DC it's great to have you as always thank you for being bullish Heath thanks thanks for having us action items for ubiquis nation just one link to go understand during the holidays and that is ultrasound.money go click that link go learn everything you can if there's things that don't make sense do some research at some point in time we gotta collectively come out with a like a video like a five minute video to describe this whole thing I feel like that should be a joint project maybe that the youth bowls take on and publish somewhere for folks so it's a quick how-to um that's super important anyway go do that wrist and disclaimers gotta end with this none of this has been Financial advice all right seriously none of it uh crypto is risky eth is risky as well you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier
