they just announced yesterday that they were going to raise interest rates by 0.75 and this is the biggest increase since 1994. but there's a problem here in that like their plan to fix inflation they only have one tool in their tool belt and that is to raise rates basically beating us all down making us feel like we're in a recession in order to decrease demand for products and the hope is that that will tamp down inflation so if you're an asset owner your assets go down if you have no assets you're kind of living paycheck to paycheck you might lose your job that's what a recession is the sign of reversal like when will all of this reverse i don't think it will reverse until we see the first signs of inflation actually reversing
