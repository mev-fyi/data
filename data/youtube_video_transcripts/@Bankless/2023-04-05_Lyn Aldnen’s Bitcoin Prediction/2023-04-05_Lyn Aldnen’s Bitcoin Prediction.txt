we had biology on sort of the famous Bitcoin to a million in 90 day bet and then we had Arthur hazon where he was like I could see Bitcoin to a million dollars in like two to four years and then we had Ben Hunt on Ben was basically like you can't call this an insolvency at all he said this is just a liquidity issue what is your take on this whole debate between your description somewhere between Arthur and Ben would be my position my base case would not be a million Bitcoin in four years and then I'm pretty far from the 90-day hyperinflation I think the long run is that the FED will reach a limit where they're unable to keep tightening while inflation does have a Resurgence in the years ahead which is maybe where I would probably would aligned at least somewhat with Arthur
