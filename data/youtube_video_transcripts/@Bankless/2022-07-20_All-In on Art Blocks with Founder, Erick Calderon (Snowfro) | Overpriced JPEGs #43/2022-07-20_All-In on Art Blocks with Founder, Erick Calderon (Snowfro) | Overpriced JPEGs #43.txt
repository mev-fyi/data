what's up [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs I am so excited about today's episode I am talking with the one and only Eric Calderone also known as snow fro perhaps better known as snow fro I mean Eric snowfro he is a crypto Punk and uh you know crypto OG he you own crypto punks with every trait I believe except correct a little bit of a question mark around the alien one it's a fractional ownership uh and of course you are the founder of art blocks and he's the creator of chromie squiggle so we're going to talk all about why art blocks is thriving during this time of the bear I'm gonna talk about generative art the art blocks creation process I had some folks on Twitter send me a bunch of questions so we'll we'll answer some audience questions

life so I guess Eric's probably more normal digitally people do call me snow Pro all the time and I'm used to good at this point I mean xenica 33 whose name is Roy I like exclusively call Danica and I see other people call him Roy sometimes I'm like what no that's Seneca so our digital identities are our real identities at this point it's frightening yeah yeah it's it's it's scary and fun um okay I want to start with a question actually that I got from Michael Wong who's on our bank list team I didn't know I don't know if this is a controversy or not so you're gonna tell me he asked what is the true OG art block is it construction token or is it chromie squiggle is this a is there a community debate about this a little bit yeah I mean it's it's kind of interesting so uh the morning of Black Friday right uh November 27th 2020 I was ready to launch art blocks and you know uh my brother created the project called Genesis and I was helping him upload his uh I had already uploaded the squiggle you know I I literally deployed the smart contract not too long before our blocks launched because I've been working on testnet I screwed up the upload for the smart contract like two or three times before that it was I was up literally all night and um I just remember you know I said okay 10 o'clock it's it's open and I and I told people on Twitter that and I never really felt a lot of pressure I mean I felt like I told like three people that because I think there's three people that might have cared but I specifically remember Jason which is a very active member of the crypto pumps Community um telling him 10 o'clock my time whatever that was his time in um so yeah 10 o'clock rolls around I'm kind of scrambling uploading my brother's script um and Jeff minted his construction token um and so it was actually the very first mint on Art blocks I mean at this point I had minted hundreds of squiggles on testnet hundreds of everything else so I didn't it just didn't I just didn't even think about like what order things would be minted in and so um yeah he minted construction token and then I got my brother's script up and running and then I was like okay cool I'm gonna go mint a chromey squiggle so I minted a couple chromie squiggles somebody minted one of my brothers first so like the only time that an art blocks dropped the artist did not mint number zero is my brother's which is totally my fault although I was you know also uploading his code for him and trying to you know I I think he was still kind of a disbelief that that it was happening or that anything was going to happen on day one so he was like yeah sure just upload my code go for it um and uh and yeah so Jeff's uh construction token is token number um gosh I think it's token number two million uh because we add a million for every new project I think was the very first token uh minted on our products so the true OG you heard it here I don't know if it's first but is construction token by Jeff Davis so help me understand and folks want to know about the origin story of chromie squiggle and things but on that first day of art blocks how many artists did you have lined up to to Mint on the platform and and how many people bought from the platform on that that first day or that first week well I had myself Jeff Davis and my brother DCA my brother actually created the very first proof of concept like the very first proof of concept for our blocks a project that we coined uh Genesis and this is back in 2017 2018. um he created that project and then leading and he created it in processing which is not compatible with our box but processing JS is a library that is compatible with our books so we were able to Port his project pretty pretty easily then um in the months leading up to our blogs I well actually in the Years leading up to 100 blocks I reached out to dozens of artists and none of them actually uh took debate except for Jeff Davis so I I actually launched our box with the only three projects that I had that were willing to participate yeah um mine which you know again was also a proof of concept for a long time and uh my brothers who started as a proof of concept but I thought it was a beautiful Artistry and what he had created so I always saw it as an artwork not as a proven concept and then Jeff Davis's construction token what was your pitch in those years leading up to it to these artists oh you should see the emails I mean the pitch got a lot I would love to see the email closer you should post it on closer yeah you should uh like closer to Launch I actually got my together and I understood what I was trying to pitch right so it wasn't so crazy uh leading up to launch I had at least six or seven artists in our Discord talking about it you know interested in maybe doing something and giving me the time of day because it it takes some time to figure out how to upload code to the algorithm I mean to the blockchain and stuff um early days though if you see those messages I mean it literally sounds like an alien talking you know it's like like the blockchain and this and you're gonna mint and put your coat on chain and it's resolution agnostic and uh the majority of the artists that I reached out to just simply didn't reply and honestly if I got a message like that I probably wouldn't reply either I'd be like this person's crazy like this person we all get those DMS where you're like uh yeah because it was just it wasn't fully vetted it wasn't refined yet it wasn't until you know I got to spend some time on testnet which was you know there was a good three months of testing on testnet with the community with people minting test squiggles and test um all the other projects that I had created um that I I actually understood what I was offering and I understood what this process was well enough to be able to describe it and you know I've mentioned this in the past that I had worked with a smart contract team block rocket Tech really nice really nice dudes out of Manchester um in the early days of our blocks to write the smart contract and at one point I kind of gave up because I was like I didn't feel like I could even communicate to them what I was trying to do no matter how hard no matter how much excitement I had behind what I was trying to do at our blocks I I actually gave up working on the project just because I could not effectively communicate my vision they you you know I would tell them this is what I would like to do and they would execute it seamlessly and perfectly but every now and then they'd ask a question that that would indicate to me that they actually weren't fully in tune with what I was trying to do long term they were just you know doing what we needed to do for the smart contracts and um it was tough it was hard to explain this to people I mean the the the convergence of generative artists and people in the blockchain space uh was Tiny and I mean there's already not a ton of generative artists in the world uh prior to what you know our blocks is launching I'd say that there was a few hundred maybe at most a couple thousand um you know people that were dedicated to it I mean we've all tinkered with creative coding we've all tinkered with generative art but people that were actually like putting stuff out there and and trying to build a name for themselves so yeah it wasn't it wasn't a big pool to pick from my understanding was the seat of this idea was you men crypto punks and being like well why should I know in advance why should I be able to pick off and mint all of the zombie punks wouldn't it be interesting if when I mint it I didn't know what I was going to get and that was like one of the the early seeds for what would become our blocks right do I have that right absolutely yeah I mean I had been working in generative art or code based art for a long time there's a lot of other things that kind of came together uh once I came up with this concept of just wanting to like meant something that's created on demand and but it was actually the minting of the crypto punks that it clicked for me I said yes the blockchain can prove ownership of something digital wonderful I I you know that that was the moment that I understood that for the first time and the blockchain could provide the data to determine what I was going to get instead of me deciding what I was going to get and so that was kind of like the very first moment that I was like oh man like we could we could build something here um that would be more fair I mean it you know it wasn't fair that I got 34 zombies and it's not fair whoever claimed six aliens you know like it's or however though I could say you were around you know like you anticipated that you thought that was cool there was no I may be sure at the time that those were going to be more valuable or whatever yeah there was no monetary thought at that point you know and yeah um did not think they were becoming Millionaires and I agree there was yeah no I think we were all like what are we doing here but um if but I was excited it was it was it was a pleasant process it was an enjoyable process and so I'm thinking okay if we're going to do this in the future if this is going to happen more and more then this way of selecting our generative outputs is not functional because then it's just who can get there first so you know even like imagine with cryptokitties if like they just opened up with 10 000 cryptokitties after having seen what happened with crypto punks the like there would have been a gas I mean crypto kitties did create the first gas Wars anyways but there would have been a gas War just for like the more valuable ones so I think um it just felt like there was something interesting about uh owning something digital and there was something interesting about the concept of Rarities but uh being able to Mint It On Demand was original um in that original day yeah so I want to put forth an understanding I have around the place of art blocks I guess in in sort of generative art history and I want to get your reaction to it and have you maybe expand on it so gender of Art's been around since the 1960s in in various different ways but but my understanding of this is art blocks not only meaningfully change things for these gender of artists in that it provided this platform and this new way to reach an audience Etc but it also really upped the Annie in terms of you're committing your your algorithm your code to chain which is first and foremost you know kind of a bold thing that people didn't have to do in the past and then moreover my understanding is that historically as a generative artists you would maybe produce tons of outputs and then pick your favorite five or ten or whatever and make prints out of those and now not being able to kind of control which outputs you pick and your buyer is going to get what they get that really puts the pressure on to get this algorithm really really right before you start creating art and that seems like a really fundamental shift in the way that generative artists and gender of art works is that right yeah I mean the blockchain provides tools and one of the tools is scarcity and there's there's different ways of looking at scarcity there's scarcity in like the speculative Madness that we're experiencing we're like there's just not enough pieces for the amount of people that want them um and that's an example of what's happening with crypto punks in just about every other of the original nfts so that scarcity is not what I'm talking about here although that is also very much a product of the blockchain scarcity being that a algorithm a generative algorithm had a seemingly unlimited number of outputs you could have 4 trillion chromie squiggles um maybe more if you just ran the algorithm over and over and over and over um humans I think need a cap need to understand okay yeah there's millions of these but this is the body of work and so what artbox is doing um is it's making an artist sign off on not only the work that's going to come out of that body of work in advance craft their algorithm to like make it perfect but sign off on the result as the body of work and generative art never really had a great guideline or structure for that to happen maybe if generative art had become better received earlier in history maybe guidelines would have been put in place some standards would have been put in place you know um galleries would have created provenance for generative art in the same way that we see provenance for other traditional art forms maybe you know databases but you know shared databases not blockchain but whatever might have helped an artist establish a Edition size for uh for a generative algorithm the thing is is you know these artists would create these imagine for example an example fidenza you know fidenza is an algorithm that let's say in in the most in the most effective way Tyler Hobbs in 2010 if he had had recognition for fidenza as an algorithm and was going to generate individual outputs print them because back then really that was kind of the way to appreciate them I mean there was some digital appreciation but it wasn't really the same thing then present them to a gallery have the gallery show them then put them through an invoice process to then eventually end up in someone's house where someone's going to come and hang them having a thousand outputs it just it Not only was it contrary to the standard Gallery model of scarcity it's like oh my God Edition size of well his is 999 editions of 999 that's crazy but also the amount of work that was necessary to go into that so the algorithm is absolutely capable of creating 999 and I'd say in this case a little bit more even compelling additions but due to just like the standard of Art and making art maybe it would have only had five or ten or 15 or 20 or 100 even just from like the pure work and effort that's required to put art out into the world prior to this so yeah you've created a cap in a in a system with low friction so people can acquire the artworks at scale giving an algorithm like fidanza like ringers the ability to produce a nice huge addition size and I I think a thousand is a huge addition size I think art blocks kind of got wrapped up into some PS PTSD for a while there and then everything had an addition the size of a thousand not everything should have an addition size of a thousand were very cognizant of that I think a lot of artists are cognizant of that and we're seeing that change now dramatically but you know there are some algorithms that can handle that and that's a perfect example of an algorithm that could handle a huge addition size so you know it's not that I mean fidenza could have been created in the year 2000 the year 2010 you know and it could have had incredible success as an artwork in those times but would the collector would the audience have ever had the ability or the the luxury of being able to experience a hundred fidenzas on the same screen or scrolling down or being able to filter and say oh look at these spiral fidences like you know Tyler Hobbs If he if he wanted to display us a spiral fidenza he would have had to generate a spiral fidenza deliberately not let the algorithm just kind of create those to then give these users the surprise and the Delight of scrolling down through all the mids and be like ooh look at that one that one's a spiral oh look at that one that one's like mono color it's just that experience is so much different now and so much more immersive and and Community Based that it has elevated generative art Beyond just that that that that the beauty of what used to happen in just the artist studio into essentially an international public experience of performance art in and of itself and I think that's why I you know we I don't think that you know I didn't set out to revolutionize the generative art World um I set out to just create something that would allow me to make art the way I like to make art and I thought other artists would want to do it but damn like it's definitely proven you know as Leslie Silverman had said on a panel one time to be such an incredible product Market fit and I always have to put an astro service down not saying art is a product and I'm not saying that you collectors are a market but like just from the core of it you know we're creating things that people like and the experience is very much a part of it and I think that's part of why the success of what our blocks and other awesome generative art platforms are experiencing right now you mentioned these guidelines may have emerged had the mainstream appreciated generative art sooner but it also strikes me that probably the creation of these guidelines is what a lot is allowing it to get more mainstream attention curious from your Vantage Point are you seeing the traditional art collector World start to understand and appreciate generative art in a new way or do you think there are still long strides to go on that yes easy yes and yes we have long strides to go but it's becoming so much easier now that the market has cooled down although um unfortunately I mean I should I don't say unfortunately like I want people to make money I'm happy for people to make money but unfortunately things are heating up again so I feel like it's gonna we're gonna take another step back it's detrimental to mainstream adoption when you have 95 of the world looking in and seeing some of these dollar values that are happening around this artwork right so um because it it leaves a weird taste I would say initially it was a bad taste in people's mouth now it's just a weird taste it's kind of like I don't get it I don't understand it how do I get involved like you know how do I not get scammed there's so many questions that the overall the outside world um the the more hectic it is the more noisy it is the harder it is for them to understand it I was at Art Basel a few weeks ago and you know ethereum had dipped under a thousand and I think people were even just like scared to even ask me about crypto related stuff maybe because they thought that I was just worried about ethereum or I was going to be depressed about you know I mean because it is obviously like if you have something that has lost a lot of value you probably don't rub it into people and um and so the conversation was literally just about the art uh and it was a wonderful week of just conversation about art craft understanding scarcity like under explaining that scarcity model to a group of people that are used to editions of five or ten um is really important I remember early days of our blocks um you know I would I would show someone a ringers and they'd be like oh that's beautiful you know and and then I would zoom out and I would show them four ringers and then I took because I you know I it's so hard to explain R blocks especially early on instead of trying to get into the depths of like algorithmic art I'd be like let me just show you this example and you zoom out and then there's 20 ringers and then you zoom out and there's a hundred ringers and then you zoom back into a different one in a different location and it it demonstrates you know then you go back to saying this is all made with one algorithm this is one artist crafting one set of parameters to generate this much Beauty um and you start to really get an appreciation of The Craft of the artistic craft and you know a lot of people will say that there's no soul in digital art there's a lot of people even more people will say there's no soul degenerative art because my God you didn't just you know digitally make one piece you digitally made a thousand pieces um but the reality is that you know just how people get really good at crafting things in the physical world these artists have to get so they have to practice so much restraint and um and and practice just in general at what they do to to generate these beautiful things and little by little I think the traditional art world is starting to really appreciate that Beyond where it was appreciated you know before before our blocks came around it clicked for me when I when I heard folks talking about how fidenza is so incredible because it has this this remarkable diversity in the outputs but all of the outputs are of a really high quality and that clicking of like oh wow yeah it's such a skill to be able to have both a diverse range of outputs that are all really cool looking and that one doesn't just like end up like sort of like a bunch of brown and gray blobs or something you know and so I was like oh I started to click what a craft this is and increasingly that'll that'll happen for folks everywhere right it's also it's interesting because fidenza and ringers have come up a lot I mean I find myself speaking of them uh all the time but um it there's so many projects on our blocks that have that same level of craftsmanship you know there's also a world where you know a a a audience can elevate a couple projects just timing um you know it hits the right chord the way that artist interacts with with the community for example Tyler Hobbs has written extensively about our he wrote a really nice essay about long-form generative art um there's a lot of artists that don't actually have that in their in their skill set or do they have the time to do that I mean a lot of these artists still have full-time jobs right and um I think one of the things that's really important to to consider and as this like thing this whole thing that we're experiencing flourishes is you know uh there is support coming for artists to be able to help them present their art in a more meaningful artistic way I don't think that a lot of the artists that released are on our blocks last year even took into consideration how this could have turned into what it turned into and uh I don't think that art blocks paid enough service to the artwork I don't think the artist paid enough service to the artwork like in terms of you know like writing about their work and like demonstrating their process Etc uh and I think that that's a deficiency that we will retroactively go back and fix for previous artists and and uh we're so excited to be able to offer upcoming artists so that we're not just talking about these same two projects so was that really you know surfaced you know like uh so that we can actually talk about all of these projects that are just so brilliantly put together um and you know we for example we recently hired a artistic director that was both an artist and has just years of experience with with artists and you know is going to sit there and help them coach them in their career help them write about their work write about the artist's work critique the work um that is a very important role that we have at Art blocks that we consider to be a huge value add for these artists that are entering a space that is just now in the long scheme of things getting recognition and so um you know we'll see we'll see more and more of these projects kind of get that recognition that they having education and explanations to really demonstrate what that's fantastic I think Warren Buffett has a quote that's like when the tide goes out you see who's swimming naked and he said that about bear markets and it strikes me that it's very clear art box is not swimming naked as we see it have it really frankly Thrive and and get even more attention if that was possible in some ways certainly relative to other projects during this bear Market I'm curious why you think that is and if you're finding and this is a question that came from Busan on Twitter um if you're finding that people are valuing or evaluating art blocks works at all differently in this market than they did previously I think that's a cool question so there's a couple things that are happening number one um I have price points at which no matter how bad the market is I will buy those pieces and I think other people do as well I think that a lot of the later entrants in art blocks I mean I think archetype is a really good example of this like there's a lot of people that want an archetype and for the normal average consumer the prices that they went up to are just completely unreasonable uh and but there are people that actually appreciate them for the art and weren't necessarily concerned about what the value was going to be and so they had this price point in their mind of what they were going to buy on ad and when it hit that price point they bought it and this is a different generation of collectors than the ones that were there in March April of last year the ones that really kind of benefit from the crazy um uh explosion I guess of like the generative Art Space of our place so I think there's a lot of people out there like that oftentimes in the crypto space you have people buying in this kind of fashion where it's like oh yeah I minted a bunch of board Apes from 0.08 sold them for five eth out of just pure joy and excitement because I mean I specifically remember when they hit five eth and people were like oh my God I just made all this money I'm gonna sell all these apes and they brought it into art blocks right and like I remember our blocks had a actual like bump not what happened in uh September specifically from this moment where people realized that they just made a bunch of money on board Apes like you saw that you almost saw the money come from board Apes into our box right that is a very different kind of collector that works there they you know we call it grinding where this is maybe like my original mindset which is the degenerate mindset you know you grind your way up to be able to afford the things that you're actually really excited to own and um people did that in all last year and people still do that today but then you have people that um participated in less expensive drops on Art blocks enjoyed the process join the community were part of it and saw these projects that were just completely unreachable to like normal human beings and those projects started to kind of Decline and they I mean you know nobody wants anybody to get hurt but I'm sure they're sitting there just like I mean there was there's a couple pieces specifically that I was just sitting there like all right here we go here we go and then finally you pull the trigger because you're like holy like I'm able to buy this piece that I really wanted to buy so I think that that um is part of the sustainability of this where um and I'm sure the same thing happens for pfps right so I don't know why necessarily art blocks is um uh experiencing a different situation than the pfp uh Market specifically um but the other side of this which is something really special too it's like uh you know if you if I had a exit survey of art blocks in September and said like you know on a scale of one to ten How likely are you to recommend or blocks to a friend my answer would be zero right like no I'm not going to tell a friend of mine to go take 12 000 out of their savings account to buy a piece on our blocks tomorrow like it just it felt frothy it it felt unreasonable to me Etc today you can buy an art blocks artwork for a hundred dollars and gas is pretty low these days so even with gas you might even be able to get something for 100 125 dollars that starts to be a number where people that are curious that have watched from the sidelines and read everything from like Wired Magazine Wall Street Journal all these things that have been written about our books let's say in the mainstream media 80 of people that read the walls to General are like well screw that okay those crazy lunatics but there are 20 probably they're like oh that's interesting and then they go and they see that they can't buy anything on the platform for less than a thousand dollars like okay yeah no there are people that have been waiting to participate in this space and they haven't been able to and so you know back to that scale like on a scale one to ten How likely am I to recommend our books to my friends absolutely a 10 when you can go buy something for 100 bucks and you can participate in the creation of the artwork with the artist and the community com you know having conversations about it uh it is just a completely different world right now and it's allowing new people to enter the art blocks ecosystem nobody was allowed to enter for months unless you were a huge VC firm or a huge collector you just it was it was like the most gate kept Thing by pure froth and now that's changing and so we have new entrants and what people kind of need to understand is the more new people the more conversation and the more excitement and the more movement and and and so that tends to kind of heat the market up again and so you know it's just this cycle yeah so the pendulum is now we had a little period where it was more accessible and the Pendulum now seems like it's probably swinging back into price points that are getting increasingly difficult for for new folks to to come into it is and the nice thing is for now at least you know the price of ethereum is still reasonable um so yes I would tell a friend I mean you know uh it's interesting with squiggles uh I I had this number in my head that I said if it hits this I have a bunch of friends that are like man I really want to get in on you know I want to have a squiggle I want to have an ft I want to I want to get involved and there's a there's a bunch of friends that I that I have that are not necessarily like wealthy individuals that could just go blow money but there was this number that if squiggles hit that number and say to them well I don't know necessarily say it but let me just say that we we basically bounced off of it so you know you can look historically but basically there was this number where I was like I will call a friend now and be like look yeah buy this 5 000 thing it could go to three thousand it could go to zero but no one's gonna like be out on the street you know it's not gonna affect their like college savings plans for their children that number was a number that I felt was a reasonable entry into this space and it's still a lot more money than I could have imagined spending on a piece of art three years ago so to be clear um we bounced right off that number and the same thing same exact thing happened with crypto punks you know I remember thinking okay at around 50 000 bucks it starts to feel reasonable to buy a crypto Punk again you know and sure enough like I mean I think it went a little bit below I think we got down to 47 or 46. but um there are these numbers at which you know after if you've sat through these Market cycles for as many times as I have you start to see what these numbers are and you start to think okay this is a rational entry point to start getting involved and uh I see that I I saw that happening with a lot of the major art box pieces where like you just you hit this resistance where like it wasn't going to go below that and that's where people were like okay well if I'm gonna do it I'm going to do it now I bought the most expensive work of art I've ever bought in my life during this kind of downturn um and I'm just I'm can you share what that is I yeah I I I kind of love how this space Works uh I bought a incomplete control and um what I did I bought it I had been eyeing it for months and then and then you know the prices went down pretty low and then I saw that there was a few sales below 63 and then there was one listed for 63 and I was like oh my God it's not a chance and then uh I remember on my birthday and I had a few beers uh things started kind of heating up with art blocks uh there was like this one night of just kind of like Bonanza at Art blocks and and I was like oh God this is gonna be like it this is my last chance like if I don't get it now like I'm screwed and so but also because this space is so transparent I um I I didn't want to also add to the insanity or add to the Bonanza by buying a very expensive piece so I went and I created a new wallet address and I sent funds from coinbase to it and I was so proud that I kind of did this like you know anonymously I was very happy to share this later I just didn't want to contribute to that that specific acute moment of insanity that was happening um and then I you know I remember getting on block talk and seeing people be like oh my God we have a new collector and I'm like no no no like I'm not trying to like you know like it just felt like it was no weird situation yeah so anyways but it was it was a beautiful moment I got really excited to be able to have that it is something that I've been wanting for a really long time and the way that the economy came together enabled me to have it and I think that that's a lot of the reason why you're seeing what's happening but you don't necessarily it's happening with art blocks more than pfps but I I think it's actually pretty clear in the sense that I I think the thesis broadly speaking for art blocks is that generative art is a currently underappreciated art form that in time will be recognized in a fully mainstream art World way as art and we have analogs for Fine Art going for hundreds of thousands millions of dollars in the world in a way that pfps the expectation is not necessarily that they're fine art it's the community thing it's the utility thing and there aren't good analogs in the web 2 World for for like how do you really justify 200 000 to be in like a club you know um and so I think that's again the tie goes out and you see where people's conviction really lie and I I share the sentiment I think it's um it makes sense to me that gender of art we have a pop we'll have a we'll only continue to grow in the future and the question is which artists will grow and maybe it'll be all of them and maybe it'll be a select few and yeah I think art for the Sega art itself is part of the reason right like we've fought so hard to just make people buy stuff that they like and if they want to speculate that's fine but like that we don't want to support that being the reason you buy the art we want to support the reason you buy that because of Art and I think that the reason that I'm surprised that it hasn't happened in the pfps is more kind of that analogy that I said like you know people waiting for that low entry point I think even in pfps there are people like I mean I have a price at which I would buy a Doodles I love Doodles but they got too expensive right I never actually owned a doodle and um there's a price at which I would buy it it hasn't quite hit that yet and uh so even though the pfp market maybe is not experiencing the same kind of excitement of what's happening in the art world I still think that that same strategy applies there are in fact because our appreciation is still not completely proliferated our society there's probably more people in the world that understand the concept of a pfp and maybe more people in the world that would like a board ape or would like a crypto company or Doodles then the amount of people that would want to own because you actually have to dive into generative art to understand it the nuances the artists like the concepts whereas with pfps it kind of is like the same concept across the board of course we have utility and you have all these things that you know also add to the to the value of those things coin shift it's a leading treasury management an infrastructure platform for Dows and crypto

crypto I want to get to the curation process this is something that folks have a lot of questions around and I want to talk to you about potential future for decentralizing things and and all the rest uh but I do just piggybacking off of that do you have any books maybe art books in general or generative art book books about generative arts in particular that you recommend folks check out if they really do want to learn more about this space um yes uh I don't I don't get to read very often so I listen to books and so a lot of like generative art books uh don't really make sense by listening to them because they you know they show a lot of pictures but there's one there's plenty of books and I can put together a list for you guys but there's one kind of outdated book that it completely blew my mind maybe like six six months into uh getting into art blocks which is called the 12 million dollar stuff shark and the reason that it blew my mind is because you know I was seeing Kirby's Google selling for a thousand dollars and I was like what the hell is going on these things were ten dollars a few months ago and like just completely Blown Away by what was happening in art blocks and kind of like confused right because I mean yes I like to Tamp down the speculation I I at least I don't you know and what I mean by that is like I will never fire people up to go buy our stuff like that is just not gonna happen and that's normally the way that other communities get people to get excited about their stuff and that's fine but I will never that's just not how I um communicate and participate and so somehow without any of that happening we still we're getting a lot of recognition a lot of money was coming through this ecosystem and and so it was these valuations that were starting to just I they were breaking my brain a little bit okay not just the squiggle you know the squiggle and and like crypto punks and a lot of the other artbox pieces whatever it was just all these things going on and so in this book it talks about the Branded artist the Branded collector the Branded gallery and it started to really sink in for me that there are things that are Beyond just like looking at art and saying oh I really like this art I did not know that I mean I'm the first to admit that before launching our blocks I knew four or five contemporary artists and that's it and I was a huge fan and most of them made colorful gradient rainbows with lights literally like that's why I was a fan of these artists and like I didn't explore art very much beyond that and so I don't know art I don't know anything about art I know a lot more now and I've gotten a crash course and I've been very lucky to be mentored by amazing people within the art World from artists like Tom sacks and uh you know galleries like uh Adam lindemann's Venus or Manhattan or Pace like I get a lot of mentorship from a lot of people but um it was that book that made me understand the the excitement that comes from the person behind the art the person behind the gallery and the The Collector themselves and like how they add value because they own it they add value that Gallery adds value because the art went through the gallery and yeah which I think in the in the traditional art World also has some like negative externalities it's been shocking for me to learn that like for example if you go into a gallery and say like okay I have the how much does that cost two million dollars great I'll write you a check right now you don't necessarily just get to buy that piece of art that the gallery will curate the collectors or who can collect work because that adds to that story so um I've just been fascinated by all the things that I see as sort of problems that's a terrifying and it's exciting nfts are so excited for that but but you know what's interesting it's like yeah I used to be like yeah gatekeeping sucks this is all awful well you know what else is awful when you make a work of art and it's flipped immediately after that and so a lot of that gatekeeping as I've learned more about this space is the is the gallery protecting the artist and saying you can't like if you just come in off the street and you buy this work is it you know maybe you know something and maybe you're gonna flip it the next day for three or four million bucks it's not actually a matter of keeping it away from a stranger but it's also a matter of and this is something that I feel like is completely undervalued in the crypto space which is the the the the relationship that you build with your community and with your customers and so it's like it's it's pretty straightforward if I I'll give you I'll give you an example uh larva Labs got in a lot of trouble or got yelled at because they gave the uh Auto glyph zero or like the initial autograph project to proof Collective owners um and not to Auto glyph owners right like their clients their original clients were the auto growth owners but like the proof Collective are the ones that were able to Mint that uh really beautiful piece that was like the pre-auto I forgot what it's called it's this wonderful work and and so people were like and people ask me all the time did you ever get offended or did you take it personally that you didn't get one of those and my answer is uh Lara Labs can do no wrong and yeah I mean I would have loved to get one because I have a bunch of Auto glyphs and I've invested so much time into their ecosystem but you know I wasn't like you know I wasn't I wasn't angry about it I wasn't you know I was just a little bummed not to get it you build a community by rewarding your community and so an art gallery has a group of collectors that have over time bought from them supported the gallery and it's it's usually when you hear about that you know gatekeeping it's not somebody off the street isn't allowed to buy it is that there are dozens or hundreds of people that have supported that gallery that want to buy it first and it's really weird imagine you the collector of that gallery now extrapolated to you the collector of an art of art blocks as a let's say gallery you really want a work of art by an artist that's released by that gallery you've bought stuff from that Gallery forever and some random person off the street is allowed to buy that piece of art yeah gatekeeping sucks but it's also like relationship building and business building and so it really has kind of opened my eyes to that because yeah I mean I I was really against gatekeeping too and now I'm starting to realize that like if if I do a a pfp drop let's say or like not pfp drop but another really big drop and I don't give chromie's squiggle holders like some kind of privilege or act as in advance of that I feel like it would be a huge disservice and there is nothing shy of gatekeeping there like there's nothing shy of gatekeeping there the difference is that the Art Market world like started long ago enough that we just feel like we can't get into it anymore whereas we're at the Forefront of this one so we're getting into the gates earlier yeah I mean 27 2700 Google holders if I did a drop of of 1000 there's no way that the outside I mean assuming it was good who knows what I would come up with a total trash but let's say it was good and I I allow this to 2 700 Google holders to get that thousand minute drop there's no way that anybody from the outside world would get would get in yeah period and that is gatekeeping so yeah sorry I think it's a no I think it's such a great point and I love I love maybe perspectives that feel a little contrarian and you're absolutely right and this actually dovetails us well into curation because I I've heard rumbles or people have said oh will you ever decentralized the curation process of art blocks and my feeling on that is kind of like I don't know that I want that like I I trust y'all like I you know I shouldn't be able to buy a token and have a say on what's in art blocks curated because I know jack about what makes gogenerative art and so but I know this is a part of the conversation so talk to us a little bit about the curation process and then um how you've thought about maybe decentralizing or launching a token someday yeah the decentralized curation process I think is a really beautiful idea uh I think you know I think of block talk every day 10 times a day I haven't been on Discord in over a month um I have reasons for that I mean it's just incredibly distracting I travel and I literally just can't get through my emails it you know so I owe the Discord Community an apology for not being in there but um I also think that hopefully they see that like my time is going to things that are making their experience that are blocks better but anyways that's a little aside but um you know I think of block talk all the time uh blockchuck is this really crazy little corner of the internet where people are very open and honest about their reactions and I think that the uh the artistic collecting maturity level of block talk has quite like uh exploded since the Inception of blacktalk right so what I'm about to say does not apply to block talk today but imagine you know June of last year and we say Okay Community you get to curate what's going on our box and right but then people are just starting to understand curation and understand it would have been pfp after pfp after pfp that is curated on our blocks like there's no way around it like that is what was Sensational at the time that is what was kind of coming around at the time and we have you know we get a lot of pfp type submissions in our blocks and they're and they're they're awesome I love them but um we are focused on creating art and there's a lot of art missing in the PF that doesn't mean that a that there's no way that a pfp can be a work of art by the way but um there's a lot missing there right and so I I kind of joke about the fact that like there was a time in our in our box history where if we would have handed off uh curation to the community what what would have actually been curated could have been a series of pfps it might even have just been like three pfps out of 20 projects but that doesn't feel like art for the sake of art itself right um today that's very different I think that the people that actually participate in Block talk would probably be incredible curators and for that reason we're starting to integrate Community curation into our curation process so we're going to have a rotating Board of community curators that are going to come in for uh periods of time and contribute to the curation process just as much as everybody else because they are just as valuable as everybody else now does someone in Block talk have a degree in art history if they do and they speak about art in a way that is educated and eloquent they're considered in a different way in the process of selecting the curation members right we are trying to build a balanced diverse Board of curators our community is getting more and more diverse but it's still a bunch of dudes for the most part we cannot have just a bunch of dudes on the curation board that is not an appropriate way to fairly imbalance in a balanced way select art and so you know for that reason alone you can't just allow the entire Community to be a decentralized curation method because that's not how the art World should operate it might operate that way I don't know but that's not how it should operate we should make huge strides whenever possible towards inclusivity diversity and that is not something that you get from a decentralized curation board and it just isn't and I I mean I I'd like for someone to kind of prove me wrong on that but I think we're far away from so ladies you hear this if folks if you've got the for the women listening who you know have an art background what's the process here what should they do to uh throw their name in the ring to be either rotated or in some capacity on a curation board for our blocks well so we just went through a very very strenuous process of uh revolutionizing our curation process right so what we've done is we have a charter which we didn't have before that has rules and those rules are if you don't vote within this amount of time you're out um if you you know there's rules about not buying art in advance or you know making sure that it doesn't feel like you have any kind of inside here yeah although we haven't really experienced that with the curation board but just you know we've we're looking around corners here as much as possible um we have expanded it and made sure that it's an even more diverse curation board because even though we did have uh a in comparison to the to the typical crypto space a pretty diverse curation but now we are really uh gone out of our way to make sure that it's more diverse and it not just gender you know but just in general a diverse curation board um those people have all received this Charter they've all received instructions they've all um you know been vetted I added people and I love everybody that's ever been on the curation board but early days of our blocks like if somebody had a really meaningful conversation with me that demonstrated an interest in what we were doing I was like hey you want to be on the curation board but it's very different now right like I'm no longer in control of that yeah how many people are on the curation board I think we're going to end up with 20 active members that's kind of our goal is to have and then they review applications and at a threshold if if enough folks say yes they make it into our blocks curated so yeah so we are and I I there's a there's a much bigger thing happening in our blocks right now that's kind of leading up to uh some pretty significant changes and I think a lot of those will be revealed more as time goes by but we are making some pretty big changes that are going to change the entire process but at the moment we have an internal committee at Art blocks that is composed of like 10 or 15 artbox people that are selecting the the projects that we like um you know it's really hard sometimes we say no to projects that might feel like a toy but they might be incredibly well like executed or if they feel like a video game or if they feel like you know or if they're missing composition and we and we try to give great feedback and say come back like this is feedback we we have um for for from for over a year now we've contracted with so Sofia Garcia who oftentimes if a project we really like it but it's just not quite there on the threshold we would say hey can you give an hour session and so we'll you know we'll contact her to give an hour mentoring session to an artist um if we really like the artist and that this project isn't the one that we're most excited about but we see their work and we're like no we really want to include you and art blocks you know we'll we'll come back to them and say hey look like you know we really like this other work or whatever uh we we are uh trying to make it to where the curation board is not presented with 20 projects a week our blocks was judging three projects a week for a while we got a lot of pushback for not getting through the application process fast enough now we're we're blowing through the application process right so now like the the application list now we're at uh at least 100 projects a month if not more which maybe doesn't sound like a lot but uh it's we give attention and time to every single project and I and I wish people kind of understood that a little bit more like um every single project that applies goes on to a spreadsheet which indicates their previous experiences and artists that you know shows their previous work shows what they're working on gives them a place to make an artist statement every single project is evaluated not a single one even if someone just put a square on a screen and called the generative art would just be you know set brushed aside every single application is processed and um the reason for that is because we want to be able to tell artists in a meaningful way why they you know we're not selected to be on our blocks so once an artist is selected on our books then the next process is it goes to uh curation and so we are very actively throttling the amount of work that's in our blocks you know we used to accept every single project on our books and then we went to like 50 and now it's like less than 15 of projects that apply are uh selected to go into our blocks and then from there there's presented to the curatorial board in the curatorial award decides whether it should be a curated project or not we're running a little low on time and I'm looking at all of the questions that I have left so I'm going to try and go through this quickly one um you know a distinction between our Block's curation our blocks Factory I I think I've heard you speak previously about potentially having more Community input though I hear you're adding that to the our blocks curated piece as well but to our blocks Factory any note you want to make there do you see there being a token in the future for our box Factory that helps make decisions around um around that there won't be there won't be a token anytime soon uh if there is a token it'll be far in the future when every other platform has proven what a token looks like um but there are changes that are happening um that will uh that will be revealed in the next few months that will affect the the question that you asked I'm not necessarily trying to dance around it it's just we're really excited about this really beautiful kind of innovation that we're bringing to our blocks in general um and we want to announce it and release it all as like one big package excited about it so uh so you're saying you'll come back on to tell me yeah I'd love to after after November I'd love to come back and like talk all about like the new art blocks awesome you started to allude to this I think you get criticism at times or art blocks has gotten pushed back about releasing too much work and It ultimately being dilutive and if you keep doing these drops will it ever be worth anything how do you respond to that criticism uh you know originally when I when we were we were allowing any artist to put anything on the platform um the criticism felt different uh my goal was to be an open platform that was the original intention of our blocks that was the entirety was to let anybody that knew how to code put their art on chain in this way and uh it was really really hard for me to come to grips with the fact but then you read the 12 million shark and you were like we need to be branded whoever kind of came around starting to be a little bit more restrictive um what actually happened is that we started realizing that we were literally hosting some of the best generative art in the world if not the best gender of Art in the world and you know artists um hinted in some cases in other words were very direct at like you know how potentially there is a disservice to the really fantastic like art that people have grinded on for years to make an artwork and algorithm compared to the one that you can tell that somebody just kind of whipped up potentially during September or October because they realized that there was a lot of money to be made there's a huge discrepancy between the quality and caliber of the art on the platform and so um we realized that we were spending eighty percent of our time as a team maybe not 80. let's say to be less severe sixty percent of our time the entire team was spending on what we call the factory which is just like allowing anybody to put art on the platform and 40 of the time was being spent on what curated playground the projects that we actually felt like um uh were so you know we're elevating we're raising the bar of um of generative art and it it we are limited we Limited in resources just like everybody else in this space and we're like okay well are we going to keep growing our team to support uh you know and to be clear some of the factory projects are my favorite project so I'm not blanket state statement over the factory it's just that's the pool where everything ended up um and are we are we growing the team to be able to like expand that and support that and be able to just host anything or do we want to be able to dedicate meaningful time to projects in both curated and the factory to elevate those artists to help those artists with their career and and bring it up and so that led to a decline in our rate of of releasing projects it led to us being kind of jerks and saying to an artist this is the maximum Edition size that you can have which is something that we fought for so long because we didn't want to meddle with like what the artist was doing it was it felt kind of like not our business not our territory uh it maximum Edition sizes maximum total value of projects and um the result has been that we've had a significant drop in Supply at artbox and it I think it's a wonderful side effect some of these changes that we've made um but telling an artist to stop making art is really hard and if I see a really good work of generative art and they want to put it on Art blocks it doesn't really matter what the supply is like it's it's really the artist's Supply you know that is being diluted not the platform Supply and a perfect example of that is for example the uh the amazing platform on uh tezo's FX hash like they're about to hit a million mints nobody questions them about dilution right there's not that much difference in the concept of how we release art and how they release art in terms of just like you know generative on-demand minting which is the root of what we're doing but they're almost going to hit a million mints like there there should not be a cap to artists being artists creating creative stuff and if you don't like the creative stuff that the artist is making you don't need to buy it and and so follow the artists that you love now as we've become more of a curated platform as we've become more of a gallery than a platform which you know it's true I struggle with but it's it's I think of the past this is what we are at this point you know being selective um we are cognizant of Supply we are cognizant of making sure that we are we don't have um you know too much stuff out there and we are starting to do some crazy analytics on what our open what we're calling our open to Mint inventory right and making sure look our blocks our art blocks collectors you know specially speculators all benefit when our block sells out mentally we don't benefit when our block sells out that's what starts that trajectory again where like you can't buy stuff for cheap or for reasonable prices anymore so we want to make sure that we never get to that point where our Block's totally is sold out uh and you know we're not that doesn't mean that we're going to turn around and start like dumping more projects on people but we're also cognizant of the fact that like that is not healthy for the artists when they sell something out immediately at way more money than someone that's been creating art for a really long time has just because of froth like artists are happy to make more money but nobody actually feels like they are comfortable with the froth that comes with this with this from an artistic perspective and so we're trying to balance all of that you've teeding it perfectly for what my my next question is and I guess it might have to be my last but I wanted to make sure I got this in which is to get your thoughts on FX hash and somebody asked specifically if you'd ever consider like an internal Marketplace for art blocks the way that FX hash has it so would love to get your thoughts and then um perhaps that ties into just your your perspective on chains and where you fall or you're an eath maxi are we heading to an omni chain world what do you think on all that I am an eth maxi but that doesn't affect really my my opinion I mean I um I actually haven't collected young FX hash simply because I've been living under a rock a rock um I remember one of our artists actually like dragged me to Tesla's kicking and screaming just because they created an artwork for me specifically shipbuilder created this this like homage to our box called the blocks of art which then turned into an artbox project and I was like okay I guess I'll get a Tesla's wallet but like my life is not such that gives me the luxury to browse through the incredible amount of projects that are on FX hash and follow more artists than I'm already following it's just like I don't I don't even get to go on Discord it would be really weird if I was sitting there minting on FX hash but like not coming in addressing my community and Discord right so um but the the reality is I think that FX hash is an incredible platform and I think um we we both start from the same route which is on-demand generative minting which I think is something that we have found uh the community the world has found to be like an interesting concept and something that we're all uh really excited about um and then there's diametrically opposed ways of how we execute that but in the end we both host fantastic art and so we both start from the same concept and we both end with what I think everybody wants which is just really damn good art um and uh everything in between could be completely different and that's fine I think that's perfect that we have different platforms I think maybe one of my favorite things about what's happening with FX hash is that we're getting artists Supply to our blocks with a portfolio on FX hash and that portfolio isn't like three projects that were deployed at the same time it was three projects that were deployed in sequence and you see the first project you see their growth in the second project you see their growth to the third project so when you give feedback to that artist that has potentially never considered themselves an artist up until a year ago because they're actually a computer programmer that realize they have a creative side which is something we should celebrate right we shouldn't shun the new artists just because they have the skills and you know um not all computer programmers that are making art are doing it because they're trying to make a bunch of money or that like there are people that found a creative side to them and they happen to have these wonderful skills of computer programming those artists that have that trajectory that they've built on FX hash when they come to our blocks um if we have critique or feedback for them and sometimes maybe let's say they don't get accepted on Roblox just you know I'm trying to sum this all up like how beautiful this this ecosystem is working the projects that have those trajectories take the feedback so well and so much better and so much more positively as like let me work on my work let me be incentivized to put my best foot forward my best work forward versus artists that don't have anything on FX hash that don't have any history on Instagram or Twitter that doesn't mean they're not a good artist but like in in you know people would be like well I worked six months on this are like it's crazy that you're not letting it on I'm like yeah but that doesn't mean that it's good art or that it doesn't mean that it doesn't need some refinement and um the there's just this beautiful thing happening where a lot of people are testing their skills on FX hash it's a playground for people to really kind of get comfortable with the concept to start building a community like don't count on Art blocks to be your marketing tool yes you've gathered a community and that's really great and we're proud of it but like we should be this platform that it elevates generative art so go build an audience so that if and when you do uh mint on our blocks you already have an audience of people that are looking to to buy your work not counting on whoever artbox is bringing to the table so I I love um what they're doing it like I said it couldn't be different you know we look at every single project at artbox it is incredibly time consuming and resource dependent they are the opposite right anybody can just put their own work up there that's a beautiful brilliant model it's one that I personally don't feel comfortable with doing a because I want to give time and attention to every single Project B I'm terrified of the idea that somebody could put up code that is not um you know that might infringe on somebody else's intellectual property and that's something that's happened at artbox too so we're not immune to it but just like the open nature of it call me a coward like I am terrified by the open nature of uh of uh and like you know the potential implications of what that means like I was crushed when that happened on our box I I spent a week literally like up till three in the morning trying to like figure it out on a single project that was like you know problematic I as a human could not live with that on a regular basis and that it's just like with open C like openc is an amazing platform but they have scam projects too because that's the you you can't fight decentralization either you want decentralization or you don't you want the spiritualization great then you're exposing yourself to some of these situations but on the other side of that because of the open Nature people are willing to experiment there it's so much less expensive to operate it is a A Greener chain and I think the combination of all those things really makes FX Hash a very compelling place and I I'm glad that FX hash exists um I I I think that it is actually making and further elevating generative art um as a medium and that literally is all I give a about and I think anybody at artbox gives a about is that we are all just making this community of artists and collectors uh in giving something to them that they didn't have before and so yeah I love what FS hash is doing and um I I really congratulate them for all of their success amazing well I congratulate you on all of your success thank you so much Eric I really appreciate you hopping on there was a bunch I will say that I wasn't able to fully get to uh simply because we just there's so much to talk to you about so would love to have you back on later this year we can talk I mean the resolution diagnostic piece I don't think people fully understand and there's some questions around that that I think would be great to dive into so I'm teasing for the for the future episode I wanted to talk about the Marfa Gallery you're working on you do a lot with art IRL as well at this point Santa Martha November 11th come it should be a lot of fun we'll be a group of community community of people that are really just interested in this kind of art and it'll be great um I would love to so we will we will Circle back on all of this but I really appreciate you taking the time and uh just congrats again I I'm grateful so grateful to everything you've done for the space thank you so much for having me I'm very grateful to be here thank you [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode
