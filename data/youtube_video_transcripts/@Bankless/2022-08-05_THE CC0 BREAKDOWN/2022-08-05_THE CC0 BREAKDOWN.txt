[Music] moon birds has made a huge announcement which is that moving forward moon birds and oddities will be cco projects so we're going to talk today about what cc0 means what the alternatives are and the implications for moon birds holders and the space as a whole there's a whole lot to talk about when it comes to licensing i've had a lot of conversations with really smart people about it so i wanted to break it down for you here right now okay licensing comes on a spectrum there you could think about it almost as three categories of licensing but really there's a whole range anywhere in between that licensing comes in so on the one extreme we have cc zero which is what moon birds just announced that they will be moving forward and that means it's a project in the creative commons effectively moon birds and the organization behind it which is proof collective the company will not be enforcing any copyright that they may have over moon birds so when you create something original like the moon birds art you have the copyright over that as the entity that created it and they're now saying we won't enforce any copyright over this the world at large can do anything they want with this entire moon birds collection and we won't say anything about it on the other end of the spectrum is a traditional art piece or what you see with like a v friends for example which is where you as a holder of a v friends nft have rights over that particular nft in terms of that's your collectible but you don't own any of the underlying ip you don't actually own you don't have the right to do anything you want with that character or to commercialize that character in any way you see fit it's really just a collectible item and then in the middle is where you get this whole range of options this of course is what board apes did that was so revelatory which is they said okay hey we have this board apes ip that we've created but if you buy a board ape nft you actually have the right to the ip of that specific board ape that you own and you have commercial rights to that specific board ape that you own which means you can go off and sell a t-shirt with that board ape on it and we won't say a thing or you can go off and make a whole coffee company built around your board ape and we won't say a thing because you have those rights now we see different things in in this space like some projects say you have commercial rights up to a hundred thousand dollar limit so you can go use your particular ip for your particular character to go build a business around it but if you start making more than a hundred thousand dollars a year on that business then you have to come talk to us and maybe there's a negotiation we can work out doodles is is sort of famous for this they want their their holders to have a lot of rights but they say hey look at a certain point if you're going to commercialize in certain ways we just want to give permission to that so you have to come and talk to us and and so our rights are set up in a way to bring you to the table to have a conversation with us if you want to build a bigger business around this doodle's ip what you're betting on is garyvee and his team you're saying i trust you are going to make this ip incredibly valuable and therefore this collectible that i own is going to have value for me because you have gone off and done this incredible work to make this project successful in the case of like a garyvee i think that's a smart bet i own v friends i think gary's incredibly talented and i like that the power is in his hands to do as he sees fit and i'm along for the ride on the other end of the spectrum in the cc zero camp it's not that you're necessarily not betting on the team the team can still do big amazing things with the project in theory now again we haven't actually seen any of this play out because this whole world is really new and we're on the cutting edge of it so we don't see cc0 projects in the traditional world like disney is not cc zero so it remains to be seen but in theory the team is still just as capable as anybody else to go build something amazing with the ip of say moon birds for example uh it's just that now anybody else can do it too so you're betting on that maybe there's a beethoven out there a beethoven of art or branding or whatever that's going to be inspired by the moon birds art go take it and go do something fabulous with with the moon birds collection that will create value for you so on a broad spectrum it's the difference between betting on sort of one set of visionaries and one creative team versus betting that an entire collective and an entire world will be able to make something valuable out of it benefits and drawbacks maybe this is obvious but the benefits of having something really centralized is again if the team is strong that's fantastic and also you don't risk brand dilution you're not worried that a v friend is gonna show up in a porno and dilute the value of v friends in general because v france is trying to be a family friendly brand and to have a character in a porno would be kind of disastrous for that family-friendly image right so that's the benefit of that is you don't have to fear that now the drawback is you don't have an entire world of people trying to create with that ip so again benefits and drawbacks if you are now moonbirds and you're cc0 the benefits are anyone can go out and create value out of this whole collection the drawback is somebody could go and use that in some sort of fringe political ideology or again put moon birds in a really compromising weird porn film that really dilutes the quality and premium feel of moon birds as a brand and again then when you look in between these two extremes you know same deal like board ape has that risk board ape has the risk that somebody goes off and does really nefarious things with a bunch of the board apes that they own and that that reflects poorly on board apes as a collection as a whole so what is my opinion in all of this and then i want to say a few words about licensing in general and where the industry could go and why i think this is such an important topic and frankly such an exciting topic okay here's how i feel i think that successful projects can come out of all sorts of licensing arrangements or all sorts of ip rights arrangements ranging from cc0 to really strict licenses i think it depends on your brand so i'm going to give a very specific example here when it comes to the board api club i think it's fantastic and i think frankly it's been integral to board apes success that individual holders have the rights to their ip and to their board ape ip the board 8 brand is one of like just a middle finger the whole board aviat club thing the the name itself is irreverent it was it's satirical it's about sort of being renegade and so having individual holders go off and do what they want for them with those board apes supports that general kind of misfit renegade vibe of the brand furthermore if abort ape was to go star in a porno or be on a toilet brand or something like that it wouldn't tank the whole value of the collection in my opinion because again the whole thing is about being kind of renegade and there's an awareness that holders can go off and do what they want by contrast you labs has announced they will also be giving more permissive rights to crypto punk holders hugo labs recently bought crypto punks a couple months ago and they're saying punk holders will also have the rights over their individual punks i don't think i love this move i think that punks are a premium luxury fine art product and it would devalue the collection to have punks everywhere like on toilets and starring in pornos now i may eat these words i may be wrong and and punks is the right brand i mean punks is itself imply something kind of renegade too and so punks is a brand maybe should be splattered everywhere and on all sorts of different products and maybe it won't hurt it maybe it'll it'll skyrocket the value by 100 each but i don't i don't think so and i think that regardless of whether or not that is the case for punks specifically whether punks should be the rights should be given to the individual holders this general point still stands that i think there are some brands that are better if they're tightly managed let's go back to doodles as an example again doodles is a little bit more careful with their brand they say hey if you want to go off and make a derivative doodles project we want to support you but we want you to come talk to us about it first that's because doodles is trying to be major entertainment ip and they're trying to be family friendly their brand is much more wholesome so they can't have somebody going off and making something that's really contrary to what that brand is and having it hurt holders having it make it less family-friendly the kind of core of what they're trying to be as a brand to close what does this all mean why am i so excited about this we are pushing boundaries in always in web3 as we know but we are really pushing boundaries when it comes to ip and what does it mean to own something and what does it mean to build ip and to to build these new creations and to do it in collaboration with your fans and with your audiences we're seeing this play out in a number of ways in web 3 right now coinbase has put on a or is building out a trilogy series little five minute shorts and they cast different board apes to star in that trilogy series and they paid the whole the owners of those board apes that they cast ten thousand dollars a piece to have their board ape star in this film there this is happening across the board there are people trying to cast world of women characters and stories or or board ape characters etc etc and they're paying the holders for the right to do that i've been joking on my podcast it's like we're turning every like asset holder into a stage mom where now they're fighting to cast their particular character in a particular world or story and while that's kind of funny it's also really exciting because it opens up new revenue streams for people who get into this world and especially people who get into this world early another area where i think this is really exciting is in the realm of fan fiction historically we have seen entities like disney or i think george lucas was pretty famous for this too be really stingy uh you could say about their ip and about the worlds they are creating and were really begrudging about letting fans run with the the worlds they had created and create fan fiction that could really be integrated into this broader story world as we start to think about more permissive ip rights in the world of ip or in the world of web 3 that totally changes and suddenly now fan fiction is something that's really encouraged and is seen as a way to help explode the world in popularity in in terms of fans love for it because it just increases their engagement with the brand and that's something that's fantastic for fans i think will in many ways be fantastic for the franchises themselves and with nfts as licenses there's all sorts of different ways that revenue splits can be managed by smart contracts and make it really easy for the original franchise creators to get royalties for the way their fans might be monetizing their own fan fiction work and then for the fans to feel like they're a part of the franchise in a new way so that's it a quick rundown of the kind of ip rights we're seeing in this space some of what i think is good and maybe bad about it and what we can look forward to in the future because of this new world of permissive ip in web3 [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode please go ahead and hit subscribe it
