welcome everyone bankless nation this is state of the nation episode 6. david and i do these every single tuesday we broadcast them live on youtube well not live actually we're getting one day one day yeah it's it's uh the same day turn around on youtube and then we post it also on wednesdays to the podcast feed we are here to talk about what is happening in the bankless nation that means what's happening in crypto what's happening in d5 we related to the big picture things we so show you some visuals we drop some insights and action items sometimes we even bring in a special guest and today we have a special guest that we will surprise you with in just a few minutes david how are you doing today sir i'm doing absolutely fantastic got down off of a mountain uh this weekend and came back to a totally different uh d5 it moved so fast it moved so fast so you you like was that like two days and you missed um you missed like two years in d5 yeah it was it was 36 hours and now uh i'm just behind you're gonna have to find a new breakfast buddy who can keep up faster than i can all right well i was checking things over the weekend so i think i've got us covered but um you know there's a few things i don't understand as usual it's becoming too much to keep up with um before we i ask you the question david we should talk about two things that are going on this week so the first is we actually have roon christensen the founder of maker who's going to be in the bankless discord at 12pm july uh thursday what's july 23rd thursday july 3rd 12 p.m eastern time so if you are a bankless nation member make sure you make that we get to ask anything we want we did this with uh robert lesner of compound last week um did this with itamar from argent it's just a fantastic way to learn a bit more about these protocols so catch that also david uh you are releasing a new bankless show i hope to help you on that sometime but you are taking the lead on that can you tell us about that and um what you're going to be releasing next yeah we now have the meet the nation series where uh new projects uh kind of projects that need some more exposure projects that people haven't heard about um are able to meet the nation so we just released our first one with the reflexer labs project which is producing the rye stable-ish coin and so if you want to know what reflex or labs and rye is all about you can go and listen to and watch the meet the nation where i interviewed stephen yonescu i believe is how you pronounce his last name from the reflexer labs team their project is is very comparable to maker dow and we kind of pull back the layers and get into it with with steven on the meet the nation and we're going to be rolling this out for every project that is new every up and coming project any project that you have questions about you can always ping me ping ryan tell us that you want to get some project on to meet the nation and we will get that done so this is like the way to learn about the next big things that are going on in d5 so on state of the nation we talk a lot about current events current protocols but meet the nation is a chance to as we like to say front run the opportunity and get a little bit ahead of what's happening next what could happen next in d5 i learned a ton from your interview uh on rye that these things are are almost like they remove the volatility in a way that dai doesn't super interesting and uh you're doing one today right david i'm doing one today with the with the ampliforth team because there's a lot of un unanswered questions i have about ample fourth which are which we're going to get into oh give me a good one i have some unanswered questions too we should we should talk about that later on today that's exactly what we're going gonna get into with meet the nation awesome all right well uh let's definitely do that so um what do people need to do to catch meet the nation subscribe on youtube pretty much right yeah subscribe on youtube it's not there's not going to be one meet the nation day we're going to record these as uh as we deem necessary if not if no new projects come out in a week which probably hopefully never happens but it seems in d5 they always yeah oh something always happens and so um whenever something good comes out whenever there's a worthy team that we want to meet the nation we'll meet the nation but if there's not there's not um and so the only really way to to do that and pay attention is to a subscribe to the youtube and b follow the bankless hq twitter account because that's where we will be tweeting out uh the meet the nation episodes you heard it uh david i've got a feeling you might be having to do one of these like every day pretty soon because it's just coming fast and furious absolutely okay so uh the question the question of the say the nation is always this david what is the state of the nation right now sir yeah we've already hinted at it pretty pretty strongly thus far but the state of the bankless nation is exponential things are absolutely crazy right now uh like i said i went to the mountains this week and i came back and there's this brand new thing called called yiffi uh uh this new token whatever iffy yfi yeah is that is that it is that maybe i'm yeah it pronounces it that way no no yeah apparently it's it's defy liquidity mining but like on steroids i don't understand how it works i i've i listened to eric and anthony on the the um eth weekly recap and and i tried to understand how it works there and i still didn't get it like and i'm this i live in this stuff and i still don't get it and so like if i don't get it like so many other people don't get it d5 is moving so incredibly fast like gas prices are above 100 way right now they were at 70 grey yesterday in 70 grade the day before that's absolutely insane uh i i have friends of friends who are asking me about d5 i have friends wait really yeah uh-huh yeah dude all right and like you're getting texts or wait are they saying are they saying the words defy are they asking for like like um ripple tips and stuff like that no instead of ripple it's link okay it's definitely link it's defined link but they say defy because i got a link text yeah no i got i got one i got one d5 text yeah what did you say about link you're gonna make the link marines mad okay or maybe you're not maybe gonna be bullish i don't know yeah so like okay this is a little bit of a tangent but like i'm of i'm ready to be convinced that like things like link things like synthetics they're all like link is over a billion dollar market cap but synthetics is below a billion but then there's like litecoin and bitcoin cash and like cardano and eos they're still in like the top 10 top 15 billion dollars market cap like link is totally worthy of displacing them like link could go to could go and take off eos wait are you saying it's a better coin than the other coins sorry perhaps yes yeah and like so could all the other like kyber deserves to be up there synthetics deserves to be up there at least in comparison to litecoin like black coin doesn't deserve to be up there and so i while i say this state of the nation is exponential like we could be in the very beginning of that exponential curve all right so open mind you've got an open mind on that we're going to talk about that too i think that's our first topic with our guest actually to talk about what's going on with d5 tokens and some of the exponential growth that we've seen but before we do david we've got to talk about our sponsors the first is avei oh pardon me that's me ave ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum one of the many tokens that are absolutely mooning and i hope to one day have it displace all the other coins out there like litecoin and all the other ones in the top ten that i just mentioned uh the ave is a borrowing lending protocol that is a little bit different got a little bit of extra tools and tricks up its sleeve the one that i really enjoy is the stable interest rates loans that's a really important money lego in order to bring crypto to the mainstream and replicate some of the financial services that we find in the real world but on ethereum stable interest rates are are incredibly important to be able to plan out and predict your financial future and you can access stable interest rates via ave for developers and the creative types you can get real crazy with their flash loans protocol where you can borrow up a large and large large amounts of collateral for no for no collateral no deposits so long as you pay it back in the same transaction so you can do some pretty crazy stuff with that uh check them out at ave.com awesome and also speaking of ave i want to tell you about argent so arjun is the best defy wallet for defy hands down especially if you're using mobile david was talking about ave you can access ave it's currently free i think they've extended it so if you're doing anything with ave in argent there's no gas prices and that actually means a lot these days you can also access compound pool together kyber token sets this is really a almost like a if you're in the us you know venmo this is like a venmo experience for d5 it's super secure easy to use there's no seed phrases involved you can have guardian and social recovery so you can bring in some of your friends in into recovering your wallet in the event that you lose your mobile they've got over 20 million in locked assets i bet that's going to climb as well it is the most bankless wallet with good ux out there uh so check them out at argent.xyz that's a rgent.xyz we will include a link in the show notes okay david we're talking about coins i don't you know i i struggle with that term because i think it's a i think it's abuse you know like um particularly around like among maximalists um but there are some coins out there that clearly unless they are viably competing as a money they are not worth nearly the market caps that um that the market sees them as worth subscribes to them ascribes to them today um our first topic we want to talk about this q2 token report so the second quarter token report that lucas campbell put out on bankless lucas is a talented researcher he researches you know all of these kind of token economics and he put out this fantastic report we've actually we're bringing him on the show lucas are you uh are you there i am how you guys doing welcome good man how are you doing lucas just dandy on this uh fine tuesday morning awesome well you killed it with this report dude it's like really good uh when i read it i was like you know what we're starting to get to the level where we've got like wall street level analysis and metrics supporting some of these token assets so kudos to you i think it's super well received uh well done on it i'm actually going to share aspects of it lucas on the screen so we can we can talk over a couple of the findings but maybe you could start with um like we've talked a lot on bankless about defy tokens being a new asset subclass in crypto they are crypto capital assets can you talk a little bit about what a crypto capital asset is and how it's different from other assets in crypto yeah so crypto capital assets are kind of this new emerging asset class within you know crypto assets right and i think the the notable difference here is that these protocols or these assets are you know have tangible value thrown flowing through them so you're able to take you know traditional valuation methods like p e ratios and dcf models and uh you're able to model how these tokens stack up to their peers and attempt to find you know like a fair valuation uh so that's probably the notable difference like when you're talking about like other coins like litecoin and whatnot there's marginal fees and what uh on the network so it's really tough to value those tokens based on their cash flows so that's kind of really the key differentiation between um a majority of crypto assets and then the crypto capital asset is that there's this tangible amount of cash flows flowing through the protocol and this is kind of what we talked to talked about with ben hunt right where um there was there's a very strong transition in crypto right now while i still believe a lot of these valuations are kind of just based on traditional crypto valuations where it's mostly just supply and demand and narrative and story there is now ways to measure these things in very grounded and fundamental valuations and i think that's partly why the d5 narrative is so strong right now is because we can actually see cash flow we can actually see real value in ways that we cannot see with like litecoin or bitcoin cash or card or whatever right yeah yeah you know like ben was talking about um basically getting back to sort of fundamentals and the tie between true fundamental investors who still see a world even in stocks that is you know based on cash flows as a fundamental and this asset class is is starting to become that in crypto so it's cool that like uh traditional investors who are used to models to value stocks can now value some of these d5 tokens that way that said it's been absolutely um explosive like the growth i want to maybe flip forward to this to talk about token performance in q2 right so q2 april through june of course um i've got a a chart up that was included in your report lucas that shows token performance and we've got bnt that's bancor right um we've got lend we've got ren these grew like the first two they grew by over 500 so they did a 5x just in one quarter ren grew 2x synthetics almost 2x uh i mean it's done a lot more this quarter but like that's some pretty explosive growth is this growth deserved lucas what do you think yeah that's a good question um if had you asked me what the state of the nation is i would have said mooning these tokens just have been going off like most of them have increased by like triple digit uh percentage gains so it's just been you know wild if you told me ask me if you were deserved that's a little bit more nuanced um because if you look at like the fundamentals like earnings have gone down by a substantial amount um this is largely due to maker having this zero percent stability fee um which drastically kind of uh reduced earnings in the d5 sector oh so let's talk about that so i've got the earnings chart open so um if you're on the podcast i mean ch check out the video the the video is where you could see this visualize this stuff or check out the report you'll see this graph yeah this is why we do the video yeah go to the video go to the video get so we've got q1 here right um so look at the q1 uh bar chart here these are earnings right so to be clear these are all of the cash flows that these d5 tokens have actually generated so real cash flows we talked about this in our chris prenincy printed c podcast this is super cool so q1 the d5 protocols did 5.5 million in cash flows in one quarter right so that's annualized it's about 20 million right um q2 it's down this is what you're saying lucas it's down to about four million um what's interesting about this is the bars like the tokens that make up that amount have completely changed from q1 right so like synthetics just almost evaporated maker as you were saying almost evaporate evaporated they're tiny um now and and other protocols it looks like yeah there's no significant leader those are all pretty equal yeah so we see a drop right as you're saying um but we also see great far greater diversity in q2 is that is that kind of what you're seeing too yeah so we saw like a lot of notable new entrants a lot of protocol upgrades in q2 um for one we saw uni swap v2 launcher in may we also saw the launch of balancer ren launched on mainnet genosis launched their decks loop ring was launching uh their layer two decks um so we just saw like a lot of new entrants into the d5 space which you know in turn just made it a lot more diverse um but yeah lots of new players in the space now and you said maker is out because because why because their stability fees that's the interest they charge on their loans dropped to zero and the reason it dropped is to try to stabilize die is that right exactly exactly why did synthetics drop um so synthetics was kind of disproportionately reporting their earnings due to some front-running issues back in q1 and early q2 um but i believe they fixed it for the most part so now they're kind of reporting more accurate earnings um which is just a lot lower naturally not all of these have tokens i'm noticing here uh right lucas so uniswap v2 does not have a token that can capture that value dydx does also does not have a token to capture that value but the rest do is that another distinction you'd make yeah definitely um okay so very cool so we've got real earnings we've got massive price appreciation um and you and bankless and i feel like token terminal and maybe a few others have pioneered this um this additional look at relative valuations of tokens that's super important and that that almost creates like a a price to earnings ratio right so if you're analyzing stocks maybe you talk about what a price to earnings ratio is in the stock world and then how that relates to price to earnings in these defy tokens yeah so a p e ratio is just like one of the you know basic metrics for valuing an asset so really what it means at the core is that investors are willing to pay x dollars for every one generated by the company today so what that means let's say apple has a p e ratio of 80. so investors are saying that they're willing to pay 80 for every dollar earned by apple today and really what that measures is the future growth potential that the market believes that that asset has um so we can take that same uh framework and apply it to d5 tokens given that they had these cash flows so yeah so generally with pes and stocks you might see um stocks that there's high expectations of a future growth like tech stocks those would have a higher p e ratio right it's not necessarily that they're overvalued it's that the market expects them to um grow faster grow into that yeah versus like a um a general elect electric or something right which is like i don't know they're like um they're not 10xing anytime soon they're not 10xing there may be like a an 8 to a 15 p e ratio depending on whereas like a netflix that's going to be like 100 or something like that wait what what's how about a tesla yeah yeah that's that's the real one tesla's valued at 280 billion or so and they don't even make any money right so that's like one of the nuances and then like zoom which was just video technology that we're actually on right now has a pe ratio of like 1200 or something like that insane right so like okay when you're looking at these d5 tokens and when you're looking at you know the addressable market these are like open financial software accessible by anyone in the world and then when you compare that to like zoom who's posting higher pu ratios than most of these d5 tokens and it's video conferencing technology that's been around for 20 years um you just kind of see that there's massive growth potential ahead and like despite the fact that we're in the hundreds for a lot of these d5 tokens it's actually not that bad relatively speaking yeah so like what is a netflix for instance yes yes let's look it up i mean i i would guess somewhere in the in the current market like a hundred range or something yeah it's about 84 right now okay so that's 84 pe and we've got in this chart we've got a bank or at uh 92 right the lowest one right that's the lowest one um the the other thing that's interesting about this i think lucas is um both protocols and companies can kind of you know dial up their earnings and dial down right like so amazon went through a uh large phase they're still in it at to some level where they you know bezos was just like i'm gonna recycle all of our profit we're gonna make zero dollars because i'm gonna recycle all of our profits into making our prices the most competitive and i'm gonna do that to gobble up market share and get network effect and then basically own the world right so for many years uh amazon had like zero profit or a negative profit um but more recently they've started to dial that up and at any time like they could just dial that up and run insanely profitable companies so pe can be a little deceiving on that level too right right yeah i mean it's super interesting to think about that like that can't really happen to the same level i mean i guess it could happen through like governance right like if you wanted to reinvest those earnings or the cash flows like governance could i guess elect to do that but it's definitely a much more like nuanced situation than something like amazon or basis it's just like hey we're going to reinvest all of our money and we're going to post negative earnings i i just want to appreciate the fact that we're actually having this conversation where like and so lucas like hats off of generating like a graph with p e ratios of all the d5 protocols and now allowing us to make comparisons to the stock market right and like being able to compare things to the stock market which is like our foundation for evaluating stuff is insanely just a awesome and i'm just b i'm finally glad we're here we're here now like we can we can have these conversations the fact that we're having this conversation i think is just insanely bullish yeah i mean big shout out to token terminal they're really the ones you know behind this and the ones pioneering uh the pe ratio and aggregating all this data so big shout out to them i'm gonna pull this up by the way this is token terminal guys um if you haven't seen it so it uh it will show you basic more than just d5 protocols but um a lot of crypto assets and their p e ratios and their earnings over time they even put uh ethereum ether and bitcoin in this list has a super high pe ratio 1100 so this is what dude this is why it either is just stupidly undervalued it's stupid look if even if ether is just a capital asset and you don't buy the ethos money economic bandwidth everything we freaking talk about on bankless it's p e ratio is 108. it's got a netflix level p e ratio yeah like and it's a global financial information global financial system like whatever the market will figure that out i'm just i'm angry at this point because heath is so stupidly undervalued the tezos is valued at 41 000 p e ratio jesus yeah it's um well so so back to what we were talking about in the intro david right so um um do you think like good valuation of this stuff lucas and david are going to like wash all of the let's pick on litecoin because that's been a theme today uh like wash all of the the litecoin and xrp garbage down the toilet and some of these assets will start to shine are we like starting to see are we going to see a paradigm shift now that we've incorporated these valuation mechanisms lucas go for it um i think i would hope so over time right like we're still super early to this game like compound is like the only d5 unicorn in existence today it's valued at 1.5 billion the rest of the d5 protocols are valued at less than half a billion so there's there's a long road ahead and i would assume that over time the market would kind of realize that a lot of these assets are relatively undervalued and compared to like the top 10 where there's billion dollar market caps and minimal earnings or revenues on the network yeah so i think i think that we are it's it's possible that we are in a massive repricing event where all these dfi protocols with real cash flows are just going to come into fashion in to investors who are looking for something real to invest in and also like why today in 2020 would you have a thesis on litecoin or cardano or xrp or or you know bitcoin sv like can i say why sure okay it's be i think it's because and this triggers me it's because um they're operating under this like backward-facing narrative of there's bitcoin and altcoins right they're not operating under a narrative where there's three types of crypto assets the asset super classes as we call them with berninski right so you've got crypto capital assets that are earnings and cash flow you've got commodities which you know are based on supply and demand and then you've got store value of coins right they're they're acting like uh bitcoin sv and litecoin they're priced as if they're all store value coins competing for money right right so i it feels like that's why it's like the altcoin narrative it's like this maximalist narrative that's not staying keeping up with what's actually happening in the space yeah i totally agree and and like i said i think and this is why i'm kind of cautiously optimistic about seeing things that are already really highly priced in the defy world things like kyber things like synthetics uh things like maker and compound ave these things have gone on absolutely massive runs but they're still below a billion dollars and like bitcoin sv is three and a half billion dollars cardano's three billion dollars litecoin is 2.8 billion dollars there's no reason why all the d5 protocols can't be up there with them if those are priced like that the d5 protocols can also be priced like that too and i think this next cycle that we all believe that we're about to go through we're going to see all of these you know theoretical store values that aren't real store values like bitcoin sv litecoin fall out of fashion because obviously they should or maybe i'm just biased and then the d5 protocols can step in because of the actual pe rate ratios and the actual fundamentals that we get to measure or is that just too bullish i mean i think you're right on right on the mark there um we shall see though i think the famous saying is the market will stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent so sure um if we can only hope that these d5 protocols will realize the valuations that we have you know especially relative to some of the stuff that's in the top 10 and valued over a billion dollars we're getting there it will probably take a while for that to happen but we can only hope that it will narratives still dominate right david we should talk about ample fourth by the way narratives still dominate yeah i'm here to still dominate yeah so there's some there's some other stuff in this report uh guys you gotta check out um lucas does a breakdown by sector so like dexes just absolutely crushed it um both in q1 but also in q2 whereas um whereas lending sector was way down as far as earnings go compound kind of bolstered it up through yield farming and then another sector to take a look at is derivatives and that's basically synthetics right now although we've got some interesting new entrants like mcdex mcdex entering entering the ring and i'm sure we'll see others i think we'll see a lot of others um luke is anything else that you want to highlight from this report that we should um be thinking about what's what's kind of the the bottom line here for us um that's a good question uh if i said anything that we're probably just getting started this is a multi-year multi-ideally trillion dollar bull run that we're going through or that we think that we might be going through and there's a long road ahead here and equally as important there's a lot of new tokens that have yet to launch um in the deck sector we have curve in the lending sector bzrx is uh launched ave has an upgrade set for the next few weeks we're seeing uma protocol in the derivatives sector so there's a lot of assets coming uh you know coming into fruition and that are going to launch in the next few months here so just keep an eye out for them it sounds like what you're saying is there's plenty of room for growth i did write an article called the trillion dollar case for each so funny a world famous article at this point in time and um we've got right now i love this chart this is defy users over time richard chen put this together we're at about 260 000 defy users that is the population of a mid-sized u.s city so lots of growth that we're growing way faster than a mid-sized us city that's for sure yeah the bankless nation is the size of the city of richmond virginia basically um so there's yeah there's there's a lot of there's a lot of grip ahead all right awesome lucas thanks it's been a pleasure man awesome thank you guys for having me cheers appreciate it take care all right so bankless nation go check out that report it's fantastic david we should talk about our sponsors again before we get into the next few topics do you want to start yeah absolutely so our next sponsor your camera's offering uh our next sponsor is ample fourth we've talked a little bit about ample fourth uh so far in this episode ample fourth is a base money experiment and i really want to emphasize the experiment side of things uh it is a very interesting token with this crazy mechanic called a rebasing uh mechanism where it's so it targets a dollar but it targets a dollar slowly and if the price is above a dollar you'll you will find that there will be more supply added to the total ample force supply to bring that price down and then vice versa if it's below a dollar and so it it's some pretty crazy stuff happens around the rebasing but the point of ample fourth is that is a non-dilutive m0 money experiment uh and so it's it's like bitcoin in the sense that it is non-dilutive so when you purchase a share of the all outstanding ample fourth tokens you are guaranteed to have that same share no matter what the supply is so it uh it's a it's a supply elastic currency while it's also a price inelastic currency so pretty interesting experience experiment check them out at ampleforth.org lots of cool uh little there's a dashboard there too so you can check out the state of the experiment and what's going on also guys if you are exchanging crypto wanna tell you about our other sponsor diversify so gas fees are too high it's very expensive to use defy exchanges on the base layer but not with diversified because diversify is built as a professional-grade non-custodial defy exchange that operates in a layer two so it settles on the ethereum chain but all of the orders and transactions occur on a layer two that they've developed some incredible tech here it really makes you wonder why use a centralized exchange at all when you can get a better experience on diversify without giving up custody of your assets so we're talking 9k transactions per se per second instant execution and super low fees they also have the neck token which is used for governance and it will soon provide discounts to diversify traders so that's something to check out as well they were doing liquidity mining before was cool way back in 2018 uh and their exchanges is fantastic so check them out go to diversified.com we will include a link in the show notes all right david uh what do you want to talk about next man i think we're talking about the uh morality of price go up morality what what morality of pumping didn't we just say like you people shouldn't pump coins like what's going on what are you say yeah there's nuance here right um and so and bitcoiners figure this out very very early uh because the there's an intrinsic relationship between the health and protective barrier of a blockchain crypto system and the price of its native asset right and i wrote about this in my most my most recent article um uh the protocol sync in global public goods where uh i illustrated ethereum is this platform for offering protection to applications right so uniswap maker it needs to have self-sovereignty in order to be the things that they are right like a uniswapper maker dow that is under state purview is not a maker or uniswap at all right so ethereum offers protection to these applications right it says you are allowed to be self-sovereign you don't have to uh you know look to the nation-state to to operate and have rules and regulations you can use ethereum for your rules and regulations and ethereum itself is also self-sovereign ethereum gets itself sovereignty from the price of ether right and so ethereum protects applications but ether protects ethereum right and so when it comes to uh pumping eth unquote pumping eath there is some amount of like service that you are providing all applications on ethereum by trying to make sure that ethereum is as safe and strong as possible and that that strength the strength of the walls that protect ethereum is reflected in the ether market cap david are you saying it's um our patriotic duty as aetherians to pump the price of eth is that really what you're saying i'm not not saying that wait so so like um i've i've gotten into debates on this and to be clear like so i think what you're talking about when you use the term pump like you're using the term pump to be a little bit provocative it's a little facetious yeah it's a little facetious what you're actually talking about is valuing the the token economics and value accrual mechanisms of ether the asset highly and prioritizing ether the asset not just ethereum the network because the price of ether the asset is what gives security to the entirety of the ethereum network so you're saying all good ethereum patriots should want if price to go up right and you're not talking about like speculative pump so you could go dump on somebody right right like right like i know you you're holding this you're holding for like 20 years aren't you i tell you until i die grey beard right you're gonna steak you're gonna like that that's your vision so you're not short-term pumping you're talking about long-term value accrual mechanisms yeah i get that right is that what you're doing yeah absolutely also do you want to stop sharing your screen um yeah uh and so like and i i think there's an important nuance here where like it i think there's a relationship between the centralization of an asset or of a project and like how immoral pumping is right and so like and again bitcoin has figured this out where if you replace like the bitcoin army with the xrp army or insert x army here like they're almost indistinguishable the difference though is that bitcoin is fully decentralized so there's no central orchestrator of the pump in the same way that like there definitely is for the xrp army right and so like bitcoiners if bitcoiners are quote unquote pumping bitcoin just as hard as xrp people are pumping xrp but the difference is it actually serves a purpose with bitcoin right it serves a means to an end because bitcoin actually needs to go up in order to survive whereas like if you're if you're a centralized team and you have a large amount of the supply of a token pumping that is nefarious pumping that is malicious because there probably there's too many people that are just going to be enticed to dump right and the the part about bitcoin and like ether is also very sufficiently decentralized when these things go up in price there isn't large bag holders at least not in comparison to how there are for centralized assets like xrp there aren't large centralized back holders that are going to dump on people when it pumps when ether pumps when bitcoin pumps it pumps for all of us right not just for a select few and that's so the decentralization of a project relates to how moral it is to pump something and i think ether and bitcoin are sufficiently decentralized where like it's not just pumping it's like protecting the network okay so but from a community perspective the bitcoin community right now they are very very comfortable with price go up like in fact that's their main thing that's right that's the whole thing the ether community the ethereum community is historically less comfortable with that right right so i think there are there are many among us who are um you know saying things like hey the entire security of this thing there's a economic report that came up last week for eth2 staking which basically said this thing works if heath price is high it doesn't work if it's not right the entire security of the network basically there are some that are comfortable with that but there's also i think a taboo i want to say right against talking about ethic price right in the historically in the ethereum community we had vitalik on uh the podcast and he talked a little bit about potentially talking too much about price being a moral hazard and it being a an impediment to the progress of bitcoin so um the criticism of bitcoin is they've become so obsessed about price go up that they're willing to sell their soul to crypto banks and and not to to not scale the network and not extend the vision because all they care about is price go up they're not building a network for the world right i'm not saying i share that view i'm just saying that's that's a potential criticism that they've lost sight of the goal what do you think do you like what do you think about this dynamic do you somewhat agree with it too or like are you more bitcoiner in that way yeah uh it's a good question and and it is relevant to say that like ethereum does have its centralized components right like ethereum 2 is a is a centrally coordinated endeavor like there's many different client teams and so that kind of decentralized decentralizes the effort but like we can we have a list of people who are working on eth2 right so that itself is inherently centralizing we also have the ef right um so i'm caught in between like a lot of these client teams that are building out youth too and a lot of the efforts for building out eth1.x depend on eth price because that's what's funding these things at the same time if ether price goes too high too fast there might be like you know there might be some jostling there might be some like positioning there might be there's a lot more value to capture and any centralized entity like the ef like the people that are handing out money to client teams there's now like a political component as like who's going to get that money and so like having a little bit of money is like a nice balance because there's not a lot of there's not much at stake but at the same time it would be nice if the ef had more money to pay for more salaries for more client teams but then there's also the political risk of like who's gonna who's how do we decide where that money goes so it's all a balance so i understand that like for for one person that is trying to pump eath there's another person saying like hey maybe we're not ready for that yet like maybe later um maybe when there's no one to like stop you but but right now i i think there's a delicate balance between like trying to trying to pump ethan trying to have like a smooth equitable network yeah yeah and the the thing about ethereum's token economics it's scarcity economics is that its price appreciation its scarcity is also is actually linked to network usage in i think what could be a very like a very nice virtuous cycle right so if your blocks are providing value to the world that means your transactions on the ethereum network people will pay more for them right and you're creating more blocks as well so you're gonna have shards you're gonna have more capacity but people will pay more for them and a portion of those fees goes into burning the actual ether token itself so usage of the network feeds back to scarcity of the eth asset that seems to me and i've heard people argue argue this to be a very um not non-pumpy thing to do right it seems like it's like wow this is an economic network that is actually increasing the utility of its blocks the value of its blocks and the real world usage of its blocks to scarcity of its asset and pumping the price that way um i mean to me that's like a like when you view it like that and by the way we're talking about eip 1559 it's kind of neat to do but when you feel like that i mean that's a very low pump thing to do compare that to like xrp army or like you know link marines yeah but pump like the pumpiness is a solution for having no fundamentals right like right that's what that is and so the more we bake in fundamentals the less we have to have this conversation right and so we integrate eip1559 and now there's nothing left to like for for people like you and me to rally around like hey let's pump eth let's find a new way to pump eats like no like it was one five five nine now that's live and then there's also staking live and now the only way to pump eth more is by supporting d5 protocols that add more economic activity to ethereum which the only way that that's going to happen is by providing a real-world use case a real-world utility to people that want to use that d5 protocol so like we get to shut up and move on be like we don't have to talk about eip1559 anymore we don't have to talk about ethprice we can just talk about like how these d5 protocols are helping change the world because in the background ethereum gets it the protection it needs because of the fundamentals of eip1559 and this just fits right into the conversation we were having with lucas earlier where like and this is just the whole narrative of i think 2020 is like there are now real ways to evaluate and value these things and like that's and that's what pumping is for if you don't have that and so like pumping is for trying to replace some sort of real world valuations real world meaning if we have real world metrics and valuations and cash flows et cetera which is what eip1559 is and staking then we don't have to have this nebulous let's pump each conversation we can just talk about like this is how much is worth yeah absolutely i agree i think that what what we're probably agreeing on and saying is ether price go up is fundamentally good uh we need that in order to secure the open financial network of the world um low eath price is bad net from a utility to the to the world perspective the world's short first place with low eth price it is uh so if you if you are supporting kind of the entire movement of bankless and and defy this is what i can never get around it's like if you're supporting that movement we need a trustless store of value we need trustless economic bandwidth we need a non-sovereign source of money at the m0 at the base layer or this whole thing doesn't work right a government can just push the button and like deactivate the entire thing that's the same as the traditional system that's why everyone's getting scared about usdc and d5 right exactly um so anyway uh there is some morality to price go up certainly uh maybe not to short-term pumping because you're gonna dump on someone based on some knowledge you have certainly not that but long-term value accrual the morality of that i it checks out for me man it's all doing it all right uh what else do you want to talk about david i think we should talk about the relationship between tokens and eth ryan ooh okay you want to yeah take us well so uh one interesting thing that happened last week which is not surprising at all to me is that the asset value on ethereum um the asset value of tokens on ethereum that is aggregate aggregate aggregate your c20s actually passed the value of eth right so i've got a graph somewhere i could show but it's something like um something like i don't know 25 25 billion each was was the number at the time something like that and so um what does that mean from your perspective david so now we have erc20 tokens that are worth more than the value of eth so camilla put this out this tweet out by the way camilla's book back there infant machine pick it up read it read it it's great i just finished it history of ethereum um she said that that this disproves or it could disprove the fat critical thesis it's a challenge to the fat protocol thesis because tokens are capturing more value than apps uh what's your take on this yeah and if this just fits in so well to the previous conversation where like i i bet this wouldn't have happened if eip1559 and staking was a thing um however uh i i will continue to be of the opinion that like the more valuations of tokens that are on ethereum and and like i don't even think that the fat protocol thesis means that the native asset of a chain ether actually has to be greater than the aggregate of total tokens on ethereum it just means that like the more value of tokens on ethereum the more ether price is going to be and um the the frustrating thing i think about ether uh you know people like you and me that have ether uh we want the evaluation of d5 to be like one-to-one tracking with evaluation of ether but it just doesn't do that right i think ether is a huge lagging indicator for defy right and so while the current volume or current aggregate market cap of all tokens on ethereum is surpassing the ether price like that narrative just gets flipped the moment ether goes from like 230 dollars to like 300 dollars or more right is that when's that happening david tomorrow so yeah um but it is happening well okay i mean it could right and so like the the larger market cap on ethereum like they're just ether is just proximate to it and at the very least like that prox proximity is going to benefit it to some degree right um i think eip1559 and staking closes that loop and makes that relationship happen faster but i do think that relationship is present no matter what it's just a lagging indicator right now you know another thing so um part part of the concern there's been a concern for a while i think um that well if erc 20 tokens if they exceed the price of eth the aggregate price of eth too much that means they're no longer secure right like the value of eth is not enough to secure the tokens on top but on this i've got to disagree because i don't think that um most people are making the differentiation that we like to make when we talk about settlement guarantees for instance and this is so crucial for people to understand so missouri put out this uh am i sharing my screen david yes you are okay i'm sorry put out this this is um ethereum versus bitcoin daily settlement value okay and ethereum is now higher because it settles more on a daily basis of both eth and erc20 tokens in aggregate so it's settling more than bitcoin but i actually disagree with this okay because what's counted in this number in the ethereum number is all of the the 10 billion or so erc20 bank issued stable coins right okay it's super important to remember that uh bank issued stable coins are not actually settling on ethereum they're not they're settling in the traditional financial system these are ious for money in a bank account somewhere right the ious do settle on ethereum but that's not the final settlement that is not the final settlement layer like it's still the legal system so it doesn't so it's using the security of the legal system now it's using the um the transport layer of d5 and crypto which is super useful but it's not actually being settled on ethereum just the ious are being settled on ethereum this is different like bitcoin is completely settled on the the bitcoin network when there's a transaction on bitcoin ether is completely 100 settled on the ethereum network when there's a transaction on ethereum right so um i think people don't make this distinction what what's really important what's more important is that the the trustless assets like like ether for instance or but like erc20s that aren't um issued by a bank somewhere and settled in in meat space and legal space it's really important that that value those erc20s maintain some ratio with the value of eth or else you could get into a situation where you know you lose the secure the security of ethereum is not enough to keep pace with all of these digital bearer assets does that make sense i just feel like um a lot of people maybe don't understand that subtlety um but i think they should there's there's nuances that go even further than that right like i do agree with you i do want this broken out into in between like native ethereum assets like mkr you know kyber ave all the things that are native to ethereum and then also the non-native assets largely usdc and tether however um there is some these things do settle on ethereum to some degree right like so i think i think if balancer was hacked or uniswap was hacked or somebody got hacked and some somebody stole a bunch of usdc i i think it's pretty reasonable reasonable to think that that hacker made off with that usdc do you think so yeah so yeah here's what i think would happen i think um coinbase would just freeze the account you think so oh yeah dude you know like so you know the twitter hacks last week um they sent out a uh or they had a uh logged into coinbase mobile and they basically said um the bitcoin address that right the twitter hackers used has been uh you can't send anything to it yeah it's going to happen too fast though right so like say say somebody drained some account i don't want to pick on any particular d5 protocol but somebody drains some d5 protocols account of usdc they immediately go to you to swap and sell for either i think that's possible well so but what are they doing that's interesting right that's a good point that's good they're swapping for ether right away because ether is the the cash you can get away with because it's the base settlement layer right you don't want usdc yeah on ether you want dye something with stronger settlement guarantees yeah having closing that turnaround time for hacked protocols with centralized assets uh i mean it's also at some point like the the circle or tether really actually care that much like they don't really lose money like they're made like and like they don't really have too much responsibility it's true it's true yeah it's true that's gonna like that's going to happen and that's gonna be interesting oh i think so like let's say let's say compound was hacked right now and you knew who the hacker was right um and they made off with a whole bunch of usdc and coinbase had time what'd they do bam blacklist account assets frozen right refund to sender they'd almost be as a company it would almost be their fiduciary responsibility to do that if you didn't do that it would get sued in legal space right like that that would be a very interesting court case um if i lost my money and coinbase had the ability to give it back to me but didn't that feels definitely like a lawsuit sure yeah for somebody yeah then then we get into the whole code is law debate like was it a hack or was it an exploit or you know did it actually use the code as intended there's there's a lot of dirty dirty hairiness there i agree i just think that um if you're not settling on ethereum you know fully for instance or on bitcoin fully that there's it's not it's not truly settled right so there's all this room for ambiguity and um yeah we're not like we're not considering that as much when people look at you know uh security anyway absolutely i do think that fat protocol is right personally at least for like money protocols um you know not not necessarily for any protocols i can but i think directionally it was right yeah and um i guess we'll we'll see i don't know what you think about that but i i think the the fat protocol thesis is here to stay until until some erc20 token passes the market cap of ether like that's like a single erc20 token not all of them right like i think the fat protocol thesis is pretty flexible is that going to be ample fourth david no it's not going to be ample for it although that would make me happy actually i wouldn't know but no one right so um maybe maybe lastly just because just to tease kind of meet the nation right so um i have some questions about ample forth um and full disclosure they're a sponsor of the show the reason by the way the reason oh shoot okay the reason we took them on as a sponsor is because um is because essentially we could talk about we could talk about them the way we wanted to talk about that which is as a monetary experiment and i do think it's a fascinating monetary experiment um but it doesn't it doesn't have like the whole rebasing idea kind of um throws me for a loop because the supply can change on a daily basis right yeah but supply is volatile yeah but price is less volatile but if you buy like whatever units x units of ample fourth right let's say you bought your whale you bought one percent of all ample fourth in existence you always own one percent even though the units will actually change on you is that is that right yeah the the units will go up and down but you will always have the same percentage of the market cap that you bought at the time you bought it okay so it's similar almost to like bitcoin's 21 million right so bitcoin has 20 like 21 million when it's fully um diluted and then you know so does ample forth but i don't know that everyone understands that because people are hitting my twitter uh you know dms and such and saying things like um yeah the like this is a coin that just expands um you know it it's it's completely different than bitcoin or ether it's a coin that just sort of expands based on demand of the coin and sort of you know tethers itself to a dollar i don't know that they fully understand the supply dynamics going i'm also skeptical of how much people actually understand uh understand it and like it's one of the things like maybe maybe i'm missing something but i don't think i'm missing anything uh i i think it's a cycle i think what's happening is a very interesting psychological trick based off of how we're not used to having stable price and volatile supply everybody in crypto is used to stable supply and volatile price this is the inverse but the fact that those things are inversed doesn't actually change much like it's still pretty if it still follows the same laws of supply and demand and like and you know there's there's a case to be made where you can just mint it in normal erc20 token have fixed supply and it kind of fulfills the same m0 experiment as ample fourth except it just doesn't have this rebasing mechanism to keep the supply volatile and the price is relatively stable and so it's it's really up to the ample fourth team to like figure out how to extract utility and value out of the rebasing mechanism because you don't get stability and your value from ample fourth because the market cap is just as volatile as any other cryptocurrency it's just that it's it's taken the volatility from the price and put it into the supply but there's still volatility it's still present right yeah so if i own one percent of ample fourth going back to my whale example that could be worth a thousand dollars today and twenty thousand dollars tomorrow and ten dollars the next day yes and the amplifier token will still roughly be around a dollar right because it adjusts daily yeah so i think the way i understand it is the way you understand it so i would be super interested to hear in your meet the nation like more about that and you guys to dive into that like because maybe that's what it is and if that's what it is it's um it's still an interesting money experiment because no one's doing that as an erc20 today yeah absolutely it's all about like how how does the rebasing mechanism actually like how can we leverage that in ways that are useful that you couldn't just leverage with a minted erc20 token like what are the ways that uh users can actually use the rebasing mechanism to their advantage and like i think we i think it's pretty fair to claim that like we know that the market doesn't understand this because i've been watching the rebasing mechanism on uniswap and people when the price rebases and what this means is that new supply is added to everyone's wallets equally right so you can watch the supply in your wallet change right after the rebase every 24 hours and when this happens people rush to uni-swap to buy the cheap coins but that's a total psychological fallacy because they're still buying the same percentage of the market as they were right before the rebase and so like we know the market doesn't understand this because they're falling falling to the to the psychological trick right and so like i don't think ample force is really going to stabilize in its market cap until the market understands this and stops stops succumbing to the psychological trick and and you use the term psychological you know trick right um but it's at some level it goes back to like isn't 21 million and the scarcity meme a psychological trait totally oh totally that's why this is such a fun experiment a psychological trip to boots the trick to bootstrap money basically right so um because money is inherently social right in order to create money you have to have a good meme do you not a hundred percent 100 and this is why i'm happy with ample fourth uh being a sponsor of bank list because the difference between a monetary experiment like ample forth working and not working is how how well can they distribute their token how well can they get awareness because money if money is a meme awareness is everything right under understanding it is is everything right and so you know well like i've personally gotten some flack about like saying that ample forth is legitimate from some people who are hyper skeptical i i'm happy to do what i can to help them do what they need to do to spin out what could be more than experiment an experiment one day well i think a lot of ethereans are uncomfortable with the idea of money as a meme to be honest and they want even the value of ether to be bootstrapped not just because of a meme but because of its raw utility back to our conversation about which is yeah we've been talking about this all episode right like it's great because we're getting the fundamentals however there's always going to be the meme layer there's always going to be the meme layer it can't not be and i i've always thought that the meme layer is where you drive the highest level of security right so if if you are a meme coin um like you have to compete as a meme coin in order to be one of the highest value crypto assets in the world to me the meme coin or the meme side of things it's just another word for monetary premium right exactly and so bitcoin is like almost completely 100 monetary premium because there's not much utility there except for like you know the the proof of work is its utility the uh seizure resistance is the utility but memes are based on fundamentals right so there's a relationship between the fundamentals and the mean well so the me the meme creates the fundamentals right because i would argue no i would say it's the other way around okay well so maybe they're both related right so because so i would argue right now anyway um bitcoin is also useful because it's so liquid right so yes it means itself it means itself into liquidity into reality right totally right and because of that liquidity it's now actually useful because i can use it as a trading pair almost anywhere because i can you know hold it and a reasonable amount of crypto banks or individuals will accept it as real value so like it it's like a cycle where it creates its own value sure yeah yeah you can't have one without the other so maybe it's a chicken and egg thing where the order doesn't really matter but you do need both right you do need both right absolutely and so like the utility of ample fourth is this rebasing stable-ish mechanism uh and it's really up to the ampliforth team to find ways to leverage that because like that's great that that's that utility but they have to derive value from that and that's really the innovation behind and before that needs to happen all right so i create an erc20 david it's got fixed supply and it's money damn it it's right it's base it's base money it's m0 right the bankless dollar um are you in can we mean this thing to money is that is that how it works i guess the question is like if if ample forth is doing this right what's to prevent this is the old question with uh in the bitcoin community with people who are um you questioning the value of bitcoin what's to prevent everyone to do it everyone to create their own money and kind of out-compete it or dilute its its meme because i'm just competing with uh you know the bankless dollar or whatever yeah um i mean we saw that happen that was what 2017 was 2017 was like make your own money and that's why ethereum blew up in 2017 because it was a platform for making your own money right um obviously it didn't work out too much but many things did survive uh i wouldn't say that very many monies survived but i guess litecoin counts i guess it's like two and a half billion dollars so i i guess that kind of counted but that i guess also didn't come from 2017. um i mean it's it's partly one of the reasons why we are so optimistic about the future of defy is because anyone can spin up their own token and ascribe some amount of value to it whether that token turns into global money is a different conversation but like i'm sure if we spun up bankless coin bankless token there's some ways that we could describe value to that that would generate a market cap and then generate some meme layer on top of that as well like there are there are things that we would there's tools at our disposal that we could use the question um as you as you do the meet the nation is um regulatory um so ben hunt says don't come at the state with you're saying your thing is money because the state will dominate you that's the interesting question big that's why satoshi was anonymous right um anyway super interesting discussion david yeah um i think we should wrap it up here absolutely if there's one thing i hope the bankless nation got out of the state of the nation it is this do not buy litecoin [Laughter] just kidding i mean jordan it's going it's going to zero no i mean don't bet against narratives i guess i mean we have no comment about litecoin um but what you should do as far as actions is check out the report by lucas it's absolutely fantastic take a look at token terminal we will include those things in the action list and then also check out state of the nation new episode releases today so it should be available by the time or close the time that that you watch this um david anything else i'm missing on the action items uh nothing from me uh except for stay tuned for the future meet the nations that are coming one will be coming this week awesome all right state of the nation episode six the state of the nation is exponential thanks a lot for joining us
