landmerge although I have pushed that question off for many years as it's been asked to me I can actually give you a day and that is September 15th 2022. it's based upon total difficulty which is based upon how much mining is happening between now and then so depending on what miners do are they selling their Hardware are they revving it up what I've seen recently is like UTC right on the cusp between the 14th and the 15th um and you know moving 30 minutes here and there uh there's a couple different estimators and stuff so it's an art not a science an estimating difficulty things like well are the miners gonna mine through the merge are people going to start dumping their gpus and turn you know we're gonna have like a 10 drop in mining power between now and then I don't know yeah
