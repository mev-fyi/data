[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how you doing today absolutely fantastic feeling a little bit more educated about the state of the dollar and what the world that what this crazy world of the 2020s is going to bring us we had brett johnson on who you guys might know as the formula the the guy that put together the dollar milkshake theory which has been going around especially in crypto twitter uh especially in macro twitter in macro circles about uh it's a mental model for understanding how the dollar is going to behave moving forward and in sort of this new paradigm that we all find ourselves in uh brent did a really good job kind of laying out what he thinks as the future of the relationship between the federal reserve and the people the federal reserve and the dollar the dollar and the rest of the the global politics pretty pretty decently wide ranging conversation focusing on the macro conversation it was it was a good sequel to the lynn alden conversation and so you know getting people that that you know macro is not my core competency so getting people like brent onto the podcast to hear what they have to say i think is really valuable yeah it's interesting he's uh dollar bullish despite money printer going bur and he explains why and i felt like it was very much the same message as we've heard from lynn alden and ray dalia and others but it had this asterisk beside it which is like hey the short run maybe it's bullish for the dollar and he goes into the case why we also talked about we proposed the crypto milkshake theory to him uh and asked his thoughts on um on crypto and he talked a lot about having assets outside of political jurisdiction uh non-sovereign escape routes those sorts of things and uh we got into the case for for why crypto he's i i suppose not bullish on it but um let me let me do that again he's got kind of a mixed review i would say about crypto up to this point so it was good to discuss that with him as well david we also talked about gamestop that is a stock maybe maybe we should give some background on what's happening with gamestop right now because we get into the details i'm not sure that listeners will be as tuned into the details as we have been this week what's the background on the gamestop thing that we get into later yeah it's already turning out to be one of the crazier stories of well i guess we're just into 2021 so yeah 2021 starting off with the crazy story in the world of financial markets for those that have watched the big short uh there was that character uh that had his feet up on the desk that was calculating and drawing up on the whiteboard and he's the guy that predicted the housing crisis and so he shorted the housing market and it took forever for him to become right but then he ended up becoming right and right this is what that movie was uh was uh he wasn't the main character of the movie but he played a central role in the story of the big short this same guy uh looked at the stock price for gamestop this and this happened not too long ago so the same guy that the big short movie was wasn't about him but featured him the same guy in the real world the guy that the actor played looked at the value of gamestop the company by tallying up all of its assets and then it looked at then he looked at the gamestop price uh and then said that well the value of the company is way should be way higher than what the value that the share price indicates right and yeah the share price of gamestop is famously one of the most shorted stocks of all time it's like kind of a blockbuster 2.0 like no one is going to a retail store to buy or borrow a game and so it's it's been heavily shorted and the the branding power the mean power behind this call that this uh very savvy investor made worked its way into uh subreddits like wall street bets and fintwitt and you know some other internet platforms where typically it's a bunch of retail traders and so people retail traders piled on the wall street bets trade by buying spot markets by putting just buying shares of the company even buying calls of the company to get a short squeeze on gamestop and what happened was a bunch of retail uh investors retail speculators caused a short squeeze that ended up bankrupting a large a pretty large fund and and causing other financial harm to other funds that were on the short trade so really it's a story of retail versus fund and i and we fit this uh conversation in with brent about you know what we've been talking about on the fourth tourney or what we've been talking about on the bankless podcast which is the fourth turning which is something that brent has also talked about we go into those details as well that's the background on gamestop i think the listeners will find that part of the conversation be very interesting all right super cool david well before we get into our episode with brent johnson we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors who made this episode possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new

welcome brent johnson of santiago capital who manages money for high net worth individuals who are looking to grow and preserve their wealth brent welcome to the show you are a macro thinker known for your dollar milkshake theory which we're going to talk about and i love on twitter that you are willing to push back against uh maybe maybe austrians bitcoin maximalists and other dollar bears uh brent it's awesome to have you on the show thanks for joining us hey thanks for having me always uh always happy to to talk to new people and i'm looking forward to it this is gonna be a lot of fun so i think you just came from the uh jerome powell meeting you tuned in as a lot of folks do what is powell thinking these days what are jerome's updates for us well you know i think it's pretty interesting because he would listen he was very dovish um he really couldn't have been a lot more dovish other than to say they were going to increase you know qe but you know the markets uh the markets kind of we're having a tough day anyway and they didn't exactly rally on his comments so i i kind of find it uh pretty interesting because i think it kind of plays into a number of different themes that we see in the market right now and some of these things i i don't necessarily agree with um the fact that stocks only go up and that uh you know you know the fed prints dollars and gives them to the banks and the banks go out and lever up and buy stocks and therefore you know just you know short the dollar and buy equities and everything will be fine and you know i i i certainly understand that logic and it's certainly been hard to argue with over the last eight months but i think it's going to be a little bit more difficult than that over the next couple years can we talk about that for a minute because it it seems like uh everybody in finance tunes into what jerome powell says and i don't know if it's always been like that but it's certainly true that what central bankers say these days carry a whole lot of weight maybe more weight than they ever have like is that weird is jerome powell god of finance now is i is this kind of new and is it weird well i don't know that it's new i agree that it's a little bit weird i i think it's very weird that you know normal everyday people who otherwise wouldn't even work in finance actually know who the federal reserve chairman is i think is kind of odd because you know the whole central bankers as god have it's kind of become a meme in unto itself um and that you know the central bankers around the world you know to a certain extent become celebrities and rock stars and you know i i don't necessarily think that's healthy um but you know it is what it is and at the end of the day my job is to you know play the world as it is not as i'd like it to be and you know that fact right there is something that that i think is very important and that i think many people overlook i think especially when it comes to investing i think many people invest for the world they would like to see uh rather than the world as it is and i don't necessarily have a problem with that if you're you know if you're trying to change the world and you're all in on your investments that you think are going to do that then you know i can respect that but if you're just if your goal is just to make money i don't necessarily think that's the right way to go about it the to me the role of the central bank historically has been to be this like silent man behind the curtain right you know maybe tinkering and playing with levers and dials but otherwise being hidden from view and the the attitude is that you know a quiet or silent fed is a good fed right like if they're not in the news cycle they're doing their job um and that that used to be the the perception of the federal federal bank uh and i think that has been decaying over time and has a trajec trajectory of doing going elsewhere from that perception maybe you could give us maybe a a brief history lesson as to like perhaps the trajectory of people's attitudes or perceptions of the federal reserve from what it was in in times past to where it is now to where you think it might be going in the future how do we how is society changing their thinking around what the federal reserve does i mean that's a good question it's it's kind of a very complicated one i i think you're for the most part right i think it used to be that they were kind of the man behind the curtain and you know i would argue that in the last 10 years they are no longer the man behind the curtain they're actually the magician on the stage and they're actually putting on a performance and you know there's a certain group of people who like the performance and are trying to profit from the performance and there's another group of people who are saying you know you just think he's doing magic but what he's actually doing is a trick and this trick is going to come back and and haunt all of us and you know and and so there's there the end there's some friction between those two different for those two different camps and i think the fact that you know central banks have now like i said walked out on stage and you know they've even said that this is the trick that we're going to do and the fact that they're trying to do it i don't think that that's a long-term healthy thing i think i think it's it's a it's a bad thing you know and the other thing i'll say is you know and i've said this before i'm not a fan of central bankers at all um i am in fact very critical of central bankers but based on the design of the monetary system i understand why they're there and to if again if you're playing the world as it is and if you understand why if you understand the design of the monetary system then you understand why they're there why they're necessary and nothing that they do will surprise you because they are their job is to step in now to your point their job is to kind of be the man behind the curtain and kind of be silent but the real role of their job is when there's a problem and when there's a crisis their job is to step in and be the lender of last resort to provide you know whatever means necessary to to perpetuate the system so i try so while i don't agree with what central banks do and and i wish there was a system that didn't require them the system as it is today does require them and so i'm never surprised when they do what they do um for the people who criticize central banks and say well they you i'm not going to buy equities because they're just propping it up um you know through qe or whatever it is and if it wasn't for them you know stocks would be much lower well i get that thinking that's fine if you don't want to play but to think that you know that they're not going to do those moves and you know that they shouldn't do those moves well it's fine to have that opinion but they're going to do those moves that that's why they were pre that's why they were put in that position that's why they were created so i try not to get too critical of the fed of making the moves they make as much as just as much as just kind of criticizing the overall system but i still have to play against the moves that the central bank is making so you can't just ignore it either the lender of last resort i think could be a focal point of a conversation because i think when pete when we talk about you know first the man behind the curtain and then the magician on the stage what we're really talking about is that that last resort threshold is actually a subjective thresh threshold that requires people to believe where the last resort is and it seems to be that there is this marching this creeping higher and higher and higher of where that line is crossed and all of a sudden like what the the things that end up on the balance sheet of the fed are becoming closer and closer to like the spot markets for so many like u.s equities maybe talk about that dynamic and how that has changed over time sure well i think the first thing you need to know and i'm not gonna have time to go through the whole reason for this uh but i would say that again based on the design of the monetary system ongoing crises are a guaranteed feature rather than whether a bug or a feature of the design of the system as this the basic long story short the system the system is one where you have some collateral and then that collateral is used and then that collateral is money and then that collateral is used to loan new money into existence and so for the system to survive it has to grow and in the early days that's fine because it's a very small number but you know like any exponential system if you took a hundred dollars and you increased it by one half of one percent every year initially it would look great and you'd get this nice little growth curve but at some point even if you only grow at one percent a year that curve will eventually go exponential and once it starts to go exponential the amount of growth that's needed just to have it survive becomes an exponential number and that's what we have then the design of the monetary system is an exponential system and so it is designed to grow and if it doesn't grow it crashes now you may think that's a good thing or a bad thing but it just is and it's it's just math and it's not even difficult math um and so i what i would say is when they first started off with the fed you know 100 years ago the problems were relatively low the problem with the system was very relatively low because it was brand new but over time as you get you know it grows and it gets bigger and it gets bigger and it gets bigger and the debts get bigger and gets get bigger and less get bigger and then you start to have these crises and then when you realize the only way to solve the cr the short-term crisis is to make the problem bigger it shouldn't be surprising that the the next crisis is bigger and the frequency which with with which crises start to happen increases as well as you start to go up that exponential curve the problems are bigger and they're more frequent and i think the reason that while you know the central bankers were largely behind the scenes for a long time is because we were on that kind of a relatively flat but steady part of the curve but in the last call it 20 to 30 years you know that curve has started to steepen and in the last 10 years it started to to go up pretty rapidly and then last one year it started to go straight up and so it should not if you again if you understand the design of it the the magnitude and the frequency of the crisis should not be a surprise to you um and the react and the central bank reactions to these should not be surprised to you now i know i'm kind of going off on a kind of a wrong rant here but the reason that we get into this big inflation versus deflation debate and which one are we in is the bigger the debt gets debt is deflationary if more money has to go to service debt and pay off that debt then there's less money that can go for productive measures so the so as the debts get bigger it's setting up for a deflationary shock now to counteract this central banks do everything they can to generate inflation and they have a number of programs and tools of which they can do that and so you will see these periods of inflation expectations rising but so far you know whenever they rise they end up crashing and then they rise and then depression and every time they start to go up you get a number of people saying this is it this is the final time hyperinflation the dollar is going to be you know printed away and it's going to be worth zero but every time that's happened for the last 30 years it ends up rolling over into another big crash um and i think what's happening now is we're getting closer to the end game quote unquote uh so for the people who say you know this is all going to come tumbling down and and you know it's the death of fiat money or it's the death of the central banks and i don't necessarily disagree with that i think it will take a little bit longer to play out than many do i still think they have more tools in their tool chest than many do but i don't necessarily argue with the idea um that we are entering the end game or getting close to that game because you know we've had a number of these little mini debt cycles but now we're getting into this super debt cycle and i think the super debt cycle is kind of coming to an end because all the debts of all the previous bailouts are now on the country's balance sheets and the central bank's balance sheets there's really nobody else to go to unless they come up with some new supranational entity the bad bank type thing where they can offload the debts onto that and i'm not saying that's impossible but my point is i think we're getting towards that end game um i happen to think the end the path to that end game is going to look a little different than a lot of people who also agree that we're heading towards the end game but um we do have a reckoning coming so we do want to talk about kind of the end game and and help our listeners understand the dollar a bit more and uh through through the lens of the dollar milkshake theory which is a theory that you've coined to sort of describe what's happening um before before we do i just want to echo what you were saying about um central bankers like uh i i think people oftentimes are too quick to to demonize the individuals when really what you're saying is that these are just people stuck in the the gears of the existing monetary system right it's almost like their decisions are preordained or inevitable their decisions are a product of the system already so all of the the criticism in you know 2020 we were talking about like money printer money printer go bur the entire year right it was as if the central bankers were forced due to the system uh to to to make that a reality there's political pressures there's economic pressures there's this the the um the cohesion of the system as a as a whole really required that um can we talk about what decisions you think jerome powell and other central bankers are going to be faced with now so this is you know 2021 just got off like you know jerome powell just had a call uh 2020 was the year of money printer go burr our is 2021 going to be the same thing is are powell and and the other central bankers going to be forced to print just more and more money or how does this play out well the short answer is yes um you know the you know there's few memes that i hate more than money printer gober but it's not going away why do you hate it well because i think i think it i think it in many ways i think it's it's not that it's wrong but it's kind of misleading um because and this kind of gets back to you know the magician on the stage is on the one hand jerome powell will go on 60 minutes and say well we printed a lot of money okay now that's the smoke screen that's what he wants you to believe and the reason he wants you to believe that is he wants you to go out and spend money because if you believe him and you go out and spend money and take out that new loan and you know et cetera et cetera et cetera because your doc you're afraid your dollar is going to get devalued well then it can to so if everybody did that because they believed him then you can kind of get a self-perpetuating or self-fulfilling prophecy because that is what you need to get inflation you need people to go spend money you need people to take out new loans you need people to be worried about the devaluation of their dollar but then on the other hand he will come out like he did today and like he does in every other fed meeting and he'll say now let me remind you the fed can't spend money all we can do is lend well now which is it are you printing money or are you lending right and if you if the fed lends money to the banking system and the banking system does not then lend money to main street that money that they've quote unquote printed which again is it's bank reserves it's not actual cash they're not actually they're not actually giving the banks cash it just sits in the banking system and it does not become inflationary um and so you know again i think it's it's it's like it's like the magician and the magician's assistant right there they're they're doing these moves on stage they're telling you that it's going to be inflationary and all you got to do is wait and you're going to have this large inflation but you know at the end of the day they need you to do the trick for them they can't actually cut the lady in half right they need you and your mind to just believe that they're going to cut the lady in half and then put her back together because you as a whole when i say you the public is the one who creates the inflation now one thing i would say is that and so again because all they can do is lend all they can do is make the problem bigger and as the problem gets bigger it becomes more deflationary okay which will end up being a bigger crash and this goes to what we were talking about earlier about how you know it starts off low and it gets bigger and the crises get bigger and you know the central banks have to come out and use more and more tools and do bigger and bigger policies eventually eventually the only tool left to them is to get the laws changed and no longer lend money but start spending money and once that rubicon is crossed that's when the inflation the lasting long-term inflation that leads to hyperinflation happens and that's why all fiat currencies eventually return to their intrinsic value which is zero but it takes a very long time to get there and and and for for that to happen to a currency the public has to lose faith in it completely lose faith in it um and i just don't think that we're there yet and even if we are there and this is the point i've made several times but i feel like it just always falls on deaf ears and nobody really wants to listen to it is that every other country is in the exact same situation that we are in so if we were doing these policies and we had this design of the system which was guaranteed to make the central bankers print and all the other countries had different system or were in better economic shape and didn't have to deal with the same types of problems that we are dealing with and as a result their currencies were quote unquote harder or less prone to inflation then i would completely understand the argument of money printer go burn therefore dollar goes to zero but that's not the case that's not the world that we live in the world that we live in is that all the other countries all the other major central banks are in just as bad a shape as we are and they not only are they going to need to do as much as we are they've been doing it for longer than we have been and not only that but you also have to understand that there's two dollar markets now i'm kind of jumping around a little here but but it's important there's the u.s domestic dollar market and then there's the offshore euro dollar market and just for listeners who are not familiar with this market the euro dollar market is not the same thing as euros that are used in europe so euros are the currency of the realm in europe but euro dollars are just dollars that exist outside the united states and the fact is is that the euro dollar market is so big that it can't even be measured and it's much bigger than the u.s domestic dollar market and entities outside the united states use and need to use dollars just as badly as entities inside the united states now that same dynamic does not exist for other currencies brazilian reals don't have a lot of value outside of brazil japanese yen more so than many currencies have value outside of japan but nowhere near the same size as the dollar so again they're much more valuable inside japan than they are outside of japan nobody needs chinese yuan outside of china nobody needs south african rand outside of south africa but everybody who operates on the world stage even if they don't want them needs dollars again want versus need dollars to operate on the global stage and so everybody has the same supply dynamic problems everybody is going to have to increase the supply quote-unquote of their currency the problem is is no other currency has near the amount of demand that the dollar does so when all these programs get ramped up all over the world the fact that in fact even though we may print more and faster than other central banks and i don't think that we will but even if we do the the demand dynamics of the dollar make it such that we can quote unquote get away with it better than these other currencies and when that happens the dollar will rise versus other fiat currencies now it may fall versus gold it may fall versus bitcoin it may fall versus wheat or corn or some other real estate or some other hard asset that is not getting debased but the problem is is if the dollar rises versus other fiat currencies it puts enormous pressure on the entire monetary system and it leads to huge huge problems i mean the stronger dollar versus other fiat currencies is literally a wrecking ball for the global economy and that's why i say that despite the money printer go bur and despite the insane policies of the federal reserve actors the dollar the end game for the monetary system is not the dollar going lower the in the the dollar going lower perpetuates the system the dollar going lower is what the central bankers want but the end game for the monetary system is when you see the dollar going higher despite the fed's efforts to do otherwise muted ryan nope once more wow okay i was double muted there so brent you made so many good points here um and we want to get into them you know one of the points that i think we want to flag to to touch again is this idea that all of the central banks are in the same position right with respect to fiat and we want to raise the question about what about non-sovereign stores of value uh so this is the question of crypto but before we do let me try to kind of summarize what i think you're saying you're saying that the money printer go bur meme is overly simplistic because when somebody sees that meme and they see see the picture of jerome powell in like memetic forum and he's like turn in the crank and the dollars are the 100 bills are spitting out what they automatically think is oh my god hyperinflation in the u.s is upon us right and um there's so much supply of of dollars in this economy that like prices are going to increase inflation is going to like hyperinflate and it's the end of the dollar and what i think you're saying is that well no uh the end game is actually not that the end game because so much debt worldwide debt is denominated in dollars there's an interim step and they'll be this this sucking of a value and capital into dollars first before that happens but it also does seem to align with um some of the kind of other macro thinkers in this space right so we had lynne alden uh on a couple of podcasts ago we're big readers of ray dalio ray dalio talks about this modern monetary theory three and then uh mmt-3 is what she calls it which is kind of his definition of the end game of the the debt cycle essentially and i think you're saying that you do see an end game of the debt cycle playing out but you just think there's going to be this interim step where the dollar appreciates drastically in value doesn't hyperinflate before we get to that final end game scenario and you know citizens lose all faith in their fiat currency am i understanding you correctly absolutely that that's that's completely correct and the one of the the way i i try to explain it is let's pretend that you know we're there there's there's you know 10 fiat currencies lined up and then you have silver gold bitcoin and a couple other commodities as well now i can understand if if all of the fiat currencies are going to be quote unquote printed where the argument could be made that the gold the silver the copper the bitcoin would rise in value and fiat turns okay so let's let's go buy those for our portfolio just for the sake of argument for this example let's go buy this for a portfolio okay that's done we can no longer talk about gold silver bitcoin or anything else now we are just focused on the 10 fiat currencies okay let's say that they're all falling okay fine but they all one of them will fall slower than all of the others they're not all going to go to zero at the same time it just doesn't work that way because they all trade relative to each other so even if you hate all 10 of them and that's why you already bought the other stuff that we're not going to talk about anymore and now you have to choose out of the 10 which fiat currency do you want the most and which fiat currency do you want the least or should i say which fiat currency do you need the most and which fiat currency do you need the least and you start marking off those boxes the last one you're going to get to is the dollar so you know it's a it's fiat is a relative game you may hate the game you may think the game is stupid you may want to exit the game but if you live in the real world you cannot do so right so it's and and and even if you do let's say you you you you know you have your bitcoin you have your gold you're you're independently wealthy you no longer have to work and you can move away to some mountaintop on montana and you don't have to you don't have to you know deal with the real world so to speak um well that's fine but if you do want to live in the real world or if you do want to profit from the real world that's taking place trading fiat currencies against each other is a great way to make profit or at least it's a great opportunity to make profit now you may not be successful in doing so but the foreign currency market is the biggest market in the world it's the biggest and most liquid market in the world and if you can figure out how those are going to trade relative to each other and if everybody thinks you're wrong and you end up not being the potential for profit is very asymmetric and it's my argument that it's possible i'm wrong it's possible the dollar doesn't fall last i'm pretty sure it will fall last and because everybody disagrees with me the asymmetry of the trades should i be right is is compelling enough that it's worth taking a small percent of your portfolio and allocating to it and so that's that and you know i i didn't come up with this dollar milkshake theory to convince everybody to go buy dollars and i didn't do it to convince everybody to sell gold and sell silver and sell bitcoin and just go hold on to cash that's not the point of this the point of this is to actually make people aware of how the system actually works and what could potentially happen if your money printer go burr and the dollar goes zero mean doesn't quite turn out to be correct and we kind of saw that in spades almost a year ago now in march i mean i always point out to people at the beginning of last year the dollar was around 96 or 97. on march 9th it was at 94. so it had fallen three or four percent and you're talking about the dxy index that's the the dxy index that's right and then 10 days later you know on march 9th it was at 94. on march 19th there was a 102 or 103 and the world was on its knees because the whole world was going through a dollar short squeeze every asset on the planet was getting liquidated because it didn't matter what you wanted what you needed was dollars and it came out of nowhere and it happened all at once and no and gold went down a couple hundred dollars the gold miners got cut in half bitcoin went down 60 or 70 percent bonds even sold off commodities got crushed because it didn't matter what you wanted what mattered was what you needed and that until the entire monetary system is redesigned the potential for that type of very quick and very fast dollar move which just wrecks capital markets is still there now you may think that the central banks have it under control you may think that jerome powell is superman and is never going to let it happen again i would caution you that perhaps the magician isn't going to be able to pull this trick off as easily as they have in the past and as a result i'm willing to bet again if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract wallet as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet wherever visa is accepted it's really a fantastic tool that lets you use ethereum for

shop go to monolith.x to sign up and get your monolith visa card synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out quenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics so brent i kind of i think we can bring this conversation kind of full circle and connect some dots for our listeners i want to talk about why there's so much demand for dollars um and part part of this conversation is the petro dollar the globe runs on the dollars in order to consume petrol the energy of the of the globe but my question lies in the fact that it seems to be and maybe i'm wrong here and you can correct me uh it seems to be that it's in everyone's incentives to have a lower dollar like the the rest of the world wants a lower dollar because they have debts denominated in dollars and so if dollar if a dollar is cheaper that means their debts are cheaper the federal reserve wants a lower dollar to increase spending right um boomers and people who are looking to retire want a lower dollar because that's inflates the price of their assets which they need to retire off of it seems to be everyone wants a lower price dollar and so why are we why are you convinced that the counter forces that uh would create a higher dollar would actually outweigh the forces of seemingly everyone's incentive which is to have a lower dollar well so a couple of reasons number one is that they do want a lower dollar but not a dramatically the lower dollar and and the reason i say that is because if you get well it all depends on how you get there and and the circumstances that took place for it to get there but if you get a lower dollar by definition you get a higher euro and a higher again and a higher real and a higher canadian dollar etc etc etc now a lot of those other countries again are in the same situation we are they do have debts some of them are dollar-based debts so the dollar going lower helps them service that debt better assuming assuming that their economies are steady and growing right um but if the problem is is if their currencies are appreciating because the dollar's falling so their currencies are appreciating and if these countries are exporters well those countries are now their exports have now become more expensive because their currencies have become more expensive and if their currencies are more expensive than the people who would normally buy their goods may go elsewhere and try to buy goods from them and so you know if assuming the demand stays steady and exports stay steady and growth of the economy stays steadier gets bigger and these all the transactions that normally would take place at lower prices still take place at higher currency prices for these export informations then you know that that's the ideal scenario where you get a growth of an economy the dollar's a little bit weaker these other currencies are a little bit stronger and it doesn't hurt their exports now that's a beautiful scenario i don't think that the beautiful scenario is going to be as easy again that's a very beautiful trick if you can if you can pull it off you know you're a magician i don't think that the trick is as easy to pull off as many think i think there's so many deflationary effects out there for these other economies and you know not just the us again we focus on the other economies i don't think a rising currency allows their economies to grow and so i don't think it's as easy as you know let's just get the dollar lower and everything works out fine again because you got to remember the way that they have gotten the dollar lower is that they made the problem bigger and we're going up that exponential curve and the magic trick is very easy when you have a stable you know curve imagine like you're you're you're you're standing on the top of your car and you're just going down the road well you know it's a little dangerous but you know you can do it but now you start going up a mountain and so now you're going up a mountain and you're trying to stand on top of your car and it's it's not quite as easy to do as it was when it was level um and not only that but you're going up this mountain then you get a sharp drop and you go up again it's like now not only are you going straight up but it's a volatile it's volatile and straight up trying to i i it's trying to you off and i just don't think the central bankers are in as much control as everybody else thinks that they are see this and this is the point that i always like to make is that if you are short central bankers or if you if your faith in central bankers are starting to wane then you should be a dollar bull not a dollar bear because the dollar going lower is the central and as in a kind of a steady organized fashion that is the central bank's winning now if you believe that's going to be the case i have no problem with that but don't sit there and think that you're some kind of an anti-central bank you know contrarian and they're going to fail and therefore the dollar is going lower that's not that's them winning that's not then that's not them losing them losing is when the dollar starts to spike despite their best efforts to get it to do otherwise this is so counterintuitive brent and i'm glad you're bringing this as a mental model to you to our attention and i want listeners to hear what you said earlier i'm just going to kind of underline it a little bit really the dollar milkshake theory it's not a prescription for what you should keep in your investment portfolio you're not saying that everyone should just hold dollars right um you're saying that the the theory basically uh describes how the money system works in these types of scenarios and i think we very much saw the dollar milkshake theory at work in uh the first quarter and second quarter of of 2020 right this you could almost hear the slurping sound oh yeah yeah it was definitely playing out with regard to the dollar the all the global capital was flowing into the dollar i mean there's really no question about that anybody who questions that is just you know kind of off their rocker now the flip side is that for the last eight months it's been the opposite and yeah that's what i wanted to ask you and i'm not gonna sit here and pretend otherwise i don't think the problem has been fixed but there's no doubt that the central bankers got it under control for the last eight months so you know my hat's off to them uh again but my point in people always ask me well brent at what price would you change your mind and would you give up on your thesis and my answer is that it's not really so much a matter of price as it is as of why the price went there and what i mean by that is if they're able to get the dollars around 90 right now i mean if they were able to get it to 85 or 80 and they were able to do it in a way that reduced the size of the problem and didn't make it bigger and were able to do it in a way that the world was now less dependent on dollars rather than more dependent on dollars well then maybe i would change my mind but if they are just making the problem bigger as we go up that exponential curve well then there's not necessarily a price at which i'd change my mind the other thing i would say is that you know the the on one hand the milking theory is extremely simple on the other hand it gets a little complex because ultimately what i think is going to happen is we are going to see the dollar the dow rates and gold all rise together now we're not there yet and we weren't there last a year ago either we had the first part which is that the dollar goes up creates a crisis and then once the crisis gets to a certain size what i think will happen is the rest of the world will not only will fly to dollars not just as uh because they need dollars but because they're trying to escape their own domestic crises now the central banks were able to get the the problem under control last year so these local domestic you know non-us but you know domestic to brazil domestic to china domestic to japan domestic to south africa domestic to turkey those because they were able to get the dollar down those domestic international crises were able to get under control but what i think will happen is i think we will have another dollar move higher markets will fall and the next time i'm not sure that the fed will be able to get it under control quite as quickly and when those domestic crisis and those international markets start to take place i think you will see a situation where sovereign bonds meaning treasuries of non-us countries at least beginning i think you will start to see rates rise they may go down initially again on this crisis but once the the central banks have to start coming out and doing more of these qes and it's not just the united states i think interest rates will start to rise on international sovereign bonds for counterparty reasons not because of inflation expectations and as interest rates start to rise and counterparty expectations or as counterparty risks start to rise i think people will leave those economies and they will look around the world and they'll say well where should we go and i think because they already have to have dollars it will be easy to say go to the united states and as that global capital starts to leave these other economies that are now in peril i think by process of elimination again remember when we had those currencies lined up against the wall and we got we already got rid of gold and silver and bitcoin and now we have to choose what out of the next 10 who we're going to choose i think people will choose dollars and once they have dollars i think they will choose u.s assets and i think that will be a case where they start buying u.s u.s stocks again you if you're a brazilian citizen you may very much prefer to buy coca-cola that pays you a four percent dividend than owning a brazilian treasury which is not only the currency losing value but it's paying you a similar or is paying you a similar dividend or a lower dividend dividend so and you're worried about the counterparty risk of it and so i think that capital will leave and come to the united states and i think that will push u.s equity prices higher now i think in the short term we are due for another pullback we're due for another rise in the dollar fall and asset prices that will create this crisis um and then i think eventually we'll get into this second part of the milkshake theory which is you know u.s asset prices rising along with the dollar so i know that's kind of a convoluted explanation but that's that's how i see it no i get we i i think that that that was clearly articulated and i think listeners are able to pick up the essence of of what you're saying about sort of the dollar strength and the bull case for the dollar i want to maybe pick off what you're saying there because uh you're saying hey in you know 2020 it looks like central bankers were able to get this under control and it seems like they were although might argue that the one of the casualties of getting things under control was the absolutely insane stock market rise like we could talk about wealth inequality we could talk about um you know billionaires adding trillions of dollars to their bottom line well mainstream in the us like didn't get very much but but let's let's focus in on this this narrative that seems persistent right now which is here's the narrative this was the casualty of the central banker move to kind of stabilize things stocks only go up that's what people believe right now brent and like even even just this week as we're recording it we had this insane story about about game stock uh stock doing like a 5x uh and i know david was tracking that a little bit but like can we talk about this this narrative of stocks only go up was that a casualty of the central banker move well to a certain extent yeah i mean i i think you know gamestop is is really fascinating to me on on many different levels because i mean there's a lot to impact here because it literally sits kind of at the intersection of you know the pandemic and lockdowns and the bailouts and the subsidized checks you know the unemployment relief however you want to describe that the ppp programs um and then the money printer go member and it also sits at the intersection of you know the dissatisfaction of the blue collar or the lower however you want to describe the um the lower workers in society versus the elites you know the elites think that they have uh you know kind of a right or or an entitlement um to to make money um at the expense of others and the the little guys like has gotten to a point where they're not putting up with it anymore and they're ready to grab the torches and the pitchforks and push back a little bit and so gamestop is a way that you have all these people who you know are sitting at home because they can't go to work they've gotten unemployment checks you know they used to you know play video games or you know make sports bets or um you know whatever it was and but now they've gotten money um in their home and they got nothing better to do so you know they hear the money printer go member well let's go play the stock market you know the the billionaires and the millionaires are getting rich why shouldn't we get rich too and i think initially a lot of the um again professionals for lack of a but the professionals that they kind of thought it was kind of a funny or silly little phenomenon with the robin hood accounts and stuff and the wall street vets accounts but you know some of these guys who work out of their basements just because you're working out of your basement doesn't mean you're stupid you know just because you didn't go to harvard doesn't mean you're not smart you know and a couple of these guys figured something out that the rest of wall street didn't and you know i i give them a lot of credit because they figured it out they figured out a way to pool their resources and they did it they you know they upended a wall street darling and you know so far they're winning now i would caution these people to take a little profit you know don't give it all back but it doesn't change the fact that you know these were very smooth it wasn't just a fluke i mean i think i think it was a well thought out attack and and and when i say attack i don't mean that in a negative sense you know i maybe i should say a well thought out plan and i think that they have so far executed it beautifully now whether whether that lasts or not you know i i again i would say that in general whether you like this or not the system is kind of set up to help the rich at the expense of the poor now i know even some of my friends will disagree with me on that and that's fine but i think that that kind of gets back to the whole you know central banker inequality narrative i really do think the system is set up that way and i would say that while you know the the millionaire billionaire class may have been slightly wounded by this episode they're not yet dead and you know don't be surprised if you find out in the next few days that these people all these people that have bought in gamestop are no longer able to sell either because they just say no more sales or their trade no trading on that security or whatever again i don't know what it will be but i don't think we've heard the end of this story and i don't think it's a guaranteed victory at this point they've definitely scored some points and again i give them credit and i don't take anything away from them um i just don't think the story's over yet yeah i i think gamestop could be a starting pistol or a catalyst for i think it already is at least for the at the very least conversation but also for something perhaps much bigger than that uh to me the gamestop story is distilled down by um internet native people who uh who go on reddit specifically the wall street bets uh subreddit but then it's bleeded bled out into other domains of people that kind of just live on the internet and scrounge the internet for information and everyone kind of uh figured out that if everyone else who is also of the nature of people that would peruse reddit for information financial information they everyone kind of realized there's this story of this potential short squeeze got proliferated around the internet and these are all the people that are you know just the average joe schmoe who got there that got their um their stimulus check uh and it was kind of this it's to me it's the story of coordination a bunch of random people on the internet figured out that if they all bought the stock they could short squeeze these massive funds and as a result of of what exactly that's exactly what happened uh a bunch of people just like put it put in you know 500 a thousand dollars into into into robin hood on just to buy either at spot marker at the spot market or on option calls and they all they all short squeezed a bunch of these funds that ended up uh some of them ended up going bankrupt because when you short something there's no there's no uh limit to how much risk you have that's the nature of the short and the conversations that have come out of this are about like i i saw a funny tweet the other day saying like it was it was a satire on this whole episode saying like oh no the wrong people have manipulated the markets yeah right no exactly and the the tables have turned and now all of a sudden these funds are asking for like do-overs they're asking for like for the the nyse to shut down or to put like you said to limit limit sales and this to me has been an extension of the politic politic oh boy the politicization of the markets where the markets are now political tools and people that have influence can control the markets where and and what we're seeing with uh this uh the the money printer go burme and the the stonks on only go up meme is that there's a lot of political clout available to people close to uh tapped into the the federal reserve and what they're doing who are close to the money printer yet yet there are these other people who i would say are the the furthest away from the money printer which are the people that are just receiving the stimulus checks because the stimulus checks to me is it's the furthest away because the closest is the asset prices asset price inflation and i think there's this dynamic this growing discrepancy between the little guy and the big guy that i think is uh using the markets to frame this conversation as there is a changing of the guard there is a changing of what makes these markets tick and and brent i know that that you are a fan of the fourth turning book which is uh something or fourth turning theory which is something we've talked about a number of times on the bankless program i'm hoping how to get out of you how do you fit what the the story of stimulus checks the story of the money printer gopro the story of gamestop how do these all fit into the fourth turning neil strauss generational theory yeah so i mean it's a couple things here first thing to the listeners if you if you haven't heard of the book the fourth turning i can't recommend it enough uh there's probably no other single book that has affected my outlook on the markets as much as that one um i mean i think neil howe i just think he's a genius because he wrote this you know 20 25 years ago now and you know it's almost like a playbook for what has happened over the last 10 or 20 years um you know to touch back on something that you just said uh well first of all i do think we're in the fourth turning the fourth turning is basically there's you know those four cycles to uh to an empire or to a you know to a a century of um for a country's development you know you got the the spring where everything's brand new and you've kind of come out of a crisis and you know then you get into the summer and things are really nice and you go into the fall things start to get a little colder and then you have the disaster which is which is winter right and that's the fourth tourney and so you know in the fourth turning all the institutions that have built been built up in the previous three uh turnings you know start to get torn at their fabric and so a lot of them come down and you get the rise of new new thoughts and new ways of doing things and so i think we are still you know in that fourth journey um i think you know you the the fact that the quote-unquote underclass is is starting to rise up is a is a hallmark of that of that stage um you know the interesting thing about what you were just saying is actually a part of my thought on the whole quote-unquote milkshake theory and let me see if i can set this up the right way because one of the biggest arguments against my theory is that the fed will not only go money printer gober on the domestic assets and the domestic needs but they will print whatever amount of money is needed for the rest of the world as well for the euro dollar market the fed will bail out the euro dollar market now i'm not saying that they won't do that but i will absolutely say i don't think it will be as easy for them to do as everybody else thinks everybody else thinks it's just boop control p control p and you just give them the money and it's no big deal and i don't think that's the case i think that there will be domestic pushback about that um you know to your point you know this is the this whole gamestop thing is maybe it's a small thing on the overall problem but i think it's indicative of you know the u.s populace starting to get fed up with the you know too big to fail bail out the rich and i think that they are pushing back you saw a lot of this over the summer you know with the black lives matter and the you know the other you know the other movements you know people aren't necessarily just sitting back and taking it so to speak anymore and you know on the one hand you could say well biden's in charge now and you don't have the trump who's the antagonist anymore well you know you know the the antifa crowd which would which caused a lot of problems over the last year we're doing it subsequent to you know biden's election so i don't think these problems went away and let's say that in the next two let's just say that for whatever reason the next two weeks let's pretend that gamestop goes back to 30 bucks and all of these millions that all of these very smart and very resourceful you know wall street bets you know native internet you know population let's say they lose a bunch of money and let's say they don't get bailed out well have you ever seen what a bunch of unhappy you know young teenage you know early 20s males unemployed people do that's not a that's not a formula for cohesion or for you know you know unity that's you know that's that's tender for pushing back against the man or the system and so i don't think that society is just going to sit by and let us bail out you know bangladesh when bakersfield has an unemployment problem i don't think that we're going to be able to bail out you know airbus which is a french company when millions of people or when thousands of people at boeing have gotten laid off i just don't think it's going to be as easy to do as everybody else thinks and so you know i yes we you know to the point at the very beginning that the central banker's job is to step in when it absolutely has to be done but that doesn't mean that they step in before pain is felt and i think a lot of pain will be felt around the world before we step in and bail them out and if we do bail them out it will be on our terms not their terms and this gets into another part of the fourth turning and i i wasn't sure we were going to talk about this or not but i i think it's important to do so um because this is this is another i think part of my theory that many people either get wrong or mistake i've had a lot of people call me jingoistic or an american exceptionalist saying that you know my dollar milkshake here is nothing more than somebody who thinks america is the greatest place in the world and is entitled to for the sun never set on our kingdom so to speak it's actually the complete opposite of that i think that the us has committed many many sins and i think that we are going to have to pay for them dearly someday um but you know any great empire which i would argue that the u.s is an empire but you know no empire just rolls over and just hands away their power they will fight tooth and nail and be the meanest sons of you've ever seen before they give up that power and i'm saying maybe that's a crude way of expressing it but you know globe the global reserve currency is something that the dollar you know the dollars have the world reserve currency for the last call it 80 years world reserve currencies are never handed over willingly they're always taken from the new guy on the block who takes it away and you may not like that but that's just kind of the way it is and there's all these arguments well you know the global reserve currency it's actually a burden for the united states it used to be a benefit but now it's an economic burden well global reserve currencies are not about economics global reserve currencies are about power and political power and geopolitical power and nobody ever there's nothing more intoxicating there's nothing more addictive than power power is never ever within possible exception of george washington nobody ever gives away power it's always taken away and the idea that the us you know is just going to give away their power and not employ every last tool which includes the us military before it gets taken away from us i think is just it's very naive now i personally don't like this i don't personally like our foreign policy i don't personally like that we have used our military to reinforce the dollar's you know role as the global reserve currency but hey that's a fact of life they do do it all you got to do is look you know just in my lifetime i can think of three or four different instances where some you know international entity or country or leader you know in some way or another try to exit the dollar system and start a different parallel system and those leaders just don't exist anymore now that's perhaps a little bit crude and perhaps a little bit you know unwanted and you know unsavory but it's the truth and and i i think that has to go into your thinking a little bit when you're trying to figure out which currency survives and which currency doesn't so i think you know and this is all part of the fourth journey right this is you know it's the fourth turning on a goal it's not just the united states going through the fourth attorney this is on a global level you know there's some countries that are in a few different maybe in the perhaps a little bit different stage maybe not everybody's in the fourth attorney but this is kind of a global phenomenon and um i just think that i i just think that the next you know call it five years are going to be much different um than many of the other people who also see this fourth journey so can we talk about that for a minute he said so many interesting things there brent like one one of which is you think it's more likely for us to get you know for us citizens see a 2 000 checks each month in ubi than for it to be be politically tenable to to bail out um euro dollars for instance which is which is somewhat interesting because i feel like through this through even the gamestop thing we're seeing so much behind the scenes of how the game actually operates and there's this idea that the the fed is some apolitical um like central bank algorithm essentially but like what you're saying is no it's actually very political right so they're going to decide to issue checks and print money for american citizens before they decide to print money to bail out other countries and and euro dollars for instance right so there's this like political machine the gamestop thing showed us that all of these these banker games that were that are being played they can actually be played by by you know online communities and that sort of thing so i i i think you're saying that and you're also saying that this fourth turning is going to make a very uh tumultuous decade for us we want to get to crypto with some of the time remaining but but before we do just general thoughts how the hell do we prepare for the next five to ten years like like portfolios you know maybe just general life advice uh it sounds like things could get dicey yeah um in short yeah and you know the funny thing is is that and perhaps perhaps this is a little naive on my part and so i'll fully admit that is i actually think i'll be able to navigate but navigate the financial part of the next five years okay i think i've kind of got a good plan for how to deal with that whether i'm right or i'm wrong um again i think i think i have a plan for for for me being right and i have a plan for me being wrong so i think the financial part will be okay um the part that scares me or the part that i'm most concerned about if that's the right way to say it is the social aspect of this uh because you know we're just not on a good track and we're not on a good track in the united states and we're not on a good track uh you know anywhere else in the world either and so i i do think that you know this uh the social aspects are going to be very very hard to to to plan for just because they they can kind of come out of nowhere i mean i think if people are thinking about that this kind of thing it's going to help but for the people who don't think about this um you know it can be rather shocking um you know i do think that it makes sense to prepare and to the extent you can create your own sovereign escape route for lack of a better word right um gold can be part of that bitcoin can be part of that you know some real assets maybe that maybe some kind of an account or assets outside of your political jurisdiction um now i'm not saying that everybody should you know band together and leave the united states i'm just saying that it wouldn't be a bad idea to have an idea of where you might want to go if you ever decided to do that the flip side is that there's other people in other countries who feel the same way and despite all the problems that we have which they are many i think if if you went to a thousand different people around the world you know equally distributed around the world and said you know what your life is starting over tomorrow here's a million dollars the trick is you have to get on a plane and go live somewhere else and it can't be in your country where do you go i think the vast majority of people would choose to come to the united states so now it may that may not be ultimately the best place to do it but i do still think that that would gain that the united states would win that quote-unquote um contest um so you know i'm not saying that the part of your plan should necessarily be the least ever leave everything in the united states and get out but i am saying that you need to start thinking about that kind of stuff or or perhaps you need to move to a different state or perhaps a different city again it all depends on what your personal situation is but regardless of which country you live in all of the again all of these countries are in the same problem you know they built up these massive debts which can never ever be paid off and so they are going to have to devalue their currency in some way or another to help pay these off now i don't think leaving the united states for mexico is going to solve that problem for you i don't think leaving the united states for europe is going to solve that problem for you so i think you do need to have some kind of stores of value um you know in your portfolio and i think land i think gold i put you know i we should probably talk about crypto because i think people have mistaken my views on crypto quite a bit i'm actually a fan of crypto i'm a fan of bitcoin in a conceptual sense i do see and i own some i i think if you can afford to own some you should own some i do not think that people should sell everything they have put it all on bitcoin because it's the greatest asset ever invented and there's only one way it can go uh i think that's extremely extremely naive so so let's let's talk about that brent right so you you mentioned so many things there and this is like kind of the i guess almost like the um the summit of our entire conversation here is because we're on the same page with you with you know fourth turning and this kind of narrative issue and central bank um yeah money printing all of these things and all of this leads us to a conclusion that crypto is going to do quite well over the next 10 years in fact i might say brent may i present to you the crypto milkshake theory which is which is basically the idea that this lack of faith in institutions that you're seeing this generational distrust of the old financial regimes this um desire to break outside of the banking system that has essentially gamed and rigged uh our entire economy right like newer oh younger generations are are feeling this pressure right and all of this is is culminating uh towards something like crypto being the answer store your wealth outside of the political your political jurisdiction have a escape route from your sovereign invest in bitcoin invest in ethereum use decentralized finance banking tools rather than the fidelity account they can just lock you out of when gamestop you know breaks out of it breaks out breaks out of the price range that that that's not according to plan right this is digital this is programmable this is internet native this is meme based it's community based it's all of these things tell us your thoughts on crypto and don't be afraid brent to bust our bubble right because we're we're mega bulls we're ultra bullish on this asset class and i know you like it but you also have some reservations so tell us the good and the bad here well i mean i i'll start off by saying that you know i have been a big believer in you know kind of becoming your own sovereign and becoming you know you know getting some assets quote unquote outside the system for a very long time and and that historically has been gold for me and i still think that gold is the ultimate asset i know that many people in the crypto world believe that crypto is the superior asset i do not currently believe that kryptos is the is the superior asset but i could be proven wrong i i don't really feel strongly enough about it one way or the other to but i i if i had to choose between crypto and gold i would choose gold but the great thing for everybody is that you don't have to choose between the two you don't have to put all your money into crypto you don't have to put all your money into gold you can actually own both and have a very good successful happy life so if any of your friends are telling you you have to choose you can tell them to go to hell because you don't have to choose you can have them both okay so now let's talk about crypto so i first read you may have heard me say this before i first read the bitcoin white paper in january of 2010 and if i remember right the price at that time was around 25 or 30 cents um i had a two-year-old son i had just changed jobs and he was just getting ready to start to go to this private school which was very expensive he was two or three and um you know at the time i say that because at the time i said you know what i should just put five thousand dollars in this and forget about it um you know this this conversation would be much different today had i done that um i didn't uh but what i brought but the day i read that the reason that i read it was because somebody sent it to me because at the time and still you know i was a big believer in gold and i thought everybody should own gold in their portfolio and so somebody sent it to me and they said hey you may like this you know it has a lot of the same aspects of gold but it's kind of it's kind of a newer way to store wealth so i read it and you know i'm not a technologist i'm not a technology guy a lot of times when i hear about technology a lot of it does go over my head initially i really have to kind of think about it and um but i remember sitting back in my chair and thinking if the technology works the way this white paper says it works in a million years it will never be legal because it's the most powerful thing i've ever heard of so let's break that down a little bit now that does you know in hindsight i should have just bought some anyway right but but i didn't do that but i've been following it since then and i you know i owned a little bit of bitcoin i ended up buying more between you know i think between 500 and you know more at 700 and more at a thousand and then i didn't even look at it for years and years um i've sold some of it recently i should probably tell you that um but what i would like to caution people about is it's not that i don't like bitcoin and it's not that i don't think that it's not a worthy cause for you to pour your time and your resources and your energy into a system which promotes freedom and self-reliance [Music] okay i get it i understand all the positive aspects of bitcoin one thing i would just point out is that you know it was originally not just going to be a store of value it was going to be a way a payment system to could potentially be used as money that has not happened it has largely been quote unquote seen as a store of value because recently the price has gone up but if you ask somebody in 2019 who had bought it in 2017 whether it was a store value you would have gotten a much different answer because they bought it at 20 000 and it went to four right so you know the history of bitcoin is ones of many booms and minibus and depending on which dates you pick as your time frame it has either been a spectacular success or spectacular failure now as of right now it's looking pretty good now it's down about 20 25 from where it was a month or two or three weeks ago but it's still very high and i'm not saying that it can't go much higher but what i will tell you is that to think the the idea that this is the greatest asset ever invented that governments are absolutely powerless against anything um or or they're powerless against trying to prohibit its use and its rise is just completely completely wrong there are many many ways that governments around the world can curb bitcoin's use now i don't care if you believe me on that or not i'm just telling you that it's a bigger risk than many people think and to automatically dismiss it now if you say if you say hey it is a risk but we think we can win because of this and this and this fine but when you automatically dismiss it because you just think it's better or because you think that you have more power than the world's greatest military you know i just think you're you're you're not giving that risk a proper assessment um you know governments the one of the biggest tools that governments have is their currency and they are not just going to let something else take it over now my point is there will be a battle bitcoin may win that battle but it may not and my point is is it's you know when i talk to people about it they talk about it as if bitcoins goliath and the us government is david and i just think that's a wrong analogy now it doesn't mean that i think it's the other way around i think bitcoin's david and the us is goliath now it doesn't mean that david can't win david can win but it's not easy and then the idea that well the us outlaws it and then it just you know you know cameroon adopts it now cameroon becomes the next global power because they have bitcoin as their as their currency again i just that's not the way geopolitics works so brad this is uh this is all good feed so good feedback i think you'll actually find that that david and i probably agree with with aspects of what you're saying maybe maybe more than uh on other podcasts that that that you've been on in particular this criticism of hey i remember if you're around in 2010 you certainly remember the the the headline of bitcoin white paper peer-to-peer electronic cash right and you're saying it's certainly not serving as that um i'm not sure how closely you've been tracking the ethereum and decentralized finance ecosystem but part of the the bankless program is it's like it's like bitcoin but also tracking some of the things that are going on in ethereum the decentralized finance landscape and that is starting to become closer to the peer-to-peer electronic cash the bankless value transmission system and i'm not sure if you've been tracking that so much but i would actually say that there could be an alternative path call it a third path right like you you were talking about this collision course with governments um it's funny we had ben hunt on on the program he said the exact same thing he was like you you know governments will just relegate you to a corner like you can't take on reserve currency status they want money it gives them power you're not going to do that crypto so like stop trying um but there is one other way that i'd be like i wonder your thoughts on which is that things like ethereum public blockchains become so damn useful to governments themselves that the governments actually propagate their use right so if you look at stable coins right now on ethereum for instance there's about 30 billion in stable coins on ethereum that that's tiny right compared to the euro dollars but realize that number was like minuscule uh at at the start of 2020 and just grew to 30 billion stable coins on public blockchains could be an export of u.s monetary power it could be something that the us government wants it could be a a settlement network for all sorts of countries if what we're building here brent is an internet of finance right you know all of the countries will want to adopt the internet of finance because it gives them an advantage just like we adopted the internet of communication so another path towards getting to uh adoption of crypto could be it just becomes so darn useful that countries you know have to adopt it in order to to have the next silicon valley you know with within their jurisdictions have you given any thought to that or what do you have any takes on stable points yeah so i think what you said is is very valid and i think you know in the same way that i was saying for you guys for you and when i say you i don't necessarily mean you personally i just mean the the crypto community in the same way that i said you know to just summarily dismiss the us government government's ability to you know do harm to bitcoin would be naive i think for me to ignore everything that you just said would be would be naive as well i think the blockchain technology is the genie that's out of the ball it's not going back in and i think it's incredibly powerful and i do think that blockchain technology um digital coins digital assets are kind of here to say i do think that you know central banks around the world are going to issue their own stable coins their own currency coins whatever you want to call them um and so you know i kind of like i kind of like my one of my biggest current problems with with the with the bitcoin world or crypto world however you want to describe it is is tether and this is not a new i mean i know everybody's you know sick of hearing about tether but you know to me tether is just i i it's just such an anomaly to me because you know the the the crypto community is supposed to be one about verification you know absolute uh custody custody verification um you know tracking of transactions you know very transparent not opaque uh but then you have you have tether which is in my opinion has kind of permeated the entire industry and they are a central or central issuer of a fiat currency with no verification of any custody and no verification of any actual assets and so to me it's just it and and whenever this is brought up rather than saying you know you're right i don't know why anybody does business with them the answer is oh you're just paranoid you know get over it everybody already knows about it well so brent our answer is you're right nobody should like it's completely it's completely opaque it's completely like there's no transparency whatsoever no one knows whether tether is fully backed or not and that's a huge problem yeah but but the other thing i'd say is let's say that the let's say 12 months from now there's a fed coin which i guess would be a us dollar stable coin for lack of a better word right now why would you choose a tether stable coin or some other stable coin rather than the u.s fed coin and what makes you think that the fed and the us government is going to allow another stable coin to compete with their stable coin so we actually the way i view usdc which is a much more regulated much more transparent fiat cryptocurrency crypto token that's issued by a company inside the united states that's that's fed coin um you know it's fed coin by proxy it's not actually issued by the fed um and we had jeremy alaire on the podcast not too long ago um and he kind of we talked about just like you know let's go back to core fundamental american values where we'll figure out how to export the brand of the dollar via the private markets via private innovation rather than federal top-down control like you know we we've kind of throughout different parts of this conversation we've kind of been harping on the fed's lack of ability or control um i think they could if they want fedcoin they should just put their weight behind usdc i mean they could i mean maybe that's their plan maybe their their maybe their plan is to just have a group that's studying this and then they will either quote unquote co-opt a an existing stable point or issue their own but my point is is that if they choose the other they if they choose to create their own rather than to collaborate they're not going to let another currency compete with theirs i mean they're just not they're they're not monetary compliance they're not open to monetary competition they're they're monopolists so i just think i just think that that's a risk that you can't ignore the it has to be it has to be addressed and understood um but you know and again i think ultimately you know again my biggest current problem with bitcoin is the tether uh the tether influence i do think that tether has an outsized influence on the price of bitcoin at least right now i think if something were disclosed uh in an unfortunate or an unsavory manner at tether i think the price of bitcoin would suffer and perhaps dramatically so that doesn't mean that it would die it doesn't mean that it couldn't come back it doesn't mean that it couldn't actually go much higher than it is today and so i'm not telling everybody to go out and sell everything they own and forget about bitcoin uh by any means and certainly don't forget about you know decentralized finance and you know you know all these other potential benefits of it i'm just saying size your risk appropriately understand that there's serious risks out there um but you know bitcoin is a legitimate in my opinion it's a legitimate tool to help you quote unquote build assets outside the system now i don't know that i would necessarily unless you're like an industry player who's actively promoting it if you own a bunch of bitcoin i don't know if i would be on twitter telling everybody because if you're going to be outside the system you don't want anybody to know about it it's like a pirate standing over his treasure chest and saying here's all my goals you know you know just i i i i'm sure there are many who do it's just the loud ones that get that get noticed yeah right this has been a an absolute pleasure thank you so much for for letting us kind of understand your your mental model for central banks the dollar the fourth turning just everything we went through i i want to ask this last question to kind of close out i know you're involved very much with kind of wealth preservation for high net worth individuals i want to ask you a different question we have a lot of young listeners who are kind of earlier in their in their investing career and attracted to things like crypto what's your best advice for someone who's young who's trying to grow their wealth during this decade what would you tell them to do well i think the simple answer is you know spend less than you make you know do whatever you have to do early save some money early um you know there's a famous line by um who is it no it's not warren buffett it's i think it's his sidekick he said do whatever you can to get your hands on a hundred thousand dollars and then after that you can kind of ease up a little bit um and i think that's a very very good advice now whether that number is a hundred thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars not you know a hundred thousand for for some people hundred thousand dollars is an incredible amount of money um so if the number for you is ten thousand you know make it ten thousand but you i think the most important thing is to live within your means number one number two build up a a little bit of a a side you know fund or a nest egg whatever you want to call it not so that you know you can invest it and become warren buffett but that if if in case you know you lose your job or you lose your you know your your income for a certain amount of time or some some kind of crisis happens you know you have you you don't have to lose everything in order to to get through that time period and then the third thing i'd say is don't invest in something just because your friends are investing them in uh you know don't invest in something unless you understand it or unless unless you can afford to take a little bit higher risk on something that maybe you don't understand and you you know but but if you're if you're just starting off and you're building the base of your portfolio um you know you know start off with the less risky stuff um if you want to start a business or something you know bet on yourself uh but think for yourself um only invest in what you want and this again this is initially you know think for yourself invest in what you understand and once you've kind of got some more assets build up then you can start taking more risks that's great brent it has been an absolute pleasure
