new internet friends randy thank you so much for joining me here today i am so grateful to have you on the show carly it's such a pleasure and i've been a long time listener i love it's such a great show so i'm delighted to to actually be here i feel like i've like made it in web 3 to come wow i appreciate that uh it's it's having you on makes me feel like i've made it so it's it's mutual for sure so i listed some of what you've done in your career you have worked in and succeeded in just so many different industries web 2 certainly tech media business theater writing now you're in web 3. as a way to maybe dive into your story a little bit i'd love to get your tips or your perspective on how to manage such a dynamic career in which you've you've you know spanned so many industries what do you tell people who want to emulate that oh my gosh well first of all i believe that a career can have so many chapters so if you're like me i think i'm on the 15th chapter of my career but if you if you feel like you're on a second a third chapter um and sometimes the chapters don't even make a lot of sense on their own like for me my first and i know we'll get into to this more of the first chapter of my career was around being on the front lines of social media then i had a chapter where i went and performed on broadway and produced broadway shows and you would think those two things have nothing to do with one another but then fast forward to this kind of third chapter i'm in of web 3. web 3 is all about the intersection of the arts and technology and understanding how to value an artistic deal and also a business deal so um i what what i love most about it is that i bought my first nft about six months ago and now here i am today as a founder in the space so never too late or too early to uh have new career adventures and has it been for you like a matter of following your gut or like what has been the guiding principle as you've you know picked different industries to enter i think the the biggest thing is just always having a strong why for why you're doing anything because so much of the world is about hype and it's about fomo and uh if you're getting into a space that's really noisy because of fomo or because everyone else is doing it it's probably not going to end well because no matter what you do you're always going to be outsmarted outworked out out hustled out accessed by someone else but if you get into a space and you have a really clear why and for me i've always had two why's running throughout my entire career which is supporting the arts and allowing creators to go direct to their audience that's been a theme in everything that i've done for the last 20 years and also of making sure that women have access to new financial vehicles and so for me getting into web 3 it was very very clear why i was doing that and what lane i needed to stay in and i highly recommend that for anyone who's thinking about exploring dipping a toe in or having a new career in a very noisy hyped space okay so you joined facebook in like 2004 i think the year it was founded right your mark founded it so you were at the inception of this company that is truly one of the most influential institutions in the world and that has ever existed i'm curious and you were there for like 10 years you were there for for a long time so you saw it through all of its growth was there an aha moment for you at facebook was there a moment that you can remember where you were like oh this is going to be huge and then i'm curious if you what parallels you're seeing now to web3 or if you've had similar moments now that you've been in web 3. yeah it's so it's interesting to say that and um it's funny i'm just i'm chuckling a bit to myself because i i was working at an advertising agency in new york city at the time and and i i loved my job and i loved what i was doing so when i went out to kind of hang out with the the early facebook team i thought i was going out for a weekend to just give some advice and then i ended up staying for 10 years so just i'm i'm just laughing about how things work out in life but one of the things that i realized really early was my biggest aha moment at facebook that i think applies so well to web3 is that the moment i knew we were on to something was when i realized that we had a product community fit and so many people talk about having a product market fit but i really think it's about having a product community fit and what i mean by that is that i we had these like facebook laptop bags and whenever i would go through an airport people would run up to me in early days and be like my college has facebook and i love it and and stuff like that and um like i felt so proud to be walking and like wearing facebook merch and people would come find me and um and i that was the moment that i realized i was like okay having a product community fit is such a key metric for any business and now fast forward to web 3 and it's all about the community i mean that how how good you are at building community is more important than even the idea you have or the art that you have a lot of the time and so uh that was really my big aha moment on just how important that is while you were there you were the founder creator impetus behind facebook live this ties into i think your your comment about always wanting to empower artists in everything you do this story is awesome can you tell the story of how facebook live came to be yes oh my gosh thank you for asking and yeah i mean i guess uh i've always had kind of an entrepreneur brain and an artist heart um my dream was to perform on broadway and so you even though you put me in a tech world you couldn't really take the artist's heart away and so i was always thinking you know how cool would it be if we could give people on facebook the opportunity to be their own television studio or their own radio network so during one of these all-night hackathons that we would do every few months i i took over this little closet as a studio and i started live streaming uh what was going on in the hackathon like interviewing different engineers and things and two people watched my mom and dad it was like a huge failure i don't know what i thought it was going to be like the next oprah and literally it was like my mom and she told me it was boring and she was silent and this is like on your own personal facebook page yes this was on my own perspective you just said you started kind of streaming a video out totally and in 2000 in 2010 you could not just go live from a phone there was not the streaming bandwidth to do that so um i actually had a friend who was wearing a backpack like this giant backpack that had like all the technology that enabled us to go live like the poor guy all night wearing this huge huge equipment um and i i didn't even stay awake the whole night to present my idea at the end of the hackathon because i was so humiliated that only two people watched that i was like okay i guess this facebook live idea that i have is dead um but a few weeks later i got a call from my friend who was katy perry's manager and he's like i saw this new tv show that you were pioneering on your facebook page and katie wants to be the first to use your tv show to announce her new world tour and uh i almost apologized honestly i'm so sorry this is not a real tv show and then i was like wait a minute like what would the guys do like the guys wouldn't apologize for having a good idea they would just find a way to make it work and that was a big moment in my career and that that mind shift and i was like you know what yes katy perry should definitely launch on facebook live and uh that was the first ever facebook live broadcast was katy perry um selling out her world tour in minutes uh live on her facebook page that's so incredible i mean so and honestly a testament to katy perry and her team for them also seeing the opportunity as early as they did so it was like your friends when he was friends with you on facebook so saw the live stream you had did and like recognize the potential for what it was that's i i i think that's uh very cool i also i've heard you talk about back when you're at facebook i think you had a mentor who basically told you to be less interesting and i want you to speak to that a little bit um but basically i think the thrust of it which was like oh you know you're doing too many things or you know men can get away with that you as a woman can't you have to seem laser focused on your job or people won't take you seriously et cetera et cetera and this feels like such a a case to that that counter which is had you not been you know different if you had not been doing other things which may be talking about on the side in terms of performing and if that had not been part of your personality facebook live never may have never you know existed or would have existed much much later in the life cycle because none of those engineers were gonna go and grab people into a closet and try and interview them and and flex that performance muscle so um i think that's that's so cool for that reason and maybe use that as a segue um to talk about that that story of being told basically be less interesting and and um how that maybe shaped your thinking and and your your correlate well i mean i was always i always loved performance and so um i actually i sang with an 80s rock band in silicon valley um i mean the standards are pretty low for what makes a good band in silicon valley but um we we played at a lot of charity galas and uh like tech company holiday parties and things like that so i had my 80s rock band i also um you know a lot of people in web 3 have seen a recent music video that i did but that wasn't my first i've been doing tech music videos like that for decades and so i i had like a music video that i put out about the iphone launch and like blackberry devices and all these things and um i noticed like that the men could get away with djing on the weekends at different parties and hella skiing and having like all of these side hobbies and people thought it was so cool and so interesting that the second that a woman does anything that isn't raising a family and heads down on a job people are like oh she's distracted she's not a real entrepreneur she's silly she has frivolous interests and it was always this push and pull and i i had some mentors who i really really trusted who you know were a bit older than me who had seen even you know worse situations as women in business um and they were like you you have to be less interesting if you want to be successful in this web two world you need to have no side interest no passions like just be a serious entrepreneur and i finally realized that i just didn't want to do that and it was the moment where i got a phone call inviting me to perform in an 80s rock musical on broadway producer had they wanted a tech personality they had seen some footage of our 80s rock band and called me out of the blue offering me a leading role on broadway and it was that exact moment that i was like right there there's two paths to go down there's like decline this and go immerse myself fully in my career and be that less interesting executive or take a stand and show that women in business can have a 360 degree rich life and maybe that means that some people aren't going to like me but those people probably weren't going to like me anyway and so at the at the end of my life like what am i gonna have more fomo for not doing so um i ended up accepting that that broadway role and that set my career on a totally wild and amazing path so that's amazing so how long had you been at facebook was it seven or eight years when you left to broadway it was about seven or eight years i had been in silicon valley for about a decade at that time and uh a lot of people told me they're like randy you will never be taken seriously in business ever again if you go sing on broadway you'll always just be like that woman who sings and uh um i just i didn't believe that was true i believed that there i've always believed that there's this middle ground between arts and technology and that both coasts have it wrong in silicon valley they're just building these giant platforms for billions of people without caring the content that's on the platforms in new york they care so much about the content they think people will fly to new york to see it and they don't think about distribution at all and so i've always believed that there was a middle ground between those two worlds coming together yeah that's such a great point um do you feel were you penalized ever did you feel for having made the broadway decision or have there been moments where you're like oh i have been taken less seriously or and maybe there haven't been but i asked that in part because i do think our own beliefs about how other people are going to react to us sometime influence our decisions more than how people actually would react to our decisions totally you know i would say that at first yes and then over the years it became actually a huge competitive advantage for me so i would say in the beginning people were just like okay randy's officially gone off the deep end why would someone leave this like great role at a company that just went public in order to go sing in an 80s rock musical on broadway and i i can understand why people would be skeptical about it the same way i understand why people are skeptical that like i'm buying jpegs right now in my career like i've done a lot of like weird things that's okay like let let people be skeptical um but what i will say is that it opened a whole new world for me of understanding how artists and creators exist in the world because i became one um and it opened up a whole world of understanding how to evaluate the business of an artistic project because i i went from there into producing for broadway i ended up producing you know i think uh almost a dozen shows i've produced now on and off broadway um which i wouldn't have done without that experience of actually acting myself and i think now in my web three world it's made it so that i can interact with both the techie founders and also the artists and creators themselves because i know what it feels like to step on out on a stage and put your art out there and have it well received or not well received by an audience like i understand the vulnerability of an artist and a creator in the space in a way that i think a lot of other just techy people don't understand totally one thing that excites me about web3 and i want to get your reaction to this and see if you agree or if i'm thinking about this wrong has to do with empowering not just artists and creators but but call it you know the everyday people who are maybe kept out of the accredited investor world so it strikes me that facebook you know in addition as just using them as an example you know in addition to being a company has always been a platform and you saw companies like zynga you had multi-billion dollar companies built atop facebook zynga games i'm sure there's many others and the people who have benefited most from that as time has gone on have been those early investors in facebook who would have been accredited investors vcs you know folks that probably already had money what excites me about web3 is ethereum is a platform atop which you see all of this stuff being built but anyone with an internet connection essentially can buy into ethereum and can take part in that growth do you think that's a fair comparison how do you think about that you know i guess it's a broader question around how web 3 maybe differs from the web 2 world but let's start with that specific example totally and uh i mean that kind of goes back to like my second why that we were talking about which is making sure women are on the front lines of new financial vehicles and um what i mean there were so many things i loved and still love about silicon valley and about the broadway world but the thing that frustrated me so much is that it seemed like all of the opportunities went to people who could afford to write a 25 or 50 000 check and if you couldn't afford that baseline minimum you were just left out in the cold you had no network you had no access into tech deals same with broadway if you want to be involved in putting a show on broadway it's a minimum usually you know 250 000 check that you have to to write and um why shouldn't we give more people the opportunity to support the arts why shouldn't more people have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of things um so a few kind of a let's call it web 2.5 organizations that i've been really lucky to get involved with uh i joined the board of directors of the motley fool a few years ago that is all about giving investment advice wherever you are on your journey and then about a year ago i joined the advisory board for republic which is equity crowdfunding i'm working on a project that's doing a deal with the public right now we're going to be using republic for our love and so rep that was like sort of a big lightning bolt moment for me was seeing how in republic suddenly um those angel investment deals that might be inaccessible in silicon valley because they have a 25 000 minimum investment as an accredited investor suddenly with a hundred dollars you have the opportunity to to become an angel investor and so that was just incredibly exciting to me and i've been advising and working alongside the team at republic um and crypto and web 3 just felt like such a natural extension of that the fact that now um you know you get to have a direct connection with an artist you get to make a direct investment into a project and see the upside of that in such an innovative way again these this isn't for everyone and i also i understand that i sit in a unique place of having had success in business such that i can play with these new financial vehicles and that's not for everyone so i try not to couch anything as investment advice that i'm giving or advice but what i do think is that uh we can't live in a world where opportunities are only for people who are already rich and so it's been a big mission of mine to at least inform and educate women about these opportunities such that when they are ready for them and it does make sense financially they can take advantage yeah and republic relies on regulation cf which i think was something that came into play in the obama administration which opened the path for non-accredited investors to start making investments in companies that i think we're looking to raise like five million or less um you know there it's there's still a lot of hoops and i'm right now trying to working on a project where we're trying to use republic but also do something kind of crypto native and marry those two worlds and it's it's not a it's not a natural fit yet nope nope we're not quite there yet i'm curious and and obviously none of us can know for sure but given just the breadth of experience you've had in so many different spaces again early tech now republic etc do you have any thoughts as to where this all goes regulatory and are you optimistic that crypto will help usher in sort of a new way of wave of laws that are beneficial to everyday investors and to your point for women and people who maybe have been historically left out of these opportunities yeah i think um right now uh crypto is a little bit of a sketchy neighborhood it's also just like like the the ux just isn't quite there yet so um it feels it feels like a combination of like being in a really sketchy neighborhood at three o'clock in the morning and also it's like back to the days when i was in college when you could only text message people who are in your same service provider so like my my boyfriend who's now my husband had a t i had verizon we could not sms one another like so like how useless is that when you can't even like sms your own significant other because you're on on a different network so crypto to me feels like a combination of those two feelings of like the uselessness of early text messaging and like the sketchiness of that neighborhood and so i i love the utopian idea of a decentralized world but i think the reality is that like a little bit of centralization is probably really helpful for where crypto is right now um because that sketchy neighborhood needs a little bit of security and um we need you know some of the big players who know who understand ux and who have the capability to improve on that quickly to get in in the game also so you know maybe i'm going to lose some of my crypto street cred to like call for a little bit of centralization i'm not calling for total centralization but i do think that until you know there's someone to call when your wallet gets empty and emptied and scammed and until there is like some baseline improvement in how clunky things are we just aren't going to see the promise of tens of millions of new people coming into the space yeah i think that's actually the prevailing sentiment you know like you have maxis maybe who are very loud who just purely want you know decentralization in its again purest form i don't think that's the vast majority because realistically there's no denying what you're saying you know like it's just you're not gonna get everyday people in this if they have to worry about a a ten word seed phrase and there's a trillion different ways that they're going to get scammed or hacked or they have to be fearful that they're going to lose their their net worth um i wonder because i also think like especially for women we're already like entering the space uh so behind and then if you have to constantly be looking over your shoulder you're not looking ahead and like as women in the space we need to be like a laser focused on the future which we can't be if we're always thinking about protecting ourselves so um i think there's just yeah there's there's a few steps that need to happen and i i truly hope you know i want tens of millions of more women to get into the space in the next year or two and i hope we can make the advancements to make that happen i want to talk about hug and really dive into everything you're doing there because i think it's awesome final question on this sort of line though is about meta if you're open to giving some thoughts on meta your brother is mark you worked at facebook for 10 years we're talking about decentralization centralization we can cut this out if you don't want to speak on it but we'd love to to get your thoughts on uh meta and that transition yeah yeah i mean i to be totally honest i'm much more in the nft world and so i i'm excited and curious about the metaverse but i don't quite spend as much time focused in that world um and i you know i never actually worked at meta only at the the company formerly known as facebook but what i think is exciting is that their shift to meta i think has really set off so much enthusiasm fundraising innovation in the space so no matter you know how you feel about the company how you feel about the name change i think that was probably the single event that's happened recently that has set off just a extreme enthusiasm and passion for the metaverse area of web3 so i'm i'm excited about it i um you know for me i uh i think the future of the metaverse will probably be ar before it is vr um but i'm i'm i i'm an interested and curious uh bystander observer of what's going on okay let's talk about hug you mentioned obviously you're very much in the nft side of things uh why don't you give the the overview of what hug is there's a lot of components here that i want to dive into but um start with the overview yes and uh you know it's a little hard to give an elevator pitch for hug because we really are a com a community driven effort but what i will say is that i see it as kind of the second stop on someone's web 3 nft journey so there are a lot of awesome first stops out there there are great communities that are onboarding beginners that are helping people grow their initial collection and decide where they want to be in web 3. um curious addy trading club is one of my favorite onboarding beginner communities meta angels is one of my favorite onboarding communities but what a lot of people don't have is they don't have that second stop so after they've onboarded most people will be really happy just being kind of hobbyist web three or um or dabbling in it but a subsection of people want to go really really deep once they're leaning into the space and i think for women for non-binary people for diverse founders there's not really a friendly second stop in web three there's these like super bro-y alpha groups and uh there's a lot of a lot of kind of toxic communities that are out there to go deep um but what i was missing in my own journey is i was like okay now that i've onboarded like where where's my community of other women that want to go deep in this space together in a really friendly inclusive way and i didn't find it so we decided to create it so that's kind of in a nutshell what hug is and within hug now we have about six different programs and things that are going on to support people um because some people their second stage in crypto is that they become a super collector of nfts and like almost a curator and some people take up the plunge to become founders as their second step they get so drawn into the space that they decide that they want to build something and so hug really sort of has programs for everyone no matter what your second step is so let's talk about some of those specific programs was group hug first yes group hug was first so the first uh problem that i i really felt we needed to solve is the fact that there are a lot of artists and people who have launched successful nft collections where they have that product community fit that we talked about but now they're like oh [ __ ] what's next i now have 10 000 people in a discord looking at me that's right expecting things from me and i need to do something that's right they have five they have like thousands of people on their discord saying like when utility when roadmap like why does everyone keep spelling when wrong exactly and so and there are all of these founders now that are just like holy crap like what do i do um a lot of them you know are were artists with no formal business training or even if you have business training nothing really prepares you for like you said 10 000 people who have bought one jpeg from you and now expect you to be available to them 24 7. so group hug i found myself advising about 20 different nft collections and founders and they were all going through the exact same thing so group hug we decided to form a formal accelerator for projects that have already completed their mint and are now kind of in that like oh [ __ ] what's next phase and uh really helping to apply some of the things that i've learned on the front lines of facebook and and web 2 on how to turn something that's web3 native into a really long term business living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect po-apps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you gotta try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 i think when we spoke with and i spoke with ally downey and alex kavalakis from from the meta angels team they've announced they have this very early stage if you have an idea and you're trying to take your project from you know idea to mint they've launched this program to really get you there and then this feels like the next step you know yeah it's like congratulations that's the feeder into group hug and then i believe there is something called hedgehog which is a beautiful lovely pun that is just very randy very randy in the uh everything i felt from you which is just like fun and lovely and funny i love puns i i hope anyone who's interacted with me in web3 knows i don't take myself seriously i am i'm like i'm in on the joke like i'm in on the cringe with everyone um and so uh hedgehog is our slightly earlier stage program i would say it's still it's not as early as what meta labs is doing when you are like um have your you know or sorry angel labs when you like just have an idea but hedgehog is you know okay you have a team you have a community maybe you're a month away from your mint and you just need a little extra oomph and support and hype going into the mint that's uh that's how we work with programs because we had a lot of people who were applying to group hug and hadn't quite minted yet so um that's a very different journey though from the the growth stage businesses that are going through group hugs so we launched hedgehog to support slightly more upstream and how many uh projects right now do you have in each of these we have um eight projects in group hug we have two in hedgehog and then we actually also have an artist-in-residence program so in every cohort we accept three artisan residents who are one-of-one artists one-of-one artists are such a crucial part of the nft ecosystem and very often overlooked for these giant pfp collections so we have three one-of-one artists who aspire to work on a bigger collection and we're helping you know either match them with a founder match them with devs help them grow their idea so that's been really exciting and rewarding to have also and are these time-based programs as well like you're in the program for x number of months and and there's programming during that explain a little bit what it's like for the folks going through this exactly and it's it's a little less it's not like your typical uh accelerator program where everyone lives in the same city together i mean we have um nft collections all over the world that we're working with but uh our early stage program only lasts through your mint and then at that point you're either kind of graduating to group hug because you've had a successful mint and what's next or maybe we're holding your hand a little bit longer if something isn't quite going up to expectation with the mint group hug is a one-year program and companies are coming into that already having minted ready for the next phase of their journey and we're really working closely with them for almost a full year that we're advising them on on building that road map and long-term growth so um it's it's exciting we're constantly changing things and we're actually just opening up uh applications for our next cohort of group hug artist in residence and hedgehog also we will definitely include the link to that if you send it over to me we'll make sure we have that link so folks can go and apply what are you seeing as the common denominators amongst projects that are successful and then maybe the common denominators where projects are consistently struggling and need support from something like this yeah i would say a few of the things that i'm seeing that are leading to success is when founders are really willing to get out there and tell their story i think in web 2 world a founder could still hide behind a pr team that would do most of the work or a spokesperson in web3 you can't do that no one is going to love your business like you do or no one's going to tell your story like you do and so um a lot of what we're doing is getting founders comfortable putting themselves out there media training yeah media training um we run a lot of twitter spaces for hug and so we're always uh putting all of our founders on there to kind of get their sea legs with with speaking in front of big groups of people and then encouraging them to go out and do more of that on their own but i realize like what you and i are doing right now this is not a skill set that's comfortable for a lot of people this is a lot of people's worst nightmare and um you know but it's such an essential part of success in web 3. i feel for introverts in this space as somebody who kind of is one which people are always surprised by but like you know i think it can be if you're like an artist and you're like super introverted and shy and just want to make your art i'm like i know it's tough this world we're living in where you kind of need to be out there telling your story and um yeah so it's great to have a resource who can kind of help walk them through it totally i also feel like i end up acting as like like a therapist or like a professional mom i'm literally a professional mom that's what i am like i've been calling myself for years a professional mom to entrepreneurs and it's like never been more true than in web3 because the biggest similarity that i see between web 2 and web 3 is that um is this kind of crazy frenetic pace that everyone is going at at the beginning it was like that in the beginning of web 2. like when the iphone first came out the mad dash to create apps for the iphone was like exactly like what i'm seeing now with web3 and a lot of founders burned out right before it got good and i really don't want that to happen again especially to women in the space and i know um you know not only are women hustling to launch these things but then they're just like constantly demoralized by the fact that like some dude will launch a project that has a 27 eighth floor a few hours later and meanwhile you see like world of women that's been like hustling for months and months and months and like their floors dropping and that's like incredibly demoralizing for i think all women in the space to see the reality of what's going on like that so i spent a lot of time as a mom as a therapist as a friend to a lot of our founders because it's uh it's it's a tough pace it's an emotional roller coaster and i just i want all my babies to like still be standing in a few years from now and is your advice or is your perspective if you can stick it out if you can not get burned out and if you cannot if you can make sure you you protect yourself you're not working at a pace that means you're gonna leave in a year in three years time a lot will open up or what are you telling folks totally that's literally my only advice is to like make sure you're still standing in the year 2025. if you are still standing if you are still standing like if you haven't been thrown out of the dodgeball game by 2025 like you're gonna win because it means that you've pivoted it means that you've like not burnt out you've had enough resources to hang in there because that's what i saw in web 2 if you know all of the early facebook apps and all the early iphone apps like they all changed they all pivoted um but if you could just hang on for a few years to watch the ecosystem mature and understand what customers wanted you are so much better poised for success are the folks you're advising is this their full-time job and do you feel like for folks and for artists who want to launch into this space it needs to be a full-time job i think so for group hug um to once if you are like you have to be committed to a long-term journey so we do require for anyone in our group hug program that it is their full-time job and that they're all in on it um what i would love to see though is i would love to see a world where people can be hobbyists in web3 i don't think that's really the sense right now i think the i think and i think that's why the space turns a lot of newcomers off of it is because there's a sense that either like you are 24 7 in it drinking from the fire hose or you're not like a real crypto person um and in order for this world to really expand and for all of you know new money to come in a new opportunity to come in we have to make room for the hobbyist enough tears and the hobbyist crypto people and so i would love to see a world where people feel like they could launch a collection on the side as a hobby but unfortunately i just think right now the atmosphere just isn't conducive to that there's some advice that i love from elizabeth gilbert who wrote eat pray love and is you know just pressing about a whole bunch of things in my opinion and she wrote a book called big magic and one thing i took away from that was she didn't quit her day job until she wrote eat pray love which was you know a huge massive success but she had actually published several books before that but the reason she had never quit a job despite having published all these books was she was like she never wanted to put the pressure on her writing this thing that she loved so much to sustain her financially because she worried if she did that it would ruin this thing she loved so much and hearing what you're talking about it resonates for me along those lines of the unfortunate thing right now is if you want to be an nft artist or if you want to be in this space you you know you kind of have to put the pressure on it to make it the thing that sustains you because you you need to be at it 24 7. but i do think that as the market matures that will be something that will uh not be the case right like you can do social media on the side right now you know and then grow it into a business that you do full-time uh you know any time absolutely just like um someone can can have a podcast or someone can be on social media and i think once some of these big players get into nfts a bit more it'll be easier too big corporate big corporations what do you who are the big players i'm talking about like like um pinterest and instagram and shopify and like once some of these big players make it just like a button that's on you know a site you already have or social media yes exactly then i think that makes it just so much easier to um you know of course that's also going to mean you have to cut through a lot more noise because if it's easier for you to launch your nft collection on the side that means it's easier for millions of other people to do that also so there's there's pros and cons with that that come with all of these things but i mean i'm just even thinking about podcasting there's some staggering statistic i read that said that um like most podcasts don't even make it past four episodes so if you can just make it to like the fifth or sixth episode of your podcast you are much more likely to have success and longevity here we go over jpegs like it's just like most things in life yeah like just being still standing like actually really matters yeah so many people quit before right even right before i think two right before it opens up and gets good i've now referenced this book so god i'm so sorry to everybody who listens to the show but there's a book called um the war of art i don't know if you've ever read it but it's it's fantastic and um you know it makes that case the author makes the case like he personifies this idea of resistance which is everything that fights against you as an artist like everything that procrastination that fear to start your art to do the thing you love right and he's like resistance gets strongest right before you're about to succeed you know and i think that's true i think so many people give up right right before the breakthrough totally what are are there areas that you think are are ripe for nfts where we haven't seen a lot yet like what are some of the under explored areas that you'd be excited to see projects take on for example in this next cohort of of huggers if that's for sure um i'm really interested in the tie between crypto and philanthropy um i think that's something that is really interesting because uh you know there's so many incredible organizations and philanthropies out there and also a lot of organizations that are not really very well run or not making the best use of finances and i think um applying that uh you know to the blockchain that accountability and that layer of being able to see exactly where money is going it could be such a game changer for making donors feel comfortable with philanthropy and keeping organizations accountable and so i'm really interested to see you know what is that layer of like web 3 nfts and philanthropy um so that's something that i'm really keeping my eye open uh in this next round of group hug and hedgehog applicants um and then also i think you know i'm i'm looking for kind of that level of like the pipes behind a lot of what we're doing um you know they're like what are what's what's going to be like the media company of the future that's built on web3 what's going to be the office collaboration tools of web 3 and uh i think as a lot of our behaviors are changing i will personally fund anyone who is making an alternative to discord like i will just say that like if someone can build a viable alternative to discord like i'm i'm there call me please because like discord is a ouija board of chaos and destruction and it cannot be the only way that we communicate okay i love that let's actually use that to talk about hug hub uh and what you're doing there explain to folks what hug hub is it's another spoke in this grand hug wheel and i'm excited about it thank you um and we are on discord so now that i just like spent all that time like slamming it we are there but like what's the reason now yeah i agree i agree it's like a necessary evil right now but i'm you know my eyes are open for for an alternative it's part of this broader like the ux ui and this space needs improvement right like we're also all buying on coinbase and transferring over to metamask and you know like having to find the weird part of our iphone where we can turn off icloud syncing for metamath like we're all doing these things but like this is obviously not the best it can be exactly okay so we are on discord right now but um one of the projects that originated from the community that's now become kind of the central thing that we're doing at hug is we are creating a database of hundreds of women in diverse led nft collections um that we're calling the hug hub and uh for the last two months we've had over 300 community curators in our discord who have been pouring through thousands of nft collections to create these really detailed analysis and description and what they like about the collections and we'll be launching that um in our discord and then as an external site called hug hub where anyone can go and actually kind of do research on nft projects alongside the community so we'll have we'll be launching with about 200 nft collections and a hundred one of one artists and what i will say is that it will be viewable for anyone but if you if anyone wants to be a curator and actually contribute content to the site and reviews and add collections they will need to hold the hug nft pass which has started minting it started minting quite recently yes it started minting recently available on openc um and we what we said publicly is that having uh they come in hugs matching hugs the nfts so even just having one side of a hug will get you into hug hub and into our discord in the research community but having a matching hug is going to unlock special things okay i want to get into maybe the nft a little bit more in a minute but i want to stay on hug hub and a couple things that stood out to me about this one if i understand correctly you have these 300 curators but they can't actually contribute information about a project that they themselves own is that true correct so we divided everyone into kind of these uh these mini groups to go through collections and each nft collection had about 30 curators that had their eye on it before it got approved for the site so it wasn't just like one person deciding and people had to recuse themselves or get moved around to different groups if their group was assigned to an nft project that they had a close relationship to the founder had advised on were a holder of themselves so we really wanted people to um be advising as neutrally as possible um and so it was exciting to see the results that happened and a lot of these curators i mean they were taking it so seriously they were going into other communities discords and asking questions and poking around on social media and really getting a sense of what the community was like for these different projects and how helpful how welcoming to newcomers so i'm excited i think that the level of research and analysis on each of these nft collections is really unique to what the space has so far and i hope will really elevate and bring a lot of diverse nft founders and collections into the public light who might not be noticed otherwise the other thing that struck me is no negatives you can only speak about the positives of a project explain the thinking behind that yes so again i mean we're called the hug we are all about embracing creators the last thing that i would ever want to do is tear a creator or a founder down this space is already rough enough like they they don't need no one needs to be kicked when they're down in this space and so i believe that there is something to be complimented about any project and so what just like when you get out of an uber uh and uber kind of a pre-suggests some compliments for you like nice music good conversation like clean car uber doesn't pre-suggest any negative things for you to to say about the driver um and we want to do the same thing so we want compliments to be really pointed and detailed um we're not going to suggest compliments like this project is awesome because that's that's not helpful but we will say you know we will recommend compliments specifically about the road map or specifically about the art or specifically about the founding team um because we think that there's you know there's probably something nice to be said about anyone and if you don't have something nice to say about a project well that that also speaks enough for it without having to to come and say something negative and so if there are projects because there are of course rug polls or there are projects that are have nefarious intent if if uh a project like that comes across the the desk metaphorical desk of your curators is the idea that it just doesn't get onto the platform at all like how do you ensure that um you're also successfully almost warning folks off from projects that maybe are bad yes then if we have that sense because a project has to kind of cross about 30 different people's eyes before it gets put on the site we uh my hope is that we will protect it from a lot of those we might not there might be some that that slip through the cracks um and we'll figure out as a community what to do with those uh but a lot of people seem to be kind of just doing their own research in a vacuum right now by themselves and so at least you know i'd love to see people benefiting from research that the community has done and benefiting from adding their own thoughts to projects that are out there but if something seems nefarious it uh it will likely not make it onto the website given all the checks and balances that we have so it being on there in and of itself in the first place is a certain like stamp of safety you know it doesn't mean you're gonna make money it doesn't mean you're not gonna lose money all those things can happen of course but it it does at least mean 30 30 eyeballs who uh have looked at this thing and said this is not a rug 30 eyeballs have evaluated the founding team the health of the community the road map and the art itself yeah so if they if it's still a rug pull after that then like it is a very thorough sophisticated level it's a very very sophisticated rug one one other thing i will say is that you know uh there are hiccups that come about in nft collections like for example there was a situation with crypto chicks with the collection um where it came to light a few months ago that the original artist had um uh had plagiarized at least one of the pieces of art in the collection um and now you know that is a collection that probably would have made it through our our database because it did it does have a great team around it a great community cool art um so i you know we've had a lot of discussion even in our own hug community about what you do when that comes to light and i will say that the new team that has come in to turn crypto chicks around has been really thoughtful and really fantastic and so um i'm hoping there's a way with with hug hub that maybe we can temporarily kind of put a you know a caution on a project but give the team the benefit of the doubt of turning it around and overcoming those hurdles so for right now it sounds like hug hub is not a place where if you're look if you know you're not going to search any nft project and find it if you want to read an evaluation of board apes which you can find anywhere at this point if you'd like it but you know what i'm saying that's it but if you're looking to um really invest in some projects that maybe have been overlooked or underlined it feels actually more where you can sort by certain traits you can sort by i'm looking for a female founding team and you can read about projects that maybe haven't crossed your radar otherwise is that a good way to describe it absolutely um we are launching with all female and diverse led projects in this first assortment of what will go up on the site and so if you're looking to just get information on the top 20 collections on openc there's a lot of information that already exists around those collections a lot of analytics tools what we're surfacing is do you want to collect more lgbtqia lead collections in your portfolio do you want more black-owned collections do you want uh latin x collections female founders um you know our hope is that as you know coinbase nft and big players come into the market and bring millions of new collectors uh a lot of these people are going to be you know want their wallet to say something about themselves um and will be interested in identifying with specific kind of founders i also hope that as more liquidity comes into this space with some of these huge exits and huge blue chip nft collections um i hope that a lot of those people who've seen returns will turn around and pay it forward in the community by investing in projects that were traditionally underlooked so uh that's our hope is that hug cub can be kind of like the place to find all of those because it a piece of my soul dies every single time someone posts on twitter like i want to uh collect some women-led projects drop them in the comments and then everyone just scrambles to you know post their project and it's like thousands of comments um like a piece of me dies like there has got to be a better way exactly and now this poor individual has to go sort through a thousand projects to figure out what's legitimate what's not that's right is how in real time do you anticipate this being in the sense that right now you're launching with i think you said 200 or so projects that'll go up initially is this going to be hey here are some projects minting this coming week is is that the hope or where do you see this evolving yes so we're going to have a whole calendar around projects minting our first uh our first go go around is projects that have already minted just because it's much easier to do research on a team and a roadmap in a community on something that has already been minted rather than something that that hasn't been minted yet so a lot of the focus will be on projects that have already minted and the nfts are already out there or they're in the process of minting um but i hope over time as we open this up to the community and allow any of our nft holders to start contributing to the site that will actually you know have a world where there are thousands of nft projects that are minting have minted uh that are on there and that you can search by do you think this is creating a like art renaissance where and i've said this on the show before i growing up you know art collecting or buying art like just seemed like this thing that i don't parents did i guess but like it never it's not you know even as i've gotten older and had slightly more disposable income like it's never occurred to me like buy art and do you think nfts are changing that where the younger generation is suddenly gonna have an interest in art and in owning art in a way that uh maybe they wouldn't have otherwise done so done oh a hundred a hundred percent i think there are millions of art collectors that are being born because of web3 i know even for me my physical art collection has grown so much more since entering web 3 and getting into digital art uh because i've i've been i've gotten so interested in art and then i've also developed relationships directly with artists and now you know not only have i uh collected some of their nfts but now i'm i'm chatting with them about like the actual in real life paintings and and things that they're doing too and getting to know that um and i think before this kind of renaissance as you mentioned it felt really inaccessible for a lot of people to collect art and there were so many middle men like you had no opportunity to have a direct relationship with an artist you had to go through a gallery or a website or or something and it felt so unpersonal and art is is such a personal journey collecting art so i think the best thing about the space honestly is that we will see millions of new art collectors that are born from this digital world a couple more questions because i know we've we've reached we're almost at the end here so you mentioned augmenting has happened if you own even half of a hug set you can get access to the hug discord which will give you access to these lists of projects anything else you want to share about what holding a hug nft will do or holding this pair might do yeah i just think you know we have such a great community in the discord right now um so if you want to be part of i guess that we can call sort of call it an alpha group because that's what that's the lingo out there but if you want to be in like the i call it web 3's friendliest most welcoming alpha group um we we'd love love to have you um no matter whether you identify as a collector a curator or a creator yourself of of art anyone who's on that second stop in web three we we'd love to have you um and uh so lisa chao is our artist she has created these adorable matching hugs that we've divided into left and right sides and so like you said even having one half of that side will allow access to everything but um we we also have learned in coaching other projects that utility is really the future of nft isn't providing in real life utility um and so matching hugs will have some special utilities that i'm i'm not allowed to talk about because we're still in the minting window um and so i don't want to convey anything that could uh jeopardize uh legally what we're doing but i'm excited to reveal that over time thoughts about uh how nfts in the theater world may mesh i know theater is something you're so passionate about you obviously are in the nft space where do you see live performance evolving to would love to get thoughts i know i've like saved these big lofty questions for the end of the show and you're like i love it and it's so funny because about a decade ago i gave a talk at tedx broadway that was basically calling for decentralization of theater without even using that word because that word like wasn't in our vernacular yet um but my whole ted talk was about you know how do you ever expect this industry to move forward with so many middlemen and uh i that's i think what i'm so excited about i think dows can become a huge vehicle for producing the arts and shows and and bringing new things to life i think um new emerging artists and writers in theater won't have to wait to get a producer or a theater to fund them they can launch an nft collection that kind of explains their script and their storyline and their music and and actually get the backing of a community rather than the backing of a few rich producers so i think this could completely change the way that arts are produced in this country can you name some of the like for people who don't know the theater process what are some of like the middlemen right now that hold the process up well uh first of all there are only 40 broadway theaters so um if you want to actually and there are so many shows that are good enough to be on broadway but uh so you have to do the politicking to get your show to be one that's accepted by one of those theaters so that's that's a huge gatekeeper that's that's there the other big gay keeper is that it costs about i would call it 12 to 20 million dollars to put on a broadway show right now and um but there's not a lot of institutional capital that's funding broadway so shows are brought to broadway 125 000 check at a time until 20 million dollars have been raised which is like insane i know doesn't that give you heart palpitations 100 so uh so not only uh so the the lead producers of a show have kind of figured out a way to outsource that because i mean you you would spend a year just raising those checks and not focusing on the show so there's now a whole middle layer for any broadway show of co-producers who basically are just tasked with like raising a portion of the that money so if you come in and you write a 25 000 check to a show you will not only will you probably never ever meet the lead producers of the show you will certainly never meet the artists or the actors or the creators of the show so you could finance a show you could win a tony award for that show without ever having met the person who wrote it and for me that was like when i realized that about the industry that was one of the most horrifying moments um i felt so sad i felt like the magic of the theater industry had been ripped out from under me and that was when i was like no i i will never work on a show in that old way again i will only work on a show where everyone putting a dollar in feels like they're part of the process and meets the creators and uh all of that work is done in tandem like there is no reason why someone who wins a tony for a show should ever have not met the creator do you have plans in the works do you have any like things up your sleeves i know i wish i wish i wish i could talk talk about them but what i will say is that if anyone listening out there is in that small venn diagram like us of like the intersection of theater and web 3. come find me we are a small crew in web 3 but we are vocal and we're passionate so come find me because we're putting some cool things together it's so interesting for me coming into web 3 and as a result of being interested in web 3 learning about all of these other industries learning more about the music the legacy music industry learning more about the art world and like realistic how messed up and just like inefficient and stupid all of these old models are has just been such a fascinating thing for me that that does make me so bullish on on nfts i do think it's going to take longer and i don't know about about with theater specifically and i guess i'd be curious in your thoughts i think some of this is going to take longer than we'd like it to i think the music industry their systems are so embedded and so screwed up and there's all these legacy deals and contracts that are in place that can't just be unwound with an nfd so it's going to take time to really have this play out is that i agree i i agree and especially for theater i think we're going to first start seeing this with new emerging artists because um a lot of the shows that are going on to broadway right now are either what's called a jukebox musical where it's like the music of green day or the music of aretha franklin and like that i mean that's like way too much ip issues to to do something like that with web3 or the other category is like blockbuster movies that are now getting turned into musicals like there's like mrs doubtfire the musical or beetlejuice the musical like what i call it moulin rouge and like that has too many ip issues also so i think the kind of artistic projects that are going to be ripe for leading the way in web 3 is kind of these like solo singer songwriter or playwrights indie that own their own content and can experiment with it i think that's so exciting though because we need that i mean what you're describing is so happening in the box office in the in the movie world right where all we see are like remakes of fast and furious 100 or whatever you know like it was actually interesting there's an interesting chart that shows there's zero overlap in movies that were nominated for academy awards this year and like the top grossing box office hits like there's this total stratification happening there and web 3 as a way to empower more interesting storytelling that's maybe a little riskier if you're a you know if you're a financier or a hollywood whatever just trying to make a movie that you know is going to do well in the theater um but that actually has an audience that would be really excited about it um absolutely just like theater's the same like i always tell people if you want to see great theater like don't don't go to broadway go downtown and see like the the kind of raw early emerging work and unfortunately most of that never sees the light of day in a commercial way okay last question and you could also decline to answer this because it's maybe a little bit more personal but i interviewed i interviewed griffin and duncan uh uh cockfoster who are the co-founders of nifty gateway and i had to ask them about their last name because it's [ __ ] foster and i was like that feel like how was middle school for you for you your last name zuckerberg your brother is one of the most famous people on the planet what is that like for you what has that been like having a your brother become one of the most recognizable people in the world and having the last name zuckerberg yeah um i'm glad you asked the question of the nifty gateway guys because i actually had them on my radio on my siriusxm show and like i just didn't have the courage to ask yet so i'm glad you did um but uh you know it's it's really been it's been such a journey for me and what's interesting is that um i feel like you know i was so swept up for so many years and like supporting my brother's vision and being at facebook and i think it was right around the time that i got that call for that broadway show that i realized i kind of had this like call it like third life crisis where um i was like oh my gosh if someone made a movie of like the story of my life i wouldn't be the lead character in it like how did i get how did i get to like my early 30s being the supporting character in the story of my own life and um you know i'm so proud of all the work that i did at facebook and in silicon valley but i think for me that's like really shaped a lot of my career and uh even being in when i started being a little more vocally present in web 3 i could not figure out like why anyone cared what i had to say about anything because my entire career i've been like the other zuckerberg like i've never been like the one that people wanted to listen to or cared about so um i feel like it's it's been fun but also wildly uncomfortable for me to step into this new more visible world in web 3 so uh i hope what people can take away from this is that you know we're all learning and evolving as people and all coming into our own identity no matter our age or where we are in our careers well i'm so glad you have because i think you are obviously adding so much to this space from hug from you know the insights you can share from having been a part of web 2 and social media and that rise for 10 years i mean i think you have so much wisdom to share i'm so grateful to you for sharing it thank you for coming on i really really appreciate you and we'll definitely have to have you come back because i'm now curious to dig so much deeper into theater and nft so when you do finally launch something please come back i want to i want to learn more about uh how that's going to shape out play out harley you're amazing i mean just i love the fact that like the leading podcast in this space is a badass woman like you thank you i don't know i think kevin rose has something on me but i will catch up to him eventually where you got it you got it just just still be standing in 20 25. that's it do you honestly have inspired me with that like when i'm stressed or anxious or like feel like i'm underwater i like will literally that'll be the mantra for me like you just gotta still be here in three years and like i know i can do that so i know i know you can too thank you thanks randy i'll talk to you in three years [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this
