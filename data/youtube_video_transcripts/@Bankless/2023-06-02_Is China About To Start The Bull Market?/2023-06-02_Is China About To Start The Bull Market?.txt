this is the most interesting part of this article Hong Kong Securities and Futures commission release a rule book for the crypto industry last year stating that retail investors can start trading crypto from June first what bankless Nation it is the first Friday of June what time is it David ah Ryan it's the bank of Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News on crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor there is so much to cover this week which is why I'm talking so fast I'm also it's the morning time for me now for the first time in two months so I'm welcome back caffeinated welcome back to East Coast yeah it's great it's great actually it's good to see that background Again David I I missed it we're seeing kind of a you know a different background for the last week I missed those bricks yeah no the brick and the lighting and the good camera it's all back everything you know it's it's June and um last year 16 days from now three hours Capital went bust that's when we first found out about it really oh this is the factory errors Capital mines this is a round material month and this one through three hours Capital month man yep man time flies right when you're having fun are we having fun little did we know we still had FTX ahead of us at this point but actually okay well that means it's been roughly one year since Easter bottomed it's been one year since the ether bottom in that case that's true yeah about one year since we're gonna talk about that then also a few topics of the week did China just do a 180. can you read about this I just started to and I want to get your take on it but I feel like no one is talking about it and we're going to talk about it uh what else we got to cover we got this Celsius end game so if you are a Celsius creditor or you are interested about the state of Celsius creditors hi Ryan uh you're gonna be find out exactly how much money you're gonna get and if you are over five thousand dollars of a Celsius creditor you're gonna get something else I'm prepared to be disappointed yeah definitely hold your breath on that one uh World coin raising 110 million dollars 115 uh divides the crypto industry continues to be polarizing and then also the secret to winning the bear Market we got to take from Kobe at the end here all right uh before we get in David we've got a special word from our friends and sponsors do you want to add some more excitement to your life your staking life that is you can add excitement to the staking routine of eth using the asymmetrics protocol what is this thing David So for those that are familiar with pool together asymmetrics is like pull together but for each staking and so you stake your ether and then instead of giving a just boring 4.55 you get anywhere between zero and a thousand percent it could be anyone probably going to be zero might be a thousand percent uh and so this is what we call a prize linked savings account uh and so all of the yield gets pulled up and then one lucky winner gets everyone's yield and now that everyone else gets zero uh zero percent yield uh and so if you like to add a little excitement to your e-staking asymmetrics is for you uh banklist.cc Slash asymmetrics uh you also can follow them on Twitter asymmetrics underscore on Twitter look at this look at this almost seven eath that you could just get right on the daily right now that's the current reward pool uh kind of fun right yeah so only 234 users are competing for that seven eighth so like this actually so that I believe there's also like an extra little uh incentive uh so you actually technically get more yield uh if you like net everything out with asymmetrics um you just have to be ready to get zero percent for a while or maybe a thousand you don't know until you don't know yeah you can try your luck here okay let's get to the markets though um bitcoin price what are we at on the week uh call it a flat week up half a percent on the week start at 26 700 ending at twenty six thousand nine hundred all right how about ether uh actually up 2.5 percent so ether is up on the week started at 18 20. uh we are up to 1865. and the ratio we actually got pretty high up on ether uh this last week yeah yeah what's the spike what's this green candle here yeah I think that was when the um the debt ceiling got raised uh so 29 yeah so coupled to Trad markets um but still uh slowly positive optimistic trajectory lately on ether uh 2.5 uh ether BTC ratio looking really good if you are directionally long ether uh like I am uh at .0692 so wow happy happy ratio that's a pretty big ratio game in the month is up only in May yeah wow like I'm zooming out on the by the way on the Kraken Pro charts which lets you do this uh very nice I can see the ratio over time uh yes okay so we're back around the the April yeah like mid April but but you're right after a dip um you know at the end of April where we've been up up only in May for the ratio so uh go go eat total crypto market cap 1.17 trillion dollars pretty flat pretty flat David give us some stable coin numbers too uh down Ryan down stable stable coin numbers okay so 12 months change in stablecoin Supply uh it's bad 162 billion down to a hundred and twenty six billion uh year-to-date change since 2023 139 total amount of uh stable coins that have been issued so it's like kind of market cap of staple coins which which is a great usage metric for stable coins yeah so the the stable coin Supply in crypto is our liquidity uh so it's it's a very base nice it's important to see where stable coins are going seeing them go down is bad because that means there's less liquidity in the system interestingly though tether is at a all-time high uh so tether the 12th month of the year to date of tether uh started at 70 billion dollars is currently at 83 billion dollars surpassing all-time high 12 months ago it was at 83 billion dollars then three Euros Capital got liquidated it started to Trend downwards but now tether has resumed all-time highs so for a while uscc was looking real good against Heather gaining a lot of market share um lately ever since uh a year ago and especially after the banking crisis uscc's had some some headwinds and tether has gotten some Tailwinds look at this chart so I have a take on this you know last bear Market stable coin Supply actually grew a bunch so look at this this is just this is my God that is gargantuan yeah 2019 versus 2021 in fact it grew probably okay you're looking at 2020 we were at like five billion dollars of tether Supply yeah 2020 fast forward to 2022 uh touching an 85 billion right that is that's been a growth but you know what's interesting is um why this decrease one explanation for this is uh t-bills treasuries are actually the best yield Farm out there right now and that is outside of defy right in the last bear Market with intro interest rates fed interest rates at zero percent or close to zero percent very low let's just say defy uh interest offer the best yield on your dollar is no longer the case although um here's a take maker is trying uh the maker Dow is mulling a proposal to boost the die savings rate to 3.3 percent the last time you heard the die savings rate it's been probably 2020. I haven't even thought about it since 2020. um I used to consider the die savings rate as like the binary star system between the East sacred and the die savings rate this is when die was like the only meaningfully uh like decentralized stable coin on ethereum um uh and then it's been at zero for a very long time or at one percent as of recently but this is this is uh 3.3 is not small that's a decent chunk of maker doubt uh Revenue going into the die savings rate uh yeah implies that will increase the supply of dye in the market that's that that's the aim and by the way making them more competitive with basically debels with treasuries out there which are about five percent something like this so uh crypto creeping up there it's a nice equilibrium let's talk about eth staking though uh what is this chart from Hill Dobby yeah this is crazy okay 17.4 of all staked ether was deposited last month in the month of May wow that is significant 17.4 of the total States including the deposit queue which is a one-way queue into the beacon train that's crazy yes I mean this is um much more than I thought yes yeah the same in the same way this kind of feels like at post eip1559 it was burnt it ended up earning way more ether than people thought yeah same thing's happening with stakings like man people are staking way more than we thought that they would anytime you say um Heath burn right you know I gotta open up ultrasound money just because it's been at least two weeks since we've opened up ultrasound money look at this look at this beautiful down only Supply we have negative 275 000 ether since the merge damn one million win one uh tell me about the ethereum validator queue though that's an interesting story speaking of all-time highs the weight to be on the beacon chain for a validator is at all-time high 38 days so if you deposit 32 ether you got to wait 38 days the world's most popular Club you can't get in you gotta wait 38 days exit time is uh zero minutes zero minutes you are free to leave anytime uh was happy hour in there so you know everyone's trying to get in uh total Mev distributed to validators here's an interesting stat on its own um 200k eth distributed to validators of Mev what does this tell us so Mev this also includes tips so in just anything above base V is what we're looking at so 200 000 ether was distributed to Ether stakers cumulatively total since um proof of sake has launched so ethers Acres have received have so Spenders have been sent 200 000 ether to Savers this is why ether is great savings technology and this is a meme ripping from the hands of bitcoiners who said BTC is great savings technology yeah staked ether is the best savings technology of all time and what we're seeing here is we're seeing Spenders short people with short time preferences giving their time preference to people with long-term time preferences the eat stakers see guys what you don't know about David is he is actually a hardcore bitcoiner he just substitutes the word Bitcoin for ether Yes except it works way better do bitcoiners have always been right except they just chose the wrong thing all right um for the bankless maximalists out there though of which both you and I consider ourselves we want maximally bankless things this was a great headline and Story coming out of decrypt this week ethereum and Bitcoin balances on Exchange Edge towards a five-year low what wow so take a look at this WOW uh the amount for ether anyway um there's now 18 million eth ether on exchanges that represents 15 did you know though in the summer of 2020 it was 30 percent so we have about half of the amount of eth on exchanges in custodial systems than we did in 2023 years ago this is great this means more people are going Bank Less more people are taking custody of their private keys and getting it off of custodial Solutions very very bullish on this metric so we should ask why why is this happening what's going on here why are so many people going bankless uh so I mean the first uh this this trend definitely started with post FTX even so like everyone who's been on a centralized exchange has been like you know I'm going to try out that self-custody thing so even there's been outflows of free eth from even all the good exchanges like coinbase and Kraken right so that's going into people's self-custody however they want to do that um there's also regulatory fears and so if the the choke point is like you know what I'm I don't want to get choked out I'm going to do the self-custody thing first uh and then also there's the beacon chain which is sucking up all the ether which requires self-custody kind of mostly most of time some of the time and so and interestingly enough Hardware wallet sales are also up only as well and so there's just all of this demand and also at the same time versus 2020 defy as like a utility is way better than it's ever been like the utility of being bankless is up uh so as the industry has developed the reasons to self-custody has also increased another one of the most bullish things going on that no one's talking about because it's a bear market and we don't like good news except we do on Bank lists I'm always down for some good news uh Cyrus unesi had a really good take I think on the current state of the nft market why don't you give us the tldr the nft market is garbage and going to zero and Retail hates jpegs and crypto Twitter hates all coins with pictures he's he's being hyperbolic here uh here and then he follows up and says uh here are a few reasons why I haven't dumped my nfts because of this first I still like my jpegs more than I liked ever liked true altcoins the art is worth more to me than looking at xrp or Iota balance on a block Explorer he's just picking out like [ __ ] coins basically picking on them the market caps of these nfts are extremely tiny now a one eighth floor translates to a 20 million dollar market cap that depends of course on the supply of the nft but generally speaking the 10 000 pfp uh is like kind of the standard even at the depths of the 2019 bear Market giant scams still maintained higher market caps than this 20 million dollar market cap is insanely small nfts are structurally under invested in because people don't understand them yet Blue Chips like punks and apes are sitting at a one billion dollar market cap which one billion dollar coins have more staying power and brain value and utility and fundamentals than punks I'll wait memes are still extremely popular people have quit buying them but they can't quit talking about them there's something about jpegs that gnaws at you they don't disappear the way Nia Neo Iota and avax did can it really go down another 90 from here don't answer that I'm fairly certain someone will come along and buy this up soon why because mixing gambling and art is a new cult natural phenomenon I think it's this I think it's a great series like line of thought like I think don't don't overthink nfts they were the a big bubble then they were this first big bubble and like it's just like let's be like stupid people you're just saying basically nfts are better meme coins than meme coins yes that's exactly right yeah there you go that's what it is and they're gonna pump again for the same reason they pumped in the first time and I think like low like illiquid low-cap nfts are like a great place to place your bets in this building I think one one thing I see Cyrus is saying though is the Blue Chip ones in particular those are the ones that are kind of like surviving right and there's definitely going to be some up and comers but definitely there's going to be the vast majority of nfts they're gonna go to zero or close to zero right yes yeah I think the the game is to pick your bets pick your place or chips as to which ones you think are are underpriced low low priced but still being like circulating around on crypto Twitter you're betting on culture aren't you yeah you just make these cultural bets stop chilling your bag sir I I don't even know I I might own an mfer yes yeah you have one yeah you have one you convinced me to buy one yeah God only knows what that um that's priced at right now I'm sure it's about one year all right yeah see it's not at zero it's like no no that's not too bad yeah that's about what I buy for I think something like this uh all right Dave we've got some stuff coming up what do we have coming up coming up next we're going to talk about China's potential 180 on crypto which might be the most bullish news I've ever heard ever and no one's talking about it are people not talking about it for good reason or not we don't really know uh the Celsius deal gets Inked so

Innovation and development this is coming straight from Beijing a web 3 Innovation and development white paper we're not seeing these kinds of white papers being written by the uh the White House these days tell us what's going on so this white paper which I'm trying to figure out the significance of the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology commission which released this white paper um I'm not a China expert at all so I have no idea how this institution scales in the world of like authorities in China anyways the document states that web3 technology is an inevitable trend for future internet and Industry development the commission aims to construct Beijing as a global Innovation Hub for the digital economy to that in beijing's Chao Yang district will spend at least 100 million Yuan 14 million dollars every single year until 2025. not that much money but still it's more than zero this got on cz's radar who gave a take interesting timing on this web 3 white paper he says not sure of the authenticity lots of talks about nfts VR AI metaverse Etc looks like bite dance JD and Baidu each have their sections Gavin wood and beeple were mentioned web 3 web 3 web 3 people was mentioned yeah Gavin wood yeah look someone actually printed this out too it's an actual print out of the white paper in paper form imagine that uh and so this is the most interesting part of this article this white paper to me Hong Kong Securities and Futures commission release a rule book for the crypto industry last year stating that retail investors can start trading crypto from June 1st what okay this is Hong Kong not China which is an important difference okay although valence is it an important difference yes I yes no it almost means seems like the experimental zone for the rest of China the financial experimental Zone but but go on this is the Securities and Futures commission so is that like the equivalent of the if the SEC and cftc combined that's inside of Hong Kong yeah okay go ahead stated that retail investors can start trading crypto from June one so first off congrats to Hong Kong for getting rules really happy for you yes uh and uh if it was if this was mainland China this would be massive uh Hong Kong's a great uh pigeonhole great foothold great uh Beach head for the rest of China but retail investors can start trading crypto wow well that's just fantastic this is great this is uh there was also a um segment I guess on uh TV in China so from the China central television um CZ called the Chinese Community buzzing after Bitcoin was seen on TV in a segment and of course this is um pretty uh tightly controlled States media so very intentional to choose to show Bitcoin or not this is uh like my Bitcoin withdraw cash redeem yeah um I don't know again what all of this means David it's difficult to parse but there seems to be a a warming to crypto um in China in the west are still trying to figure this out because we don't we don't know how big of a deal this agency is um this segment that you're talking about is actually taken down so it was taken down retrospectively well that's not great so others have said Woo blockchain his tweets uh this is an unimportant governance Department in Beijing and it is just exactly deliberately exaggerating emotions uh focus on the AI and metaverse while the Chinese government is nothing supportive of of crypto so some people are saying it's a nothing Burger uh I am in a couple chats asking some Chinese friends and other people's opinions about like yo what's the deal here like how legit is this and there is contention no one no one can come to consensus on this oh really it's some people are saying hey it's a big deal others are saying it's not a big deal at all yeah that's kind of the question I guess maybe that's the the measured take but um China really I think is has been an enigma on crypto so very difficult to um to discern but I guess one take on this is I think whenever you see you know so China and the US of course are economic Rivals rivals in many different ways it seems like increasingly if China if if the US goes hard on like Banning crypto negative on crypto I think China will in turn support crypto like if the U.S zigs China's gonna zag take another operation yeah right which is probably long-term bullish good for crypto yeah now I on the back of this even in Hong Kong I don't see like a whole bunch of crypto projects being like all right cool Hong Kong we're moving to Hong Kong let's do it right right and so until I see that um sort of skin in the game and steak I think the market will be pretty undecided as to whether China is actually warming to crypto or whether this is just a flash in the pan and the thing is I feel like China has changed its mind on crypto so many other things if China came in and said we are so bullish on crypto like we're gonna allow everyone to do anything and that would be really bullish for a moment and then they could completely change their mind as they have already done five times over the next year and so like even if we got the most bullish news possible out of trying it like no one would be like okay but are you serious though because I really don't really know so mixed review on this news but probably more positive than than certainly negative right and turning in the right direction worst case it's a nothing Burger but there could be something here uh tell me about this yeah that is correct that it is not bearish there's anything we know it is not bearish there we go uh tell me about the end game for Celsius though David you promised out of this account are you ready for this headline right uh I don't know I'll brace myself Fahrenheit wins bid to acquire assets of insolving paradise yourself are ai's writing these uh coin desk articles now crypto Consortium Fahrenheit has one ambid to acquire the insolvent lender Celsius Network whose assets were previously valued at around two billion dollars oh okay I thought they got this wrong I thought they uh converted Celsius to Fahrenheit No Fahrenheit crypto Consortium called fahrenheit as purchased Celsius yeah Freedom Units taking the taking the victory here okay so the group will acquire Celsius institutional loan portfolio staked cryptocurrencies mining unit and additional alternative Investments um So the plan proposes that all of Celsius assets except liquid cryptocurrencies will be transferred to a newly formed company newco and so here here's the here's the deal here's the deal you ready for iron here yeah what you're gonna get do I get anything if your Celsius bag is more than five thousand dollars you will get a small distribution and become a shareholder in this new company which is going to have some private Equity uh some mining assets Etc it's a little bit more it's a little bit more than 5K so that's what I get huh oh yes yes perhaps uh and so uh what what does Celsius currently have to give all these new shareholders of this new company um they have some defy crypto assets they have some they have a loan book loan book portfolio PE and VC Investments uh liquid cryptocurrency about 500 million dollars and also mining assets because Celsius wanted to buy Bitcoin miners because they thought that was a good thing to do with money uh so this new this new plan proposes that all of these except the liquid crypto assets will go into newly formed company newco 100 of the equity in this new company will go to the creditors that are owed more than five thousand dollars Pro rata those owed less than five thousand dollars will get 70 cents on the Dollar on their claims and no equity if you are a Celsius holder it's a totally different deal if you have 5 000 or less if you have less or less than 5 000 I should say then you just get 70 right so you get a 30 haircut you get 70 and no equity if you have more than five thousand dollars you get this new Co Equity you know so if they're if they're depending on how they're marking this like five thousand dollars say you have ether in Celsius and Celsius goes in solvent that ether was priced higher yeah so like 70 on your dollar for a force hold of ether I didn't think about that like if it's marked to Market if it's Mark to Market yeah I don't know how they're I don't know how they're doing that I don't know that that detail that'd be a good question 70 on the dollar for the claims and no equity yeah it depends on what the value of ether was at the time certainly yeah okay so if you are a creditor above five thousand dollars you should not expect to see much returns after you get all the deductions so you you get the distribution of the liquid crypto assets that is left after they pay out the sub 5 000 people any share of the monies that Associates gets from suing machinski so that's fun uh and then you also get the share of this new company Equity you are not getting has no money come on you're not gonna get anything no he cashed out a lot of money oh really he cashed out hundreds of millions okay yeah along with all the other uh apps back yes yeah big clawbacks all right clawbacks I mean I don't know how much that's gonna Translate um okay so there are new managers and investors also that need to be paid so 35 million dollars per year salary to be paid to the management team of this new company so who are these guys the fahrenheit team they will be who will be putting 50 million dollars of their own money to buy the shares of this new company uh their Equity is subjected to a two-year lockup that they can sell up to 30 of their Equity after one year if Celsius Equity trades at 150 of net asset value uh after one year the fahrenheit team has the option to dump on you if Celsius Equity tokens increase in value uh so they can the fahrenheit can sell in one year if uh the value of this new Equity token goes up by 50. what are they going to do what's their business Equity right they're just going to take it reshuffle it try and rebuild it um same thing was going on with FTX 2.0 right now it's like they're also trying to restart that exchange yeah I I'm not I'm not bullish on this Equity um I'd rather get 70 of my money back right now rather than have this I think that you had more than five thousand dollars in Celsius yeah yeah I mean not much more but like yeah yeah so I'm not I don't love this but I don't know the new managers um I mean is there anything like the old managers like come on this doesn't help hey if you if you have enough money to buy a company like this to make a bid in this state in the market you're going to be doing something not terrible but that that's hopeful Fahrenheit all right so we're Fahrenheit outside is that what they're called Freedom Units for yeah Fahrenheit yeah oh my God you're making a joke about the fahrenheit system rather than the metric system exactly I thought that was the token they're called like Freedom Units it wouldn't surprise me all right David well let's move on from Celsius I'm going to leave that in the in the distant past here um I want to talk about where we are today in the crypto market right now and this is a question for the ogs is this crypto winter darker than the last um what inspired this question for me was I saw this tweet from icebergy uh who said every chat I'm in is super depressed about the current state of crypto I don't know what chats this individual is in uh they look like kind of a Dev angel investor focused on crypto nfts in Bitcoin so probably a crypto Trader type but definitely prototype price as closely as as we do so that kind of begged the question to me is this crypto winter darker than the last one and I put out a question to the oh geez I got a bunch of fantastic responses maybe I'll I'll read a couple and then I'll um I'll get your way in so uh Dan McArdle says no not at all in 2011 by the way Dan's been through about all of these in 2011 negative 94 he's talking about I think he's talking about bitcoin price primarily so not full crypto market cap so 2011 was negative 94 was easy to fear it was done for decades crypto was done for decades 2015 we got a negative 87 percent that was the bear Market there 2019 negative 84 percent that was the last one but digital gold had caught on the beatings of D5 were parent 2023 we're only down 78 percent centralized stuff failed oh well every other bear Market was worse so dance take was every other bear Market was worse and he brought some data points objectively rather than 2011 negative 94 2019 negative 84 Bitcoin at least is only negative eight percent uh so that's a take brantley.eath says not even close crypto is an order of magnitude bigger more more developed better funded now and has a far lower chance of total failure at this point DC investor says no because we are not dealing with existential crisis but we got big enough this time where mainstream questions the value prop like the natives last time a lot of responses to this I from what I could tell most of the OG's here's here's Anthony sasana so it's not even close last bear Market people were questioning if crypto would even survive this bear Market there's more genuine actual long-term focused building going on than I've ever seen before most of the ogs are saying no it's not worse uh do you concur what's your take on this question I think there's two sides of this conversation I think almost by definition ogs who have seen two bull markets so that's that's you that's me that's susano that's a number of these people here by definition like it's not as bad for them because a one they've done it before and B they bought in at like 10x lower prices to begin with so for them specifically it's not as bad because they're just in a little bit more of a cushy position I think the first everyone's first bear Market uh feels the same stresses them out in the unique and different and unique ways and it and that is always going to be the same everyone's first bear Market they're going to their conviction is going to be tested uh last bear Market we had certain challenges that we do not have this time and this bear Market we have new challenges that we did not have last time last time ethereum funding was about to go to zero when you were about to like have to pause development to figure that out right we were literally and we legitimately had no use cases on the app there like why why in theorem inspired me in 2017 to 2018 I can't remember it was just like the vision I I guess I was around yeah the hope for that it could be something um Reid did not have the regulatory oversight and like Gary Gensler and chokepoint 2.0 so that is the new challenge and that is what these current people who are going through the spare Market are questioning themselves about not about like what's the utility et cetera et cetera and so yes every single bear Market is is the stress from every single bear market for every single new cycler is always valid and unique and I would also agree that yes these challenges are uh different and perhaps easier but they are still extremely like tough challenges so I'm a little bit on both sides what's kind of interesting is this is sort of almost a bear Market defined by a negative regulatory reaction negative nation state reaction to crypto and that just means we're there like we're at the end of the level this is round one of the boss fight right and like we're fighting the final boss this won't be the only battle I think the final boss will take multiple forms but like that's how far we've actually come and if you had told me in 2019 that the 2023 bear Market would go down to just less than a trillion dollars I'd be like bear Market wait what but yeah but that's that's because you're that's just because of when you got in though it's just like the the where your disposition as a result of the place that you started in the crypto industry I'm just I guess what I'm saying is objectively at one trillion dollars right we got some punch there's something here yes in crypto and that means something but I totally acknowledge that everyone's bear Market probably feels just about the same so if this is your first time it probably feels like the first time comparably to an OG but that's why I do think OG's can kind of take the perspective a little bit they have a valuable perspective in that they can say objectively rather than my own feelings uh objectively is this a harder bear Market than than previous and um they're saying anyway it's uh it's not worse than the last one right the threat of crypto not coming back is completely gone in my mind and that is the big difference David what do we have coming up next coming up next blend blur's new nfe lending platform is putting in numbers we got the world coin race to talk about uscc natively on Arboretum we got some uh Moon pay Executives pocketing 150 million dollars before shuttering the company oof and so much more to talk about but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors especially metamask and metamask learn to learn about all of the crazy crypto jargon that Ryan and I sometimes use without explaining ourselves uh so if we do that sorry but also I'm going to ask Lauren has a product to learn all about that so let's go hear from them right now learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallets Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web3 mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 Network built differently from the other layer twos you may be familiar with mantle is a modular layer 2 built on the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80 compared to other layer twos but it also reduces gas fee volatility mantle has a decentralized sequencer set eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network and because mantle implements multi-party computation nodes layer 1 settlement execute is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two mantle is the first layer two built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest Dow treasuries in the world bit down mantle already has sub communities from around web 3 onboarded to help the growth of mantle like game 7 for web 3 gaming or edu Dao for the world of DSi and buy bit for tvl liquidity and on-ramps check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle blend blurs nft lending platform has put in some absolute numbers loan volumes of 308 million dollars in the past 22 days why 22 because it launched 22 days ago so in addition to the nft trading platform that we all know is blur uh their blend platform is doing something like 20 to 30 percent of the total platform's revenue so azuki's amassed 70 000 ether in loan volume coming from 6500 loans coming in at number one in the preferred nft borrowing uh collection on blend crypto punks coming in at 35 000 eth in loan volume Milady is coming in at 22 and a half thousand so we all knew that nft Phi was a thing but uh blend from blur has just like dropped an absolute cannonball in the world of nft Finance this has just exploded so 82 of the nft lending Market can you just explain what is an nft loan David yeah so you put up your nft as collateral and then you loan some money you take it to the pawn shop basically yep yep and pay you back your your ether your uscc I'm assuming this is all ether and then you get your nft back or you don't and you get liquidated and somebody buys your nft as a it's like a put on the nft wow um so this is could cause some tears if nfts go up again and and somebody you know ponded off and sold the bottom uh effectively uh that's very interesting though it's good to see nft5 taking off tell me about the coinbase wallet David yeah so coinbase wallet has introduced gas free usdc transactions uh on polygon so you can send uscc on polygon using the coin base wallet for free coinbase will cover your gas fees I was wondering what the mechanism behind this and so this is actually using eip3009 which is a account in the account abstraction category so it's using this eip3009 transfer with authorization uh it's a meta transaction which is Again part of the whole account abstraction thing and so coinbase just relays the transaction pays the Matic gas fee and you get free uscc transfers on polygon I think like this is a cool marginal Improvement for a narrow use case which is USC in coinbase wallet all in polygon but I think why this is a big deal is that it extrapolates very very well as soon as EIP 4844 comes dank sharding and gas fees on layer twos come there's going to be a fight for consumers for wallet users for transactors on chain and it's going to come to like I bet you most transactions on chain from retail users end up being free because someone's going to subsidize that because that is a company this with this information I'm a loosely held prediction you most transactions from retail end users are just going to be free on layer twos or free or they might get paid that's a different story that's a different story well this is really interesting because this is a key element of ux Imagine The crypto experience right now imagine if in you were to transfer money uh from somebody in venmo you actually had to have like PayPal stock portion of PayPal stock to pay that fee to transfer like that's a bad ux and so this is working on that problem here uh by the way uh usdc is now natively on arbitrim yep as well actually not yet sorry you gotta wait seven days June 8th it will be natively on arbitrum so it's good news for layer twos as well um David what is going on here Moon pay Executives pocketed 150 million dollar raised from series a of course this is the account uh web3 is going just great from our friend Molly's account of course it would be her hey Molly how you doing what's up Molly um okay so what is the story here what dastardly deed just went on in web 3 again moonpay insiders CEO Ivan Soto Wright and along with others sold a 150 million dollars of their own equity in their series a raise in 2021 so they moonpay raised 555 million dollars at a 3.4 billion dollar valuation uh and then the founders cashed out 150 million dollars of that right before a crypto crash not a good look not great I mean a good look VCS have some responsibility uh in the kind of their documents and you know raises to not let this happen to them and because this if you're an investor this kind of thing does not feel good if you just invested in a company and the founders are already exiting before they've seen it through right um so I guess a little bit like shame on the VCS who also did this too but also shame on like moonpay like it's just bad form to do this yeah if it bleeds it leads type of headline um maybe the VCS were okay with it for some particular reason but man moonpay was inside of one's single bull market as a Founder I would feel bad if I exited inside of the same bull market right like I would do in the next bull market that's actually the social contract after you get the thing done and it's really there and it's really built maybe they could consider it done Paradigm uh one of I think the most prestigious what one of the one of the better VC companies in crypto I would say is broadening its crypto only focus to areas including AI so Paradigm just caught the AI bug that's the uh the story here David are they abandoning crypto is Paradigm done with crypto what's going on uh so they have changed their bio on Twitter they've also changed some of their website so it used to be Paradigm backs disruptive crypto slash web3 companies and protocols and now it's Paradigm as a research driven technology and investment firm um uh the line there's a line We Believe crypto will Define the next few decades was removed from the home page which now makes no mention of web3 or blockchains uh and so uh the they're coming from a source for the block which which wrote an article about this this change doesn't mean the company is trying away from crypto but rather highlighting its reach into adjacent areas such as AI so Paradigm gets the AI bug changes up their website and like why why is this news because people are talking about it on crypto Twitter Paradigm or now grifters they never were committed to crypto in the first place blah blah blah blah uh what's your take on this run uh I don't think so and look VCS are going to go where the opportunities are for VCS so um look if crypto is jealous about that I I don't really understand that take um I guess I I will say that there is an element where a lot of investors though in general like the shine is worn off of crypto like AI is the new hot thing from an investor perspective right right um and I think that there's some opportunity in that because when everyone else like the best time to actually be looking at AI was probably like 2021 you know what I mean like right before um but everyone was focused on crypto yeah I think it's kind of a a no story maybe crypto's feeling a little bitter about uh being forgotten here I think it's right I think it's exactly that Meme of the guy like looking over her shoulder and his girlfriend the crypto girlfriend is like who are you looking at and the paradigm's looking at at AI like again why are we talking about this take well because there's a decent number of people decent number of people on crypto Twitter who are like up in arms about this in my new in my mind this isn't news y'all are just bored like so why are we talking about this we're talking about it because other people were talking about it last week three weeks ago people were canceling Bank lists two weeks ago people were canceling Ledger and now we're just canceling Paradigm because they changed but people are canceling Paradigm movies yeah this is like this is why this is news it's like people are trying to cancel Paradigm it's like yeah and they're like no this is you betrayed us this is Paradigm Paradigm has like a billion dollars in crypto though uh there is news it's layoff season uh binance layoffs they're calling this a pruning of non-performers um and they have laid off apparently 20 of their Workforce I believe that's correct um they had 8 000 employees yeah that's a lot right so 20 down um also just noticed uh this week nanson analytics company a great product they've built they just laid off 30 of their Workforce so the CEO kind of wrote about this and this was his take it's extremely difficult decision we announced a reduction of our team by 30 percent two reasons for this first we scaled up the team on the back of Breakneck growth it's kind of a whiplash crypto was you know expanding so fast you felt like you needed to hire a ton and now you have to take that off um and this year has been brutal for crypto market so I think um crypto startups crypto companies um are taking an opportunity to sort of prune and to scale back right now and that's just the way things are in the in the bear Market um these companies aren't going anywhere I'm very confident of that uh they are just uh taking some time to kind of prune um coinbase did this earlier in the year like um Gemini did this crack and did this companies have laid people off this is just a normal part of the the market cycle like there's there's the layoff phase for every company and really like if you're not if you are optimizing for growth and you are not laying people off in the bear Market you haven't picked the correct optimization Point that's what Brian Armstrong straight told us yes with his policy that last uh Tommy Adam on the podcast like it's always it's sad to see layoffs it's like an unfortunate headline for the company but like if you if you if you are not laying people off then you didn't hire enough in the bull market so this is normal expand contract expand contract that's how things grow here uh speaking of expansion World coin just getting ready to expand mightily I think here Sam Altman and Company raised 115 million dollars for the world coin project what is the significance of this uh well the world coin is is really putting rubber down onto pavement uh and so they are just ramping up everything I feel like they think that they are primed to take the next big steps as a company to scan more people's eyeballs to get more orbs out into the world and actually um go from kind of a monolith to more of a modular company which is part of the whole like every time you say that scan people's eyeballs with an orb it just it can't not sound like dystopian it is sorry it is dystopian the reason why I'm like a comfortable saying those words is because like I have accepted that uh biometric scanning is a valid attempt to produce civil resistance and once you accept that premise you understand that there are and then then it's like okay well what are you going to scan fingerprints um what are you going to scan your face uh well you need to scan something uh and the IRS is the most civil resistant part of your body so if you if you accept these assumptions then you get okay we're gonna have to scan everything but but think of this I get that so technically this may be the right solution but think of this crypto Bros want to go on yes the object the Optics are terrible and that's broken and who is it oh it's it's the maker of chat GPT the most powerful AI on the planet wants to be the orb is this like Chrome ball that like all these World coin employees have a habit of like pulling out of their backpack yeah I mean it there could be um you know all presses good press kind of thing like yeah this is very attention grabby uh in a way I just wonder if it just you know segues itself off a cliff rather than actually uh where because that's my big question right yeah yeah yeah the the actual if you're concerned about how the world coin project is going to work or not you should pay attention to how this um people are trying to game it and that is definitely currently underway right now people are trying to Game World coin because like the idea is is a world coin and part of what they're raising money for is that they make building the orb more permissionless and they also make scanning eyeballs also more permissionless so you have like orb agents God agents uh agents of the orb or agents of the orb who are like not employed by World coin who are incentivized to go scan people's eyeballs because the protocol pays them to do that is like a referral fee I know this is not as soon as you incentivize that to happen well how are you going to get to 8 billion people you have to do this in a permissionless and sense of driven way yeah and so like they you they pay you in World coin to scan people's eyeballs as like a referral fee and so then people are going to be like okay do I need to go scan individuals or can I game the system somehow and so like people are trying to game the world coin uh protocol and sit like civil attack it and if it's Stan if the world coin protocol stands up to those civil attackers who are paid to try to attack the hack the thing and it still works you gotta be bullish on the system I'm sorry I think it's it's purporting to solve a massive problem that that is the uh the upside here is right it's like identity um some kind of an on-chain identity solution um but wow I think it's not great one thing they have to really do is they have to get the Privacy Max list on their side I think they have to get the decentralized decentralization Maximus on their side because they're not going to get the the centralizers on their side you know the nation state level to hate world going I think that one is actually the easiest to account for what which one uh privacy it's pretty easy to not then there they have all of the like here's how we don't collect your data that's all available and like all like generally accepted that people like who I respect in the Privacy Community too right and penally audit this it can't just be World coin being like weird story I would love Zuko's take on world coins yeah a few other you know privacy Maximus we've had on uh Matt from um Hopkins remember we had him on yeah a podcast I would love his take anyway uh interesting a lot of money big war chest here and some major investors coming in including um blockchain Capital a16z Bain Capital Etc so it's definitely a lot of VC Firepower here speaking of which magic just raised 52 million to grow crypto wallet as a service used by corporate clients like Mattel and Macy's yeah these guys have been around for a while uh they used to be called uh Fort Matic wallet if you remember that way back when yeah yeah okay I haven't heard about them very long time but there I remember working with them back back in my last startup as like hey we we need wallets for people who don't give a [ __ ] about crypto very practical very practical approach very similar to coinbase's um NPC Service uh system that they built up yeah so congrats to the magic people you guys have been heads-on building for a very long time very good project David we have coming up next coming up next we got questions from the nation we're going to talk about Lido's dominance we're also going to talk about uh whether or not ethereum is better or worse because it has a respective and Visionary thought leader of italic of course uh takes of the week and what Ryan and I are bullish on uh and then we got a song a day from songa day man and we will get started with all

bankless or click the link in the show notes questions from the nation today of course these are asked in the bankless Discord which is available to all bankless citizens uh here's the question given lydo's dominance and staking share and clear intentions not to self-limit their shares rocket pools now did would it be possible for the ethereum foundation to implement a cap on the maximum share any protocol can control while not ideal would it be possible to implement a protocol upgrade as a last resort to protect the network from majority control blue furball asks this question uh David what do you think so there's two parts of this question that I think are worth pulling out would it be possible for the ethereum foundation to implement a cap and then is that cap even possible at all uh so eips come from many different places um whether or not the the ethereum foundation has deemed it appropriate to actually push and promote an EIP I don't that that eips are discovered more emergently like the ethereum foundation didn't push 4844. um dankrad and Proto Lambda who's now on optimism these people came up with uh for uh dank sharding and then pushed that so like yeah I'll just throw an objection to the idea that the ethereum foundation is I would say they can't I mean you have to get like uh client devs on board as well I mean you guess it can come from EF researchers so if like dankrad and Justin Drake Came to consensus about an EIP then yeah that came from the EF but it really are influential yes and they are in the uh so like semantics here um but the bigger questions like can we Implement a cap and that answer is no we cannot yes because the ethereum beacon chain does not actually know what is an entity and what is a solo Staker it doesn't have information about who is what and so uh that is a subjective thing that is something external to the protocol so it's not actually possible how would you determine Who's got what ether where the ethereum protocol is not aware of that fact uh and so um there's no way to actually enforce decentralization at at the protocol layer that is a that is a that's part of the layer zero so I think um there was actually discussion question this week a lot of discussion on light of this week um you know and some concern about the the chair of the markets over 30 percent I don't know if it's like 33 36 somewhere in that range it's in the 60 no no it's not that high yeah uh you know what he's saying is a proportion of total eth staked of liquid state teaser okay liquid state either yes but total eth staked it's closer to like the low 30s um and that's what protocol like designers are really uh mostly concerned about is the total proportion here and if it gets over one third one third versus two-thirds yeah you know like uh there are different bad things that can possibly happen Danny Ryan wrote a great post about this this week which um you might refer you to as well so there's cost to be concerned but the remedy is on the social layer right I think right now it's basically people saying hey um don't stick with Lido they have too much steak so interestingly enough it's also where the problem arises because Lido is explicitly a monopolistic doubt they have explicitly stated no our goal is to be the staking provider are that we will not self-cap because that's antagonistic to our our our vision for ourselves which is to be the most decentralized taking as a service protocol but don't you think don't you think ethereum needs to be resistant to that so so people often compare it to um prism Prismatic right and they say well you know prism took you know fantastic steps to sort of self-limit their own growth and there was a time where they were like 70 of the beacon chain client right and kind of growing and now they're back down to like what 30 to 40 percent what's different though with prism versus this is there's no profit incentive incentive for prismatic to increase in market share in fact it would only cause more hassle for them I mean I remember we talked to Preston Van Loon after um and uh Terence from Prismatic after the ethereum finality event and they were like thank God there were other clients it's like it puts the burden off of us yeah right Liars does not saying thank God there's rocket pool exactly rocket pool and be like I want your steak to eat okay put it in my Vault so what do we do about this is it a problem what do we do about this my answer for what we do about this is like level up right we have to have some staking um competitors that are competitive with Lido and win the old-fashioned way which is a like a competitive tool set right um that people want to stick with um it's not happened yet which is so maybe that's a bit like hand wavy right um do you have a better answer yeah there's there's plenty of staking as a service Dallas coming on to the scene um so there's competition available the supply of competition coming into the market is that's not a problem many people would like to start and are starting staking as a service orgs some differentiated some not um really the big answer is we need solo stakers so the there was the um uh the rated.network report that came out that there was 6.5 of um validators on ethereum are Solo stickers which sounds like a small number and maybe it is but remember it's 6.5 percent are these like ultimate hardliners who will not compromise the ethereum till I die uh go down with the ship these are these type of people and having you only need a minority of those to make sure the ethereum is protected um you they they're still the concern of like anything above 30 is bad they allito apologists will say well lito is itself is a decentralized org it wants to be decentralized even more than it already is and it's taking steps to be fair it's taking steps yes uh then and then the other like the further lito apologists we'll just point at Rocket pool and say hey that community that the rocket pool just wants is mad at Lido because rocket pool once that's either too because they're in second place because they're in second place right yeah granted the culture around rocket pool is healthier for ethereum so if rocket pool had more and lydo had less I would say that that would be objectively better for ethereum but you also have to be aware of the of the incentives for Rocket pool in that Community everyone wants to take down Lido um ultimately uh is the layer zero that is going to be the thing that protects ethereum uh and so this is why anytime Lido shifts into having too much control you're going to get just like natural pushback from a nebulous set of participants with their own individual incentives um I will say going back to my first point though making solo staking easier is going to always be the best answer yeah there's always the best so much work to do with making and that's really what the EF should be doing is making guise for solo stickers so like if you have to as a solo Saker touch the command line that's bad and we should not have that and we should fix that and that's going to be a much better solution I I think so too I think so too but the layers here is trying all sorts of things including shame right shame being so monopolistic wait shaming light up but also shaming people who stick with lighter and that's awesome yeah that is a stick that zero can use I just right we gotta have better stick we yeah I have better carrots and sticks than that do you own any steak teeth at bakeless or do we only own our eth we don't have any our eth but we run are you talking about lightest we don't own it at bankless but we do run we do run rocket pool mini pools yes um oh are you trying a virtue signal yes David just slip that in there it's just very interesting we're doing we're doing our part all right uh here's a question from uh canis Cain ass here's a question from Kane nass what effect do you think it has on the evolution of specific of a specific chain the fact that ethereum has a clear respected and Visionary thought leader vitalik of course compared to bitcoin that has none really what do you think about that so Satoshi did the white paper thing right it's there for a little bit he participated on various internet forms and then disappeared right uh vitalik he founded this thing created the white paper uh has not disappeared has been active in shepherding this I I think in a decentralized leader type of way so it's very different from the model of a CEO but still he has not abandoned the project he's been working on it even though most of the other ethereum co-founders did sort of abandoned earlier days quickly yeah and I didn't honestly know what vitalik would do whether he would kind of stick with it or whether he'd do the Satoshi thing anyway the question is what effect do you think this has had on ethereum I am grateful that vitalik uh is the leader that he is the the bitcoiners will point to vitalik and be like look how centralized ethereum is whatever fritalik says goes um to some degree like whatever vitalik says goes isn't wrong but it's not in the way that they're saying it is they're saying like yeah like vitalik is this dictator of ethereum it's like his way or the highway the only things that vitalik feels strongly about are like the right things to feel strongly he's just right he's like the Right leader uh and I say that as uh as somebody who's like you follow vitalik more like you might follow like uh Gandhi for instance it's not like top down it's the bitcoiners are gonna love that one you know what I mean but seriously though there's an element of like there's spiritual leadership here no right and he's his track record is proven now as somebody who spent the last two months with vitalik and suzalu and Montenegro I can tell you he's doing many other things that are not ethereum and so he is a leader of of across Industries across uh Technologies uh and so like ethereum is not the guy is his full-time job the guy's a guy like he's not the leader of ethereum he's vitalik also he has philosophical directions for about how ethereum should be developed and stuff but yeah he's doing he's living a life and some of it happens to be concerned about ethereum and other things he's concerned about like Network States and Longevity and public goods so uh I mean the question of has this had an effect on ethereum undoubtedly so in fact I would I would say ethereum would not be where it is if the leader kind of um abandoned it not abandoned it but just um when you know M.I.A after the white paper or after ethereum 1.0 right it really needed some shepherding leadership and I'm kind of reminded you know I'm a sucker for like founding you know America type of things right founding fathers after they wrote the Constitution they didn't just like yeed out of there right right I mean they were still um even Washington won the Revolutionary War served as president for a period of time um the country kind of needed that there were a lot of questions that the original Constitution didn't solve and so you needed a Bill of Rights and you needed to Hash things out in like the Federalist Papers and all of these things if the if the founders of the United States just left after the first white paper of America was shipped uh this would have been a complete mess it took some time to sort all these things out and I think the same is happening with ethereum it's more complicated than Bitcoin too yeah right Bitcoin had the luxury of being simple enough where the founder could just leave and it'd be okay ethereum was not that and is not that and needed that guidance from the people who are philosophically and ideologically aligned I still think I still think Bitcoin I need to do well that's a different story The the best leadership that I see vitalik doing and the the that I know actually works is when he writes articles titled legitimacy on his blog post and that that article becomes cited in startups reasons for existing I've seen the vitalik legitimacy post cited in like decks more than most uh other like articles that I've read uh yeah and and that's just leading leading in this very like passive like low touch way that still steers an entire ecosystem yeah yeah I don't know if you answered the question but I think it gave we had gave the content that the analytic questions yes vitalik uh was necessary yes it massively influenced ethereum no it wouldn't have forgotten here without a vitalik or someone like him and I do think he is actually a fairly unique uh type of leader in history a lot of leaders kind of grab power and they tend to keep it and he's done the other direction vitalik is much less necessary for ethereum to succeed today than he was five years ago in fact I think at this point if italic left ethereum would be totally totally fine that would have been true a number of years ago whenever the last few times I've introduced vitalik on the podcast I've introduced him as vitalik the guy with that holds the record for the most ignored EIP proposed VIPs and it's true cips are ignored huh that's interesting I like we should delve into the ignored ones maybe there's some good ideas that is some Niche Contents I don't know I would not understand it all right let's get to some takes of the week we got one a big one from Kobe so Kobe on opportunity how do you win during the bear Market David what do you do this is the the season that we're in we've called it kind of the apathy Market Kobe had some advice and I think he said this uh sometime in maybe yeah at the peak yeah so when everyone was drunk and look at the spot these podcast participants do you recognize some of these faces here uh van Spencer suzu uh I don't know who the others are okay like some simple Market uh content people anyways this is pre pre this is yeah it's pretty the three hours Capital demise let's play the play the clip do you think the majority of people that don't make it are the people that lose interest between bull markets like people that have known about it from from so far back who still haven't made it it's because they as soon as it gets frothy it gets the bull market they they re-buy the all-time high breakout so they re-bought at like 20K and they play the bull market they like they're a little bit naturally bearish and the bear Market hits and they stay interested for about a year and then towards the tail end like late 2018 2019 they just naturally lose interest and they go oh this this shit's over I've got live commitments whatever and then they get back involved when it starts getting Frosty again and those are the people that are not going to make it so if you if there is one piece of advice that I can give is like find a way to remain the same level of interest that you have now when you check the chart every day you like lose sleep over your positions whatever the [ __ ] you're doing you over leveraged Apes like you need to have the same level of interest when everything's really boring because right now it's like everyone's interested right like my uh my like parents are like super and like what should I buy my friends from school way back when hitting me up saying is cardano good and whatever but up none of those people are interested in the in the bottom none of those people are interested when it's going sideways for six months and if you tell those people at the bottom in the six months sideways Now's the Time they [ __ ] ignore you they're like nah it seems a bit risky like it's not for me I'll look at it later and then they hit you up in January of this you're like is it too late to get in by the way and you're like no just immediately Market by it's like 25k or something it's 30k and they're like I'm gonna wait for a dip and at 60k they're like is it too late to Market by like you said you're like bro I have no advice for you anymore I told you it's 4K to buy I told you like six games I told you at 7K to buy so the way the main way you have to make it is try and perpetuate your interest through the boring bit the boring bit is where the opportunity is when all these Moon boys and all the marketers and all the lappers they disappear from Twitter and they don't they don't participate anymore their accounts just stop tweeting that's the bit where you're supposed to be interested and you're supposed to be taking your like next three years of positions um most people that don't make it they just they stick around for the fun bit that's it stick around for the boring bit there it is David so try to maintain your interest during the boring bit this is the boring bit let me ask you uh how do you maintain your interest and how have you done it in previous bore markets yeah the in 2019 was the last bore Market that we had is when I was felt like I was taking crazy pills man because like unit swap got invented dye was growing like crazy compound was being utilized and no one was talking about it and the the advice that I have is like there is going to be similarly exciting uh innovations that our grants are going to be more complex because we're a one more cycle more mature but there's gonna be things that excite you that you're looking around and you're no one else is getting excited and you're like why the F not now if you're good at this game if you're a good investor if you're good at playing the crypto crypto world you will understand and if you've identified it correctly you'll understand that that's Alpha and you're not taking crazy pills I felt like I was taking crazy for a whole entire year if not longer but that this is where you have to understand like no you're the smart one you are paying attention when other people are not uh and the looking for Alpha is actually easier so long as you understand that like yes people aren't going to be excited about this thing for maybe a frustratingly long amount of time but so long as you see the vision and you have identified opportunity uh that this this is the year to do it and we were talking about like the bore Market incoming at the at the end of 2022. it's like first we had the we're punched in the face bear market and now we're having the bull market and here we are we've arrived and so now it's a matter of like hey this is where you actually make millions of dollars next bull market if you identify the opportunities you have to in order to do this though okay so I think Kobe's advice is so Salient around um do whatever it takes to stay interested right okay so realize that during the um bull market your brain was actually rewired for dopamine hits every time you checked Price Right on your phone your app and the price went up boom dopamine hit where is it going to go next right oh it's down a little bit but boom bit big increase again and you're looking at your net worth and you're like wow this is amazing isn't great so every time I refresh it goes up you got hooked on the dopamine so you consumed all this crypto content now that dopamine is all gone all right so you have to get your hit like your brain wants chemical hits from something and you have to get it from something else all right where you can get it at least uh for me it's been doing stuff building something learning about something trying a new D5 protocol trying a new wallet like learning about uh ZK machine learning or some sort of obscure uh you know um obscure topic and then maybe making content about it um if you're if you have Dev skills you obviously you build something right if you don't have Dev skills if you have other kind of softer skills then you're writing your your um your you know researching you're doing all sorts of things to keep yourself busy and you have to get the chemical hit that way instead um so you have to really rewire your brain and I think if you stay here and if you can maintain your interest then as David you just said like there's benefit on the other side of that but you have to sort of trick your brain into it because you've been addicted to the dopamine price hits that's no longer present anymore you got to get it from somewhere else you know you know what's a great source of dopamine Ryan what's that is when all of the things that you thought were true come true and turns into a million dollars because you stuck it out through the bear Market that's a nice source of dopamine yeah but it's not instant is it it takes some time and uh it first takes the crazy pill section you have to feel like you're taking crazy pills and that's how you know you're on to something that's where we are um all right what else we got another take of the week what's this is yours uh yeah this is this is me uh so uh here's my take that's actually not a take is a question do you all think that I can get Ryan to sign up for another weekly show and so here's my idea for the show 35 minutes long on Wednesdays five minutes for the intro uh and then we talk about what we're gonna talk about and then 15 minutes I teach you about something and then another 15 minutes you teach me about something that's like anything it's just not crypto just you come and you teach me something that the listeners would enjoy if it were to be about crypto because we did just talk about figuring out ways to say interested in crypto during the bull market but there is no requirement that it is about crypto yes correct are you trying to get like is this a a sideway to get the uh the food podcast in here you're gonna come with like a nutrition lesson hey World War II podcast I don't know oh my God it could be anything uh yeah I mean look it's the hardest thing for me is just finding time to deal with acquaint David as you know because we carve out the time and anyone else who needs a meeting in that time can F off really so we just carve out dedicated time every week stop doing other meetings I don't know I mean one question I would have for the bankless nation is would they be interested in this uh for me one thing that that gives me the dopamine hits is um when we get feedback from these shows people are actually interested when uh we get like viewers on our shows and when I like hear feedback that hey like great episode you know product Market fit product Market fit that's the kind of thing so a signal for this would be if we heard from makeless listeners that this kind of show format was interesting maybe they get too much content from us already David I don't know man don't we do like three to four podcasts a week every single freaking week and we're talking about adding another one here I remember when uh let's see it was the weekly roll-up which was the third show that we layered on first we did the Monday podcast and they were like then I was like Ryan we need to do a weekly like new show to cover this event that's happening so we layered on the state of the nation and then it was like Ryan we're only covering one Weekly News thing we need to recover the entire weekend news let's do the weekly roll up but that was like two years ago we've been doing these three podcasts for like two years I think it's time for another podcast and I think uh if you pull up this tweet that I just sent you in Zoom eat wave put it nicely David learns something Ryan learned something and I learned two things sounds like a good deal to me there you go well I want to hear what the bankless nation thinks let me email that over David I can't uh I can't give you an answer no I can't come in on the spot you know I'm I'm uh I'm naturally breaks anyway but I will say to your credit I did think that the podcast was a bad idea in the beginning I did also think that adding the weekly roll-up was a bad idea and uh weekly roll-up has become like the Cornerstone of this podcast that's my favorite it's I enjoy it like this this gives me energy sometimes it's hard to kind of get your head around all the topics but I enjoy these little chats we have so um I don't want to Discount this tell me what you're bullish on this week though my friend so I know we just came out of uh Hey how do you maintain uh interest during the Bohr Market my strategy is to invest time and energy into something completely different so that when you do have time for crypto you make it in very intentional and you go very deep rather than just getting like scrolling through crypto Twitter you don't even talk about the meme coins if you don't want to that kind of that's exactly you're free to ignore what you consider noise and just tap into intentional stuff anyways uh so I'm bullish on climbing mountains what actually completely unrelated actual amounts actually not outside so uh in one month's time uh you will be doing two weekly Roll-Ups with Anthony cesano oh my God I will be in the middle of uh uh Mountains in Washington Mount Rainier and Mount Baker and then at the end of ECC I've signed up to climb the Matterhorn which by the way is verifiably insane thing to do to sign up to climb the Matterhorn while having done zero mountains before which is why I have to like two others insane also dangerous question mark uh on the risk Spectrum yes I would say yeah everything's on the risk Spectrum how far on the wrist spectrum is this um Everest so Everest is 26 000 feet the Matterhorn is 15 000 feet just judging a mountain by feet you can't eat that very imprecise picture uh I mean look at people look at look at how [ __ ] seat that thing is dude I mean are you sure you see the ridge that is on the on the right side I don't want to do this podcast solo David yeah I know well not only is it uh your co-host but it's also uh a very integral member of the bankless team as well so it's two of us so hey you know if we both go down like yeah you might as well it's full oh my god wow this is this is great this is great news I'm just saying for you so so um what kind of training goes into this I've been going to the gym twice a day for the past week or so ever since I got back from uh uh just start now starting that training uh well I was I was running around in Montenegro now I have 50 pounds on my backpack on a stair stepper which let me tell you is extremely boring my God though makes crypto very interesting you can listen to some podcasts that's exactly what I did yeah wow well um this looks crazy uh I would never attempt something um like this and I'm also proud of you uh but also hold on be careful of me I haven't done it yet okay but just even been trying to attempt this is crazy um well we'll see if I can actually get halfway up the mountain but that's that's what I'm very very excited about all right I don't know how to get exposure to mountains but if I could I would no Boar market for David he's going to climb the mountain the Matterhorn yeah that's incredible man where do you [ __ ] around it's nothing nearly as exciting it's something about crypto is that okay no wait what it's uh restaking uh so we did this episode with uh sriram who is kind of the father of free staking um he's the founder of this protocol called eigenlayer we've recorded that earlier this week it comes out on Monday um got me really excited about restaking at least excited um probably 80 excited 20 concerned yeah which is which is always the most interesting type of podcast and I feel like restaking will either hit product Market fit and it'll be absolutely massive or it won't right but if it does it'll be a really big deal so this to me restaking is potentially as big as layer twos were for scaling decentralization okay and it's as big as Mev was in terms of the challenges presented to the protocol and protocol research it really changes the incentive game and to me it's as big as maybe the merge or something like it for the value of eat the asset so you combine all of these things and man restaking is like this massive rabbit hole that I feel like will be journeying on not just now but in the years to come that again is if it hits if it achieves product Market fit and I think there's more than a fair chance it will so this is something I think that you want to know learn about ethereum and you want to know about crypto this is probably the the newest Frontier right to go explore so I anticipate this first episode will be one of many that we actually do on restaking in fact we're talking about doing a panel with um sriram and some of the protocol researchers as well and you know know and talking about this further so I'm bullish on it but like scared bullish on mistaken is what I would say maybe the same way you're bullish about climbing the Matterhorn at least I hope you're a little like cautiously you're scared you're not you're doing something wrong yeah exactly I feel the same except from the comfort of my home the scariness can say inside of the computer yeah the the investable surface area around recycling is significant I mean it's been it's as large as Layer Two like you said it's gonna change the game gonna change the game I think um thank you for thank you for making the section about crypto yeah yeah you're welcome uh meme of the week we have no meme of the week but we do have something special for you guys uh and this is um a Moment of Zen song so um full disclosure ahead a lot of language in the next song here that you're about to hear I think it's worth it because uh it's it like it's exactly how I feel like we've got to stop sending our money to randos on the internet who are just going to scam us um I feel justified in playing this song this is a song by song Dayman that we're about to hear so let's let's play that um I'm gonna get to wrists and disclaimers and then stick around for that of course gotta let you know none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] [Music] [ __ ] money [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what the [ __ ] what the
