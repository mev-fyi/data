[Music] all right everyone welcome to the weekly roll up this is the last week of february the fourth week of february david what do we do on these weekly rollups we roll up the full week of crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor first we start with the markets what are the markets saying then we go into releases what got released in the last week of crypto then we go into the news what happened in the news cycle then we get into some ecosystem takes who had some interesting opinions over the last week and then lastly we get into what david and ryan are excited about and then we top things off with the meme of the week i like how you fit that in david are you ready to start let's get going with markets you ready absolutely so again so much happened in marcus let's get into it all right let's roll them up markets let's start with bitcoin what is going on with bitcoin it was up and now it's down what's happening bitcoin topped out at 58 and 300 and now it is at the low low price of 49 hundred dollars uh i feel like this is our biggest correction in the crypto markets this entire quote unquote bull run ever since like at the end of defy summer right so d5 summer ha ha happened and then that was a pretty big correction we had like a quote-unquote like two-month bear market uh this most mostly a facetious joke um but that was like kind of the last time we ever had any big correction and ever since then it's been basically this linear up and to the right trend and but finally we got this big correction both in in bitcoin and in ether prices but the trend is still your friend the trend is still here we're still looking good over the long term david uh we've been told to respect the pump i think we've got to respect the dip my friends sometimes these dips happen this is perfectly normal during a bull market you're going to see 30 you're going to see 40 dips sometimes a little bit higher in previous bull markets that happened three or four times before the end of it this does not necessarily mark the end of the bull market and i'm still bullish over 2k as well uh this week but now it's back down where where did we go and where are we now yeah ethan broke 2k and it hit 20 2040 so just got a little bit over 2k decided it wasn't really it's it's the right it wasn't it wasn't the right time you know we're saving it for later we're back down to 1572 dollars almost five hundred dollars off of the east top which again it's a it's a big correction legacy market participants don't understand like the these magnitudes of these moves but in crypto this is just a normal correction this is just how it goes david i'm just glad we got a chance to celebrate eve 2k my friend like you know that felt good just hitting that milestone even though we're under now i'm confident that we'll get back there again uh what happened to total locked value in d5 that's down a bit too yeah we we peaked out at 43 billion dollars locked in d5 the last weekly roll up we've reported it at 42 and today we are at 37 and a half billion dollars locked in in d5 uh it actually takes a a little bit more of effort and energy to figure out like well what is just asset price appreciation versus depreciation when it comes to locked in defy or what is actually like deposits and and or withdrawals from the ecosystem so there's a little bit of noise here in this metric but still like 37.5 billion dollars still a large number just a little bit you know shaved off the top next big milestone seems to be 50 billion we'll see how long it takes us to get there uh let's talk about dpi so this is the the d5 pulse index tracking the top 10 d5 tokens you know what's interesting about this if i look on the weekly view david um it's about flat so it didn't take quite the hit that ether it it definitely went up with eth but it didn't take uh quite the hit at least from indications where are we hanging out right now yeah we are just below 400. 390 dollars for one dpi yeah and let's let's take a look at the uh dpi eth ratio to see sort of that effect so um it's up a little bit from last week right this is definitely where you can see the strength that dpi and d5 at large had against ether uh the last uh last weekly roll-up it was also the first major correction of dpi versus ether but now we are back up to the week before that right and so dpi out once again outperforming ether do you know i have a reason for this so it's always it's always a mistake it's often a mistake i would say to attribute kind of like the noise of of markets to specific fundamental reasons but i think this might be due to the binance chain narrative david so uh binance chain has been gaming gaining some steam and volume and usage some real some not so real uh but that aside has been gaining some some usage while ether ethereum fees gas fees have been going kind of off the charts and i think the d5 token index move up while eth price move down or at least this ratio moving up a bit might be as a result of that might be as a result of people seeing that narrative or hearing that narrative and being a bit less bullish eth relative to d5 tokens do you think i'm jumping the gun on that take or do you think that's a a live narrative that is affecting these prices uh over the last week yeah yeah we definitely saw the binance chain bnb token absolutely skyrocketed last week to a a i think yeah it became number three in market cap behind bitcoin and ether this binance chain next i think it even passed tether uh which is pretty crazy so uh binance chain definitely riding in the same tailwinds that ether is riding in and uh if you are bullish finance train you would might even say that uh binance bnb token kind of took the wind out of the ether sales um i'm skeptical as to how long that lasts but you know by the last week was definitely a win for finance trained believers and bnb holders yeah are you a finance chain believer david i don't know not at all not at all okay why why i don't cz doesn't pay my salary he doesn't pay my paycheck why would i believe in his product no i believe in protocols i think we'll have time to get into that hopefully during the take section i'm sure uh one of us has some hot takes on that um let's go to the next though on the market side of things while this happens again anytime there's buys or anytime there's sales so you know in a uh in a bull run or in a bear run um with with these market moves dexes tend to do well or at least exchanges tend to do well and lately decentralized exchanges have been just crushing it in terms of volume they had their biggest day ever over over 4 billion in daily dex volume now i mean these numbers would have blown our minds back in 2017 and now we're hitting them on the regular and they feel like they're only going to go up during this full cycle what do you think about this yeah so volume is goes hand in hand with volatility right and so when there are big moves and especially big moves down because big downward moves tend to happen much faster than upward moves and so there's a lot of volume that's compressed into a short amount of time and i think that blow off top from uh twenty two thousand dollars down to even the low low price of fourteen hundred dollars where ether was that's a big move and that means that there's going to be a lot of on-chain liquidations there's gonna be a lot of people uh selling off their positions there's gonna be a lot of people taking positions there's just overall going to be a lot of volume and we're seeing that we're seeing that in d5 we're seeing that with dexes uh just all-time highs with dex volume uh on the upside and on the downside this is just how volume works last i checked dex volume was like something like you know five to seven percent or so of centralized exchange volume um i'm looking for that ratio to go up i'm looking for decentralized exchange volume to start consuming more and more of the centralized exchange traffic and we'll see how that uh turns out david this is a really like we refer to d5 pulse all the time that's d5pulse.com they just came out with a crypto dollars chart which i think is super cool this is all time david so dude look at this it's like it's like climbing everest we got a mountain of crypto dollars being printed each of these crypto dollars generally is backed by some collateral so this is not fractional reserve banking which is which is interesting right each of these crypto dollars actually represents a dollar of value in collateral or a dollar in the bank but we're at over 35 billion now in terms of crypto dollars that are active and live on ethereum and i think this probably includes maybe some that are on um or is this just a theorem i'm actually not sure david do you know uh yeah i believe this is just aetherium yeah i don't think there's a single other chain that they have listed here um the interesting thing about this this metric and you can see a similar chart with a btc on ethereum uh charts tend to go up and down but not these charts this chart is only up which really is really indicative of crypto dollars when deployed to ethereum don't leave they only stay and and bitcoin when it's deployed to ethereum doesn't uh it leaves a little bit more than crypto dollars but generally it stays there right and so this is one of the fundamental theses that we have about ethereum as like the nexus of of internet economic activity as the global permissionless settlement layer once assets come to ethereum they don't leave because they're more useful on ethereum and so like we see corrections in crypto prices we see corrections in other realms but with crypto dollars up and to the right never ever down yeah i think like just i guess ask yourself um if if you have a sell plan david right i'm sure you have some sort of cell plan um you know i'm sure like like most of us on the bank listen you're not going to sell all of your crypto assets but you might sell some uh when the market heats up too much during this this bull cycle uh aside from money you need to pay bills rents living expenses that kind of thing like when you sell are you gonna bring your money back into your wells fargo account or what are you gonna do with it why would i do that like my wells fargo account that's their account that they let me use i would rather use my own account on ethereum i was having this interesting conversation in the uh our eth finance uh uh uh subreddit shout out to all the our our eth finance bros underappreciated subreddit out there um and i was i was saying like you know when i when i do myself which i do plan on doing at towards the end of this uh towards the end of the cycle i plan on holding crypto dollars in my my ethe wallet just because that's my account like self-sovereignty self-custody uh what's also interesting is i also added into this conversation and this is kind of where the conversation led is i actually also plan on having a decent number of my crypto dollars that i will sell into not inside of smart contracts right so not only am i selling into dollars which are stable and and you know while we on the dollar at the end of the day it is the dollar can't really hate on it but i'm also going to keep it out of contracts or at least make sure that when i do put them into contracts they are insured because one parts i want to lock in my profits but then i also want to reduce risk and right and so buying into the dollars having a position in dollars is a reduction of risk position but if i put those dollars into contracts um then i'm taking more risk right and so i actually plan on selling into dollars and also keeping them out of contracts just be able to hold for the long term yeah i totally agree i've the same plan right so i my money is not going to touch my traditional bank account wells fargo account where i'm earning like point zero one percent almost near zero zero just call it zero percent when there's uh crypto dollar stable coin interest earning opportunities like spanning from three to five to ten percent right and some of these are relatively low risk some of them are more risky than others so um it it's exactly what you said david the money once it goes into crypto it's like a black hole it ain't coming out even if you're selling reserve assets because they're overheated like bitcoin or eth on the cycle they're staying in crypto dollars all right before you move on ryan i really like that metric on the left that they have is custodial dominance oh yeah so i was gonna say it's a really cool metric all right so what does this mean what does custodial dominance mean yeah it means uh what percentage of crypto dollars are uh trusted right um usdc tether what has like a a custodian managing a dollar in the real world right so this wouldn't include dye and so that's going to be an interesting metric to watch over time and it's at 93 which is a little bit sad it's a little bit sad face like the trustless dollars have not um have not succeeded against traditional crypto dollars yet so yeah but they have such strong tailwinds because there's so many dollars out there and there's much they're easier to get out the gate there's less risk with them they don't have to worry about solidity and code they can just put dollars in a bank account and then make this claim that say hey we'll give you one of these if you give us a crypto dollar blah blah blah i totally agree and guys if you want to check out crypto dollars what they are in more long form content check out our jeremy alaire conversation that was a few podcasts ago just look that one up okay this is probably the biggest news we're going to touch on in the news but but let me just touch on the market piece so here's the thing coinbase just dropped their s1 report this is sort of the filing with the sec that's public that they need to drop um before they they ipo before they go public we'll get into that in a second because that's in the news section but i just wanted to highlight this stat that came from it david which is probably the most bullish thing i've seen this this month maybe uh maybe this year so that's you know this week anyway i'll get that at least this weekend for now um and that's uh the coinbase's volume okay and they segmented it in their s1 report there's a fantastic graph here that that shows you um what it looks like and the bottom line is right now in q4 2020 coinbase estimated that 36 of their volume was from retail so only 36 from retail that means the rest is more from kind of institutions that was totally different during the last full run in q1 of 2018 the last bull cycle it was 80 retail okay now it's 36 retail before it was 80 retail you can interpret this a few different ways one interpretation is oh my god we're already here and retail hasn't even come yet that's one interpretation what do you make of this david yeah the i'm reminded of in 2017 2018 like the memes that were going around to like convince people to not sell was like quote unquote the institutions are coming yeah and back in 2017-2018 we were right they were coming just three years later right much further down the line but now the institutions are here right like this is clearly indicative of bigger well-capitalized entities coming and just dominating uh exchange volume over retail yeah i think retail beat institutions the first bull run it feels like institutions would be retail a little bit this bull run at least for some of these assets maybe not for d5 type assets but it also feels like we've got a lot a lot of way to run from retail like coming into this space i'm sure we'll see some sort of retail friendly uh frenzy before this is all over david you ready to get into the releases yes we absolutely let's get into releases but first we're gonna take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith d5 visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of d5 so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today alright guys we are back getting to the releases on this last week of february roll up david we got to start here optimism tell us what optimism is and what they're doing and why this is a big deal yeah optimism is uh favorable beliefs about the future right that's what it means to be optimistic but optimism is also a scaling platform on ethereum using some sort of uh uh we call them optimistic roll-ups right and where you settle optimistically uh and there's some nuances behind that but this post is about and and the the point is that is that everyone is really really bullish on the optimistic roll-ups and how they're how they are constructed and everyone is optimistic about optimistic rollups and what what makes me optimistic about optimism is the um crazy team that they are putting together so they just put out this blog post called dope hires and more mainnet in march uh so they go through just a number of just really strong players that they hired on to the optimistic team and i also loved the way that this article was written um you you know you can feel the ethos just exude out of the optimistic team the optimism exuding out of the optimistic team uh it's a really strong players here and really what this means is that optimism has really done a is really ready to take it to the next level right and really get this thing out the gate uh business developers are on the team more coders and more more integration specialists uh a lot of really cool things i'm optimistic about optimism i could tell david all right so like the big takeaway from this apart from their um their new hires is that they are launching on mainnet in march now originally they were planning to launch on mainnet and march in sort of a limited way with just a few pilot projects now it looks like they're going to launch like generally be open to everyone and what rollups if you've been tuning into bankless so far what rollups allow you to do is essentially copy all of the d5 protocols we know and love on another chain so these are fully uh ethereum virtual machine compatible so if if uniswap was to join this synthetics is already on it if you swap was to join this if if yfi was to join this if if curve was to join this we'd create a whole another roll-up chain with all of our d5 protocols basically like a d5 roll-up chain so this is uh very timely given gas fees very timely given that the narratives in the space and i think is absolutely going to be a massive launch event and then story going into 2021 as all of these d5 money protocols kind of pick their their various scaling solution i think optimism is poised very well here david they also announced uh some additional investing we had chris dixon on the podcast not too long ago and chris dixon and his firm um andreessen horowitz so he he sort of runs the the crypto investing uh area at address and horowitz they are investing they just announced that they are investing in the optimism team too how much money are we talking about here um wow part of a 25 million series a investment in optimism so definitely some runway for that team and uh super excited about what's going to happen next yeah yeah the i and i think the other vc fund that doubled down already had a share of optimism was paradigm and they bought more um so paradigm doubling down on their bags smart move all right we also have layer two coming from one of my favorite exchanges decentralized exchanges dydx now they're doing this with not optimistic roll ups but z cave roll ups but the net effect is is similar in that they're going to be able to scale dydx to new levels without using ethereum mainnet block space but it will be just as secure as the ethereum maynet david any takes on this news yeah i think this is going to be a theme in coming rollups is a project x d5 protocol y scales goes on to l2 optimistic roll ups or zk roll ups or something uh so i'm get used to it i guess is my takeaway dydx one of the first uh i expect here's a prediction for you ryan i'm just making this up right now at least three projects will uh be on next week's weekly rollups on some sort of l2 wow okay we'll see we'll i'll i'll try to remember that david you know one other thing i think that's important to realize is that there are different dimensions to scaling transactions per second is is certainly one of them but another one is how do we scale oracle's in our conversation this week with hart from the uma protocol really impressed that economy david it's like so oracles of course are useful for everything in ethereum that requires a price and synthetic assets all require a price so the scalability of oracles is really essential for kind of the different assets and and money primitives that we can create on ethereum well chain link has been one of the predominant oracle type solutions one challenge with chain link is it cost a whole lot in terms of of gas uh these are validators on chain link that are paying this gas but it costs them a lot in block space in gas and fees to push these prices on chain well chain link just released a new upgrade that is going to drastically reduce the cost 10 times more efficient to put um pricing on chain than it previously was this is another dimension of scalability that we like i think is under reported david but like is just as important to what we're trying to do in d5 right there's there's two ways to scale there's we can produce more block space and we can do that with zk roll ups and other l2s l2s is generally pla building out new places to have block space uh and then they bundle that up and then put that on the main chain that's one way to scale the other way to scale is to just simply optimize and be more efficient with what we put onto the chain right and so uh make or doubt when they run their oracles specifically maker dow's oracles cost twenty to thirty thousand 000 a day in gas alone just to put prices on the chain so that the app can can operate uh there are optimizations that we could be doing here and one of the strategies that maker dow is doing and is exactly the same kind of pattern that train link is doing here is they do a lot of their computation off chain in a trustless manner in a cryptographic manner and then they only publish the bare minimum on chain right and so simply just doing less on the l1 and optimizing what you do with the l1 block space is going to be huge especially for oracle's right um oracle optimization is really really important and there's other like vectors as well aside from oracle's like chain uh coinbase uses like 20 to 30 percent of ethereum block space simply because they're not well optimized uh and so block space will become more available when when heavy computation teams like chain link maker down coinbase etc figure out how to optimize and and put more of that computation on on not on the l1 yeah david i think every team is working for up to toward optimization we were talking to the nifty gateway um co-founders uh they they said in their next release they're going to reduce the minting cost of an nft on chain by 99 so this is uh it's awesome to see this sort of innova innovation and efficiency that these teams are bringing due in part to high gas prices david talk about this one so ave and balancer are partnering in some way what are they doing here so if you guys are listening to this weekly roll up on friday morning when when this comes out we are doing a live stream with uh stani from ave and fernando of balancer moderated by dan elliser so something pretty unique on the bankless youtube where it's going to be live streaming at 12 12 pacific time definitely tune in to that if you want to learn more about this but basically what ave is doing it's using balancer as its back end as its asset management platform to produce yield for its deposited assets right so balancer is kind of like uniswap but instead of two tokens it's many tokens and so the uh balancer and ave are working together to make a balancer pool to generate liquidity for assets that are in ave but also generate yields and so it'll actually be more lucrative to deposit assets into ave because they're using balancer in their back end for liquidity and for yield pretty pretty uh pretty cool so tune in to live stream if you want to learn more yeah the way i understood this is if you are a liquidity provider in a balance or pool right you're not necessarily earning interest on those assets that are inside of the pool and what this is going to do is essentially allow a portion of those assets inside of the pool to be earning interest in the ave protocol so super cool to see this kind of collaboration coming out david this is also awesome we've been tracking this for a while we've got all of these great nfts but how do you how do you display them this is zapper coming out with a user interface uh enhancement zapper is is just a fantastic tool along with zurion to see kind of your crypto assets your crypto portfolio and now zapper is extending that to nfts so you could you could see your super rare art that you purchased your nft art inside of the zapper platform inside of that wallet david what's your take here yeah there's so much to unpack here right so we got to start off with the conversation that nfts are status tools right so crypto dollars ether bitcoin these are wealth tools nfts are status tools like the mona lisa is a status thing whoever owns the mona lisa it's a big deal right art is a status thing it's a way to signal status and one of the problems that nfts has is that typically if you buy an nft you can only view it on the one pla the issuing platform right so if you bought it on wearable you got to go to railboo if you bought it on nifty gateway you got to go to nifty gateway there are aggregators like openc that are helping with this but this is exactly the same type of innovation that we're seeing out of zapper where you can see your assets see the actual visual visual representations of your nfts displayed here along with the market value right and so not only can you include the value in your portfolio you can actually make it display right and so i kind of expect some sort of specialization when it comes to people's crypto wallets that you know maybe they hold their funds in one wallet but their art in another wallet so that they can flash their art right like show people what i what i own like all the nft all the cool nfts that i bought without having to dox all their funds um i think innovation like that is definitely coming and it's really cool to see zapper being able to innovate on like both both the value of nft size and the display of nft sides because what are nfts if they don't have a visual display of the art yeah i can't wait to see all the the social signaling type wallets that that come out of uh come out of crypto given that the nft the nft bull market here uh david let's talk about this alchemix is releasing something uh can you tell us what alchemix is yeah alchemyx is a new d5 money lego right uh attempting to be relatively governance minimized return uh attempting to be protocolized um but the way that this works is that you deposit your crypto dollars right now it starts starting off with dye and then those die the dye gets deposited into urine to generate yield and then alchemix will mint you al usd or or a al uh stable coin so you deposit stable coins and then you borrow stable coins but the thing is is that you don't actually if you are patient you don't actually have to pay back your debt uh so typically with d5 protocols when you borrow you have to pay an interest rate uh but because alchemix has yearn in the background yearn the interest that you get from depositing to yearn automatically pays back the debt that you that you took when you borrowed al usd and so if you are if you are a patient you just get free money uh be it from the interest rate so you deposit a hundred dollars of dye you get to like withdraw 70 al usd but you don't actually ever have to pay that back and eventually you can just go back to alchemix and withdraw your die or mint a l more alusd it's a it's a system that auto repays your loan for you because it's generating yield in the background so it's pretty cool that's super cool and i think what the the the macro story here is is this is now we're seeing like i don't know third fourth fifth layer money legos because this whole thing alcamx is built on top of wiring which is built on top of all sorts of other lending and borrowing protocols which is built up you know on top of stable coins which is built on top of ethereum so we've got like this is why we call it money legos because we have these these sort of stacking type effects and uh you can you can create things on top of other things now now we're seeing things being created on top of a yield aggregator itself on top of why i earned so that's pretty wild yeah i said that that the alcoholics protocol was governance minimized i actually got that confused with something else it's not it's not attempting to be a governance minimized platform but everything else i said was true okay thanks for clarifying david david ladis is doing some cool things you just did an unboxing they've got some lapis is back in stock uh you want to give us a sneak peek of this yeah yeah so i did my first unboxing video i'm not good at that by the way i i realized somebody made in the comments like it took me it took them like four or five minutes to figure out what i was actually unboxing i kind of forgot to tell them that it was a hardware wallet uh yeah so i did an unboxing for a lattice one from grid plus uh so if you want to know and get more intimate details as to what that's all about uh go check that out uh i do i go through the whole setup process so you can see what that's like and then i kind of give my thoughts that's like what the who the product is for if it's really into into you or if it's really a good product for you or not the metaphor that i came out with while i was making that video ryan is this a landline hardware wallet kind of is this the metaphor i'm working with because it needs to be connected to wi-fi so it needs to be in your home right and so you must somebody if you want to make a transaction somebody must be local to the units right by definition and that unit is in your own home and so the lattice one adopts the security of your home which is pretty interesting you're pretty cool well guys this is worth it just to see david uh peel off this look of glee as he peels off the plastic from his lattice display it's just worth it just for that um david let's end on this on releases this is actually like a future release tim baco put together a github proposal for eip1559 the much awaited eip maybe the most awaited eip in ethereum's history and he proposed that it be included in the london eth hard fork so if i'm not mistaken we have a date now for the next eath hard fork ethereum hard fork which is uh in april and that's going to be called berlin and eip would not be in that april hard fork it would be in the one after which is estimated to be sometime in the summer like june july august that time that kind of time frame uh and if all of this happens and if this proposal is accepted that would mean we would get eip 1559 this summer yeah i remember earlier predictions and i think even on the bold case for ethereum podcast with dc eric and anthony that we actually perhaps didn't even think about eip1559 coming into q4 or even q1 of 2022 uh the fact that that tim tim bako who by the way has the most information about eip1559 period he knows the most he knows he runs he runs the whole show like he's the organizer behind it he's making a proposal to get it included into the london hard fork so this is a proposal for inclusion is what you would need to see to get eip1559 included this is the first step so this proposal will be reviewed and then the uh the eth1 core developers will analyze whether this is ready for inclusion or not and if there is consensus among core developers it shall be included uh in the london update which again theoretically slated for this summer so we're on we're on the way we're on the way absolutely i mean uh it could take longer than this summer sometimes hard forks have a tendency to be delayed but this is overall good news it means tim thinks this eip is in a place where it can be proposed and included uh huge all right david let's get huge the news uh fedwire went down ethereum never goes down but federer did what is feb fed wire and what chaos did this bring with it right so fed fire is how the fed transfers balances between banks right the us dollar asset transfer mechanism between commercial banks and other banks right and it broke apparently uh so centralized systems are fragile they can go down because they're not redundant and i kind of forgot that that the fed wire could even go down like it's not really something you think about yeah like your money system isn't supposed to break right it's supposed to just work uh but you know at the end of the day centralized systems are fragile centralized systems go down like whoopsy daisies uh and i actually i think this even got reported by the gemini twins when they had to make an announcement or some sort of release saying like hey like deposits in and out of our our exchange like are being paused because this fed wire thing is broken so sorry about that not our fault it's the fed's fault um crazy absolutely crazy that like the dollar just has downtime like that's nuts yeah i mean this paralyzed a whole bunch of banks for a few hours and it makes you think about like cyber security attacks what what would that be like it makes you think about like um you know somebody somewhere has a button they can press and power this whole thing down a lot of centralization uh underlying the the traditional banking systems of today um david let's get back to what i think is probably the biggest news item we we we teased it a little bit when we were talking about the market and that is coinbase's s1 filing it's it's it's notes basically uh the things it's publicly disclosing before it's about to ipo i've got a few gleanings from this maybe you could add yours too the first is 43 million verified users that is like that's massive right 43 million um 2.8 million monthly transacting users they are just crushing it in terms of of revenue 2020 revenue was a 2x from 2019 revenue there's a lot more here but what were some of your takeaways yeah it's just really cool to be able to access this information i know a lot of data geeks like nick carter were really waiting for coinbase to file this so that they could poke around uh and so we are getting some early digestion from from people like larry cermak who works at the block uh it's his job job to digest information so i think this is just the first of many big takeaways that we're going to get out of this coinbase filing and really what what this is indicative is that you know coinbase is not really a well-optimized company kind of burning a lot of money but they're making so much money it doesn't even matter and i think this is just going to indicate to the rest of the financial world that there is so much money to be made in crypto selling shovels you don't even have to believe in bitcoin you don't even have to believe in crypto or the bankless vision you just have to know that there's money to be made selling shovels here and a lot of people are going to want to get in on that coinbase has 90 billion in assets on their platform david and they're getting ready to ipo at a market cap of a hundred billion in valuation like if i'm if if i'm a traditional bank at this point right i'm starting to get worried i'm starting to sweat because it's it's not just like maybe defy is not on my radar at all but like coinbase is on my radar you know how we're we're just saying that you know the uh any any of the assets that that many people in crypto sell will actually stay in in crypto dollars this cycle well who really owns crypto dollars it's these crypto banks like coinbase and gemini like they totally own that they like my my gemini account my coinbase account is so much more useful to me even than my my wells fargo account because it has this bridge into the world of defy and it's also just very useful on its own so if i'm a traditional bank i'm starting to sweat a little bit these guys are coming and they're about to eat my lunch uh and uh you know i i wonder what some of the the meetings are like on these executive teams if if they're kind of seeing if jp morgan is seeing it if um bank of america is seeing it if uh they're worried at all about what's happening here ryan earlier in this episode we talked about what we're gonna do when we decide that uh this bull market is close to being over and we sell into crypto dollars well if we do ever want to get our because we are bankless natives like we live with our financial monies in ethereum like in our own in our own wallets but if we ever do want to bring that cash back into the world where kind of the rest of people are like if we ever want to improve our local environment if i want to buy a really expensive plant i'm going to have to go through the crypto banks and that's not wells fargo that's not you know bank of america that's coinbase and gemini and if gemini's rolling out a credit card well yeah let me space is rolling out a debit debit card and so what financial products are left for people like you and me from this from the legacy this is what i mean so david you have your ethereum account which is like your bankless bank account basically and all of the ethereum addresses that you have right um what would it take for you just to to to live basically on your ethereum accounts and then also a gemini account and completely shut down your traditional you know wells fargo account or whatever bank that you use like what would it take wouldn't it just take my god gemini has a credit card and then like you can pay all of your bills and then why do you need your wells fargo account right right like only to receive payments from other people that are not bankless and then i can transfer it over to crypto anyways exactly and even then uh you know it seems to me that somebody could build a a very easy bridge so that you could receive funds in gemini or coinbase i don't think these banks know that the writing is on the wall for them but it is on the writing is on the wall for them for sure um all right tell me about nyan cat i was embarrassed when we went over the notes dude like i've seen this all over the place like this meme this cat with a rainbow uh but i didn't know what it was um what is it and what's happening here yeah nine cat is like embedded into the internet itself at this point it's like one of the og viral internet memes that turned boomers in for a tizzy about like what the hell is this thing like why do people care it's just this animated pop-tart looking cat with rainbow coming out it's but like going through space like it just went through the internet like back it's years ago i don't even know what one in no way it's probably it could have been like early 2000s right uh grand meme before crypto was even a thing and the original artist sold it sold a an nnt version of it for 300 each which is almost half a million dollars and i think what's really interesting about this ryan is that the original artist remastered the gif as in he probably just started over from scratch right he probably just made it again and just bran made a brand new gif and then sold that gift that he made fresh new for 300 eth right but the and the the point is there is that it wasn't the original gift because at this point where is the original gift he probably lost it because it's on the internet it's just like on the internet the point is is that the original artist made a new gift that was the same as the old gif but the original artist sold it for 300 each it's not about the gif it's about the legitimacy of the of the original artists being able to make that nft if i went and made an ion cat nft i hope people would be it would slap me around and be like no you don't have the rights well you could and you could and you could david right you could just take that that gift from anywhere and and listed on wearable or nifty gateway or somewhere else but like that doesn't give it the value is what you're saying right exactly the value lies in the hands of the artist and the artist himself was the mentor of this nft which means that the artist himself has the rights to sell this nft is it not about the art it's about the legitimacy that's that's so interesting right because what people are buying at the end of the day is authenticity and without that authenticity they don't get the the the social status the signal boost that they're really looking for from these nfts you know i i wouldn't have always believed this was the case i think like even as recent as uh six months ago you and i were trying to figure out nfts and like is anybody really going to pay for a jpeg or a gif uh and um now it makes sense yes the answer is yes because what they're not just paying for the digital imprint they're paying for the authenticity and uh you can't disagree with the market the market is saying that people want nfts and pay a lot for them 300 eth man that's crazy all right uh south korea banning privacy coins from crypto banks i guess my my quick question to you here david is um is this just the beginning of of more of these bans so like they're banning privacy coins like zcash and monero do you think that's going to be like the future one of the final bosses we have to deal with yeah privacy coins are going to be a much more difficult subject than bitcoin and ethereum um simply because of their nature i kind of think it's not that big of a deal just because my privacy coins don't have that large of a market cap and really the story is store of value right not privacy uh we we know from chain link that less than one percent of crypto activity is uh is crime and so the value of privacy coins just aren't that big of a deal and i think nation states just see the promise of the narrative behind privacy's coins and then they get scared but they don't look at the fundamentals they don't really look at are people really using these things and they also don't understand that at least my theory is that privacy is an application not an asset which means that there should be applications on ethereum that let you make your die private or make your eth private that seems to be where i think the long-term trends toward privacy will go um it's interesting to watch nation states try and control things though i think that is really the true line of this story do you know what's what's interesting is the the question of if if bitcoin or ethereum had privacy on its base layer just like baked in and every we we had the technology to make every transaction uh private from the get-go because uh you know the the people behind this movement would have if they could but the technology just wasn't there so we have pseudo-anonymous um addresses rather than completely anonymous addresses but if we had done that if it was baked in do you think that nation states would have been much more hostile to these these assets and these networks from the very beginning i think it's very possible like i think it's possible that um not having privacy baked into the base layer was actually a blessing because it meant that the nation's gate states weren't afraid of these these crypto networks from the beginning and didn't try to you know strangle them in the crib as it were what do you think of that take yeah i i think it's possible i think privacy at the base layer is a problem for other reasons though because privacy at the base layer reduces the auditability of these systems right and so um uh it's it's easier to audit bitcoin and it is monero it's it's possible to audit the supply of monero that's a people thinking that like you can't actually audit the supply monero that's actually a myth you totally can but the point is of the ease of of said activity and the ease of auditing the supply of ether transparency again like transparency in my opinion is an app not an asset david we mentioned this last week but uh alpha hemorrha had a hack alpha hamora and cream there was an exploit a massive amount of funds we're stolen one of the larger d5 hacks what's interesting was it that big i thought it was 11 million dollars no i think it was a small amount of money it was it was closer to 40 million as if i'm wow um so you know pretty pretty large one but what's interesting about this is uh this week they just announced um a fund repayment program so they are going to make anyone who who um lost assets in that exploit they're going to make them whole and the way they're going to be doing this is partially through the value of their tokens which is interesting to me david because as we've seen in exploits in the past in d5 what inevitably ends up happening is token governance votes and decides to make any of those users who lost funds whole we saw it in the bzx hack we've seen it in other hacks and i feel like at some level what we've just reinvented is is kind of equity right like so if there is some major event uh an issue in a publicly traded company like shareholders take the brunt of it they get diluted rather than sort of debt holders or users of the platform and that seems to be the case here which also implies that the value of a token underlying a protocol can act as a sort of insurance or as a backstop against these exploits all of these things are very interesting to me do you have any takes yeah the the the alpha token has not um it's got taken a hit as you would expect any sort of protocol to to do if they if they got hacked they'd be like people get scared people flee people sell um and so you're totally right and this is actually much more formalized in the maker dow system where mkr is not a theoretical backstop it is the backstop and it's in the protocol that it will get minted in case the system becomes insolvent uh and so it's interesting to see newer d5 systems to kind of take a more informal approach to that but i do i think it's it's it's relieving to see that d5 protocols find ways to make people whole again if something goes wrong um it's kind of the benefit of some of these d5 protocols not being actually defy quote unquote is like they're not actually decentralized they're they're nice money legos but the team is centralized and in the young genesis of these systems like human control over these systems is kind of nice right like we can actually repair holes as they as they come about right repair holes via governance vote um david let's let's take these two news items as one so michael saylor microstrategy just bought another 1 billion in bitcoin so that's big in and of itself uh but square released some information so the square the payments company that they also have 170 million dollars worth of bitcoin on their balance sheet uh what what what is this these two stories these two headlines signaling to us you know i'm not actually a hundred percent convinced that the michael sailor buys one billion dollars of bitcoin is actually different from the last story that we reported on the weekly roll up so they're all starting to blur together i don't they're all they're all blurring together um but then also square which already had 50 billion dollars per billion yeah no 50 million dollars of bitcoin purchase on the balance sheet they bought another 170 million uh and and this was released in their quarterly report and then also very strong revenue numbers out of square from their cash apps uh which is how a lot of people but make their bitcoin purchase purchases so in the same vein as like coinbase signaling to the rest of the world that bitcoin and bitcoin services are extremely lucrative square is following up on that just as strongly yeah absolutely all right david there was some tether news this week with the new york attorney general if people remember that um new york attorney general was taking tether and bitfenix to task for the i guess the uh the backing of their staple coin what happened here yeah so there has been this apparently two year long uh probe into tether to just understand what is real and what's not real behind tether um and so they they discovered that there was just some inconsistencies with their banking and what they reported and their public-facing statements right uh and so i actually haven't really gotten to the bottom of this story i haven't figured i may have been able to measure the severity of this but like my biggest takeaway is that banking for tether is a huge issue uh because they're kind of legally gray legally dubious they're offshore and so like tether really has to kind of make do with what it's got and kind of get creative with its banking layer so that it can facilitate its tether printing and redeeming right and so what that means is that there's different funds and different bank accounts uh some are totally controlled by tether some are controlled by tethers lawyers some aren't there's just kind of this hodgepodge patchwork solutions that tether has made and and because of their nature because they're kind of dupious and so uh and and then there's also tether trying to make very strong pr um uh moves me to make sure that uh people that use tether feel secure about using tether so there's a discrepancy between their alignment of their banks and the minting of tether and so they got hit with an eighteen and a half million dollar fine and like i i i don't know how malicious or irresponsible tether was being um but the market seems to be relatively okay with it like perhaps perhaps this was one of the reasons why bitcoin dumped but i kind of think bitcoin is going to dump anyways um i'm not totally on top of this story there's a number of different threads to go on yeah it's it's interesting i i do believe in the report it it was was evident that tether was not always backed one to one in dollars in a bank account somewhere and tether will tell you that's because hey we couldn't get a bank account and uh the prosecution would say well no it's because you know you were you were making you were making money in other ways on on those those dollars and you're benefiting from not having them fully one to one backed um regardless the problem with all of this of course is that it kind of breaks the crypto mantra of like it's not don't be evil it's can't be evil right if on on chain with die for instance we see all of the assets that are backing the die stable coin we don't see that with tether it's kind of in these dark bank accounts somewhere but the other takeaway for me david was that 20 million dollar fine you know what that is it's a slap on the wrist like it's nothing it reminds me of eos they print that every day they print like who cares yeah 20 million uh i mean like with eos when the sec found that they had listed and uh sold an unregistered security it was a similar slap on the wrist like 30 million dollars what's interesting about all of this is it seems to be the case if you have enough money you don't have to worry about regulation anyway uh you're just going to get kind of a slap on the wrist out of this so i'm not sure what lessons are being taken away uh from the crypto industry at large if any but the lesson i'm getting is man open transparent decentralized protocols is the way we need to build this space so we're not building on rotten foundation david brave wallet which is a browser that i use um actually brave the browser they are releasing a crypto wallet maybe sort of a metamask type competitor and also a dex aggregator what this really signals to me is that they are doubling down in crypto it's interesting to me because they have about 25 million monthly active users now so it's no longer a small niche browser they're kind of getting up there into the millions in terms of uh users what do you what do you make of this yeah so crypto is internet native finance and you access the internet through the browser so this kind of just makes sense like brave already had their native brave browser wallet and now they are integrating the native brave browser dex aggregator where we also saw metamask do this like metamask also has a dex aggregator built in as well so just more innovation being pushed out in in every single corner of the internet i love metamask but i would definitely love to see some browser competition to metamask to push metamask into uh building it's the best version of itself so uh hopefully that um that comes to pass david that has been the news should we get to takes let's uh let's get to takes absolutely wait no uh so rare click that click that link yeah that one uh so this is nba topshop but for soccer or what the international listeners might call football um so this is really big this is i think officially yeah officially licensed yeah so uh football clubs of europe and around the world are on board with this and football soccer is a lot bigger than literally every other sport uh and so nfts uh into the mainstream in another way here we go these guys have been out for a little while but they just announced a pretty massive raise again so pretty impressive these are getting funded of course that comes on top of top shots which raised at a valuation of multiple billions yeah between a billion man so um nfts aren't just heating up in terms of of sales and interest they're definitely heating up in terms of uh investment as well okay now let's get to the takes now now can we start with your friend michael michael bury uh my beard yeah your friend so you've talked about him before when we had that gamestop rant um who is michael bury and what is he talking about these days yeah michael bury is the character depicted in that movie the big short he's the hedge fund manager who uh shorts the market before anyone else does perhaps arguably a little bit too early but you never really know um and then he was also the guy that publicized that he was long gamestop before gamestop blew up and so now michael bury is saying that inflation is coming uh and this has been the bitcoiner thesis this is the the dollar's trash thesis uh he thinks that inflation's coming and i think that's totally i'm i've been dabbling in this thought process myself for a while and um uh if michael bury says it uh more and more people will believe it to be true which actually kind of in the way money works might actually cause the inflation itself it's kind of a meme um but then also we we also saw this is not on this page but we also saw michael bury uh publicly tweet about nfts he deleted that tweet which is kind of sad but michael brewery paying attention to the macro world and protocols and bitcoin and stuff of this nature it's interesting because he's got some narrative steam behind him i mean he was right in 2008 in in the biggest way like and because of the big short movie everyone knows he was right and then more recently he was right during the the the gamestop uh stock he was right on kind of the you know the price of that and and the hedge fund manager shenanigans so the question is does he have the narrative power to make this sort of reflexive uh and uh you know that's definitely interesting but he he's also says that governments might squash bitcoin and gold in an effort to protect their currency so he's just mapping this out he's saying hey if if fiat currencies do start to hyperinflate then world governments are going to start taking an aggressive posture on them um that that was a take that ben hunt had as well what's what do you think of that yeah yeah this is definitely something to keep an eye on he he drew a connection between uh hyperinflation in 1920s germany to what kind of where we are today uh and hyperinflation or a very inflating currency goes hand in hand with very strong authoritarian governments so like the connection is there to be made um yeah we will see okay uh david can we talk about this tweet so this was from or maybe let's just talk about this story um what this this is a room what i'm looking at is a room in clubhouse house right yeah clubhouse room so what's going maybe people need to understand what clubhouse is um explain that and then why this is relevant yeah clubhouse is a new socialization app they brand it as like drop-in chat rooms uh so there are permissionless chat rooms anyone can join them uh and then in each room there will be a certain set of moderators who can elevate people to like the speaking side and so there's listeners and they're speakers uh and this uh this chat this clubhouse club uh which is called the uh culture club and they have apparently a number of these sessions and importantly it's specifically artists and creators not crypto people uh and but a lot of artists and creators are getting into crypto and so this this particular meeting of this uh culture club clubhouse room uh was talking about nfts and it's titled legitimating legitimizing nfts in the art world and in this clubhouse club in the meeting i was this was last night wednesday night when i was when i was in listening to this and a bunch of other crypto people were in this room as well there was people there uh there was uh bobby i don't know his last name but bobby the creator of the hundreds brand uh there was also um grimes uh the artist grimes uh also elon musk's wife if people aren't familiar with her music and she's releasing some nfts this week she's releasing some nfts right and and there were four and a half thousand people in this room and when i got i got into this room a couple minutes after i started and i wanted i wanted to talk because i can talk about nfts and kind of a public figure in the crypto space so and i raised my hand so they could perhaps invite me into the room they didn't because they don't know who i am because there is no because they're not crypto period i'm a no one to them because they are not crypto people they are artists and this was a room full of artists of huge artists people grimes et cetera then they weren't they weren't there to shield their eath bags like i was and they weren't there to fill nfts they were there talking about what they called a pivotal inflection point in history and this is the quote that jake berman uh who is a crypto person put on his tweet and this is what they said in this room we are at a pivotal inflection point in history specifically artist history they don't care about ethereum they don't care about defy they care about being able to culturally and creatively express themselves and they are seeing nfts as the vehicle to do that and this is and this is so cool because like when i show nfts or ryan when you show nfcs kind of comes with the bias that we are also by buying proxy shilling ethereum something that we believe in these people don't have that bias they are just here for the art yet they are shilling nfts because they see it as the next big thing wow so cool man what this says to me is that nfts have really hit escape philosophy velocity because it's expanded way outside of the original crypto culture and now it's kind of invaded other cultures and these other communities and cultures are building on top without even knowing that we exist without even knowing that like kind of cryptoculture and bankless and all of these things exist that is pretty powerful um what about this i think um this is a quote that that you tweeted out too and did that this come maybe from clubhouse you said we are recapturing the emotional value that platforms have robbed from us over the last decade it sounds like a quote from one of those creators in that clubhouse meeting is that where you got this yeah that's exactly right somebody was talking about uh the the what has been robbed from them the the emotional energy that has been robbed from them from these web 2 platforms instagram google facebook all of these all these platforms that there are creators on they say that these web 2 platforms have robbed them of their creative energy because they are intermediaries because they are extractive and so these creators are identifying the fact that these nfts are a direct cultural express expression vehicle and a fan connection medium and they're identifying that really early in nft history and so it's almost like self-sovereign creation you know how we talk about self-sovereign money well these creators they want to be sovereign over the creation that that they make and right now in web 2.0 they're going through intermediaries at every stage either going through an art gallery in the physical world or they're going through something like spotify where they get sense on a song and now they've got this new canvas this new space to play this new kind of economy where they can go directly to their fan base that's what they're seeing here that's exactly right and it's so awesome to it's very validating that non-ethereum people are spinning this same narrative that we have but in in their respective camps all right let's talk about this uh this is chris berninski one of our favorites he just goes through the math um here's what an 80 drawdown looks like so if eth hit all-time high of 10k this cycle and there's an 80 drawdown what would that be 2k if bitcoin hits 300k this cycle and retraces down to 60k after an 80 percent drawdown and his takeaway is there's a chance that what you're buying at these current prices you're buying is actually the bottom of the next bear so chris has just thrown out some math and he's just extrapolating what's happened three times in the past this is now the fourth time it might be happening he's just extrapolating the math and um and talking about how young we are in this in this bull market cycle yeah and this is some basic napkin math but i honestly think kind of crypto does better with napkin math rather than any sort of like more robust calculations let's just do some like occam's razor calculations and that's what chris is doing uh i believe it um perhaps 10k is not the top for ether though question mark um maybe maybe i'm gonna have bull market goggles on i don't know well in december right uh we we had that bull market podcast and it's interesting the range we had eric connor who predicted top of the bull run might be 2500 and then we had dc investor who came in at 20k at his top prediction and then anthony cesano was right in the middle at 10k i feel like that's the range and uh 2 500 is is definitely on the low side here but we could well past 10k if this bull run gets really heated uh hot we all we made those predictions back in december when things were a bit more sober so i tend to trust them more david that's a good point it's important it's important to remember to not become more bullish just because prices are going up that's not a reason to be bullish exactly all right um we'll talk about this region to be bullish this is you on twitter ethereum will produce more jobs over the next decade than the top 10 companies in the s p 500 combined you know what this says to me more jobs right when you say more jobs you start talking about a new economy that's being created is that what you're talking about this new economy that's actually going to employ people like creators like those yeah the creators making those nfts in clubhouse um that's what you're talking about right yeah and not only that but d5 protocol treasuries have millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars uh i i know for a fact sushi has like 200 million dollars in their treasury um and that's just that's just one protocol right every single d5 protocol has a treasury and they need laborers and workers to work for them and so that's one like employment vehicle the other employment vehicle is exactly what you said where nfts offer creators a way to monetize their own labor which is also huge which means that they don't need bosses right and one of the cool things about the jobs that i expect ethereum to create are jobs without bosses or jobs without strict organizational hierarchies right they're just paying you you you put in ten dollars of labor here's ten dollars right maybe you have to do health benefits on the side insurance whatever but the point is like ethereum is this massively employing structure that isn't just allowing people to generate a livelihood for themselves over and over and over again in so many different ways we talk about how much surface area ethereum has that's also employment surface area that's also job creation service area it's going to be massive you know it kind of reminds me of the kind of the gig economy where we all became gig economy workers for you know driving uber uber cars and you know delivering food and all of these things but the problem with the gig economy is is still centrally controlled centralized and uh you know uber is always going to take its cut right right um this is this is like gig economy only it's self-sovereign gig economy where you're working for yourself you're also working for these protocols and and you're creating but it's not structured like a nine to five job i i think that's a huge takeaway for people one of the one of the benefits i think of going bankless is you start to discover how the new economy is going to work and it's not going to work with nine to five jobs and you know here's your paycheck and here's your your health benefits uh the new economy is going to work in these like digital cultural ecosystems and there's tremendous opportunities there but you have to figure out how it works right you can't just go down the path that society has laid out for you which is like yeah you know you go to school you get to high school and then you go to college and then you expect that nine to five job and you could buy a house right that hasn't worked for so many millennials um i don't think it's gonna work for us now and like we have to be smarter and we have to discover this new country this new economy uh in the early stages so we can maximize the opportunity yeah that's that's exactly right and if if people don't think that they can find a job in ethereum i think you're being a pessimist the way i got started in crypto is i was working at a physical therapy i was working as a physical therapy aide and then i would go back home and i would this is in the middle of the the 2017-2018 mania and then i would go home and just learn and at some point instead of going home and learning i started going home and writing right i just started producing and i didn't do it because anyone paid me why would they have paid me i hadn't created anything yet but i just started writing and like my first blog post got included in like the the week in ethereum from evan van ness and i was over the moon i was like wow this is so awesome i got included in the weekend ethereum and it's just snowballed from there i just kept on writing um and then and then one day like medium d platformed me quote unquote uh i think i just triggered like their boss or something uh but then i made this tweet that was like medium deep platform me like decentralization uh it turned out it was just is this a glitch but then ryan that's when you said that you know david's writing is really valuable to me like what the medium like why why did you do that i ended up getting my medium back didn't really matter um but the point is like that's when i discovered that people actually cared about what i wrote and then that turned into a job at this uh this ico agency back in 2017 and then the security token agency and then realty and then bank list right it's all just rolled into jobs and jobs and jobs because i just started producing and if you don't think that that can happen to you think again like people are looking to pay people in crypto for their labor and if you want to get a job all you have to do is try like it can be done i totally agree yeah you know the thing the thing about that story too is david says you're not you're not a developer you're not a coder this is a technical space skills zero coding skills um and uh and like you've you've done so well to kind of create your opportunity here there there's so much more than coding that needs to be done here community management media these are all areas you can tap into the the thing to do is start getting plugged into these communities and figure out where your niche is i mean your niche was was fantastic it was like writing expressing these these ideas and creating these mental models uh and it turns out that's uh that's super valuable for people um really cool story thanks man so hey so social there are plenty of actually i would say i mean developers are extremely highly paid but like people that work on the social layer are also they people don't know they need those people but those people are really really important do you know what i'm not gonna say they're more important they're equally important like the social layer is so important and crypto important and it's it's equally as important as what we write in code um yep 100 david you know what i have another take here but i don't think we have time for it because it's kind of a longer take maybe we'll just refer to it in the show notes um well it was a take that you had in the bank list discord so premium bank list of members definitely saw that take yeah it's just like we just heard your story david which is cool i have kind of a personal story that i used to be in the validator business i used to run a validator in the cosmos ecosystem and and some other delegated proof of stake ecosystems and this is kind of a story of of uh why i exited that essentially and uh the tldr was my experience as a cosmos validator left me more jaded on these delegated proof of stake systems of which binance chain is one um which is why i was making this this contrast and it made me more bullish on ethereum anyway my full take is uh we'll include as a link in the show notes i tweet this out and it's also in the bank list discord david before we get to what we're excited about we should take a minute to

all right guys we are back david let's start here what are you excited about yeah keeping the conversation going about ethereum the employer and nfts expressing creativity what i'm really excited about and maybe this isn't excited but this is more about what's on my mind i recently watched this movie called nomad land which was uh it was a story that followed this lady uh after the 08 crisis as she was kind of just a nomad living in a van just hopping from state to state trying to find work and it was a sad movie it was a it was a depressing movie it wasn't it wasn't a feel-good movie it was about the struggles of people's lives after they lost their jobs and their homes they were forced to live in a van and travel around america trying to find work very very reminiscent of the great depression right people traveling trying to find work uh and it i i it hit me like a ton of bricks dude uh and i became like very very kind of kind of sobered up about like hey what are we trying to do here in ethereum because i'm a hundred percent a believer that if we had ethereum we wouldn't have had the financial crisis the financial crisis is the perfect example of something that would have not happened under a a financial paradigm under the ethereum protocol and so what i'm what i'm excited for in the long term is about ethereum's ability to re prevent and reduce suffering in the world and that starts by employing people itself in a self-sovereign way giving people job opportunities that don't depend on financialization that don't depend on just like just massive massive uh conglomerates of companies and and like amazon and all these other just big centralized companies that just are the the outsourcers of jobs what i'm really excited for is to be able to create self-sovereign money and financial tools for people to have a job that doesn't get rug pulled from them because we don't have a financial system that that rug pulls the whole entire world uh and so i i was reminded about how i how important this whole etherium thing is uh and it's really important that we get it right because if we don't get it right if the if the values and ethos behind the these cryptosystems bitcoin and ethereum don't actually align with the people that they govern over then down the road that is systemic suffering and systemic badness right and i want ethereum to be good um hold on oh yeah sorry go ahead it's straight it's striking david i think that um how how systemic problems um cost individuals like the casualties are people who are generally on kind of the the lower rungs of society right like the weak and the vulnerable right so um there is such a responsibility for those who are early those who are designing the system and we as users of these decentralized finance uh systems and and honestly as as partially part of designing the the social layer of these systems have to make sure we design them in the right way right or else like like what you just said is there's a tremendous amount of responsibility on those who are in the ecosystem now because we're saying hey here's this new financial system it's better than the old get on the lifeboat right but like if our lifeboat has holes in it if it i mean we're gonna if it's just the same as the boat that they just left uh it'll cost people so you're right there's a tremendous amount of responsibility in in what we're doing here to get it right and the honest truth is there are some problems that aren't solved yet right like we have to make the base layer in general uh and trustless blocks uh scalable right now i think of like high gas fees that's a problem we don't want ethereum to end up as a as a whale chain right that's a problem user experience is uh is a problem and we have to make this accessible to to everyone to be able to manage their their private keys also the mev problem we've talked about in the past that keeps bubbling up and surfacing its head we don't want to create a whole bunch of you know insiders who who can uh front run everyone else so um i'm gonna have to check out that movie so what's it called again uh nomad land yeah no mad land it came out in 2021 and it was an indie film uh most people in the film weren't actors which were pretty cool they were just real people uh again like hit me like a ton of bricks dude that's cool all right i'm checking that out ryan what are you excited about hopefully something a little bit sad it's less heavy anyway we had mark cuban on the podcast this week my friend we did like okay david uh bankless the podcast is not even a year old actually we we celebrate our first year birthday it's like march 2nd or something march 1st or 2nd so it's next not even a year old and we had mark cuban on the podcast that is a testament i think to the bankless community um the reason we got on mark cuban's radar is because everybody kept hitting mark up and saying hey bankless get on the podcast you're talking to nfts you know you should talk to them you're talking defy you should talk to them um but that that is actually absolutely huge and exciting a few lines from that conversation guys you can check it out if you haven't already it will be on the podcast on monday it's up live on youtube right now mark cuban said he's learning solidity like i can't believe that's a statement i'm making in 2021. um he schooled us in some erc 20 erc standards what was the erc i'm going to figure it out like yeah it was 11.55 which 175 an nft standard but also has some extra features built into it which mark knows plenty about apparently crazy right uh he knew what euler beats were this is an nft that we talked about on the last like an audio and a tee that we talked about on the last uh roll up he's totally plugged in um you know one of the things that i think uh stuck with me in the conversation first for one thing he said get get get long then get loud right was uh a takeaway for me about um you know once you're in an asset position this is what everyone does start talking about that talking to your um i feel like we do a lot of that when we're talking about eth and the values that underpin it but the other thing that he got right was this statement he said community creates value community creates value so three words he was using that to describe nfts but it's also true of a money asset monetary asset like bitcoin uh and also of ether so i was just blown away with the depth of his knowledge in in kind of crypto and uh and and the takeaways there so um man feels like we're going mainstream this year yeah when we bring on big names like that and onto the bank list podcasts and and and other people who i wouldn't call mark cuban like a crypto native right and we also brought on uh dimitri kofinis and ben hunt and rel paul all these people i wouldn't call them crypto native and when we when you and i make these agendas for these uh conversations i have this tendency to try and be like try and teach and i don't i'm trying to not do that and mark cuban was definitely somebody that didn't need any teaching right now he was on par with us and even passed us in some technical knowledge in some realms right he he kind of still went down that like blockchain everything healthcare blockchain i think i think he's going to drift away from that in the long term just like as just like i did um and but other than that man like his knowledge supersedes most people in this space yeah it was awesome he really did his homework i if if 90 if if 90 of the vcs did that level of homework they would be doing quite well on their investments in crypto you got to put in the hard work uh david let's get to our next section meme of the week this is the last and final section do we have two memes again this week yeah we do have two memes well they're really good one of them one of them's a little self-serving because one of them's about me but this first one this first one is uh coming out of our podcast from uh this monday uh l2 avengers assemble uh we got robbie from immutable we got justin from synthetics and then we got matt from loopring uh what matt is iron man uh who justin is captain america and then robbie is thor is that is that who robbie is uh yeah so we got we got the uh l2 d5 implementers assembling and this means it's pretty good this is just awesome uh crypto wife twitter handle needs to crypt uh needs to do this for sure for sure here's another one dude i laughed out loud when i saw this kid this is david yeah this is david's background right and it starts uh if you can't see it on youtube it starts in january and he's got some plants behind him and then it goes to february uh and he's got more plants and then march uh and then in april he turns into groot and he's got like an entire jungle behind him at this point and i think the comment is the nate the state of the nation is sprouting this is probably a comment on the growth of um crypto and everything in the bull market was just hilarious dude um i at one time i thought i could out out to plant you like i tried made some people attempts and then i was just like dude he's i mean it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen so i've just given up on that pursuit you are definitely the king of plants my friend yeah i will say that the plant population behind me actually tracks the price of ether so so this is actually what we're seeing this is just a proxy for ether so when we see 10k ether like damn is it gonna be planty in here wow that's a that sounds like a commitment that you just made david so uh we'll look for that the greener it gets on eath price the greener david's background gets so what's gonna happen right guys i did this is a complete side note but i did read this book one time about uh human connection in psychology to to planet earth and apparently humans that see the color green more often are less depressed uh and i connected that to plants but i think you just connected it to the green green candles which i think you know green candles make me less depressed too green candles do make me happy and uh we've seen a lot of them so a lot to be happy about these days we're we're definitely in a i i guess um i'm feeling really good about the the time in crypto we're in there's a lot of building a lot of good stuff happening if you're here along the journey you're you're still early and uh it's just a good time to be in crypto absolutely so david we should cut off right there let me do risk and disclaimers eth is risky bitcoin is risky so is d5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the bankless journey thanks so much for joining us this has been another weekly roll up take care
