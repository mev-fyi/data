[Music] welcome to bank lists where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david wall street meets defy what's this episode about jim bianco one of my newest favorite boomers in the bankless program he just dropped so much knowledge and energy on this podcast and i was having i was very very reminiscent of our episode with uh mark cuban and the the i think the through line between both mark cuban and jim bianco here is there are these there are these guys that keep themselves up to date no matter what age doesn't matter they keep themselves up to speed they innovate they they they tinker they get their hands dirty and they come out with very unique perspectives as a result of that getting into the weeds so jim bianco head of jim bianco research he's on cnbc a lot a big macro commentator and has opinions about defy wall street banks and regulation and how these things all intersect and i think i think my my favorite part of this podcast was towards the beginning uh where just jim just goes off on the federal banking system and how absolutely terrible it is with some really awesome metaphors going all the way back into the 1800s so just dropped a bunch of knowledge and then we also just go through other topics such as you know what's it going to take to to get wall street on board are they going to fight us are they going to adopt us is there a brain drain coming uh what jim likes to do in d5 uh and the regulation that is or is not coming a really of just a wide-ranging conversation that uh that jim just really is an expert on in every step of the way yeah bankless listener prepare yourself yourself some fire was dropped on this episode absolutely by jim bianco um you know what's really cool to me david these are the kind of conversations i love it's because i feel like we can learn so much from these conversations and the reason is because you know it's kind of this cross section of domains that jim understands right so like he can talk defy the way we can talk d5 because he's used it and he knows about it but he also has these domains that we're completely unfamiliar with like kind of the the whole macro side how the fed interacts he was a market veteran already by the time the dot-com boom was happening he's seen this kind of market psychology play out time after time and he we can pull lessons from those other domains that we're not as familiar with and apply them to crypto that's why these types of conversations are our goal to me and i think will be of interest to you the listener uh guys i think uh wall street is going to play in the d5 game i think they are they're slow in coming but they're starting to understand what this is all about and people like jim bianco are kind of uh showing the way it's he ends up talking about education the value of education and um i think that's uh that that's how we get more people into the space is is through education learning about these systems learning through using these systems i definitely feel more educated after talking to jim bianco and also the section on inflation and uh like consumer demand and job wages and uh just a lack a lack of goods in this economy is really impacting the way our society at least inside of america is really organizing around labor capital and goods i thought that was a really interesting section basically this whole podcast was full of information i had a great time with jim bianco so guys i think we should go ahead and get right into the episode but first let's talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com bankless nation we are super excited to introduce jim bianco to you he is the president and a macro strategist at bianco research he's a veteran of the dot com era we're sure to talk about that he's an expert in the global economy macra stuff financial markets as well his bio says he's unencumbered by the biases of traditional wall street research i love the sound of that maybe that's why he discovered defy before the rest of them here's what's also super interesting about jim he actually came to crypto not by way of bitcoin like a lot of us but by way of defy at least that's how he fell down the crypto rabbit hole as i understand it so we've got so much to learn from jim when i get the wall street experience from a finance guy who's gone crypto native jim bianco welcome to bank list it's great to have you thanks for having me guys big fan well we're a big fan too and uh we'll talk about how our paths cross too it's like you know partially some tweets you're very active on twitter which i love um but let's let's start with this um because we want to learn a few lessons from history from jim you've been in the financial markets a while and we always look historically at various parallels i think the first parallel we want to look at is you were around you were a veteran of the dot-com boom bust so you've seen market transformations before and we want to look at this through the lens of market psychology to understand really what we can learn with the internet we saw we saw markets trying to price in this unknown tech right like dot com how big is this thing going to be we often make parallels between crypto to the internet can you tell us what the learning lessons are so what is it like to watch humanity grapple with the collision between some financial market and nascent technology what can we learn here yeah well first of all um i was actually employed during the 87 stock market crash so i go back that far as well too so i was an aged veteran by the time we got to the uh to the dot-com crash of 2000. uh when you get new technology you usually have two things going on at once and this will sound familiar for the defy world you've got the advocates that are saying we are building something new something real something that is going to be lasting and it's very exciting and then you drop the whole country ho chunk casino on top of it you got this wild speculation on whether or not the b2b stocks are going to go up or the retailers are going to go up or pets.com is going to do this and they don't care about what the long term is i just want to make sure that this damn stock doubles before friday is all that they is all that they care about and the two kind of kind of become oil and water because the people that are trying to build something real get really mad at those that are just wildly speculating um with this stuff and the people that are wildly speculating get mad at the people that are building something real i'm here to get rich get out of my way you know and so you've got a little bit of that that's what you had in 2000 sound familiar oh my god it sounds so familiar yeah a little bit of what you've got going on but that's the way new technologies always evolve is that you get the you get the the pioneers that believe that they're building something real and then you get the wild speculation as well too uh you had the same thing um you know you had the same thing when we went west you know everybody left under the arch in st louis and they went west and some of them were saying we're going to build a new country and the other ones where i'm just getting to oklahoma to get my land rush and that's all i care about and stuff like that so you had the same type of thing happen there but what i think you saw in may that i saw that was reminiscent of maybe even the 87 crash in 2000 is you get a dominant player in the market now in the d5 world that dominant player in may was that the dogecoin hundred to one levered hot money crowd that was running all this stuff up and down all over the place the market was ripe for a correction then along came over the bridge at the right time was elon musk making noise about that you know it's all dirty it's all fueled by coal and it's all dirty and the market crashed and if you looked at some of the protocols and some of the centralized exchanges you had a massive liquidation out of a lot of those levered players now this is very reminiscent of what we saw with a lot of those speculators in the first part of 2000 during the dot-com crash you blew them out i remember watching you know on the maker burn site watching just all of the all the all the accounts coming up that you could buy the collateral on i mean it was almost too many to keep in uh watching hundreds of thousands of them on the centralized exchanges in the futures markets were blown out you wiped out a class of trader in that market that's why i think this market has been consolidating the way you will reestablish another bull market kind of like 2000 to 2002 in the in the dot-com one is you have to bring in another type of player and then eventually you'll drag in that hot money one more time hot money's not gonna get you to 65 000 on bitcoin it's not going to get you to 2 500 on each it's going to be a different player who is that different player well you your guess is good it's mine but i had to guess that different player that you want to bring in is going to be i as i heard a description out of miami is the old guy's wearing golf shirts and blazers basically the tradify guys they're going to kind of come into this market and go i believe i believe i believe and then once the market starts catching wind then here comes all the hundred to one levered guys and here comes the next dogecoin whatever it happens to be and that speculation will will re-emerge as well so what i think you're going to see if this pattern holds out is i like to say a lot of people in the trapped by market like to say market will move to the level of most confusion or most frustration and what is that sideways for a lot longer than we think it's not going to plunge and prove some people write it's not going to soar and prove other people right it's going to do nothing and frustrate the hell out of everybody because we're waiting for another crowd to kind of take the mantle the long-term huddlers are there they're not going to buy again the short-term guys have been burned they're not ready to jump in until an established uptrend has been is underway so we need somebody else to come in and get the ball rolling and they will they will it will just take i think a lot more time than people think so i wouldn't be surprised if in the fall in the winter we're sitting around and we're looking at 2400 ethan we're looking at 40 000 bitcoin and everybody's mad because it's not going down it's not going up it's just frustrating everybody we're waiting and it never seems to happen jim how do you feel about the velocity of the timelines of these things the the dot-com bubble that was a year-long bubble and it didn't immediately just pop and in the crypto world we we like to illustrate our industry as like really speed running a lot of history of money and finance does that also mean we're kind of speed running the the whole market psychology like cycle as well because the the whole run-up from you know bitcoin and ether but um up to where the it's high is where it was right before the crash and then the crash and now the the stabilization how does that that timeline the speed of the timeline kind of compare and contrast to what you've uh previously experienced in in your histories oh there's no doubt that the crypto timeline is at breakneck speed right now and that in that the speed that everything is unfolding with it's been much faster i mean the dot-com thing you could argue that the dot-com uh bubble or the dot-com mania really started with apple in 1983 uh and that it really started going by 95 it was december of 96 that alan greenspan the federal reserve chairman gave a famous speech where he talked about irrational exuberance and that was an indication that in december of 96 a lot of people thought that tech stocks were getting overdone they didn't peak until march of 2000 so you still had three and a half more years of those stocks going in the crypto world that's three and a half months not three and a half years so everything moves a lot faster in in the crypto world take apple as an example i've used uh an overlay on speculation with bitcoin bitcoin has had seven corrections of 70 or more and a couple of 90 corrections especially to go back to 2013 after mount gox and some of those others those were some vicious corrections that they they had in its price from 1983 to 2003 apple stock was unchanged and by 1997 there was actually talk about them going bankrupt and it had multiple 70 80 percent corrections on weight that was 20 years that it took in crypto land we're talking about four or five years so everything moves a lot faster um in this space and it might be because of the nature of the decentralized world that things can evolve a lot faster too you know let's back up 18 months where was defy 18 months ago before defy summer and where is it now it's incredible the amount of adoption and um you know the the technology has moved in such a massive way in such a short period of time so the investment cycles or the speculation cycles are going to be much shorter too jim we're getting a lot of insight from this and in in how these markets kind of repeat over and over again because it all seems to be market psychology part of the adoption curve right when a new technology is born so you give us a few insights one is there's these long-term holder investors who evangelize and believe in the future probably a lot of the crypto natives listening to bank lists then there are these short-term speculators every market cycle has these two groups then you said um what you need in order to restore after kind of a crash is a new crop of buyers maybe these are the the people in the blazers we want to talk about the people in the blazers in a little bit but it also seems like these things repeat in in these fractal type patterns right you know some people said uh 2017 in 2018 like that was our kryptos.com bubble and now we hear here we are again with another run-up and kind of a crash so it's not going to play out exactly like the dot-com bubble which kind of took years to get back to all-time high i don't know how long it took amazon to get back to all-time high from like uh 2000 maybe like seven eight years something to that effect actually nine years nine years it took a while and this is maybe happening again and again um but i want to ask the question before we leave this section on market psychology um to you which is like so how should a savvy investor play these markets then what's what are the secrets what are the keys what have you gleaned over time as you've observed these this sort of psychology play out so by asking how a savvy investor is going to play this market um i assume we're talking about somebody in this space you would refer to more as a hodler uh you know that they believe in the space long term and they think that things are going to go and things are going to become much uh you know grow much more and become much more um exciting and and adoption rates are going to go up uh and i think what you want to do is you want to show some degree of patience in terms of what you're invest you want to be expecting the types of things that we saw in may and even the types of things that we saw in 2018 um as well too that that that will happen along the way um you know like i said if you are you know it's easy now to see what transformational company that apple is in 2021 but in 2003 after 20 years of sideways action and a bunch of 70 corrections it was easy to see why apple was destined to be a bankrupt company uh you know back then as well too it takes some time for this adoption curves to work play out now if you're asking me about you know speculators and how should speculators do it there was a 1978 movie called deer hunter and one of the highlights of that movie is very uh robert de niro was in it and one of the highlights of the movie was he was a vietnam veteran he went back to vietnam and he got himself involved in russian roulette games where they would basically get paid a lot of money to actually hold an actual gun to their head and see if they see who blew their brains out first nice go play russian roulette if you want to play if you want to be a speculator in this market because eventually the bullet's going to be in the chamber for you and you just have to understand that if you're going to play with lots of leverage in short term on these markets it is a very very difficult thing every every speculator that i've met that has been successful i'll just say this it's their full-time job they spend every waking minute of doing that if you're part-time and you just want to chase memes and stuff you're destined to wind up wiping yourself out if you want to make it your full-time and only activity of your life to change means and you've got some talent for it yeah you could do it but there's very very few people that can actually wind up doing this i'm not saying it's impossible it's just like i'm not saying it's impossible to be 300 hitter it's just that there's not very many of them that can actually pull it off this is why we talk to people on the bank list program is like like use d5 pursue it like figure this market out but if you want to sleep at night and buy eth buy bitcoin buy the d5 pulse index and then sleep well at night it doesn't have to be that hard and people make it hard i think when they when they chase narratives chase trends and chase memes but let's talk a little bit more about um uh macro markets now so um i think a second lesson maybe you could teach us from history as crypto natives in history is about macro and how it impacts these markets right and so like put your macro cap on for us and tell us what is going on in macro i think people listen to this i've heard about five percent inflation in may what does that mean what are the long-term covet impacts on markets what's going on with all of this monty money printing we keep hear about tell us the story around macro well the story about money printing is the story about uh the federal reserve and the the federal government through all of its stimulus programs um as i've referred to it as mailing money they mailed a 1200 check to everybody and uh above uh below certain income thresholds uh in april of last year that air drops right yeah yeah air drops exactly uh and they got really fancy with some of those checks because they were direct the positive accounts and stuff and then there was a 600 one in um in december and then there was the 1400 check in march as well too uh and what happened with a lot of that money is it found its way into traditional brokerage accounts robin hood being the the kind of the the poster child for them uh putting in it that's a that's a form of savings they just put it into their savings account their savings account just happened to be uh you know a robin hood account and they just wound up buying you know the ark innovation fund with a lot of their money as well too and they they chased it so it really did underpin the market uh as well too along the way the savings rate in the united states skyrocketed to levels that we never thought were possible for for a a benchmark in 2005 before the housing bus the savings rate was two percent now what is that that means the total amount of money you make less what you spend you had two percent left over and that's extraordinarily low why because everybody owned a house everybody owned the stock market and it always went up that was my safety so i could spend my whole paycheck check then we had the housing crash in 2008 we had the stock market fall 50 percent uh as well between the savings rates went to about six or seven percent because now i can't trust my house i can't trust the stock market as much this is circa 2010 to 2013 uh as well well once we got all this mailed money to everybody the savings rate went to 27 and so a number that was far and away the highest that we've ever seen people are stuffed to the gills with money that was mailed to them they're spending it they're buying stuff they're now now you can walk into a store without a mask and i was like oh now i could get on an airplane and go somewhere interesting thing about airline travel um just to give you an idea where the country is if you look at the official tsa statistics about we're about eighty percent of the way back on airline travel we're we're flying eighty percent of the level we did pre pandemic but the airlines will tell you that leisure travel is at an all-time high business trip business travels half of what it used to be because i have no one i would love to go to new york on business but nobody's in their office so there's no reason for me to get on a plane to go to new york but i'm traveling with my family more than i've ever have and a lot of people are because they've got the time to do it as well so what's been fostering all this money is this spurt of inflation we have inflation in this country that's not an opinion that's a fact the opinion is how long will it last and the fed likes to use the phrase transitory meaning that it will go away fairly soon and they're using as an as their um [Music] they're saying because the bond market is not shooting up in yields it's confirming their belief well we'll see you know uh where that winds up going i happen to be a little bit more uh pessimistic that the inflation rates that we're seeing are going to be a lot more permanent than the fed thinks that they're going to be than a lot of wall street thinks that they're going to be and i also fear that if we see the economy stumble a little bit they've already got their built-in answer well we'll just mail more money is what we'll wind up doing we'll just print up more money and we'll mail it to to everybody and that will just foster this problem that we have over and over again and i'm sure that the libertarians that are in the crypto universe are loving what i'm saying hearing like yes that's why the cr the crypto space is taking off because we don't have these kind of shenanigans and bad policies that seem to be going on along the way so yeah i think the real story in the in in the economy is the story of inflation we have it we have it because we've we've stuffed everybody full of money uh the the the hope is it's transitory it will go away fairly soon like by the end of the year but there's some like me paul tudor jones jamie dimon just to throw out a couple of names just the last 24 hours that have come out and said i'm not so sure that this inflation rate this high inflation levels are going to go away and we'll have to see what the second half of the year brings okay well let's talk about that just really quick because i think inflation is possibly the big story now and like i think uh folks in crypto will argue we saw asset price inflation over the last uh 12 years on parallel but now we're seeing it reflected in the way the government measures uh inflation which is primarily cpi but a lot of people i think a lot of people listening this have never grown up at a time where inflation was um higher than five percent for instance for a sustained period of time certainly nev like very few people have seen double digit don't remember like the 1970s when uh the country saw that what does the world look like when you have sustained high inflation usually yeah usually what is also part and parcel with an inflation rate is shortages and that's what drives prices higher in the 70s i was around to remember it and you've probably seen the black and white images no gas gas lines we constantly had shortages of gasoline 2021 we've constantly got shortages of pretty much everything that's like modified shortages no not talking about finished goods okay like if you go to a store and you want to buy adorable good you want to buy a refrigerator a stove a washing machine and you'll go into menards or home depot and they'll say it's on sale look at this price we'll beat all the competitors you go great i'll take that dishwasher okay good we'll we'll we'll we'll pencil you in for an october delivery october i want it like tomorrow i don't want it in october what we've been doing what we do when we have high prices what we do when we have high demand excuse me is we've got one of two options we can either raise prices or we can ration products and what we're doing now and what we did a lot in the 70s is rationing products as well too you've probably seen it i live in downtown chicago and i've seen some some of the restaurants in my neighborhood that say clothes today couldn't get enough people to work yeah you know not enough not enough bus boys in which they're rationing labor just pay them more money and they'll show up well i don't want to pay more money okay so you're just rationing your labor is what you're doing so you see a lot of rationing is what you see when you start getting high inflation and you're beginning to see that at the finished goods level if you've if anybody anybody owns a home and would would really appreciate what i'm about to say you can't get anything you can't get anything from two by fours to dishwashers god some breaks in my house it's the frustrating thing is to find the replacement part uh as well too it's always the aisle at home depot never has the part that i need to fix when something breaks it seems like or maybe i'm just having a bad streak but the data does support that idea that there's a lot of rationing so that's what you're going to have to get used to whether it's rationing your restaurants or rationing the products you like or maybe even because of the demand for leisure travel we're rationing out those airplane seats so that you can go to florida in the winter because everybody else wants to go to florida in the winter as well too wow that is so strange we like we haven't really lived through that and like what really quick though jim because i'm so curious what happens to assets in this scenario like what how does the investor prepare for this kind of inflation well the first thing you got to keep in mind is there's two broad categories of assets there's equities and there's fixed income let's take the second one fixed income if you're going to buy a bond that's going to give you a certain level of returns every year your fixed income and the prices of stuff rises then the value of your bond market the value of that fixed income is going to depreciate bond prices are going to fall and interest rates are going to rise and as interest rates rise the cost of borrowing whether it's a mortgage or business loan is going to go up and it's going to start to impair the economy and then that will eventually impair the stock market that's not happening now because one interest rates aren't really going up yet to the inflation thing is only months old it's not many years old um at this point and three there's a widespread belief that these markets aren't real anyway that the federal reserve could come in and wave a wand and fix it all and it will and their their their mandate is to make sure that my stock portfolio always goes up so there's this this zeal to take risk in the market because you're you don't have to worry about some kind of a downside to that spank i think that's a little bit misplaced i think we're giving the fed a lot more credit than they than than they deserve uh in terms of being able to hold markets up either through yield curve control or any of that other stuff yield curve control in other countries like in japan and stuff has shown a very spotty track record actually working to the degree that they want we tried it in the 50s in the us and it didn't work under the name of operation twist as well too so i think we we we give the fed too much credit but the point is here is that if you get those rising prices and you wind up having the bond market start to suffer and that's the cost of capital it will eventually filter through to everything else but that's not the case right now uh the case right now is everything's okay you know jay's got our back at the fed and he'll print enough money that uh you know everything keeps going up and that's exactly what's been happening at least at least this year jim i want to get your perspective as to how all of that interacts and collides with the crypto markets but before we get there i want to tie off the conversation about shortages because i'm curious as to where these shortages are actually come from yeah are where are they coming from are they are they a result of just a lack of production because people have been quarantined at home during covid or is it more specifically a phenomenon as a result of financial markets and us not really being able to allocate capital appropriately doing due to the distorted nature of the markets why why do these shortages exist well i have an outside the box field you know a traditional economist will tell you that there is a there is a breakdown in the supply chain is what they will tell you that we are not making stuff as fast as we used to and i've pushed back on that and i said no we are making stuff as fast as we used to and if you look at container rates you know to put a container on a ship out of china to send to the port of los angeles or if you look at railroad rates how much does it cost to put a container on a rail car and you know ship it across the country these rates are skyrocketing right now and the reason is we are demanding stuff we've you know the misallocation of capital is if you mail people a bunch of money eventually they're going to want to buy stuff with it and eventually they're going to want to all buy kind of the same things and we're not going to have enough of it and that's where the shortages are coming from so what i'm saying is i think the probably the supply chain is running fine it just can't keep up with the demand that everybody wants uh of everything and we've been satisfying that by saying you'll get it in october and eventually people are going to say but if i give you extra will you give it to me now and that's how you wind up with inflation higher prices and i think that that price that process excuse me is now beginning where we're starting to see uh prices start to go up no more so than in wages we're finally starting to see companies start to realize that the reason that you don't have enough employees is because you are not paying them enough um there was a story from last week there was a job fair by a bunch of restaurants in st louis and they had a hundred openings and they held it and they held a job fair all these restaurants 12 people showed up you know the answer is you're not paying them enough that's why they're not showing up raise your wages and they'll show up and i think companies are finally starting to get that and we're starting to see wages go up all that filters into is inflation yeah yeah that really seems to be the through line it's it's it's not because people are stuck at home quarantining that phase is perhaps behind us it's really a question of there's so much money in the economy right now that it's really distorting how people choose to engage in in the world jim we we got a report uh not too long ago that there was five percent annualized in inflation at the end of end of may how does that number land with you and where do you see that number going over the next year well keep in mind that that five percent annualized rate is what there's a term that economists use called the base effect because you're comparing the data that we have so far is through april may's numbers will be out shortly april to april of last year april last year was the height of the shutdown so you're you're comparing the absolute bottom of last year to the current level so you've got that big number so over the next several months that five percent number should moderate a little bit but if you look at the last three months and that and the the annualized rate that prices have gone up over the last three months is eight percent it's been booming that's a 40-year high that those are now economists will dismiss status that's the reopening because 90 days ago we were still wearing masks and we were still under restrictions and now we're reopening yes and that number will come down a little bit too but here's the thing i suspect through the rest of the summer those inflation numbers will come down and those that think inflation's transitory say see i told you they were going to come down but i would argue yeah and watch where they bottom out maybe with still a four handle on them and that's a very high inflation rate with a four handle it might not be five it might not be eight but it might be high threes to four and why is that a high inflation rate compare it to the bond market a 150 a one and a half percent yield in the bond market i put my money in in a bond investment i get one and a half percent but everything's four percent more expensive in a year that's a bad deal is what that is and people will start selling bonds if that perception comes in and interest rates will go up and then when the interest rates go up the cost of capital goes up eventually if they get high enough maybe over two percent on the 10-year note i think the stock market starts getting a little weak neat but we're not there now we're at 150 so the stock market seems to be fine for the moment let's introduce the crypto variable into this conversation uh with with the conversation of you know money printing inflation changes in labor and just reorienting of of you know the economy when we add in the conversation of crypto how does crypto collide with this conversation where does crypto come in how does it fit into into the conversation well i you know it fits in the conversation a couple ways i mean the bitcoin side of it is they're talking about selling money a store of value uh i think a lot of people are comfortable with that idea especially um i i know a lot of people make this com com comparison that the younger crowd likes crypto more than the than the older crowd i'm gonna say that there's that's the wrong causation i think the causation is how invested are you in the tread fi system look if you are a partner at goldman sachs even if you're 28 years old and you're a partner at goldman sachs you think traditional finance is the greatest damn thing you've ever seen in your life and you don't want anything to change on it but if you're if you're 28 years old and you've got four thousand dollars in a robin hood account and you look at crypto you have a much different view of it so it's really about how far away do you get from the tradfy system as to your view so those that are more out of the system tend to look at things like bitcoin and maybe d5 a lot more positively than those in the tradfi system and i think it really comes down to with the tradify system the basic problem it has is permission you need permission to do everything in the treadvie system so that 28 year old i know i don't think there are any 28 year old partners at goldman but there's young partners at goldman they have opportunities to invest in certain vc funds and certain other investments rest of the world can't touch you know and i used to as an aside i used to get very angry when people used to say oh look at this book invest like warren buffett i was like i wish i could invest like warren buffett he's presented with ideas and and investment opportunities that no one would ever give me because he's warren buffett he he gets the special permission i don't get the special permission uh as well too so i think that the tr you know the crypto universe is more democratized people like it because it gives them the opportunities it gives them the opportunities for big gains that only the certain uh few accredited investors is the word we like to use that are allowed in the tradfy world jim in d5 we are pre seeing some pretty uh awesome interest rates on stable coins right uh they they fluctuate because it's d5 but you know typically they've been holding above 10 and 12 and sometimes they they sustain numbers as high as 16 to 20 percent and now to some degree a lot of this is subsidized by token issuance from protocols and perhaps there's a lot more risk when we start yield farming stable coins in d5 but it's all dollar denominated uh you know yield in in defy which is in stark contrast to the very low rates that bonds are offering right now how do you explain this discrepancy between the the yields in defy and the yields in the the bond market and does the inflation conversation have anything to do with this well a lot of the a lot of the trad five bond market is manipulated and it's set by the you know the federal reserve the federal reserve sets short-term interest rates and there's a lot of pro and they and they buy a 120 billion dollars a month of bonds it's a trillion and a half a year all the way out the curve all the way out to the 30-year bond as well so what you see in the um in the tradify world is an administered rate and a lot of people have argued that that administered rate has been artificially low and even some fed officials will admit that uh as well too by the way the best fed officials to listen to are the ones that recently leave the fed then they tell you what they really think instead of just reading talking points wow who are those folks now we should be people dan torillo has done some really good stuff he left the fed in 2017 uh in by the way when he left the fed in 2017 now remember this is before the pandemic he gave a speech at brookings and he said you know the dirty little secret in the fed is they don't have a working model for what causes inflation they really don't understand it and and to my responses that's fine it's a complicated subject but you hold yourself out it's pretending that you've got all the answers and he's trying to say that they really don't have all the answers you would never get that when you're actually still getting a paycheck from the fed but once you leave the fed you can get a lot of interesting kind of those kind of comments uh from federal reserve officials as well too but to your question about stable coins uh i think that what you're seeing in the crypto world is pure supply and demand is that it's set by smart contract it is not administered by somebody giving permission for a certain level of interest rates at this level or that level and not only do you see much higher interest rates but you see a lot more volatility in interest rates if there's anything that's similar to that in the traditional financial world if you looked at interest rates in the 18th century in the 19th century and yeah i have looked at them i studied them they were just as volatile and you saw that kind of movement around the agricultural cycle too that you know if you tried to borrow money and if you tried to borrow money in the spring when all the farmers were borrowing money to plant it was very very high it might be in the high teens if you tried to borrow money in the fall when the farmers were paying back their loans if you know the rates might be one or two percent wash rinse and repeat for the next year uh as well so we've seen this in the in the past when it was more of a free market that was setting rates that you'd see these kind of volatility in interest rates hey guys i hope you're enjoying the episode with jim thus far right after the break we bring up the hayden adams tweet that jim made that got him on our radar and actually on to this podcast which overall just leads us into a conversation of how defy is eating the banks which then leads us into a conversation and jim goes off on one of the best rants i've ever heard on the bank list podcast about how nothing has really fundamentally changed about banks over the last 100 years and it was just really enjoyable to to really hear the passion that jim has and his vitriol for just the antiquated permissioned banking system i really enjoyed that part and then we asked the question will wall street adopt or resist defy and we talk about the different paths that different firms in wall street have laid out in front of them and then jim finishes off with sharing his biggest fears about the future possible regulation that could come to our industry and what we can do about that jim was really a fantastic guest again like i said in the intro one of my favorite boomers to come on to the bankless podcast jim thanks for thanks for sharing all of your insights with us but first before we go into the second half of this show we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bat t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a

market psychology you know boom boom bust and dot coms and and how we can apply that here and also how macro applies to uh crypto so thanks for schooling us jim this has been absolutely fantastic information so far um and i could kind of see why you have a reputation for being kind of a contrarian and a different thinker on some of these subjects like one of the framings you just illustrated even when we're thinking about crypto and d5 that i think is new for me are helpful for me it's not so much you said uh older generations versus generations it's really a matter of incumbents versus inside outsiders right and so the people who are attracted to d fire these kind of contrarian outsiders who don't have ties into you the the the banks it's kind of like bankers versus crypto natives and the bankers will probably be slow to realize these things why because they're getting disrupted by them but let's talk about banks for a minute because this is actually how um you know you've been on our radar for for a while jim it's like your twitter and good comments have heard a lot about you but i think this tweet really uh sealed the deal for david and i were like oh my god we gotta get jim on the show because this is a picture of uh hayden adams we talked about in one of our weekly rollups um i think this was featured in like the wall street journal and it's just hilarious because if you can't see this on youtube we've got the screen up but it's just a picture of hayden adams creator of uniswap of course he's been on the podcast before and he's in this like crazy outsider not a suit and tie crazy outsider looking unicorn t-shirt right he's just kind of like appearing from uh behind the bushes and you said bankers meet your worst nightmare this is hayden adams and he's coming to destroy your effing bank he did not ask for permission he's built it and two years later he's threatening your bank um i love the like choice use of hyperbole there he's like but like there is uh truth to that message and that like here's a guy who created uh some code helped create some code and we we had somebody on the podcast recently i think it was spencer noon who said the value of each line of code in uniswap is about 18 million dollars so he creates some code very small team and now he is disrupting major trading venues right starting with crypto trading venues but how how soon until that nixon leaks into the nasdaq new york stock exchange um so anyway that's what put you on this radar we're like we have to have jim on the podcast to talk about defy which is possibly bank's worst nightmare but can you talk to us because you've been in the belly of the beast what is wrong about the current like what is so bad about the current banking system and financial system that needs to be disrupted well first can i can i give a shout out to hayden adams man you are my hero i think what you've done it's been nothing short of phenomenal and by the way um i'll i was talking to a reporter from a german magazine and they're now thinking that siemens laid you off and then you created you to swap that might go down as one of the worst business decisions in german business history letting you go like that as far as because eventually unispot spreading probably be worth more than siemens uh you know within like four or five years after that happened so i'm just a gigantic fan of of what you've done and just keep going and keep keep disrupting the business let me talk about banks and let me not get pissed off here when i start talking about banks let me stop or get into the right place to be pissed in 1871 western union invented the wire transfer in 1871 and if you wanted to send three hundred dollars to somebody say in san francisco it would cost you three percent and back in 1871 they had to put 300 damn dollars in a pouch on a horse and somebody had to ride it to san francisco it cost you three percent to send money in 1871 in 2021 to do a bank uh took two to four days in 2021 to do a bank transfer a bank i'm sorry a wire transfer not a bank transfer it costs three percent and takes two days not one damn thing has changed in 150 years when it comes to the banking system nothing has changed when you look at remittances across the world there are over a billion migrant workers right now around the world they are working in some of the worst conditions ever either out in the sun or in terrible mines or in awful factory conditions to make some money to send back to their families the average remittance is about 10 to 15 percent they work one month a year to basically pay the bank and it's 500 billion dollars of remittances a year that they're paying the banks for to just send their money back to their family uh we could give them a month of their life back or we could give their families 13 months of pay for 12 months of work by by disrupting these terrible payment rail systems that we have right now they are broken they are just they are highly regressive they create inequality and they create a lot of problems that's why you have 1.7 billion people unbanked around the world and you have tens of millions of people underbanked in the united states as well too they've had 150 years to fix this system the federal reserve has been running the payment rails of the united states for a hundred and seven years and it still takes two days to send money using the federal reserve's payment says oh but don't worry we got fed now coming 107 years later and we might get to real-time payments by 2025 is what their is what their hope is uh for the moment so let's start with this is a terrible system that is slow ineffective expensive and it falls right down on the poor now whenever i say this people are like oh i don't know what you're talking about venmo i could send venmo people money in a second yeah because you're rich you have a bank account you have enough money in the bank that they've already ripped your eyeballs off six ways to sunday with fees that they give you this free little app either venmo or zell and that you could send money to the other people that you're having dinner at uh within one second but boy you've paid for that you've paid for that in a big way before you get to that point but i've as i said if you want to pay 30 bucks to the fro to the guy that uh fit the dinner bill go down the street to a bank you have no relationship with and say i have 30 here i would like to send it to ryan let's see what they charge you for and let's see how long it takes you to send that money that's the problem with the banking system right now is that it has been slow and incumbent and a lot of the regulators are at the fault of it they've been very very slow to actually fix this system within that system there's this mentality of a permission system and i'll give you an example from this week i think this is going on it's a tremendous mistake goldman sachs has got all of their employees back at work full-time starting last monday two days ago jp morgan either next week or the week after is going to have all their employees back full time why are they why is there this zeal by a lot of big bankers to get everybody's got to get back in the damn office 10 hours a day five days a week because their job is to give everybody permission and they take that job very very seriously and we don't want to be giving permission to everybody over zoom in our underwear we want to show that we are serious about giving permission and we want everybody back in the office and why is that going to be such a tremendous mistake because what the pandemic gave to the big banks is a gift it forced them to decentralize send everybody at home let everybody work at home and guess what they had record profits and it worked and in that world they could see we don't need to have this iron control over everything that we think we need nah they didn't decide that they decided they had to go back to 2019 as fast as possible and get everybody back in the office so what they've shown me is not only don't they understand the absolute inequality of the current system especially remittances they really don't get decentralization because you already were decentralized because you sent everybody home and now you're forcing them back into that big building in manhattan to centralize them all over again so when d5 comes and it keeps coming i'm going to keep remembering this and i'm going to keep saying they just don't get it at its core if they can't even let their employees work at home a couple of days a week or trust their employees to do the job that they were paid to do whether it's at home or in the office down the hall from me they're never going to get a permissionless decentralized system as well too so let's start with other than that i have no opinion about the banking system uh is it as far as that it is it is terribly broken in a lot of those regards now you bring in d5 and d5 is looking to fix a lot of those problems stable coins is a potential payment rail um you know on the collateralized lending side with uh with a lot of the lenders as our protocols as well too when it comes to wall street again wall street is you know with their with their order book system again a very capital intensive permission system that only certain people can do certain things with to replace that with the constant product automatic market maker that these are revolutionary changes that on wall street not only don't they some let me back up a year ago they were dismissed out of hand that this is just  by a bunch of kids that doesn't mean anything today they're not sure what to make of it and they're they're they're hoping that they're saying yeah it seems okay but our system is still better uh is is is where they are but they are coming along a year ago no one in the tread fly system was asking me about d5 today i'm doing eight to ten meetings a week with tradfi customers to discuss defy and basically they want to know what it is and how it works and the biggest thing you guys will love this the biggest thing that they seem to fall on i hear this over and over again it's okay i opened the coinbase account i bought some eth where's this defy thing and i was like have you ever thought about moving your money onto like dharma or metamask onto a wallet what's what's the defy app i need to download yeah exactly exactly where's the d5 where's the d5 link on my coinbase uh website you know you know and so that's like the shocking part about it uh as well too and then when you tell them that they have to go do that they get a little bit apprehensive and by the way right um their their attention is a little bit uh uh well-placed the ux experience is terrible at d5 and there's no better experience than lex friedman's podcast with vitalik a couple of weeks ago he was talking about when he got the shiva coins put into his account and he went to target he bought a laptop and he and he called his family to get his private key so he could transfer them into a different account and he said he was stressed and he had to write uh a javascript program you know in order to get that's metallic guys yeah i was like this is the v god his his fingers all tight about sending money to a different way granted vitalik's moving a billion dollars yeah yes but it shouldn't it shouldn't be that stressful and experienced to move any kind of money i mean to this day whenever i move money i always start by paying two gas fees i moved ten dollars okay it worked and then i moved the rest uh because because of the nature of the system so if you really want to get this really want to get the blazer guys into this business the ux experience has got to get better that is is it's you know it's one thing to say that there's no permission if you lose your seed phrase you're done i get that but it's a whole nother thing that oh if you made a mistake and you didn't do the memo line right your money just disappears it's just gone and there's no one that call and ask sorry try again uh and stuff that's that's very very dis uh disquieting for a lot of people i understand it will get better it will get better but right now that is the biggest hurdle that they face what's this electronic wallet thing yeah and stuff like that jim bianco here just spitting fire like as he's talking about the banks like hot content jim like okay so here's what we're talking about here you laid it out i've never heard anyone laid out this way it's super interesting it's basically since 1871 the cost of a wire transfer hasn't changed right so like we live in a world we're talking about inflation earlier but the the gift of humanity that the thing that causes us to progress is actually technology technology is a deflationary uh force that's how we have a better quality of life as as a human species and it's so interesting to me because software has eaten entire industries but it hasn't yet touched the banking industry has it as evidenced by the fact that 1871 to now a wire transfer really hasn't changed it costs the same takes the same amount of time moore's law hasn't even affected it and i think what you're saying here jim is because it's it's basically been been siphoned off like technology hasn't been able to uh impact banking the entire industry until crypto it's been permissioned it's been sort of you know super tightly uh regulated it hasn't been open to any of the innovation that we've seen the internet bring and is that the difference is that what's changing with defy like so the basic thesis is in andreessen horowitz might say is this is um just software eating banking is that what you subscribe to is that what you're talking about here yes yes there's two there's two industries right now that haven't seen the big you know software eating them up and that is financial services and healthcare and what they both have in common is they're heavily heavily regulated and heavily permissioned and it's impossible to break through with those until you get to what defy is is in a decentralized permissionless world which is why like i said i'm a fan of your your your podcasts and boy the the center uh in my mind the center of this conversation is decentralization is that you know i don't think this industry can go forward unless it is becomes truly decentralized and permissionless as an example stable coins have become the bedrock of this industry i think stable coins are going to become the massive use case that are going to bring defy to the real world that i can envision a day where people are using stable coins they are already in asia to some extent uh that they are they're paying for everything from trade finance to a drink at starbucks and then d5 will just burgeon to service all of these stable points but when your two largest stable coins are centralized in tether and in circle and dye has got half of its reserves in tether and encircle this is the wrong business model for these stable coins they have to go fully decentralized permissionless outside of the reach of of the permissioned world there's a story today the day we're talking bloomberg has a story that regulators are alarmed about that stable coins are over a hundred billion in value and that they don't have any backed insurance like fdic behind them or anything else well first of all neither does the dollar you know that's in money market fund that's supposed to have backed insurance or a bank account these are not bank accounts these are mediums of exchange so they fundamentally are me they're confusing the the two together but more to the point what they're also saying to us is because of the centralized natures of tether and circle we can we can do something in that space and we can really for lack of a better way we can really  with these stable coins in a lot of ways and so what we really need is a decentralized permissionless stable coin die is it but it can't be if it keeps using uh tether and circle as its reserves it's got to move beyond that in order to become truly outside of the reach that's when you're going to get the software eating the financial services world when it becomes outside of its reach so jim i just want to ask what is your favorite defy app what's it like to be jim using d5 what's what's a day in the life of jim as a defy user um probably uniswap i love uh i love the um the way that you could trade on uniswapa uh i've become a big fan of the business model of the automatic market maker um right now i could see a lot of applications for it much beyond where we're going elsewhere look what is there if i read you guys can update me on it's like 72 000 liquidity pools on unit swap or some crazy number like that you could never in an order book world get 72 000 actively traded markets like you can um with the automatic market maker that you can in uniswap it is a revolutionary uh it is a revolutionary um idea it is a revolutionary concept and by the way speaking of revolutions i want to throw out another thing too uh there are certain people in life that are so far ahead of everybody else that they become you know it takes the world a generation or two to understand what they were doing shakespeare you know uh da vinci maybe newton uh vitalik's in that category right now because i think you know when he developed the white paper for ethereum what was he still in high school or just months out of high school you know he come up with the concept yeah it was freshman year it was his freshman year uh theo paid him a lot of money to develop it or something like that and then you know the white papers um the ideas on stable coins and quadratic voting and the ideas on the automatic market maker from his reddit post and stuff like that you know it's going to take the rest of humanity a generation or two like einstein to basically grasp what he's doing and that is truly unbelievable what has been happening as long as it stays decentralized if it ever becomes centralized and they keep putting centralization on it then somebody can take it over and somebody can run it and somebody can give permission and then all these ideas go away so i really think the industry really needs to really think about decentralization first second third and fourth but the fact that the stable coins aren't decentralized nobody seems to be bothered by it and throw out another one too michael saylor suggesting a a minor's counsel boy what a terrible idea a miners council is does that mean then i have to join a minors council to be a minor does that mean i need permission from the miners council in order to mine bitcoin i mean it is just antithetical to everything it stands for but yet people like him keep coming back to these decentralized mentalities it's going to take the world a while to break at that so i want to ask jim so um by the way totally agree with you on decentralization right right the hence the title of this whole movement that that we're in which is bankless right let's make this as bankless as possible and if uh you know tether is still a banked product at the end of the day it's just an erc wrapped banked product um so we do want story values and monetary units that are as bankless as possible like i want to get back to like what's good but also what still sucks about d5 right so um you're commenting about the the like people in suits and blazers coming to you and saying hey jim i bought some eth but like where's this defy thing i want to ask you like what is it like for from your perspective how hard is it to move from the coinbase world let's say which is the step that i feel like a lot of people are in right now to the d5 world like so because we've been doing this for for a while sometimes we forget what what it feels like to do the first time the the very first time you send a transaction you're like oh did that like did i do that right like oh we're not there yet oh no yeah yeah like exactly so so uh yeah tell us about that barry because like we we know parts of it still suck and by the way i'll just caveat that this by saying like even though it still sucks now it is so much better than it was a year ago and it's infinitely better than it was three years ago and we're seeing like this massive like progress in user experience but how hard is it still for the guy in a blazer who's in coinbase to get to d5 what's your experience been with that well so keep in mind that the guy in the blazer is also a metaphor for for for the moment the people that have all the money right yes as well too and the guy in the blazer thinks that now i'm talking about people in their 50s and 60s you know and as you get younger you get more depth with technology the guy in the blazer is very happy because he's on the cutting edge because he does a group of texts with his children you know and he thinks that that's high technology for him you know and that he was able to open his coinbase account without asking one of his kids for help man i'm really going along here and i'm really getting this because in their world their world is about making decisions and giving permission and everybody else executes everything under them and in this world they have to kind of learn to do it themselves a little bit because the whole idea about defy isn't you know that uh i want you know you open up an account for me and you go figure out what my seed phrase is and stuff like that it kind of defeats the purpose when you start when you start bringing in people uh because you don't want to do it which is why you see the exploding popularity of like institutional services by coinbase i guess ave starting kind of a permissioned instant or it's centralized excuse me institutional service as well too they're very uh they're they're not ready to make that leap and do it on their own they definitely want somebody's hand held to hold their hand as they go through in this system so yes it is way better i started trading in this stuff in 2017 um as you know just the magic being a bitcoin going up and down and stuff like that that's where i began with it but then really fell in love with it when i started to understand defy uh you know around 2019 and then the summer of uh defy summer last year as well too but to get them to that point where they can shed themselves of that centralization i think is going to take a much better user experience and it's going to be necessary because if all we're going to hope for with defy is that the coinbase institutional business is going to explode orders and orders of magnitude over because they're going to do it for everybody we're not going to get to that decentralized world that we're going to want because there's going to be some level of decentralization or some level of regulation that is going to be stuck on top of this design on top of this d5 world as well too so yeah it is it is kind of a harrowing experience and some of them that have done it feel better for doing it but that's the first thing they say to me man why does it have to be this hard i have said to him you should have seen it a couple of years ago yes i totally agree with you right and yet at the same time you're here you're doing it mark cuban is out here he's doing it like he's taking the journey it's like learning solidity it so here's the other thing i would say when's jamie when's jamie diamond going to do it right but like part of it is part of it is don't you think um they just haven't spent the time to figure it out right so like it does require a time investment it ca at this stage it can be learned but like i remember the early days of the internet you know you had the the clunk you had the the modem and even personal computers were difficult to use right but like yeah right like it took some time to figure out the internet i feel like that's kind of where we are so like no matter what age you are i wonder if you agree with this like no matter what your technical experience what age you are um you can figure it out if you're willing to invest the time we have bill ford who lists in the bankless podcast remember that bill ford shout out bill ford he pings us on twitter all the time bill ford is 77 and he is opening unit swap pools he is a liquidity provider he is like on the journey with us jim so yeah what do you think about that what what would you say to the to that comment one of the things that you see with people that get older and um even in the tradify world a lot of stuff has been trade you know the way that the business is run bond trading is run stock trading is run it's ver is is changed a lot in the last 15 years and a lot of these older people tend to play beat the clock in their head i'm 62. uh this seems like a lot of work to learn this stuff you know what i'll bet i could keep juggling these plates for another three four more years i'll take my gold watch and then the guy's 45 behind me it's his problem to learn it not mine and i'll be and i'll ride off into retirement and my answer to them is always the same this stuff comes on you a lot faster than you think and it and it comes on a lot stronger than you think and i understand that i've heard people i've heard people say that exact phrase to me that you know i don't have the the patience to learn it um i could milk this for another three four more years and then i'm done anyway uh it's a terrible attitude to have because it sounds like you're uninterested in everything in the world but unfortunately that there are people that get to that stage uh as well too so the bill ford's of the world yeah that's great you know that you want to keep reinventing yourself and you want to keep learning and you want to keep pushing boundaries keep you young forever is what is what that will wind up doing but unfortunately there's a lot of people that are just not ready to go there and again what is the other thing that makes them not want to go there they're probably at the top of the heap of the draft world and they're making very good coin in the tradify world and it's suiting them just fine and why do i need to learn what my replacement is going to be i really don't want it to work in the first place you know so there's a little bit of that uh as well too so a thought experiment let's some some of these people that we're talking to the people in the blazers the people who you know are approaching the end of their career but perhaps they are still like financially minded and still kind of want to know what's up with the world of finance some some portion of these people are going to open up a metamask wall and open up a ledger you know trade on union swap many won't what is the incentive for the people who do make it over the hurdle are they coming into defy to get yield on stable coins because that's what interests them are they coming in because they like defy tokens as perhaps a new frontier of capital assets what's going to be the incentive that actually does convince some of these older generations blazer blazer folk to actually come in and play around in this industry i i've what i've said to them is when you come into this industry and you start learning about this industry you're going to see a lot of similarities to the tradify world that you've been dealing with for 25 years in 30 years and you will instantly have a leg up on everybody you know the constant product model or the v3 um you know liquidity curves that's mortgage convexity if you're a mortgage trader and you will you will instantly get that wow i know what this is i deal with this all the time in the mortgage market finding the optimal point on the curve with negative convexity and stuff so a lot of this stuff is not necessarily new to you it's just being presented in a different way the borrowing and lending facilities if you've got any banking experience when you go to an ave or compound you're going to inherently understand what they're doing now you may not understand about the exact protocol and about how you transfer the money in and all that and what you do with your wrapped coin uh with your c die or your a die and what you how you do with that but you'll get that real fast because you understand the concepts of what's going on because the concepts are the same between tradify and d5 as well too so it's not new to the extent that we've developed whole new ways of doing the basics of borrowing and lending they're still the same but we're just doing them in a different way so yeah you could you've got something up on on say maybe the programmer that gets it oh i get how to do this stuff i get how to transfer my money but they may not understand the concepts as much as you do so you do bring something to the table if you want to invest the effort in doing it and you're right a lot do and unfortunately there's some that just you know won't or don't and you know who those are because they've dismissed it as a bunch of people trading useless magic beans because that's usually their their their their self defense mechanism to say that's why i don't need to do this right yeah their cognitive dissonance that's what you're looking for that they don't need to they don't need to invest any time or effort in any of this stuff so instead of uh you know talking about the individual and why the individual might come over and play around in device let's zoom out and talk about wall street as a whole do you see wall street adopting defy and trying to innovate or resisting defy or is there and is there going to be a you know big brain drain out of wall street or are we is wall street going to actually try and like turn the ship uh what do you see as like the more likely outcomes and how do you parse these things apart i'm gonna be a little bit pessimistic and say that wall street's gonna fight this uh all the way down the line until it's forced to accept it and i'll come back to something i said earlier i think the thing that can make everything go is stable coins in that if you get stable coins to the point where they really start to take off in in in asia they are you know looking at the stable coin index and reading some stuff from glass notes my understanding is that stable coins turnover is about 150 a day or 150 billion a day it's about two-thirds of all of the volume because half of it is it's usually a pair with another coin as well too but about a quarter of that is wall-to-wall transfers and what you're seeing more and more especially out of asia is and this is an exact example that it was presented to me is a vietnamese manufacturer owes an indonesian supplier 50 million dollars for raw materials at the end of the month well they could use the vietnamese bank and the indonesian bank and report to both governments and get feed feed feed feed along the way and tax tax tax along the way or i can open up a wallet you can open up a wallet i'll send you 50 million a tether and we're done with this transaction in five minutes uh for a couple of dollars uh as well too as that becomes more and more accepted around the world wall street's gonna have no choice but to basically be dragged into this uh as well because as that becomes more and more accepted the the lending and borrowing con and the automatic market maker they're they're going to be the servicing for for the the basis of these stable coins because these stable coins will be the basis for um the real world application first second of all when it comes to regulation yeah there's a lot of regulation that needs to be sorted out but i think we all look at what i read gets gets me disappointed because they're all looking at it the wrong way you know we got to stop the drug dealers you know the old tropes from five years ago and stuff like that but better regulation or better ideas is how about legal recognition for a dow other than the state of wyoming you know so that you can have dows do a lot more my understanding you guys correct me if i'm wrong on this is one of the reasons visa is doing a deal with circle is because it's uh it's a legally recognized corp organization that it can have a deal with it was afraid of the tether uh uh reserves but it can it would it ever try and do something like that with maker well a dow's not legally recognized so i don't know how they can do a deal with that other than the state of wyoming but that's not enough so if you were to do that how about an explanation of what is a security and what is a token and why don't why doesn't the sec define the two as two separate things instead of not saying anything so we could selectively beat token holders over the head when we want to when it suits our purpose how about giving us a definition of that as well too uh you know so uh how about crimes for rug polls uh you know to like disincentivize that see the problem with all of this is if you start doing that you know give definition for dowels and and what tokens are and and have specific primes for red pools uh then you're starting to acknowledge acceptance of it uh you know and that we're trying to help it move forward i'm just not so sure a lot of the regulators are ready to go that way and that's why it bothers me i'm in the camp they can't stop it in the long run but boy they can make it miserable in the medium term uh before we before we get to the long run and i would like to see see more hester pierces of the world thinking about how can we help this industry grow instead of how do we protect ourselves from it i was just going to ask you about uh hester purse if you've caught some for interviews she did one on the bankless podcast not long ago it did give me a glimmer of hope that there are at least you know some regulators some in government who really want to um foster this industry and i think we've got a lot more to talk about on the the regulation front we want to kind of get your thoughts on that particularly how wall street and regulators uh interact together you know does wall street always get its way but let's let's park that for for a minute um i want to continue talking about this discussion on um what does wall street think about v5 right use this phrase a couple of times um wall street thinking about crypto as like useless magic beans which is interesting because that is kind of a framework for bitcoin if you don't believe it is a store of value new monetary phenomenon if you don't believe in kind of the the mean backed nature of this strange internet currency then yeah it's just a useless magic bean but we've had some folks on like matt hogan i don't know if you know who that is from from bitwise say things like yeah wall street and institutional investors they don't understand some of them don't understand new monetary phenomenons like bitcoin but they do understand defy tokens why because these are capital assets that they can model the way they model equities net present value future cash flows what's the growth growth of this thing going to look like like back to the what we were talking about with unit swap is my god what a what a uh tech success story right um kid like first software project like the mark zuckerberg story i guess just decentralized um he creates this protocol a few hundred lines of code now it's doing hundreds of millions a month in volume it's got the biggest um liquidity pool of any decentralized market in the world it's competing against coinbase like what a story don't you want to own the capital asset behind that story and so you're talking about like um wall street adoption wall street likes to make money right jim like i've heard that about them and there's money in these defy capital assets um talk talk to us about that do you think defy tokens are actually an easier pitch than an asset like bitcoin yeah they are an easier pitch because they do understand them and a quick word about those we're just so you know where i'm at i i think that bitcoin and d5 are two sides of the same coin the biggest the best thing that's happened to uh bitcoin is d5 and and the thing that has helped defy go is that bitcoin existed in the first place they need each other that's the way i look at it that's why i have no patience for the maximalist argument you know that the you know the day that everything but bitcoin goes to zero i'll i'll i'll buy your bitcoins off you for 10 bucks a piece because that's about what they'll be worth at that point you want to know what's going to get bitcoin a half a million dollars eat the 10 000 plus i mean it's it's those two things are i mean i believe the flipping will happen too uh but those two things are not unrelated to each other i don't understand this argument that we have to war with the other side of the crypto universe you're worrying with the trad five guys is really what you're wearing with you're wearing with the regulators but yeah to your question they they they understand they understand the tokens because it's so similar to what they've seen in this space and ultimately i'm in the jeff dorman camp right that i could see a day in the future where a company's capital structure is not just stocks and bonds but it's a whole variation of tokens as well too tokens that represent assets or future liabilities or intellectual property or or anything along the way that they could uh uh fee generated income and anything else a trillion dollars a year of m a is done on wall street why is a trillion dollars of m a done in wall street because the traditional model of stocks and bonds is inefficient and companies and and m a mergers and vc firms will come in and they'll buy these companies because they think that they can unlock value because of the inefficiencies of the current system and again the problem is is that the people that tend to buy these companies go private you and i can't invest in these in these private equity firms because we're not accredited investors and we don't know who they are and we don't have the high dollar amount the minimums that we can invest in uh as well too but you break that down into a token world and then all of a sudden anybody can start to start looking at that value as well too and i'm going to channel my interdep jeff dorman again the the token world can open up whole new possibilities to a lot of other companies metcalfe's law with network effects it works with tesla it works with apple why because who owns an apple product or who owns a tesla probably people that also own those stocks as well too now go look at dollar tree or go look at mcdonald's how many of their customers actually own their stocks very very few but if you introduced a token that represented some kind of value that was cheap and maybe gave you a break on a meal at mcdonald's and you bought this token and you got some some um uh you know 10 or 15 off on a meal i'm making this up as i go along and you participated in the success of mcdonald's and its price went up the token price went up you've you've become an advocate for those firm just like the great thing that tesla has is what does somebody who pays 150 000 for a tesla probably also have the stock and that they run around and tell everybody how great the company is because they benefit if the stock goes up boy would mcdonald's love to have that relationship too they can't with the current equity system it's shut out too many of those people that typically eat at mcdonald's but a token world could open it up to them so there's a lot that can be done with tokens that you know we're just scratching the surface on and wall street is starting to pick up on this you talk to a lot of wall streeters you know about investing in d5 you'll hear a phrase picks and shovels pits and shovels that they all want to invest in the picks and troubles right they all want to be in the chart or they want to be in chain link or they want to be in some other uh thing that you know rend or some other thing that is is is working on interoperability or something along those lines and that's great and that's great and that's necessary but why not move beyond that a little bit and they're not quite ready to go there but if we could get a definition of what a token is and open up all of the use cases for tokens beyond what we've got now you could definitely see a lot of more forward-thinking wall streeters start looking at these tremendous opportunities that tokens can bring to the capital structure of a firm or to a network effect to a company like a mcdonald's or a dollar tree that can't get a network effect between its customers and its shareholders uh right now so a lot that can be done in this space and we're just beginning with it so jim this is kind of the hope right so like david and i can't go on cnbc but you can like we consider you a part of um wall street as it were right kind of a bridge right jeff dorman's another who's a bridge matt hogan from bitwise tons of these bridges are being built to educate wall street on what these tokens can do and the hope really is that there's enough winds for large corporations for wall street um for even incumbents that are willing to kind of move first that that that can fuel crypto adoption now i want to pick up this thread because i think it's related yeah go ahead and just say just say a quick word the problem with cnbc or bloomberg tv is they've had me on and it's like yeah yeah because the question is so bitcoin broke forty thousand is it going to fifty thousand or is it going to go to thirty thousand you know and they just wanna talk about the horse race so where the yeah they wanted to talk about the horse race and where the coins gonna go next and when you try and bring in um you know start talking about d5 in fact one interview i was on and i was trying to bring up d5 the guy cut me off and he goes do you think dogecoin's going to go to a doll that's all they want to talk about so it's going to take a while it's going to take a while for them to get there as well too and maybe maybe new media sources will arise what do you think about that david in in their said um anyways new media sources have arise because the thing about it is uh i'll say this finally because you know just between you and me whisper look at the yeah look at their ratings i bet this podcast is beating a lot of the tv shows that you're talking about right think about that david yeah i think you know because their ratings are not quite as what you think they are uh right now now they're they you know the problem with the cnbcs and the bloombergs and the fox businesses of the world is they're the the economic equivalent of the weather channel right everybody watches them when there's a hurricane you know so when the markets when the markets blew up last year you know everybody was tuned in but when the markets get quiet like they are now you've got nothing to talk about because they're not talking about long-term things you're not talking about fundamentals that's what you do are you weak here on bankless right right so so let's say there are enough wins for wall street and some of them comments to get on board because as i said there could be some wins here um like can we talk about let's pick up that thread on regulation for a minute because i want to understand really how that works so in your experience i think a lot of crypto people tend to think of the big banks and existing government regulators as not one in the same but tied together and i want to ask you if that assumption is is actually true so like whether wall street is pro crypto or not and maybe they're kind of neutral they're uncertain about it at this phase let's characterize them as that um if they got on board with crypto does wall street get what wall street wants if if big bankers and wall street there are enough wins here are are these the movers and shakers who actually are able to go to regulators and uh make things happen is that how this game is played jim what have you seen in your experience there is you know the phrase is there is a lot of regulatory capture uh in in this business and regulatory capture in english means that you know i i work at the fed and then um when i decide to leave the fed i usually go to work for wall street and so no one that is a regular i'm talking about in the regulatory capacity no one wants to crap on wall street because it's a potential future employer uh you know and the same thing happens you know with the sec you know if i'm an sec guy and i wanna you know there's a there's a nice plush general counsel job waiting for me at some bank or some brokerage firm so yeah you know you want it you want to figure it out the bad actors but you don't want to get too you don't want to get too tough on on wall street uh as well too i mean gamestop is is is is a good example of that we still have to talk about you know protecting everybody from robin hood but not about the decision to made to stop trading the you know stop trading gamestop on the thursday that everything was going crazy and who did that benefit and what was the purpose of that so there is that regulatory capture there's no doubt about that and then on the regulator side um dan berkowitz who's a cftc uh commissioner gave what i thought was a terrible speech um like two weeks ago and basically was saying that defy is illegal according to the commodity exchange authority act and that maybe we should be thinking about shutting it all down um because their their existence is i've got these laws and i'm supposed to follow these laws and it's given me a good career and this is my reason for being is to make sure that wall street follows all these laws and you guys over here in the defy world you're not following the laws well they're innovating no no no no it says on page four that this is the way it's supposed to work and it doesn't look like you're following page four over there so we got to shut you down that seems i haven't read page four yeah that that seems to be a big mentality that you've got out of something like i said you've got the hester pierces gary gensler should know this um but what a what i'm afraid of is they are two voices that might argue for it behind the scenes but you have to convince the jay powells and the janet yellens of the world that this is the way that they want to go and by their public speeches they don't seem to be ready to go there as well too so this is going to be the problem with regulation you know you've heard this i've heard jamie dimon say this too um you know i'll summarize what he said me jp morgan i got 30 000 pages of regulations i have to adhere to every day go hand those 30 000 pages to hayden and tell him it's his problem now too he's got to follow the same 30 000 pages that i have to follow and that's that's the way that they want to hopefully shut it down is they want to say you have to follow the same rules that we have to follow and i'll give you a great example of that so the fed has its payment via uh you know the fed has its payment rails kraken bank kraken bank which is a subsidiary of the cracking exchange wants access to the fed's payment rails what they want to be able to do is transfer crypto i'm sorry transfer fiat they don't want to do maturity transformation they don't want to hand out loans they don't want to give you a free toaster if you open an account they just want to be able to use the fed's payment rails narrowly to transfer money it's out for review and all of the banks have come back with their comments to the fed basically saying they have to adhere to every one of those 30 000 pages of regulations like we do even though they're just doing this one tiny little thing they just want to be able to transfer money using the fed's payment rails that's the way that their mentality is that they use regulation as a moat they use it as a moat to keep everybody out and that's why i come back to what i say before without decentralization you're not going anywhere and you have to get decentralized as fast as you can so that though they can't reach you and a final thought on this um i still think that when it comes to defy and it comes to what you're seeing in the crypto world the us and the world is fairly behind everybody else especially in asia and especially in the developed and in the third world they're ahead of us uh as well too if you look at what's going on in india with the payment rails that they've got in india they've got now i think it's called ucp a system where you can use you can pay now with a fingerprint or a retinal scan so if you go to a store you can actually put your finger on on the little device and pay you don't even need your phone anymore they're way ahead of us and it's instantaneous payments as well too there's over a billion electronic wallets in the third world connected to shaky c5 uh you know shaky c5 institutions or in kenya m pesa is a gigantic success story it is a it is a peer-to-peer phone to phone uh money transfer system there are subsistent farmers that live in mud huts in kenya that are basically when they're out maybe even behind an accident and they need to pay for stuff they're they're sending the money with their phone to somebody else in another town to get something to their phone hell they're ahead of they're ahead of all the bros in midtown manhattan paying for their lattes at this point the rest of the world is way ahead of us they're just waiting for this they've got the apps they've got the phones they know how to use it they are and they're moving forward with it and if we're going to slam down on everybody in the u.s and the eu's going to follow us and slam down and everybody else as i'd like to say the new financial world is going to be developed in one of two ways with us or without us and if we're gonna over regulate this and keep mumbling about drug dealers and ransom and that we have to shut all this stuff down then the rest of the world to just do it without us and we'll be in a much worse position than if they do it with us so that's why i think we're at an important crossroad when it comes to regulation again i don't think they could shut it down with regulation but don't underestimate how awful they can make it with regulation before we escape the clutches of the regulatory reach and get to a truly defi uh decentralized world yeah i like i agree with these takes jim and like it reflects something that like mark cuban's been talking about too another defy user uh is basically like his worry is um the us will get left behind if it imposes restrict because it's not like you're going to actually shut dphy down you're just going to make it difficult for the next unit swap to rise within your borders right and so like you could lose the next wall street might be on ethereum and like distribute a different different country and wall street becomes irrelevant in in that situation i want to ask you this jim so like how do you feel like what's your gut take on how this is going to shake out so one possible scenario is at some point you know government call regulators like kind of final boss final boss raises its head and says uh uh uh here's what you need to do um and then like innovation floods outside of the us for instance to other geographies where it's less restrictive and then the u.s kind of cools down on that do you think that will play out or do you think that there's a chance i'm we're just looking for a chance i tweeted this out the other day is there anybody in in congress who's actually used d5 before is there a chance that we get more hester pierces who are actually open to this innovation and they leave the us open to the possibility and to the blossoming of defy within its borders what's your gut on how this is gonna play out here uh i think it's gonna in the in the long run it's gonna play out as a win in the short run let's talk about what we're trying to say straight up uh money is a public good we're trying to turn it into a private good uh we're trying to get away from government control of money boy that's a very very powerful thing you know the government control of money which is why the only crowd that i detest more than the maximalist crowd is the crowd on twitter that keeps you know you know kind of taunting me oh they're going to shut it down and you're going to feel like an idiot once they've shut it all down and i've said i call them the stockholm syndrome crowd that you know you've you've been you know the stockholm syndrome is is that you've been a hostage for so long you've now taken sympathy with your captors and you're now actively rooting for your captors to win you know and i was like you know wall street you know they'll shut this down and wall street will continue and i was like and that makes your life better how is what i've always as as i've always said because the current financial system is improving what well if you're at the top of the heap it improves it quite a bit but for everybody else it really doesn't so i think that there's going to be some kind of a pushback on this because what you're going to hear what they're hearing from the big financial firms i think is we can't compete like this because you've strangled us with all this regulation and so the answer is that the wall street firms are going to say get rid of this regulation and let me compete with them they're going to say go strangle them too it's basically what they're going to do make it a fair and even playing field that's what that means that means bury them with regulations make sure that the uniswap trust needs to hire 500 lawyers in order to basically operate every day uh as well too that's what they're gonna try and do and it's up to this space to be put in a position where they can't do it uh as well i've heard some outrageous things that regulators are thinking about i don't know if you guys have heard this too but they're not talking about this idea about liability for the creators of smart contracts so if somebody uses uniswap for an illegal transaction i guess they're going to arrest hayden is what they're suggesting or some something like that now these are fringe elements within the um you know within the anti-defy or anti-crypto world among regulators but this is the kind of things that they're thinking about and so yeah it's going to be a bumpy road but what else is new in the d5 world it's already been a bumpy road to get to this point but really hopefully where it will go is let's use the uber mom and what i mean by the uber model is okay so the ride shares came up and everybody loved it and everybody was on the right ships and then the city councils and the mayor said we have got to deal with these with these taxi companies that they've got these exclusive rights we got to shut down the right shares and the constituents said no we like this don't touch it that's right for permission right the ux has got to get better you got to get more people on the system so when they push back with the regulations everybody says no you leave it alone i like it the way it is uh as well and you've got to get that you've got to get people into this space a lot more when you get to that critical mass then it'll be like you know like the ubers of the world that lots of mayors wanted to shut it down lots of mayors were getting campaign contributions from taxi companies but they they politically couldn't because it became too popular it's what you got to get to the d5 space i think it will get there it will get there but it's still not there yet guys what jim is saying is a billion or bust that's that's why in the mission we're on with respect to education is like we need a billion people on the d5 journey in in order to uh turn the tide here that's also very like what that's also been one of the the side goals of bankless is and also why we call it the bankless nation because one day like there's going to be a call to arms because we are going to need the the bankless nation to rise up and put a a foot down and say like no no no like this is our industry like we we regulate ourselves here i was going to say isn't there a couple of improvement proposals among some of the protocols to band together to create like an education fund or an education group basically to send to washington to kind of walk the halls of congress to kind of teach them what this space is about i think that's great you know when they're not advocating for regulate if i understand it correctly you guys correct me they're not advocating for regulation or anything else but they just the next time somebody in washington just starts mumbling that only drug dealers use crypto that somebody should be in their office the next day to say let me explain this to you let me understand there's this thing you know ether scan and it isn't as dark as you think it is and there's a lot of other things that about this space that you you're getting misinformation about that would be great because they got to be careful look at the the poker industry right the pope when when online poker became popular 10 years ago everybody was was doing it the government decided that they didn't like it but the poker um the poker sites a guy who works with me was big on the poker sites he would say i would be getting a check for my withdrawals from a different foreign bank every month because the poker guys thought that they were brilliant that they kept jumping one step ahead of the regulators then they realized that whatever made everything go was neteller which was like their version of coinbase they just shut that down and they ended the poker business uh as well too my point is to take that hard-nosed libertarian attitude yeah i get it that it's intellectually satisfying to do that but do you also want to win and you got to work within the system that we have as well too and that education idea is a great idea to work within look this is the this is the deck we have that's the tradify world that we have the regulatory world we have and we could argue and i have that it's broken okay but the answer is not that we're just going to completely dynamite it and pretend that it doesn't exist we got to work with it to solve to change it into what we want it to be and if we fight it we might wind up and i don't think we are but we might wind up like the uh like the like the online poker guys were 10 years ago they'll just slam that sucker down and then that's the end of everything and if you had money in a poker account it was gone tough at that point yeah and shout out to the coin center guys who are really the the people that are working with congressman to really illuminate the the positives of this industry and make sure that disinformation stops sooner rather than later that's definitely definitely our spearhead of uh for the industry with with regards to regulators jim as as we come to a close here you've been a a journeyman of many many market cycles in many many different markets and the average listener of the banknotes podcast is uh you know gen x zoomer younger folk perhaps their first entrance really into finance i know crypto is was my first entrance into finance um and in in the the crypto world we tend to get really caught up in the short term right we focus on the next two to six months but as someone who's played in the markets for for decades what advice do you have for people who you know just haven't experienced as much as you've had as you've had in in different financial markets how can people just you know keep grounded and what advice do you have for people playing in in these markets in the long term you know i think that what they need to understand is first of all education education education why are you doing what you're doing what do you think you're gonna get out of it uh even if it is that you're chasing some hot meme coin or something like that okay well what's it gonna take for your hot meme coin to fall out of favor because they always do it seems like at some point or another do you really understand some of the things that you're saying yeah yesterday uh kim kardashian was tweeting about ethereum max burned 400 trillion coins or something like that and we were laughing does she know that ethereum x is not ethereum and does she understand what's burning 400 trillion coins actually means i don't think so yeah exactly so so just don't repeat these things that you hear other people say but fully understand what what you're doing expect a lot of volatility in new technologies um whether it was you know the the digging of the canals in the early 19th century you know to the internet to what we're doing in crypto now there is always wild booms and busts along the way and there's always going to be some dark days and i'll give you one quick example let's say it was 1999 and i came to you and uh i said e-commerce is gonna be the biggest thing you've ever seen and he said okay great what are the two big plays pets.com and amazon by all late 2001 pets.com went bankrupt and you lost 100 of your money amazon stock went from a hundred dollars to six and you lost 94 of your money in the other one you would have said in late 001 well i guess that e-commerce thing busted and it's not going to really work well then amazon went from six to thirty three hundred after that and we all know what happened to e-commerce later and by the way we now have chewy which is what pets.com was trying to be for years earlier so the other thing to keep in mind is that there is the concept that we've got this defy crypto world that's going to grow and grow and grow and then we've got the protocols because people said to me well if it's so easy everybody's going to make money it's like well hold on a minute here you might think that i might think that d5 is going to be the biggest thing going but i bought a bunch of pets.com and i bought a bunch of protocols that went to zero because i think the majority of the protocols go to zero but the ones that don't redefine everything that's easy to say and it's very hard to do yes uniswap looks like it's going to be one of the redefining protocols of our lifetime so did yahoo and then google came along after that i'm not saying there's going to be son of uniswap that's going to be better but i don't know that there won't be either so keep an open mind about this stuff and don't get married to these ideas that you know that that this coin or that coiner or you know matic is going to change the world and that it's that there's no scenario where it would never not change the world well there will be someday uh as well too there always is so i mean that's kind of the best thing i could say is that um or as a old mentor of mine said when it comes to investing you always want to be a renter not an owner a renter means you want to you'll be willing to get out of the position when things change because they change and you're willing to get in the position when things change and make it more attractive as well too and yes you could be a renter over a longer period of time not just a short-term speculator but yeah i believe in the defy space i do think that a lot of the protocols will go away everybody thinks that and i do think it's going to be a lot harder to pick those protocols that are going to be the giants in 10 years than it does like now because a lot of those protocols that are being the giants in 10 years might not exist today they might still be to come um as well too because it's very very early days jim let's uh let's see the shirt we haven't gotten a good look at the shirt yet classic all right for the podcast listeners it's the classic evolution of man and we go also simultaneously from seashells to gold to coins to credit cards to bitcoin uh thanks for wearing the shirt that's that awesome shirt i need to get one of those yeah thank you jim it's been fantastic to have you thanks so much for joining us on bankless i enjoyed it thanks guys guys so many good lessons there in this conversation with uh jim bianco i was reminded as jim was talking about amazon and losing 94 percent of its value that's exactly what eth lost from the top in 2018 to the bottom uh somewhere 20 19 20 20. 95 of its value 1400 all the way to 80. we are here of course because we believe in this bankless movement over the long run it sounds like we are gaining allies as we go jim is one of those maybe wall street is coming next some action items for you follow jim on twitter at bianco research a great twitter account and uh he he drops insights like the kind he he dropped in this podcast on the regular um also david how we doing on those five-star reviews my friend we i think we need some more because we we could always use some more but what's the status yeah well jim says that more people listen to bank list than some of the tv finance news shows that that are out there and i think we should double down on that and if we could get uh bank list to the top of the itunes business and investing charts that's how we would get that done maybe we maybe will be hosting the the future of finance commentators like jim bianco here but only if we get those five-star reviews so if you could give us those five-star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts we would greatly appreciate it there you go guys bankless not bloomberg risks and disclaimers of course bitcoin is risky eath is risky d5 is risky everything in this space should have caution
