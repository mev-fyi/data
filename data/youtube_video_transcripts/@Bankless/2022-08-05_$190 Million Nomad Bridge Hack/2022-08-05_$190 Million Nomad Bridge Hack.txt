bridge called nomad was drained of nearly 200 million dollars the person that really unpacked this the best is a sam c sun who put a thread together sam says nomad just got drained for over 150 million in one of the most chaotic hacks that web3 has ever seen it all started when a telegram account shared twitter accounts tweet although i had no idea what was going on at the time the sheer volume of assets leaving the bridge was clearly a bad sign and then the next one is oops and basically sam just put in 0x000000 as an address and it comes back true meaning that every single thing will come back true meaning that the bridge is like an open vault it turns out during a routine upgrade that the nomad team initialized the trusted route 2b 0x000 unfortunately in this case it had the tiny side effect of auto proving every message as in like hey can you send me 100 wptc approved attackers abused this to copy and paste transactions and quickly drain the bridge in a frenzied free-for-all once one person realized it everyone realized it the gates to the vault were open and all the money was just like sitting there no one realized it for 43 days
