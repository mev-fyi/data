well my advice will start from what we realized in ukraine at some point we realized that there's a huge blockchain community there are a lot of people that using crypto and you can't ignore it so if you're a true leader of the country take care of your people want to take care of people make it official welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a special guest on the show today the deputy minister of digital transformation of ukraine alex bornyakov we are talking to alex all about what's going on in ukraine a few things that we discuss number one how crypto is helping ukraine in a time of war number two why ukraine's government is adopting a crypto friendly policy as a result of this and number three his advice for other countries considering crypto policy we're talking to someone who is in an active uh conflict zone an active war zone of course uh we've never done this before on bankless but crypto has become very relevant actually to the story of ukraine and i think is an example of the the type of impact that this technology can have on the world david we got introduced in in kind of an interesting way to uh to alex could you uh talk about that introduction yeah we got introduced to alex via vitalik buter and vitalik and i were passing messages in telegram about who best to bring on from ukraine to tell the story about crypto in ukraine and we landed on the the deputy minister of digital transformation himself who uh vitalik was in contact with previously so vitalik introduced us and uh we just immediately hit it off in in telegrams to schedule a quick podcast just to get the story out the door so this is an official representative out of the ukrainian government telling the story about how crypto has moved the needle in ukraine uh so uh an unscheduled podcast but you know when when vitalik buterin connects you with somebody straight from the ukrainian government uh you make a podcast uh so that that is what we did um and he helped really tell the story of the details of what it's like as a government to use crypto funds to make things happen quickly and meaningfully when it comes time to saving lives uh and so there's uh there's a lot of um previous ideology and uh philosophy and i ideation about how crypto can help the world but uh every once in a while the world presents you with an actual story to to really illustrate like this is what when when things get real uh crypto is there uh and so alex is here to help us tell that story of how things got real in ukraine and how crypto was there for the people of ukraine and the government of ukraine over 60 million dollars in crypto donations coming through on um a crypto address is controlled by the ukrainian government which is absolutely insane they're actually uh talking about releasing nfts as well alex talks about all of these things uh and this legislation that just went forward to approve crypto you know a set of laws basically to make ukraine a crypto friendly jurisdiction we get into that as well but that's been a result of the conflict and uh been as a result of ukraine using crypto for real utility during a time of war so david any last thoughts before we get in yeah i mean there are a number of u.s congressmen congresswoman and eu uh political leaders who i know listen to bank list so i would just like to say that as soon as ukraine uh was faced with the opportunity to use crypto they started adopting crypto friendly regulation so i think this is perhaps going to be uh a lesson a lesson to learn a lesson to pay attention to that crypto helps entire countries when they need it guys we're going to get right into the episode with alex but before we do we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this

ukraine we're going to be talking about ukraine's recent embrace of crypto in the midst of war uh alex uh we have never actually recorded with an episode with someone who's in the middle of war so can we start with can you just tell us how are you doing how is ukraine doing um well i'm fine and of course uh that's sir that's what's going on is really terrible and horrible um so far almost half of the territory well less maybe like 40 of the ukrainian territory uh being under different uh um difficult times um so in some in some part of ukraine there's actual war zone some part just experiencing shortage in everything is in some cities there is no heat and electricity and a lot of cities being shelled even kiev so when it's all started i was in kiev and i spent two almost two days and i woke up from explosions and there was and then during their next 24 hours there was instant like sirens going and you had to go to shelter so but there was light there was connection uh and it's still there um but uh it's not safe on around forty percent of ukrainian territory so it but even in the in a distant part they they they fire ballistic rockets uh to as they say to destroy military infrastructure but sometimes it's just missing and people dying so well that's that's terrible and what we're holding up uh we're trying to make our bed our best we do our best to keep going to or do our job and everyone has to do a job because we believe we're going to win and we need to restore this and there's so much work ahead of us but thank you and we really appreciate you a lot of people from from us from canada from european union from other countries are standing with us and that's really inspiring for all ukrainians that a lot of countries support us in this difficult times alex that's definitely something that i've noticed both inside of ukraine and outside of ukraine is there seems to be an immense amount of unity going on and at least from the outside perspective at least initially in the first few weeks of the war we saw just a surprising amount of high morale out of ukraine but i'm wondering how that's been holding up now that we're beyond 15 days into this thing how is the morale on on on the ground at ukraine i like short answer is what what i personally experience is pretty much high the morale is is is beyond i think anyone's expectations um people in ukraine are really united and according to the latest poll that i that i'm aware of uh 92 percent and even 92 percent of ukrainians believe that we're going to win this war and during the first 96 hours is really hectic and this news was were horrible because they were advancing and it was just so many people were afraid of uh what's going on what's gonna happen and they were fleeing country uh in in rush but now it's a kind of stabilized our military forces stopped them on almost on all directions and pushed back on several uh directions especially around kiev which is kind of like a heart of ukraine and it's located in in the middle of the country um so now i see like we can kind of uh plan at least her term and maybe mid-term but during the first week it was not possible because the situation was changing uh dramatically every couple hours and and people were really upset but now i think morale is high but we experience like the wars you know in our country it came to our homes and it's and like if for russians and for rest of the world maybe just news but uh for ukrainians it's just it's losing their for you losing your friends you're losing you hear like people you know losing their uh properties uh and and they worry about their relatives they lost they're losing connection with the relatives in in a war zone so it's it's it's a it's a strategy it's a huge strategy so but generally we we're have high hopes well of course alex our hearts go out to everyone that's been affected by this it's obviously the last thing that everyone wants to see happen to the world uh alex we were introduced by vitalik buterin and because of your your role in the ukrainian government you are the the deputy minister of digital transformation what does that mean what does your your job entail what what are your goals as deputy minister of digital transfer transformation well sure um ministry of digital transformation was created not so long ago it was like we are two years plus a couple months old so there was there was a couple major goals that was set up uh like we have envisioned and uh one of them uh is to develop and grow the i.t industry of ukraine so i'm basically like as a deputy minister i'm in charge of uh growth and development of i.t industry and of course i.t industry in involves crypto and with this significa we believe that there's a significant part of it so once uh right after i started we immediately um announced that we want to become crypto friendly jurisdiction and we want to do what we can in order to uh uh make uh crypto and all the virtual assets legal in ukraine uh but uh like generally speaking as a deputy minister uh i was i was in charge of couple projects like we built a project called dacd it's a sort of like a silicon valley valley for rit companies with low taxes with other a lot of other benefits um we were introducing electronic residency for those who want to do business in ukraine but don't want to go into your country physically um and um and many many more uh initiated much more initiatives that we were doing um so um i hope i give you a sense of uh what i'm what i was doing before the war and of course it's dramatically changed after the war yeah uh alex i want to get a perspective of uh what cr crypto in ukraine was like before these events have unfolded uh from from our perspective there's been a number of projects uh that that ryan and i pay attention to that have sent out messages saying hey progress is going to be a little bit slow due to the number of developers that are in the middle of fighting a war at the moment and so there's a lot of developers that we have connections to that are in ukraine and have had to uh just you know pause whatever they're working on in the in the crypto space and so for there's a ukraine hosts a disproportionate amount of crypto developers but also what was the attitude of like the ukraine government the centralized ukraine government about crypto prior to this like was crypto on the radar because it's certainly on the radar now what was what was the attitude about crypto before these events have unfolded well of course most of the governor was pretty much skeptic about crypto and you have no idea how how much efforts did it cost to convince people to make them believe that it's it's going to turn to something bigger so um when i when i started to do this bitcoin cost was around 3 3 500 so it is just on the low and we're gonna everyone was like why are we even dealing with it but then um but of course we believe in crypto and as a minister of digital transformation we define policy of the government regarding specific um items or directions i would i would call this and uh if we speak that crypto is a priority it also becomes a part of government priority so in the each ministry gives its priority so it becomes like generally government priorities so it was put in government priorities but then you have to convince national bank of ukraine ministry of finance uh security commission uh financial monitoring services so there's a lot of authorities that uh related to crypto and of course if you even you consider crypto is priority they don't so you have to convince them and uh then crypto went to like rocketed to 60 000 per uh bitcoin price and it was um and of course this is another uh portion of attention from them they said like all right right so let's let's uh let's do that faster so eventually we managed to um uh vote their long virtual assets which basically about crypt and uh pass it through paul polliman um but then uh war hit us but the good news that once we started the fund uh and everyone saw that how how successful it was and it is how successful it is right now uh president zelinski sign eventually signed this law and we are working on taxation legislation and other um uh official papers that we have to do before this all goes live and and now um no one actually argues about that that krypto is uh uh is not priority so i think everyone understand how it works now so that's that's the good news alex it's funny that much of the before that you just described um i think fits a lot of jurisdictions across the world a lot of countries across the world where it's hard for any sort of digital transformation group internal to the government to actually get government officials and the rest of the government uh to to talk about crypto it's hard to get it on their radar and sometimes when they do these governments are are hostile but what you're describing is you know first of all there was these champions internally to ukraine like yourself who are sort of pushing this this pro crypto agenda forward um but can you tell people bankless listeners who haven't uh been maybe haven't seen what's gone on you you mentioned a crypto fund for ukraine uh what is that and how much money has ukraine actually raised in crypto so far because it seems like that has completely changed the tone and tenor of the conversation about crypto's utility in ukraine so tell us about this fund and what's been raised yeah so again during the first days of war our national bank's very limited ability to send foreign transfers especially especially in a dollar in europe so we have to somehow find a solution to cover immediate needs for armed force of ukraine and and and then that was uh this was one of the decisions of like of nikhil ferderos he said like listen we need let's set up a fund and do this with their private exchange uh uh and make it uh so we can uh push it and and tell everyone that we also accept the nations in in crypto and um we and and then when money started to flow in uh we were able to quickly perform the transactions and and maybe for the first days uh the crypto was our first choice for that and so crypto really helped us because we were able to cover those needs and um so far it managed we managed to cover together like 62 million dollars around that um and but again as as the war has continued we have uh refined an approach and we launched the official website or where people can uh donate the cryptocurrencies and and different talk so we started from bitcoin ethereum and tether but then we started to add a lot of others uh so and we so much appreciate it for like gavin wood responded with five million dollar donation through polkadot then um there uh also donated like million dollars in hbar uh we also connected uh dodgecoin monero icon casper solana solano community was very helpful and ever statement so uh we were like uh one this was beyond expectations that that crypto community is so into it so they they eager to help and of course uh this step that we have taken so we announced that we able to get officially the nation in crypto it it reflected in in in their mind and they decided to help so this is this is that's absolutely it's absolutely incredible and we're going to provide some more information on that fund and where where the crypto community can can actually continue to donate because i assume alex you guys are continuing to accept funds yes as we go and over 60 million dollars is this all coming from individuals and organizations in the crypto community is this where this money's coming from um well i mentioned some organizations who are donated but um the majority of the funds i think coming from from individuals and um we we actually haven't analyzed uh who exactly donated uh and uh where this money comes coming from well uh wait for uh to be quite fair um we need to understand this is it it's it's uh pretty hard to find out uh yes the most of the nations where they come from yeah so um that i think part of the reason the crypto community has uh rallied around this is because cryptos is definitely a movement for freedom and sovereignty and i think many of the crypto communities see what what you're doing uh your resistance in ukraine as as part and parcel with that but can i ask you alex what has ukraine done so far with the funds uh have you done anything with it or what are they allocated to um to to go uh fund well before i answer the sorry question i i would like to mention also this is very uh i think that's very important to the community that um after x uh managed to establish relationship with the national bank of ukraine and they actually created a bridge to convert crypto into fiat currencies with the help of national bank of ukraine and so ever stake uh helped to facilitate this and fdx and uh national bank this is like this is the this is a precedent because that it's not never happened before and i i know they're it's it's outside of our fund but i just want to mention that this is example of uh integration of the government structures and and private crypto private institutions like international uh how they communicate how they cooperate with each other and i hope this is going to be your again a president president for uh for other things that crypto companies can do with the government um about the fund itself so so far we we have spent around 35 30 sectors close to 36 million dollars and uh we purchased thousands of bulletproof glass helmets uh medicines [Music] medicine packages we purchased a couple hundred thousands of uh food rations for for ukrainian militaries uh thousands of thermal um imagers optics night vision goggles uh so this all goes to to the army to to our defenders so uh we're gonna by the way we're gonna provide with their more statistics and and and um reports on what being purchased and um uh for for instance like hbar they told we wanna uh support just humanitarian needs so we bought just uh [Music] uh what's this called uh mobile uh uh eight packages uh i mean if you're injured in a battlefield then you can quickly uh fix your so that's so we we respond to every request actually alex you mentioned that the uh traditional banking system uh stopped being so useful at the onset of the war how has access to these crypto funds uh uh enabled ukraine to access resources when the banking system uh stopped working so well like what about the properties of crypto the the instant finality the instant settlement instant transfers and also global transfers how have these properties really enabled crypto or really enabled ukraine to achieve some of his goals well if i understand your question correctly uh i'll try to answer but you correct me if i if i go to the wrong direction um so um again during the first day of war we had to um put a hold on on number of purchases because we we had to um just like put that let's really put in halt because we need to deliver them we need to um make all the paperwork but we don't have time for that so we were using crypto to pay uh paid us money like a prepaid um but then uh companies started to respond and it's like listen we can even do encrypt some of the companies started to especially us companies they started like all right we can do coinbase account for for for the company and you can send a crypto then we can just uh convert it that's that's just forget it we know how well you are and uh you just transfer crypto you don't need to find like [Music] exchange to [ __ ] the ad currencies and and i think that we like 40 percent of uh transfer were just straight in crypto and of course um having this tool um and comparing with the fiat currencies where you send a buyer wire and then you wait for day or two and you're not able to even check your transaction and other party uh need to uh confirm with his bank or their bank to respond to yeah we got the payment but with crypto you just get in five minutes of proof of transaction because you go to the either scan uh you give them link and and and they sure that they make they make sure that they you send them and that's okay they just confirm your transaction is done so it's it's completely different from from wires and other means of payment yeah people tend to think that crypto is overly complicated and that's what that's what scares them about crypto but it seems to be that when it really comes down to it the crypto's actually the more simple of the two uh types of financial systems that we have and you've said that some vendors have have told you that they're willing to accept crypto how how proliferated how how prolific is that like is are most vendors able to accept crypto and in in this time no no um okay uh well especially for for those who are dealing with their uh military grade equipment and or equipment just for for the military uh they are more like uh classic companies that prefer to do the old-fashioned way but still they started to accept at least prepaid and they say like listen give us prepaid and then we can figure out so we can so we can we know that you're have serious intentions um um i mentioned that but i think maybe it's missed uh like maybe forty percent of uh of what we span is actual crypto and the sixteen it's it's rough calculation i don't have the exact figures at this in top of my head but uh majority of the payments of course has to be done through wire because again we we're not dealing with the regular stuff you i hope you understand that that if we were dealing with the i know some uh standard goods for you know for people and entertainment or whatever i think there will be percentage will be more but but still it's it's pretty good i think polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy

in crypto donations how when you just zoom out how would you say that the crypt crypto's involvement in ukraine has changed the course of the war well i don't have i'm afraid i can't answer your question because uh on on on my level i understand that those thousand of uh of the goods that we uh purchased and and and now we're delivering uh and by the way it takes time i i can't say that all of them already on the battlefield but uh what i assume that if we supply those goods it some of them can save people's lives and in this case um let's hope that this bullet request never will be needed but uh again we know that if we uh uh armed with a not harm but if we supply those uh those goods to the soldiers they could feel more safe and and this is this is our goal to save as much life as we can alex you mentioned about how there's been uh integration with crypto exchanges like ftx and how they've helped bridge the gap between some of the crypto assets and fiat can you just elaborate on that a little bit more is it like um uh the ukraine government sends crypto to one of the exchanges and the exchanges takes it the rest of the way to a fiat transfer is that is that how this infrastructure has been set up well i think it's opposite so there was there okay yeah so official um national bank of ukraine created um a special account for the nations but of course it was in fear and um at some point there was some uh people who want to donate and i i think it was ever steak but they were not able to transfer so they involved ftx so they assign a contract or some sort of agreement that um once crypto hit or after x account they able to transfer and so our national bank gonna get a dollar u.s dollar and how would you say are there any stories about uh individual ukrainians using crypto that you've heard is there any like experiences that you've heard in the last like you know three weeks about how crypto is uh how individual ukrainians are using crypto uh well yes that's their that's a sad story but three million people left ukraine there are three million refugees and i know that i know some individual stories wherein people from [Music] from like families from ukraine were separated so men stayed here and the rest of the family fled to poland to other countries so they were um sending them crypto because they that there's so much russia and they didn't have any money so krypto became our sort of a um easy way to uh help your family in being a refugee in another country and feel safe again and feel comfortable so i i know of such stories uh i believe there are much more stories about the business that again dealing with the uh distant part of inside a country so they sent crypto because uh banks are put some limits and and they can exchange it i know of some such some stories about that but it's not um it's not many of them but yeah there's still a couple alex you think do you think that is kind of the the role of crypto here i'm wondering because you have a uh unique perspective on crypto given everything that you've gone through recently um is is cr is crypto a technology and like a money system that um is here for the world and for the people and for governments when the banking system fails is that its role what do you see as the main value proposition of crypto well i i i don't think at this point uh it could really substitute banking system but it it's it's definitely um an option and um i i believe that uh again after some time in it maybe even in close future we're going to see more examples of companies or even countries who uh moving from this i know what we get used to the banking system to um to crypto crypto i think some parts are missing in terms of crypto and uh david mentioned that it's there's a lot of assumptions on complications with crypto and there are really and there's some um in the beginning so um i think that uh the work like what the world introduced decades ago with with the banking cards is just the [Music] concept of having a card then you did not need don't need to log in anywhere you didn't have to study anything anything um made this massive there was a way to mass adoption so i think there right now uh crypto community and uh and the companies that build uh perfect tools like exchanges and companies that operate on blockchain uh and and they've built a pretty much solid concept of how it's gonna work what is missing from my standpoint is this easy entrance and once this the way for easy interest will be found i believe i i personally i believe there's gonna be bright future for crypto um i'm curious about this dependency because um crypto of course is dependent on a a country having electricity grid a power grid up and it's also dependent on internet reliability and obviously in in the conflict right now i'm not sure how certain those things are for the people of ukraine and yet um the banking system now that it's moved to digital electronic is also dependent on those two things as well uh i'm curious a lot of people who criticize crypto sort of say things like well but what happens when the internet goes down um what is the internet reliability like in ukraine right now and is this a is this a concern for the financial system at large and also for the digital transformation the cr the crypto initiatives that you guys are pursuing uh i think uh people should realize eventually that today's banking system not not able to work without electricity grid as well that's maybe that's a hard truth everyone has to has to learn but i don't know how to send it to wire transfer without because it's built buildings weak message system and swift message system uh servers and and and and again it's a sort of a ledger it it's it's maybe it's far from blockchain but but again it's ledger and um that's their that's the first that's my observation and conclusion on that but about ukrainian communication system apparently one of the major tasks of the ministry where i work for was improving digital um improving communication infrastructure of ukraine for last two years we were working on a better cell reception on delivering high-speed broadband internet to every corner of ukraine eventually we supposed to cover 95 of the territory with the great internet so this was one of the goals and uh and we were moving towards it so um ukraine is um internet in ukraine pretty much cheap especially relatively to us so in in ukraine you can have a great internet connection speed for 10 20 dollars a month so um and and it's it was everywhere um so like 4g we were we were moving slowly slowly from 3g for to 4g but then we obtained new practices from the military and the speed the speed of uh uh switching of new standards was tremendous so far last year we completely moved to 4g uh in the country and even started testing 5g it was it was attempted but in the ministry there's another person in charge but we're it's another deputy of uh the deputy minister who is in charge of communication alexander chalice but again so this was a tax task for the ministry and um and right now um it appears that um we did good because in the most uh territory of ukrainian internet's still working and the connection is fine alex one of the things i've talked uh to ryan about with these crypto donations is that um typically humanitarian aid from foreign countries can only be spent on on certain things uh and you know usually just like you know food and medical supplies but when it comes to crypto you know this can actually be spent on the bulletproof vest that soldiers would would wear and that's definitely something new on this on this world that we've never seen before we've never seen the interaction of permissionless crypto payments and and war and buying resources i'm wondering if uh there's been any conversations from inside ukraine about this or any sort of like uh i just one thing i'm interested is in when we're looking at um externally from like the perspectives of the united states or the eu they're watching uh ukraine not have to actually follow the typical humanitarian limitations on donated funds i'm wondering if there's any conversation that's being had in the ukrainian government about this this particular aspect that's that's a very relevant question but you have to understand what's the mood in ukraine at this moment like imagine uh if your home being invaded and you were waiting on the second floor hiding from uh i don't know people who is who have uh who are armed and they're looking for you and in this situation i think you're you want to take any measure and you you're going to use any means to protect you so um i think that's of course it's unprecedented but and in in in a peaceful time it was just no one's gonna allow this but uh we are we were in a desperate position right now it's like more stable it more controlled but for during the first day of war we were afraid that we're going to lose our country in three days so why you need this bureaucracy if you might lose the whole country and and lose everything like everyone will flee and that's that's uh and of course we we're not we're not thinking about this part we were thinking how to survive and this pushed us to any means to help us to protect ourselves um today of course uh it's a bit different and and but still it's already like it's a reality and and again president signed the law so it's it's totally legal in ukraine so we can use this um yeah according to the law crypto cannot be paid a means of payment but again um we uh also want to be complete like for the rest of the world that's fine and and if as long as it's fine for the rest of the world it's it's fine for ukraine and it's in once the world over i think we uh we will reconsider your approach but we in this reality certainly yeah you touched on the the new crypto policy law that got signed into into place let's talk about that a little bit more just the the question is how has these events changed ukraine's stance towards crypto and the answer i think is generally pretty pretty positively can you go into the details about the law that was passed and kind of what that means with the relationship between ukraine and crypto moving forward um well first of all um it's the first time in the history of ukraine where we put uh what exactly is crypto how we should treat it from from civil relations relationship standpoint how government traded also we define who are professional uh service providers which is vasps right so what kind of uh ml procedures has to be taken by those who companies who um want to be licensed uh as vsps uh there are many more aspects uh that this law covers uh including uh kyc of uh of the companies kvc of the customers how this will be done how to protect investors how should mint tokens uh in uh what kind of tokens could be there's no i'm sorry uh it's just about minting we don't specify what kind of uh um like what what exactly like what what kind of crypt exactly is legal or not legal so there's no um in this law we don't say like bitcoin is is uh we don't mention bitcoin we don't mention any cryptos we just defined uh the broad it's in a broad range of uh so we say listen this is possible this is a those are virtual assets and we should treat them like this also this law defines how we can for example inherited or how we can uh sell it or how we can exchange between physical persons because this become becomes an ass it became an asset so once it became an acid then government basically defined the basic rules of how it should be treated inside a country and of course outside the country alex do you think it would have happened uh without this this crisis i know that the legislation was put forward i believe in the past it was um kind of vetoed by um zielinski previously and i i think maybe the reason was there were other priorities of course but now it seems to have been um accepted maybe as a result of this crisis or do you think it would have happened as quickly independent of the conflict that you're now in it would have happened but um at much slower pace so i think we would have spent another i don't know year or so but now it's much much faster um do you have any advice on the back of this for other countries who are you know and advocates digital transformation leaders in their respective governments on what it takes to like help put something like this together and to push it through and to promote it any any lessons learned along the way um yeah well my advice will start from what we realized in ukraine at some point uh we realized that there's a huge blockchain community there are a lot of people that using crypto and you can't ignore it i mean you can but uh it's going to be like black market anyway because people want to use it so if you're a true leader of your country if you're if you're really um take care of your people want to take care of people make it official give them right to possess crypto give the right to pass it to others to conduct a business with scripture to to create companies because they want to do that and they will anyway will do that they they'll find they'll find a way so that's probably the advice so don't uh deny but rather allow yeah you can allow on on your terms because your government and you can say listen all right you can do this on the specific circumstances with their under our strict supervision but uh um i don't think it's it's right to you just deny the fact that scripture is being used about most majority of the countries in the world so far so this is this is absurd alex one thing that's been interesting is we've observed uh all of this play out in our respective governments and jurisdictions at least one conversation in the in the us is how um effective um relatively effective sanctions have been in uh the the conflict so far and some lawmakers in the u.s are saying well if we move to a world of crypto then these sanctions would be less effective in the future because of course it's much harder to you could you know it's easier to block the swift system for the eu in the u.s and it's very difficult by design for uh sanctions to go into effect across crypto do you see that as a downside of crypto f from your perspective like relinquishing the power to block sanctions i mean i can completely see the alternative in ukraine of course you're saying hey you know we could create a a fund and get donations from all over the world when the banking system wasn't working very well and it's instant money on the other hand some of the sanctions that have been put into place wouldn't have been effective in such a system what is what are your thoughts on that argument well i i think that the purpose of uh krypto and and the fiat currency is not about sanctions it's just one case of of such things and and they want to control not because only of sanctions but they generally want to i don't know supervise the international system of many reasons not because they want to just suppress someone but but also there's a uh there are many tasks for the government that they have to do because uh because we want to feel safe too i [Music] i respect my government i respect the us government and when they say listen we have to be careful i rather i would rather listen because i remember the mass uh during their uh uh depression in in the united states almost 100 years ago then it was financial crisis so those are examples of what could could be if if government just slip out everything from their hands um so i think that well it's really hard question it's a great question but it's it's really hard to me to say that well uh let's stay with the current system uh in uh but in the same time i also see potential encrypted and i i think that that's that could be a corporation that could be your uh [Music] win-win situation when uh we still can use or we can move to crypto but whether again under certain circumstances when we say when we basically uh acknowledge that uh there should be some fail-safes the failed fail-safes yeah alex what do you have as a call to action for all the bankless listeners out there we can we will obviously put the link of the donation page into the show notes so maybe a call to action is to go donate crypto to ukraine uh but also what you want the bankless listeners to know and what do you want the bankless listeners to do uh well of course we appreciate if you put this link and we encourage people to donate we we still have a lot of needs and we thankful to everyone who's going to do that um um i don't know the listeners of the bankless i think we my message would be that we all doing uh something that never was done before so we should be proud that we bring together as a community at some point and someday in future everyone's gonna be dealing with it and saying like listen there there was a lot of evolution in this and and we know that those people were were in the beginning of of of such a great things uh things that we use today as a common thing alex uh in in addition to the 60 over 60 million dollars of donations that have come from the crypto community uh some nfts have gotten donated as well to the to the ukraine address including a crypto punk i was wondering if there's an official policy as to what ukraine is going to do with that crypto punk we now working on a separate uh section on the on our website donate.thedigital.gov va going to be separate sections the section called nft so we're going to list all the nfts that was donated for the whole time and uh we'll probably go for the auction uh nfts are not priority at this point we still have uh money to distribute from from um other crypto currencies but i think once we see what we have and and show this to the community and start auction and those money will be uh directed to the bond well i would imagine that the nfts auctioned off by the country of ukraine might fetch a nice premium for just the token value of that so that's going to be pretty interesting to watch uh alex there was a at one point talk of um ukraine doing a token as well itself is that still on the table or is that uh not happening um it depends on if we if you talk if we talk about nft yeah we have a project uh which couldn't be like a museum of war we we want to call it never again and it's going to be our piece of uh it's going to be nfts as a containing piece of art and some specific event event connected to the every day of war so uh from the day zero to the day on the war we're gonna put we're gonna create nft connected to this same ever to this same day and every day gonna have a unique nft so people who will see this collection will be able to observe uh how the war was uh going forward till the end and uh this is the project that we're working on together with again with the private partnership it's public private partnership um but we never intended to create some cryptocurrency um but in the same time we're working with our national bank uh working on cbdc so it's going to be at some point it's going to be electronic grip now uh under national bank of ukraine and they're going to issue talkings of course but it's it's going to be cbdc that that is fascinating and um yeah alex i really appreciate you spending we really appreciate the crypto community the bank list community appreciates you spending time with us uh to tell us uh what's going on i know you've got to be busy in all sorts of various domains but i could say on behalf of all of us that not a day goes by that we're not thinking about the the people of ukraine during this time uh and we appreciate you spending some time with us today thanks a lot thank you david thank you ryan cheers alex of course guys uh risks and disclaimers of course i don't think we have to get into obviously
