I would say that I am anti-crypto for what it has been promising it has not lived up to a lot of those promises I mean crypto's been around for a while but the sort of web 3 hype and a lot of the talk around it becoming a really mainstream part of the financial system and even Society you know those are really big promises and so far the technology doesn't seem to have really lived up to that what promises do you think crypto has made which ones are falling short it's stuff around becoming a major part of the financial system in some cases even like replacing traditional Finance when you get to some of the more extremes there's a lot of talk around banking the unbanked and you know fixing the widespread inequality and the financial system providing services to people who have not had access to them and so far I don't think any of those checks have been cashed it's not replaced web technology is not banked the unbanked
