vitalik on the cover of time magazine look at this picture not everyone liked this image of vitalik david so when this got out of course everyone in crypto was very excited to see vitalik and like if you've met vitalik i mean this is pretty much what he dresses like usually it's in the unicorn t-shirt i mean some of the responses some of the quote tweets on this were absolutely like ridiculous yeah they're pretty terrible this guy looks like the clone of tom brady keeps locked in his basement to periodically feed on to stay youthful my god this is if tom brady was a doc was on dog food how is it possible to be this rich and still be ugly oh my god get a hair transplant or a botox or a new wardrobe something this is why i love italic because he doesn't care about his image and like he shows up in ruffled hair that he didn't comb in a unicorn t-shirt because he has no ego
