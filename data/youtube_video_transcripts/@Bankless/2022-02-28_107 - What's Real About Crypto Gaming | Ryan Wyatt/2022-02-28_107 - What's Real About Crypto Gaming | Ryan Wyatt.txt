and i think obviously games are going to be the biggest funnel for onboarding people into the space welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless great episode on crypto gaming today what's real about crypto gaming and what's not we have an ex youtube executive who's joining us this is the guy that's responsible for some of youtube's biggest gaming partnerships over the last eight years ryan wyatt we talk about six things you want to listen for number one why there's a brain drain from web 2 to web 3 and how that's impacting gaming as well number two why crypto gaming is for whales right now and why that's okay number three why the nft haters actually have a point number four what the big game studios are doing today in crypto number five how a new generation of content creators are about to propagate crypto games number six how gaming solves crypto's pr issues david this is a great episode look 3 billion gamers in the world this is crypto's next marketplace crypto games in real life are becoming like or gaming in real life are becoming like one in the same thing both of these things are sort of fusing together and this was a great episode another in a line of episodes that's exploring this topic on bankless what were some of your thoughts ryan seems to be one of those guys that's always on the frontier uh and well i guess that's also true for you ryan but this is this is wyatt other ryan who joined uh youtube when the the world of gaming content was very very nascent and he takes us through that story that earlier phase of the internet where people didn't really appreciate how big gaming content was about to be and now he's uh jumping on board polygon studios which is the the studio arm of polygon focusing on well right now gaming but perhaps later gaming content because first you need to make the game so you can have the content later and in taking that that those lessons learned of being on the frontier of gaming content in the web 2 world clearly ryan always has an itch that he needs to scratch which is always being on the frontier of something so taking these web 2 skills and bringing them into web 3 to teach us all how you grow out a gaming ecosystem when it's done on different rails super practical episode great plain speak advice and thoughts and in fact some unique thoughts that i don't think we've ever heard coming from ryan wyatt in this episode today so make sure you guys listen to the full thing uh from the outset also make sure to listen to the sponsors that made this episode possible we've got some awesome tools for you coming right up we'll get to the conversation with ryan just a moment but here are the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of

you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] thankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest this is ryan wyatt he left his role as former head of gaming at youtube to join polygon studios as their ceo not too long ago about about a month or so ago polygon studios if you're not familiar with the studios it's just a division of the polygon ethereum scalability and layer 2 technology that you know and love uh we wanted to have him on ever since we heard about his exodus from youtube to polygon from web 2 to web 3. ryan wyatt welcome to bankless and also welcome to crypto man how's it going yeah i appreciate the warm welcome it's going uh it's going well so far i'm excited and very happy to be in here and uh jumping in full time into the space what made you join us crazies like why'd you do this you all you guys are all crazy i think maybe i thought of myself as crazy as well and that's why i did it um yeah it's a good question so you know last year um somebody came up to me was like hey you know blockchain gaming you know it's starting to happen and this thing's pretty interesting and as the head of gaming at youtube was like this is like a complete blind spot you know i took a lot of pride in knowing the gaming industry well as part of my you know my role and so it was like oh okay um can you elaborate on that and so just started having more conversations particularly with people in venture right and how allocation was starting to go towards blockchain games you were starting to see pretty prominent talent leaving some of the established studios to come into the space and so it really just started as i need to learn about it right like i don't want to have this blind spot of this emerging category within gaming and let me tell you uh i think like the red pill thing is a very real thing because uh i i think of the whole space is like a great page turner of a book and you just can't stop and so as i spent more time learning and and meeting people in the space it became very difficult for me to not want to do it uh you know as a full-time thing that's the very short the short part of it was there a particular aha moment where you realize like oh i gotta be in crypto or was it something slow and incremental i think it was more slow and incremental but it does like the aha moment kind of shows itself as part of that right um you know i really started to look at i think nft's definitely you know and as controversial as that is definitely started to be like okay you know i was already personally spending more time fascinated by how covet had accelerated kind of people spending time in let's say digital worlds metaverse gaming whatever you want to call it right you could see it very much in the numbers um you could see it along with gen z that both found you know gaming as their number one form of entertainment and and also very interestingly enough gaming is their number one form of like social and community these are different trends than even millennials who obviously were a big part of the gaming industry's growth and so this this idea of just spending more time in digital environments and what comes with that what's needed in that what will be asked of that is really probably the aha moment and you know i think centralization really doesn't and can't offer that in the same way that decentralization can and i think that was probably the real moment where i was like okay this this becomes really interesting to me tell us a little bit for those that aren't familiar with um what you did at youtube and like kind of the youtube gaming division uh obviously it sounds like it's some marriage between content that's being produced and also uh the gaming industry but tell us a little bit about that and some of the experience and skills you're carrying with you to crypto yeah um so my whole background has been in the creator economy really um i started and played esports competitively i was an esports commentator in college um i came out and started working with you know major league gaming and machinima both you know very focused on gaming video watching other people play which you know sounds obvious now today because of how big the market is a lot of people you know 12 13 years ago on this subject were like i don't know that people are really going to want to watch other people play video games it seems like very counter-intuitive people that want to play video games will just play why would they ever watch people play i think that resonated with a lot of people too because if you ever had a brother growing up or a friend you always wanted the controller like you didn't want to share in this so um i i was like look i i don't know if i agree with that i think it's pretty interesting and i think there are other people out there like me that will find it interesting as well so all of my time had been spent in that um i went to youtube almost eight years ago because they they didn't have a gaming division right and so they saw like okay gaming is going to be this big thing it already is big they had seen you know amazon acquired twitch like things were starting to get bigger and so susan wojcicki who's the ceo of youtube google started her garage she came in as the ceo of youtube and was like look we need to really need to focus and have a gaming effort i had written a lot of emails while at machinima to youtube about all the things their shortcomings about what they should be doing and so they were like let's you know let's go have lunch with the guy that thinks he knows everything and talk about gaming that lunch turned into you know 14 interviews and then later i came on as the the head of gaming at youtube i was 27 years old at the time but there was no which was interesting i mean i definitely had imposter syndrome for a little bit there because i i was actually in over my head for a little bit there um but there was no background of anybody that had creator economy experience right then it's so it's so nascent at this time so you know much like there's a lot of similarities in web three right and all i spent over all these years it's like yes gaming content it's like what is gaming on youtube it's the vertical and everything that's kind of responsible for it what products the creators and game publishers do what licensing deals are you doing how do you support game developers that care about that ecosystem both from their owned and operated content as well as the ugc of the ecosystem how do you take care of creators of big and torso you know of all sizes put programs in place processes in place all of that so how that carries over into web 3 is you look at polygon studios and really what is the studio teams going to be responsible for well you have all these developers that are building a polygon some of them need a little bit more handholding more white glove you know than others you want to be of service to the technology from a developer standpoint so you obviously have this great you know stack to build on you don't always need somebody but think of polygon studios it's what google play can do for the developer ecosystem that builds on it you know i think there's a lot that we can provide and support but setting up that internal infrastructure to support you know the developer ecosystem is going to be really critical a lot of that has some eerily similar things to what i did at youtube and was able to do successfully so i'm hoping that i can bring that over you know to the organization what's really funny i know your departure from youtube made big waves in you know crypto media and also uh web 2 media and what's really interesting to me when i hear that story is like it's the same pattern all right so like you know eight years ago when you started at youtube or when you started doing uh you know live streaming announcing for games people thought that was crazy yeah i'm sure like your parents were like wait ryan what you're doing what i mean sorry that's that's a career and nfts i feel like are at the same place right now it's like okay well you're buying and flipping jpegs what is is that real like now this is a this is a bubble this is a meme it's all gonna go away and now here you are at in a very nascent point in the industry where it's proven itself early product market fit fit but it's just getting fired up and now you're joining like the the youtube the google of the crypto scene in this in this jump over to polygon do you see those parallels there is this just like the second act for you and you're playing the same thing i i think um almost identical everything you just said is like was my entire thought process and why i made the jump over here a lot of it what is what went into the decision making on why polygon as well but yeah i see it all and i think um you know on a personal level um i was so proud of like what we all collectively did with the gaming vertical and and it's like the you know one of the biggest ones at youtube and it's in such a great place now and i um i still have this like fire and spirit to be a builder and you know as things get bigger and bigger you know you you build less and less right um and that's great right that's that's a reflection of success as part of it um but i have a huge fire still within side of me to build and so that and i didn't know where to take that kind of direction and energy right i had i've had this for a while and was trying to figure out what next and so you couple that with this like massive intrigue and what blockchain development can be you know not only just for the games industry but overall for tech and then this desire to want to keep building um it it really kind of came together and then you know for those that know uh sandeep he has a lot of chip on his shoulder and a lot of fire and so i think there was a personality match that occurred as well and so there was a variety of things but i absolutely saw the parallels ryan and i think that is what encouraged me to jump and uh you know not really think twice about it if i'm honest we definitely want to get into the conversation of crypto gaming because that's not only a conversation that the crypto industry is having but i mean the the whole broader web 2 and gaming and outside of crypto they're having the same kind of conversation about like they kind of see the crypto tidal wave coming they don't know how so that's going to be like basically the bulk of this podcast but right i want to touch on a little bit more of your transition right before we get there and so you you talked about when you were at youtube you were like head of content like it's all content focused user generated content how do you go out the gaming gaming content ecosystem for youtube but then when you describe your job at your current job at polygon it seemed to be a lot more developer relations a little bit more technical focus a little bit more business development uh can you talk about just like uh what your day-to-day ins and outs are at polygon and how you're helping grow out the polygon ecosystem and also is content still relevant too it's a good question so i think like um at youtube it was really more of a general manager role so i kind of covered a lot although product wouldn't sit necessarily under me i think it was all like you're weighing in on all those things how you're prioritizing products how you are working with developers what product partnerships you're doing with them so that kind of did touch all of my wheelhouse it out it's your point though on the polygon side i don't they're really the the content and creator economy part is not at the bulk of it i'm sure it's going to have a you know that will have a place in all of this world but uh it is highly developer focused so look i think um at the end of the day like really what you're trying to do is architect the same thing it's you have a lot of people that are responsible for your success those people being developers and creators on youtube being prominently or predominantly developers on polygon and you have to set up uh an infrastructure internally to make sure that they are properly and adequately supported because i think long term you know in a couple of years out you're gonna have all the this optionality across the text based on how you want to build is going to be huge and i really actually don't know that you're materially delineating between each one of those service offerings in the future and so as you think about the decision-making tree of which where you want to build so much of like people and who you work with and who you partner with will be much more of an emphasis than just the tech stack and and that's why i'm like i think we need to start right now in building a world-class team so that people are just like i want to work with polygon because i know when i work with polygon i've got great tech and i love that studios team because that's who we're actually partnering with that's what's going to ensure after we build and integrate that they're going to ensure for long-term success and so i'm just very fixated on creating a similar infrastructure like we did with youtube gaming to support creators and developers you're just this time around it's just it's it's largely developers but i do think you're going to start to see creators that are going to want to build projects on polygon as well into the future um so i'm excited for that time and place where we'll be adequately supporting them as well yeah this just seems like an order of operations uh conversation like we can't have content until we have the games that's right so we have to enable we have to enable the developers to make the games and then later at when that ecosystem gets its uh you know the ball starts rolling downhill then perhaps maybe it comes time to to build out the content ecosystem later yeah and that'll be like that's gonna be a critical point too because you're right it is an order of operations conversation because you're really like think about how much gaming accelerated because twitch and youtube right and how much earned media that comes from that opportunity right um so the same thing will happen because these big games will inevitably come out right now you know a lot of the games they're great it's very rudimentary because games take a long time to make and so you're kind of getting like the mvp of games out right now today but like if you can see the pipeline of what's about to be deployed over the next couple of years and the innovation that's happening there and the talent that's happening there um these are going to just be games people play they're not going to have this this obsession of if it's on chain nfts all the stuff that we are kind of focusing on now really is going to follow the wayside for a majority of the the gaming population and they're just going to find that wow this is a really cool game and as part of that i'm connecting my account and i'm buying these digital items and they're not going to be thinking like oh is this an nft or not or what is it right they're just here's the on-ramps to pay you know i'm transferring fiat into a token that's actually already exists today in a centralized environment and so i think like that's where i started to get interested that we spend a lot of time in debate about nfts and what gamers think about it it's not going to matter in a couple of years because it's just going to be a great game coupled with you know a free and thriving economy that allows for more complexity in the game environment which is exciting oh we're going to dig more into that right yeah lots of unpack there ryan yeah a lot to unpack yeah so okay so uh you one last thing while we're talking because the other thing that uh i i thought of immediately when i ran the headline ryan wyatt's you know joining polygon uh leaving leaving his position at youtube was this oh wow this is the tidal wave of the next exodus of talent from web 2 to web 3. we've seen this happen in the past with emerging technologies i'm curious how how right is that is is this part of are you seeing a lot of web 2 builders web 2 talent uh starting to come into uh into web 3 and is this a trickle or is is this a flood this kind of brain drain is is what's happening here i think time will tell um you know i i i i think that you'll see a lot of people coming over for the same reasons that i kind of outline i don't know how you spend time learning about this technology and self-identify as a builder and not want to come over right that's the thing and i think it ultimately comes down to that you know brain drain web 2 web 3 talent like whatever you know that's a little bit of hyperbole but these people in web 2 and in big tech right now are looking at this and saying this is pretty damn interesting thus kicking off a trigger of wanting to learn and spend time to you know listen to your podcast and starting to watch videos and pay attention right and then to my point like you kind of become enamored with it and so i think it becomes very difficult to not make the transition and when it makes a little bit more clear sense of you know where these individuals belong then i think you will start to see a tidal wave of it um there's there will definitely this will be a year i think which will be pivotal and known as i don't know if exodus may be too strong but this will be the year that everyone points at this is the first wave of where we saw people that aren't crypto native like you two i'm sure would identify as start to come into our space um i i fee you know at least i feel that that's going to be the case and uh you know i think polygon is going to contribute to that as well so ryan that tidal wave wouldn't happen if there wasn't something real here and so we want to identify in the show what is actually real about crypto gaming so make the pitch for us why will games be made better because of crypto because of web 3 like what does web 3 have to offer gaming i think there's a lot of um we deal in absolutes in this conversation too often and that's what i take a little bit of issue with that and i have a little bit more of a measured approach i don't think crypto gaming is is necessary for all gaming or blockchain gaming i look at it as a subsection of three billion gamers and even if you say look it's going to create game experiences and we can talk about that but at a macro level it's going to create unique game experiences that 10 of the total addressable market of gamers will get into so you have 300 million gamers that want to come over the thing that i think is really interesting about what's going to happen is when you couple a really great game with like i just say a free economy we can get into play to earn and all this but just these like free market in this sense of ownership with a really great game you're going to have people that you know are going to be really interested in participating in it what that's going to do is look at the free-to-play model which i'm in that was everybody had a bunch of criticism about that you know would have been in that but anyway heavily reliant on people with money and people with time what i think that ten percent of the type of people that are going to get into blockchain gaming are the ones that love a really good game and love participating in a free economy which that is going to be wales for lack of a better term they're going to pivot over into these blockchain game experiences that is going to put a lot of pressure on the free to play business model because you are now losing spenders that are completely rely like that are very reliant on keeping the free-to-play economy going this is then going to create a lot of dialogue so it's like 10 of the player base but how much of the revenue base particularly with how many digital transactions are happening and driving that revenue is actually going to come over into this space liquidity digital ownership you know like i'm a big fan of valor i played all the time i've only spent probably you know i put like 500 bucks into it if valor was on blockchain and i had liquidity and all this and governance i'm probably spending orders of magnitude more to be honest with you and so yeah not everybody's in that same place not everybody wants to have that kind of like some people just want to play games not worry about that that's why i don't think it's going to service everybody and again if it's still only if 90 of people are playing off chain that's fine but the revenue is going to come over and i think that is going to create a lot of pressure on aaa uh to think about it differently um and then start to get into those questions where you hear good topics of well look between sql and centralized databases we can kind of recreate some of this and have like faux blockchain kind of uh product offering but i think this is what's going to happen and and this will cause a huge shift in the space over the next let's say three to five years um but i i don't deal with it as much in absolutes as what i think a lot of the conversation publicly you know the discourse around it seems to be so what i just heard you say is that this isn't going to be like crypto gaming isn't going to replace non-crypto gaming it's not like every single game in the world is just going to uh magically become a crypto game uh it's going to be instead an evolution and an alternative to uh games and i think what you just said is emphasis on uh people that integrate economics with their games like the with the free to play movement those free-to-play games are kind of like economic games in the sense that like you can take your money you can take your value and that can enhance the game and some people are just more conducive to that style of game than others and crypto gaming might infiltrate that type of game more than it would the rest of the gaming industry uh which is fair that's a fair assessment yeah i think that's right you know look and then with inside of blockchain gaming you have you have you know it's like you can start to talk to well who's play to earn really you know uh targeted at what audience is going to participate in that you get into the some people just want to play for fun but yeah in the the general spirit of it i think that's that's uh that's right what's really interesting about this idea and i've i've never heard it articulated uh quite this way but i think there's um there's a kind of something rings true about the way you just said it which is actually the whales are going to be the first uh adoption market for this it's it's almost reminds me of kind of the um the axi infinity sort of model where you have whales that are sort of the you know uh the curator uh class the the capital class and then you have workers which are you know um people who are like grinding in the games and uh it's better than the economic alternatives in their local market so they're happy to do it provides a lot of opportunity for them to do it it's that kind of model which is very interesting because um that's uh i suppose an unaddressed market in in typical uh gaming and your idea is that like once the whales we were talking about an exodus from web 2 to web 3 earlier but an exodus of whales in gaming could actually provide the capital fundamentals and the revenue fundamentals for this market so it's almost like the criticism of um you know these games are kind of just just for whales i i almost hear what you you're saying is like okay well let's lean into that maybe that's going to be the first market it's not going to be the the last market certainly but why don't why don't we embrace it in the 1980s cell phones were big bricks and only the wealthy could afford them but then the technology improved is this kind of what you're saying yeah it's funny it seems like look that is the free-to-play model right and and that has been explicitly so it's it literally is as simple as people with money and people with time now you need a great game there's obviously it's higher level of complexity of that and so yeah i think anytime you have like a free economy people are going to be in a free marketplace and and then are allowing that in a player ecosystem it's going to attract first and foremost whales but i think at the end of the day you just have to let like the product speak for itself you make a really great on-chain game nobody's going to be talking about the the fact that it's a blockchain game or not it's a great game and it's just part of the experience and if you think of um i really do think we overthink a lot of this even in the conversation if you really look at like going back to league of legends is a great example right you know what's the what is the onboarding experience well it's just a great game so i want to play it first there okay now i have taken my mastercard and i bought a thousand riot points for 69.99 now i have a thousand riot points it's obviously fixed price relative to the dollar to the riot point but the that like what is going to really change there you know as uh as wallets get better you know as bridging gets better that's gonna be your experience right you're like oh i'm just taking fiat into a token and that token buys this now i actually can do more with that token because i can liquidate it i have governance over it so it's to me i'm like it's just look at it as product features and get outside of this you know on chain off chain thing and what what you're really talking about the end of the day is blockchain enables really cool newer product features that are are differentiated than the experiences that they are today um and that's kind of i i think in the most simplistic terms that's how i think about it and because of that it opens up things like an axia infinity it opens up things like play to earn you know like it it does you know it's part of that what do you what do you say to somebody ryan who hears that and says like you're just saying it's you know it's kind of similar to the game experience that we have today what about somebody who retorts and says okay well ryan wyatt why blockchain then we already have this you know why blockchain and this idea of faux blockchains that that you mentioned earlier um they're kind of like well we don't need that to do what you're talking about we can just build on a centralized database and call the thing nfts and so they go down a path you know talking about blockchain and nfts as more a meme than substance it's kind of like we already have that show me the new features what are the new features here yeah i i kind of look at that as like it's slightly like disingenuous um because nobody's really doing it right so the argument is like okay right you know you can use the diablo 3 auction house which everybody likes to go back to is the argument it's like okay yeah diablo 3 is a great game the action house absolutely destroyed that game was a tip you know because it's already hard to make a game you add a like this free open marketplace and economy to it it does make it very difficult balancing the game that's already difficult and so people have stayed away from that but just be like what else really exists there's not great examples counter strike is a perfect example of a game i love that you should be able to do this you don't know the scarcity of items there's an implied scarcity based off of the loot that you get and the rules that you get you can sell those items but it stays within the steam ecosystem so for me i look at the argument i'm like fine you know i don't care it goes back to i don't really care how you do it right but it's not being done and so i'm going to embrace the technology where it is the fundamental spirit of the technology to enable these behaviors right and so just because you use the argument that you are technically capable of doing it off-chain but you're really not doing it you know i i really don't care right so i look at this space as like no no not only do we want to do it we want to take it as far as we possibly can go with it by doing that and embracing the culture and spirit of this entire movement and industry and tech and however you want to classify it then this is going to enable all these experiences down the road so a lot of people are talking too much of what it looks like here and now but i think it's the future of like what what can come from enabling these ecosystems and actually like pioneering them um it opens up all kinds of doors too like it opens up its own class of creator economy using the counter-strike example again what if you could have some of the most prominent digital artists drop skins of the ak-47 skin and counter-strike all of a sudden you have now democratized game development within counter-strike the gun mechanics work the same for everybody it's not like you know paying to win it's just i love this artist he did a pack of a thousand ten thousand skins of counter-strike scenes i can mint that and own it and all of a sudden you have this whole new class of digital artists that can plug in any game they want because they're just simply doing cosmetics of items and instead of like the jpeg money monkey you've got now the board ak-47 right and i can use that in counter-strike um so i think it opens a lot enables a lot of this behavior and it's and you could still always argue yeah we can do that we could do some of this stuff it's about really the underlying spirit of the technology and what it's enabling and why people will shift over here i think that's really leaning into what we've already seen work in crypto uh where like it's the arts it's the it's the community it's the people that want to have their a way to express what they feel interested in and what we've seen get a lot of friction is people that think that nfts are going to come in and impact the mechanics of the game in a way that favor the whales right where if everything about the game is is the same but you get to express your digital identity in ways that are more conducive to your interests as we've already seen that work with nfts um and that wouldn't trigger a lot of the gamers who are very much of the purists um at the end yeah do you have any any reflections yeah no a couple of that that's why it's like that's why you the conversation becomes more nuanced okay look at um clash royale for a great example at some point you are going to have to buy items to start getting further along and that's okay right there's that's like you you sign up and you well understand that that's the same with like axes having a higher win rate like the reptiles i think do and class for axes like have a higher win rate and so therefore you're you're trying to buy those or you're trying to breed towards that okay that's right that's like its own game design i personally that's not the kind of type of game i am personally interested in but that's okay that that ecosystem is created ryan kind of touched on why that's good and creates some opportunities for people even from a you know an earning potential i i am in a place where like the games i like are counter-strike and valor and it's the cosmetic side of it that i'd be willing to part like spend a lot of money on and take a huge sense of ownership and pride over some of that stuff so it just depends on what you're looking for i think the nft argument what bothers people about it is it is too many maxis it's like the anti and the like nft maxi just speaking past each other there are reasonable dreams yeah exactly yeah it's and it becomes this like very obviously polarizing conversation there are reasons to to to not like what nfts do today right i think you can make a great um a great argument around carbon footprint and the process progress that needs to be made there i think a lot of it people don't realize is there is a lot of progress being made there is a desire for carbon footprint to be reduced on some of this stuff and there are technologies that are very focused on obviously polygon being one of them so i i think nobody's really ready to have nuanced uh conversations around some of these topics yet and so i kind of just say you know i really do believe long-term product will speak for itself on these things a big conversation in uh in the current world ryan is exactly what you were just talking about just the hate about gamers not wanting nfts or finance to infiltrate until their games and disrupt what their experiences are meanwhile on the other side of things we have crypto people who are kind of on leaning into the hyper financialization of everything and they're like oh like our games can pay us money if we design them right how do you see these communities coming together like are are they or are we just going to have to figure out how to do we have to compromise or do we just make something new and the people that are on board with that join this new part of the world of gaming how do you see us resolving this conflict it again it goes back to i think too much extremes right people it's it's that we should take every game and this game that you love like let's take minecraft right it's like minecraft people love it right and it's great game and it's so successful why even think about contemplating blockchain and that's right that's right right like i think people should be able to go in and play video games for fun and never have to worry about this stuff never have to worry about volatility never have to worry about putting money in and buying stuff and can just enjoy games like they might just want to play a narrative campaign game which is very old school but just like i just want to play a linear progression game and buy that and that's it i just want to have a free to play game that actually just licensed the skin and i don't have to worry about anything i'm choosing to make a purchase of that skin and that's it and i think that's great right so i basically just look at this technology as offering a subsection of players that that do want that right and i think you see a lot of players that don't even realize that about what kind of experiences that they want to participate in and so i don't like the gatekeeping conversation of like get it out of our community like i'm going to speak on behalf of all 3 billion gamers and i don't want blockchain games to exist i think it's bad for the industry and so that's the part that bothers me because i think we should there's so much there's so many different desires that's the great thing about where the gaming industry has gotten to be you know a third of the world gets to play video games and enjoys them there is something for everybody and i think this is finally something that's offering a a new thing and a new format for people to get excited about and i don't know how you can at the end of the day like hate on that i think it's when people think it's going to completely take over the gaming industry and that we're just pedaling it to every single game and everything should turn into a blockchain game based is where it becomes problematic what do you think about some of their objections though ryan so like just to dig into them i know i know you touched upon the uh the environmental impact issue and and i do feel like there's some fairly um easy answers to that question with you know proof of stake and either theorems transitioning over like such that you wait six months and it's not even a valid criticism at all um but there are some other objections as well um you know things like it's all ponzi games um you know we don't want this game studios uh taking further cuts this feels like micro transactions did you get a chance to to watch the whole line goes up video notice this um okay this is a big criticism uh a video published on youtube big criticism of nfts writ large it made some waves in the in the gaming circle but in nfts in general anyway there's a lot of particular criticisms out there do you think any of the criticisms are valid i i take your point to just say hey if you know it's a big world out there if you don't like nfts just you know don't do the nft thing but do you think the where the gamers even coming from because as crypto natives like we we don't even understand why uh why why the hate so i think there's very valid uh hate around them to be honest with you like okay so the argument about carbon footprint oh we're switching we're you know our consensus mechanism's switching in the long term and so therefore it's going to address that it's like great one not everybody's so well versed on l1 l2 offerings and so they don't know that right they don't know that that needs to be a topic of education two it hasn't happened yet right three gamers remember when they couldn't get an nvidia graphic card because bitcoin miners and that was all on resale you know you know 200 300 price hike on trying to get a graphics card so you have to understand there's there's resentment that's legacy in historical that is valid for them to be frustrated right and i think a lot of people would be like great ryan you said everyone's switching but we haven't and until we have it is an issue right so i think it is very fair to be critical of that and again it's like okay ethereum has been talking about when they're switching to this consensus mechanism for a while and so when it does right and then i also think people aren't um they're not as in like entrenched as you both are in it right so they don't have all this like very clear understanding of like what is bitcoin versus solana versus ethereum versus avalanche versus a layer two like polygon and immutable and side chains right and so that takes time you know i mean even someone like myself who is now working full-time in that wouldn't be able to hold water in the you know multi-hour conversation with you all on this topic so you have to give people time to like learn this and understand that and appreciate that so that they can really wrap their heads around it but it's coming so i kind of look at it as my entry and then also if you look at um you know the ponzinomics conversation i think there are valid conversations in some games where it is problematic and so you really have to think about it this way i'm not joining web 3 for where web 3 is today i think it's version 0.5 i am very excited about what when you know web3 looks when it's v3 v4 v5 and you know skating to where the puck is going if you will and so i think what happens is people get caught up on the let's evaluate this right now for where it is today and people are talking on different time frames so like i kind of just pushed back on you on a time frame of right now you know like right now there are problems there are scams there are rugs there are carbon footprint issues and so if you and i are just talking about in its current state there are very valid arguments but i am trying to take a three or five year time frame horizon and that's why i'm making the jump that's why i'm optimistic despite all of this backlash and frustration yeah i i totally agree with that take i think a lot of the arguments and this is true and crypto at large are just really arguments of time scale timeline and and and vision for where the space is going right and some people have that vision you know others others haven't seen it yet and they have to wait and see yeah but there is something that might be a bit more persistent this is something that david and i have talked about on previous crypto gaming podcast and that is almost the invasion of real world economics into these virtual gaming environments so you know as as gamers ourselves dave and i are both gamers like we grew up playing all of these games you know part part of the fun of games is the escapism you know you get to go into a virtual world and now you're like a level 99 warlock and you're just you're just a cool person like you're a cool dude when you're in that world right and you don't have to worry about your your day job or your boss you just log on with with the homies and you're just like leveling up together and you got these awesome items it's kind of like an escapism well now with crypto because things are open we have these open economies you got um three arrows capital with like billions of dollars who can go swoop in and buy a pure market and like nerf your character crush your character like right and it's just like i don't want all this status and you know bling and like all this you know uh the whales to dominate my game so get that out of there and i wonder if that's a more sustaining problem with crypto games what do you think about this it's not a problem it's choice right it's like you then don't play blockchain games and that's cool there's going to be so many experiences that are not going to ever be on chain that don't have to partake in that and i absolutely get it right like you don't have to stress over this stuff you don't have to worry about like you have a venture coming in and buying entities and buying land driving up prices having to rely on guilds in order to get any good items right that's cool like that is uh those are great very reasonable and pragmatic arguments and i would say blockchain gaming is not for you and you should go continue to play those great games that are not on chain that don't have those type of game experiences those types of game mechanics and that's great and it's really that simple you know it's like it's like if we're thinking about you know music and i'm just like no ryan like you really like rap is i can't tell you how motivating rap music is for me like you really need to listen to rap and you're like i just like country it's like no dude but every everything should be rap really you know um and i really think music should just be wrapped it's it's like that's why i'm like these are very basic kind of like human conversations that for somehow get in the mix it's like that's totally great video games should provide escapism that's awesome i i am a little bit different i actually like a little bit of a combination of both i like playing a game like valerian that's highly competitive and i like spending you know irrational amount of money on cosmetic items that do nothing to make me better in the game and guess what you and i are just different gamers and that's cool you know country and rap like e-rap doesn't take anything away from country now you get these like country rap mash-ups that are really you know people like that too so exactly and then you get games like uh you know amber sword that are coming out caveat you know i'm investor in it but it's it's a on-chain off chain right and so it's like cool maybe you never want to do the on-chain experience right like maybe you never want to participate in the marketplace and that's cool too so yeah i think i think i just take so much issue it's like you have three billion people that are playing video games but everybody have whatever they want and create something for everybody that's why the gaming industry got to three billion people because instead of just making like hardcore games that appeal to hardcore gamer nerds they started to make games that became much more broadly appealing and started to feel more inclusive and allowed more people to play and participate it didn't become a male dominated industry anymore mobile gaming changed that more casual games it's just another you know segment of the industry that we should be embracing and instead you know i think people again it goes back to just the conversation is in absolutes hang on i actually want to take the other side of this debate um so if i'm going to take the the crypto maximalist uh side of things i i kind of view crypto as like the internet where you know one at the early days of the internet people thought it was bad people hated it it was going to ruin everything uh but then the internet came and uh became the foundation for every other communications platform that's out there radio are now is now podcast you know tv is now youtube newsletter newspapers now newsletters etc and like and that's how i perceive crypto to be like it's a it's a foundational platform where if it's an asset it's going to become a crypto asset eventually now there's plenty of games that do not have assets uh there's there's like you know lots of games around there they're puzzle games or whatever you don't actually have like an inventory and so those games i think are uh irrelevant from this conversation but i do think that any game that has in-game assets will eventually become crypto assets just by in the nature of they become upgraded and elevated to have properties that they would never ever have before and they also didn't lose any of the properties that they they started with uh do how what's your take on that yeah i think you start talking about different games like you guys talked about like wow right you can highly disrupt wow if you put all of those games you know all those items and that kind of goes back to the diablo 3 auction house argument but you also can play like god of war and there's never like an ownership element there in digital items where it needs to be and so i kind of look at like you made a great example about like youtube disrupting tv it did massively but tv still exists right and yeah it's obviously on the decline but it's still there right now people started to say like okay i'm coming over here and it became easier and easier right it becomes available on mobile internet gets better for mobile right content gets better you actually have an incentive for creators to create content now with my you know monetization incentive right so yeah i'm not saying that things won't maybe shift more and more over to some of these things um and not everything has to be highly disruptive that you know three euros capital comes in and yeah maybe they bought all the like the the 100 redline ak-47 skins and counter-strike and so now they're like 10 eighth a piece but it's okay it's a cosmetic they're not playing they're not it's not a you're not paying for that to win you're just paying for a cosmetic or unique digital item so that's the other thing too it doesn't even necessarily have to be highly disruptive to escapism either you just ryan you just might have really shitty boring skins and i might have all the crazy looking exotic ones but at the end of the day our guns have the same attributes when you and i are playing one-on-one in counter-strike and you know you'll probably beat me right and it doesn't matter that i have these crazy cosmetic items that i own i am such a nft boomer that may be more true than you know ryan you may have all the better items right you you keep bringing up the diablo auction house which is i actually had a front row seat to the auction house diablo is one of the games that i've played the most and i watched the the arc of the auction house come and go and for listeners that don't uh aren't familiar diablo is a loot based game you go around you play it monsters drop items some items are rare some items are really rare and then uh in diablo 2 they had off-chain like off-chain marketplaces these are the crypto terms just like third-party vendor websites that were actually against the rules of the game itself uh but people with the desire to find a really good item was so strong that people would violate the rules hope that they didn't get caught they would go to on to a third party website and and buy an in-game item for actual dollars with like paypal or whatever uh and then they would meet up with someone in game to have the asset given to them and this was in diablo 2 and blizzard blizzard uh made it in diablo 3 they just instantiated that whole concept right into the game itself and so you could you could straight up buy a sword and i remember i remember when somebody bought a 70 000 axe or something and it just blew up in headlines and this was back in like 2000 in like you know um 2010 or something so like 70 000 in 2010 before crypto was around right like mind blowing and the community hated it it just ruined the game people for all the same reasons that we're seeing uh nft hate these days we saw we saw the community just uh you know decide that the auction house was just not good and blizzard sunseted it they should they took it off of the game is that you know that's right but the reason why they hated it was in order to try to combat that and fine-tune it they had to change the drop rates of legendary items and so forth and so now all of a sudden you're playing the the economy got messed up because now you're playing 12 hours and it's all common loot right because it started so the auction house actually really did make it a terrible gaming experience that's why i think it is a fine line of balancing those two but that everything else is very correct but it's like how they had to combat it at first was to tune the drop rate where basically you just play all day long and it's just like common loot and that's not fun at all either right uh so then it made it so well the only way i guess i can get the loot i want it like exasperated that issue is like then i gotta buy right and then as a gamer like ryan the uh escapist gamer is like this sucks ass you know uh and it did um so that's kind of what happened right that's why you got to be like that's a that's a very complex thing to balance right and i think that people are con there's not a huge incentive for the game publishers to balance it right they're like we make a ton of money anyway this is a pain in the ass we could actually ruin our entire game that we spent you know nine eleven years building all because we wanted an auction house for what right so that's the other issue too and i want to connect this conversation to another thread that we've been we've been pulling on so far ryan you talked about how you didn't come into web 3 because of where it is now you came into web 3 because of where it's going and i think one of the reasons why there's so much like uh just like vitriol and hate about nfts and then there's vitriol and hate about the people that hate nfts and we're coming out of the extremes is because right now largely crypto gaming is mostly an idea more than it is actually games like everyone is ideating on potential futures and there's investment about like what it could look like we have some we have some you know real use cases like axe infinity and some other games but really the industry that we're talking about like crypto itself is actually mostly in our own imaginations we know it's coming we just don't know how or when or why and uh what we didn't have with the diablo auction house is a highly adaptive iterative experimentation cycle that we were seeing in crypto and like the auction house was was legacy tech it was tradify rails and you can't experiment like that it's not open it's not is uh you know the the diablo was a single game from a centralized company where ethereum and gaming is open and permissionless opening it up to more experimentation and i'm hopeful that all the nft crypto gaming haters out there which which are totally justified in their hate today have their uh become convinced about nft and gamer and in-game assets and in this whole ecosystem later because we've been able to experiment and iterate and actually answer to their very justified qualms that they have today how do you feel about this i like 100 aligned with everything you just said i think too like when people realize it's not infiltrating all games in every game and every game type they'll be great once they have a better understanding of the changes in tech and carbon footprint they'll be great once it's not such a like nft is an interface all the time they'll be great too right because what will happen is they're just gonna like i said before they'll just start playing and have a great game experience and it'll be on chain and it'll be what it is right um i think the other thing too is the games that you see today you know if you're into like high polished aaa games deep development cycles you know that those games don't exist on chain right now so when you also look i'm like okay if you are open-minded gamer right and you look like i don't really want to play said run or actually infinity right because i like high polished aaa games and that's fine because a lot of what you're seeing for these games are they're they're focusing on the the the economy part first and the game development second and that's fine because we're going to learn a ton and we already are you know look at everything axis learning you know with slp and burning and balancing all that as they had to grow this huge user base over so ton of learning that needs to happen on this side and it's great and these are you know the first movers to the space and they're obviously benefiting from being first movers and that information will be shared over time and i think the thing that i'm excited for that i feel lucky to have the privilege of be having some visibility into what games are coming a couple years out that are going to take a couple years to develop and i know that when those come out there will be a lot of gamers that are going to be like i want to play that game they're not even care about this conversation of of crypto or blockchain or anything like i want to play that game and i guess we got to play that game i'm going to have to set up you know i'm at a mask account that's cool right you know and i'm going to have to transfer fiat into this token that's cool i've been doing that for years you know and they'll just kind of like all of a sudden become part of crypto and i think obviously games are going to be the biggest funnel for onboarding people into the space the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer 1. assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across these bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer

too can get into the world of web 3. so let's uh talk a little bit about this ryan so you spent some a lot of time in in kind of the belly of the the the web 2 beast if you will right and um by the way i i just want to say going through this conversation so far i love kind of web 2 builders who are entering the space now like your cohort in your class adds to some diversity of thought to the existing kind of crypto natives of the world and what i really see is the strength is that uh you're just so damn practical it's just all about like how can we just get more people into this build the utility of these games and like forget about all of the debates and like let's just get more users in these games and i i um you know obviously dave and i are decentralization maximalists we we are very much um are here for the the values of the space but the thing is those values will still persist as long as they're embedded at the base layer and so now kind of the the game has moved towards can we get more and more people on these things as quickly as possible and i think that's why a lot of the the web 2 builders of your cohort are going to add a tremendous amount of value because you guys are like just like let's just do it we're so practic like we're just very practical about it but let's talk about web 2 for a minute because we want to get your thoughts on web 2. the googles the facebooks the twitters the twitches of the world let's talk about that as an incumbent group first and then we'll talk about gaming studios but like the social media incumbents the the fangs that sort of thing do they see web 3 as an opportunity or do they see it as a threat i think the answer is probably a little bit of both right um i think the unique thing these companies their their user bases are in the billions right and so a lot of the question is how much when you have billions of users already how much do you need decentralization right how much is it beneficial how much can you recreate without actually needing to build it on blockchain right so like uh you know look at like a twitch right you have a subscription business that you know on a channel level people pay 4.99 a month to right well they could add utility to that they could put that on chain you know people could then be like oh i've had this item for this long or i'm in this tier you could do all that you could basically make it an nft right do they need to do that is another question right i would argue that there's a lot of good reason to say they don't need to um at least not now right um the nice thing about their size is they have the luxury of being able to pay attention to the space observe it and then make decisions on how they want to accelerate and onboard into it i do think the technology that they will like it would be in their best interest to lean into it to better understand it and to have some some subsection of their business operating on on on the chain i think it's cool like you see youtube posted web3 pm rules right you know so and you're seeing this across the space so i welcome them i think i don't look at it i think it's like we should have open arms for all of these major web 2 platforms to figure out their you know what they're going to do on chain um i'm excited to talk to everybody from instagram to pinterest to youtube to twitter to facebook and everybody in between right um and figure out what part of their business makes sense to start considering for being on chain um and i think they will and i think inevitably they're going to have to address it and have some part of it and those with bigger user bases and bigger businesses have the luxury to sit back uh but i do think this will get this will heat up over the next couple years right and as as as blockchain could be potentially threatening to centralize businesses long term how do they lean in to to pivot right so these are open-ended questions but right now i look at it as they could be highly complementary in one validating the technology and to opening the aperture of users funneling into on-chain experiences how do you think that happens so we're seeing like you know twitter incorporate nft um authenticating nfts into you into their profile pics right tiktok is doing some things too um youtube has made some headlines recently i don't know many of the details there about getting more aggressive doing more in the nft space i'm sure you know far more about that than i do but like a youtube or twitch how do you anticipate if if if you were still in charge of a kind of a youtube's uh blockchain and nft strategy what would be the first features that that you would add and where do you expect this to evolve first i'll use twitch as an example to save myself from from any and any issues you know since i was at youtube and love what they're doing but a great example for like what you're already even seeing like take twitch a video platform right twitch has clips right there are clips that are super you know prolific and that everybody knows them and can and can reference them whether it's you know ninja and drake's moment or an esports tournament yeah awesome to mentos right and be able to mint those today and then have ownership over it right i think you could start to think about your currency as it right that they have bits you know like what what does that turn into if it's like an on-chain token experience and allows for some actual ownership you know obviously it sits under amazon and these are like tough challenges but you know like that would be really cool and if bits had some kind of governance token decision making on product roadmap right you can't obviously build based off of committee it's a ridiculous concept that you can just like have all these different topics and deliberate with the community on but you could also start to make big decisions i'll give you example like say you know i was running twitch and you had governance tokens what would you put up like do you want us to focus on vod or do you want us to focus on short form content or should we build more live features like put a take a governance token and put that to and then let's actually live by that token and not use it as a suggestion but actually the outcome of that decision making let's actually build that way right and so i just think these are great examples of things that they could do to integrate over time where yeah it's still very centralized in a lot of ways but they have they start to incorporate some of these behaviors that are allowing for that and enabling it uh this is where i would start to focus um i also think like having an nft around a creator is really interesting because there's like utility that you can build behind that you know whether it's meet and greets and discounts on merch or whatever it is right um so yeah i think like there and twitch has done a great job of getting close to that if you even look at you know um there's like channel points you know and so you know you go into like ryan and david to be streaming like who's gonna who's gonna win this you know match you know ryan or david so like there's even some of that so i don't know i think there's a lot of things that they could start to do that would be really interesting in the space that people would like if you just remove the idea of and if you remove the term the acronym nft and you just talked about the technology i think people would be fascinated by it there's two themes that i think are colliding in this conversation that i want to go ahead and just get right into that that collision point the the first thing ryan you talked about how axia infinity is really good at an economics game uh you know people don't play axe infinity because the graphics are aaa plus they don't play it because it's the most fun game in the world they play it because there's this really interesting economics element behind it and it's really the economic element of axiom infinity is is what that game is this the the visuals the skin is just a minimum viable skin to make that economics game fun and that's what the crypto gaming the web3 gaming side of this world is really really good at like we are building up the economic side of this thing because that's the new thing that's new on the other side of the spectrum we have things like activision blizzard and ea that are really really good at making very high fidelity high graphics very in-depth lore rich games that we are we all know that exist to this day and there's there's and the promise the goal of crypto games is that we get to maximize both and that's something that is completely unexplored axi has like definitely pioneered crypto games ea activision blizzard has pioneered uh fun visuals uh fun stories fun fun gaming mechanics and we're trying to collide these two things while maximizing both of them meanwhile the other the other part of this conversation that we're talking about is that the the brain drain from web 2 to web 3. like you are no longer at youtube because you had to go to polygon because a lot of the people that get crypto pilled can't stay at their web to trad job because it's not enough for them the itch isn't scratched enough uh and so and i've seen this time and time again where like even uh for example coinbase has had to hire non-crypto people because they needed to grow out the company to become large enough uh and there just wasn't enough crypto people around and so coinbase got um just kind of like lagged behind because there wasn't enough true native crypto people to make uh coinbase the the crypto native company that everyone wants it to be and so i'm worried that like games like or companies like activision blizzard or ea just won't be able to find the crypto people to add good economics into their games because all the good crypto people went to the the teams like axe infinity or like polygon so how how do we collide these two worlds how do we get the the traditional legacy incumbent gaming studios to have really really good economic elements to them and how do we have all the good economic games become like extremely vibrant and rich is it going to be like mergers and acquisitions how is this gonna happen i love it that everything you just described i agree with and this is exactly what i want polygon studios to be right because i think what you're gonna have at this point is you're gonna have a you you are going to have this huge gap in talent so you're gonna want to figure out how to tap into people i would like a part of our studios team particularly the game design team to have a mixed background of traditional game development and also understanding of like tokenomics and game design and balance and have that as a service so that when they are thinking about game development so activision blizzard it's like now like they're not gonna just like turn all their games into blockchain games but when they the day comes and i think it will that they knock on our door and they're like look we got a new ip coming out we want to make a new game a blockchain based game everything david just said is true we don't know like we don't know where these people are we don't have anybody that's like great with tokenomics like we don't understand what's working what's not working we'll be like not a problem like we got you covered we have some of the best people in tokenomics we have people that have made you know call duties in the past we actually are going to send a room and we're going to help you along the way and that goes back to the beginning of what i said like what studios value prop is is it's not a tech conversation at that point like yeah yeah solidity polygon done right not a problem how do we actually make it a great game so that people want to be on it and that's i think will be a huge offering of studios so it is hard right you're gonna have to find this mix of people you're gonna have to be patient with people that are interested and need to learn right um and you know web 2 folks that will come over but i think if like we can offer it as a resource we will be able to help um kind of bridge the gap between the space one there's one thing i've noticed in the gaming conversation is um a frustration about the the current state of uh the gaming studios the big ones the ones i've already mentioned activists and blizzard ea um some of the ones i can't like they're they're kind of in that like too big to fail type state of like they're so big they are so consolidated and they've become like misaligned with their communities where their communities want them to like innovate and pioneer and take new risks and instead what they get are like micro transactions and loot boxes uh and and so like there's seems to be like a bunch of uh desire for disruption and innovation that's not coming from the current gaming ecosystem and i'll and that's leaving room for a lot of these newer studios to show up but they don't really have the the edge needed to really compete with them but i think that might not be true once we start to talk about web 3 crypto games do you do you think there's a room where these these newer crypto enabled crypto funded uh games uh gaming studios of the future are the like the renaissance and gaming that we are actually looking for it might be a little much to like say renaissance but i think there's a macro level issue here that there's a ton of capital being deployed across the game space like and we've never seen anything like this before on top of the acquisitions that are happening which we've also never seen before i think at the end of the day gamers are going to have a ton of optionality and that is that in itself will fragment the entire industry in a good way right so yeah there's consolidation of these big games and big entities but there are so many different games coming out that appeals to such a broad user base um that i actually am not as concerned about this like consolidation that maybe others are because i see all these games on the horizon that are funded by big venture and so forth right i think what would be really interesting is how what everyone's go to market strategy is and i think the go to market strategy for blockchain based games in the creator economy is going to be really interesting versus all right traditional publisher i have to write david a check to go play or stream my game for a month well if all of a sudden i'm like david i got you tokens that you can participate in the upside you know they have a lock-up period i have nfts that i'm going to give you and actually that's how i'm going to tap you as far as leveraging you as a creator and doing your brand deals and going to market i think that gives you a unique advantage both as a creator and both as the developer which i think will cause a disruption and i'll tell you what i'm a huge believer that the gaming content creators the youtubers and twitch streamers disproportionately drive the thought share around like what games to be able to play and i think they are going to greatly benefit from go to market strategies that web 3 games offer the creator economy that the web 2 can't like you know it's like activation blizzard with call of duty it's like they can't be like uh here's you know might well microsoft series but activation blizzard shares uh you can participate in that way right it's like very different so anyway it's a little bit long-winded that i actually think although you see consolidation i think you're going to see a bunch of disruption over the next couple years and web 3 will be a contributor to that also with the user-based shifting of whales but yes yeah it's interesting to hear you say because that was always my uh my gut take that the content producers in streamers have a massive amount of influence in terms of like the tastes and preferences and which games are successful and which aren't and it's funny to me that they haven't yet tapped into crypto economics okay because like um a lot of other crypto youtubers certainly have when they're talking about projects um that they're investing in that they're excited about and maybe i wanna touch on this uh this content point uh really quick because we had chris dixon on the podcast a couple of months ago and we discussed this this idea that web 3 can happen a lot faster than web 2 because web 3 has web 2 to propagate itself yeah and that is such an asset that i think we have right now with um all of the youtubes and and twitches and all of the social media that are already up inactive in live um what do you think content's relationship is between uh like crypt with crypto gaming do you think that content will be and streamers will will start to propagate crypto gaming and is that a bold case for it do you think that's a reason why it maybe happens sooner than people expect i don't know that if it's something if it will happen sooner because i think at the end of the day a content creator doesn't want to stream a game that they're not passionate about and they won't just shield games right like it's very obvious you know so it's not like nft projects where people are just like pumping nft projects because they're a content creator right you don't you don't want to stream 100 hours a month a game you don't like you don't want to upload 30 videos in a month of a game you don't like so right first and foremost there has to be quality games that come over and do you think let me ask you though ryan do you think that changes if they're getting like very wealthy on these crypto games right i know that's the case now i don't think i so i think there's a lot to unpack even in this conversation right because then all of a sudden when they're streaming games that have like volatility and are ongoing like free economies it's like almost you're playing a video game but it's also like somebody that's streaming trading live right at the same time you know i think it's really like once they get into a game there then it's easier to talk about how they actually stay within that game because the you know the economics of the developer offers them to participate in it long term and that's you know a lot some people are like oh you can't do that i saw you know like jiho getting crap about it and i i wrote back i'm like it's absurd all the top creators are getting deals from game publishers to play their games you know when they launch and market them and so forth i think the thing that creators haven't so content creators when they look at it it's really daunting to learn about crypto right you know it's i think you guys for your background and how long you've been in it really take for granted how deep your expertise and knowledge is and how daunting it is to get into the space and understand all these things it's very very intimidating and the learning curve is really really steep right and so i think you need two things to happen you need time to learn and i don't think the i don't think the desire to learn is going to happen until there's a game that they're really interested in now of us all of a sudden they have to care and they want to care about it right and then all of a sudden they're going to figure out they'll have the agents and managers that are going to help them understand like your deal is a token deal it's not a check you know for marketing right and this has a lock-up period what the heck is a lock-up period right like what does that mean for me what kind of disclosures do i need to have as a content creator right this is just going to take time but it's going to happen all this is going to happen it's like very clear to me all this is going to happen but you need time and something needs to be a catalyst for wanting to learn you know mine was like general intrigue creators when they find a game that's blockchain and their economics change because of it in a good way and yes they'll learn but that's my that's the that's the biggest issue there uh another thing i want to collide in this conversation uh i'm about to bring up right now um i i joke with on on the on the show a number of times that there's there's three things that i know for a fact that crypto has produces products one is money we're really good at producing self-sovereign money another one is yield d5 is really really good at making yield and the third is content crypto people love content there's just never ever enough content they just want more of it they want more of it and we were talking earlier about how like once upon a time the the gaming in the industry was perhaps like or the the the rest of the world was like oh we're gonna make content about people watching people play video games like that's not never going to work and like it seems like that ecosystem that side of gaming is like almost as big as the gaming ecosystem itself as it turns out gamers also love content so when we when we collide these two things uh what what do you think the future of crypto gaming content intersection looks like like how big of an industry how big of a tam do you think this is oh dude the inflection point of what will happen the space like when a good game comes online and creators start creating content around that is going to be like significant think about um you know the one thing i even look back in the youtube days it's like you know what no one really watched mobile games you know like it wasn't really a big thing to watch mobile games now you look at it it's like you have pub g mobile and green a free fire and all these different games that kind of come up and it creates like another leg up in this industry right mobile games in this in this particular instance so i think there's two good things about that one as somebody who's recently learning right relied heavily on youtube as a way to learn right there is some great channels podcasts whiteboard crypto your podcast right where all of a sudden if you're interested there's no excuse on not to get brought up to speed as quick as possible so that's great the same thing is going now when it's like you have to be kind of into like web 3 early days d5 to like care about some of this  you know what's going to happen is like when it's gaming you know and all of a sudden you go back like oh this is awesome new game that came out i'm a big streamer i'm playing it right now here's how you set up your wallet here's how you buy here's how you get into it all of a sudden you're like oh we just got another 100 million you know people into crypto and i don't even know if they really realized it and so i do think content is you know key right to use the cliche saying and it will be the he the next big inflection point so i think we see a lot of experiments in the next 12 to 24 months and it's only gonna take one game look what minecraft did to youtube you know minecraft has been the largest game for a decade on youtube never been dethroned right you know just hit a trillion views on the platform materially changed the entire course of history in the games industry both playing video games and watching video games you get one game that's blockchain like that it'll it'll it'll absolutely change all of what we know about the space and material way and i think we're like you know where there's smoke there's fire and i'm seeing a lot of smoke in this space right now and i'm excited for it i think that's probably going to be how we solve crypto's pr issues with the anti-cryptogamers the anti-nf tiers it's got to be through user-generated content uh if we can get because there is no like ryan and i we're gonna do our best to promote nfts but we're crypto natives right like people aren't gonna trust us because we're not we're not gaming streamers but i think when we find a way to make a crypto game that can also produce crypto gaming content around it from the gamer side of things that pr the positive pr that's going to be what educates people to get more private keys to open up metamask to be more okay with nfcs to lean into it i think that it makes sense sense to me as like the the best most viable way to like solving kryptos pr issues with all the anti-crypto people these days yeah and going up that funnel it's when you have great products right they'll speak for themselves like it won't be a pr issue because great products will tap will be tapped by content creators which will then be amplifying that great product that other people will dive into as well and so the pr issue will stop when we're talking about the actual pr issue and we're talking about like hey we're on i'm on this podcast in three years we're talking about like this awesome game that came out how many users are playing and how many people love it and we're not even having these conversations and i think that's the inflection point and we're close man i think you know look like we're not we're not too far out that's why i don't really engage in the topic too much but great products will solve for all of this and we're very close to having great products in the space you touched on this a little bit but i want to head on this topic i want to take this topic head on um the cool thing about uh assets in games or crypto assets in general is that they can transcend ecosystems uh you know you can take your one d5 token and go into a different defy protocol with that and you can all and that's this is the magic of crypto games you can uh you can play your game and then you can take your assets elsewhere outside of the ecosystem and do you see a world how how do you see the world of like there's assets inside of games like some games gold that's native to that one particular game could in theory be connected to the content ecosystem around that same game so like you're grinding in the game you get the gold but then there's content around that game that also could use those same economic assets as compensation referral fees referral links i don't know um like do you how big a how how important do you think the link between the financial compensation or financial rewarding of content producers about the game itself do you see this uh as part of the future world of crypto gaming i do i think you know i think the incentive model for creators to create content around the game is going to change right and right now it's very basic it's like i like this game this game gives me viewership so therefore it equals money or i got a check written to play this game and it's good enough for me to not feel like i'm showing it right it's pretty much your monetization right now in the creator economy i think what you just discussed will happen but the complexity is like tenfold right when you start to talk about all of that right like accruing tokens because of content you created or viewership that you generate and all of that i think it will happen but that complexity is so high that it's going to take a long time for people to really understand that but i do think it is inevitable because the incentives are better aligned for everybody we have this other uh primitive that we've developed in crypto which is somewhat interesting called a dao right a decentralized autonomous organization but it's just to me you know from world of warcraft and diablo days it's it's like a guild it's just kind of like a you know a gaming guild that where you might earn loot and treasure and prestige with your friends um do you think that this is going to be important for us what do you think about dowse and how does that tie into uh yeah like spending time thinking about guilds and dowels and so forth um as you know i think with that yes a certain part of it is you know like some of it though you know of of guilds of being like asset ownership particularly beneficial to play to earn games because it helps with like yield generation and so forth is a whole different topic i mean dallas will be interested i mean it's like the hot you know leaving east denver it's like apparently everything is now a doubt um so we'll see what their their place is but i agree right like if you think about like going back to world of warcraft you know you have this group of people you're making group committee-based decisions on things that you should be doing how you want to represent yourself how you want to invest how you spend time i can see you know dows coming together having tokens across a variety of games making decisions based off of it so yeah i think it's like it has a play it has a place in this world i'm still kind of seeing what it is and what the value prop long term is both with guilds and taos and delineating between those two and what that means for the space i also think it almost warrants even another like follow-up conversation other day of like okay we said blockchain gaming is a subset of the gaming industry well within that there's like uh you know a pie chart of different types of games that will evolve over time and you know guilds and dazzle mean different things to some of those uh different games like a play to earn game or something that has that you know crafting or breeding into it and so forth uh i'm an advisor for a company called breeder dao right and they have like a tech stack that just does a really really good job of helping facilitate breeding and and and i think that will have like there's going to be like a whole tangential industry of businesses that are propping up in the games industry around this because of it so it's interesting space i think it's super cool and it's um you could tell something's organic when it when it gets really weird and crypto gaming is like really weird now breeder doubt like that sounds very strange but um yo that's what you get when you have something like uh minecraft which is sort of an open open landscape for uh for creators to to build things on um curious about this so just tying off the the established gaming industry incumbents the existing game studios so what do you think they do as a reaction to all of this because it seems early on that we have maybe three different reaction archetypes like the first is you attack crypto maybe some are sort of doing this a little bit like steam maybe they're blocking some crypto games you're seeing a little bit of that um then you got the ignore crypto which has seemed to be sort of the status quo for a lot of existing traditional uh gaming studios and then you've got the the embrace crypto which i don't think we've we've seen any game studio come out and fully embrace crypto right like maybe they're dabbling um so what do you think how do you think this is going to shape up do you think we'll we'll get those those three strategies and how how is this going to evolve yeah there's a couple things that unpack there i think the steam thing until you have clarity and feel like your users are um are safe in the games that they play in you it's best to just take a a ban to all of it until you have a more nuanced understanding of it so i don't like it but i certainly can appreciate it because there are games that you just don't want to enable because they're actually games that are malicious or bad behaviors and too much volatility and it's best to just actually you know rule with an iron fist until you have a better understanding of it actually set a rule set and guideline of what games you're allowed to on the platform so that you can ensure the safety of your users on it so i'm okay with steam my hope and optimism for steam is that's what they're going to do long term they're going to be like these are games that we feel are safe we've looked at them we understand them we understand the economy of the games we know how they work we know how they're positioning themselves to players we actually feel safe with this being on store so that's that's one the other thing is you ask like kind of how they should look at it look if i'm running a big games publisher right now i'm right now putting a team together of saying we should launch a new ip a new blockchain based game completely new ip put the whatever web to game developers that we have that are super interested in the space i'm gonna retain that talent i'm gonna put you all spin you all up to work on a game so i'm like everybody who likes web3 that is a game developer tell me who you are and i'm gonna let you come work on a team right now instead of going to actually formally going to web3 and i'd put them on a project to start working on a game and a new ip it's good for retention there's only benefit of learning right like all of a sudden we're going to build out this great competency of what a blockchain game based is we're going to actually probably learn a lot about games economy as well that will help us with our off-chain games you know and probably get smarter about what we can do there can we create some faux you know uh blockchain like experiences and so forth over there and that's what i would do so i'm hopeful they do that i also think there's interest like you know with like look i think if you um if you think long term there's an opportunity to generate more revenue off the game because it's a blockchain based game it's like it's good to go explore that on a new ip and understand and better learn against that and they have the resources to do it now with all this consolidation i would rather be doing that um especially if you believe in like my free to play whale shifting thesis right that you would get ahead of it and mitigate that so obviously i'm biased here because that's kind of what i believe long term is the shift of whales so you could hedge a little bit if you believe that in your you're at a studio by doing something like this so it's like employment retention it's knowledge and it's also you know this you know new foray into the the games industry of trying something different this has been really cool ryan and you know thank you for spending so much time with us as i said like uh your cohort is injecting a whole lot of uh capability and energy into the space right this this practicality that i feel like we need you've got a lot of bagless has a lot of listeners who are very excited about scalability technologies layer twos like you know polygon the polygon ecosystem in general and you signed on to develop the polygon ecosystem not not as much from a technical perspective but just from like a a community perspective right enriching the the ecosystem as a whole um so uh give us the pitch for for why why polygon what do you think that this does for the ecosystem we're seeing more layer twos uh spend more time on their community and the ecosystem and less than the tech these days um what makes you so bullish on polygon why do you why did you decide to sign up so i'm pretty so there's that's great thank you for asking that actually there's a a lot of reasons um i think one you know ethereum is here to stay long term like full stop right okay so then you have this desire to want to develop on ethereum and i think polygon is going to be and is the best way to do that you know with the tech stack that we have and we'll have in the future and you also have to go back to kind of what i said earlier on if you're like what's the long-term polygon bowl case if you will is you've got to believe that in the long term people value the like the biz dev side right and the actual developer relationship side so much because the tech sac doesn't have a lot of it's not highly differentiated from other opportunity other offerings right and so i feel like what we're going to be able to do now is the tech stacks already in a great place we've spent a billion dollars on acquisitions in the last year on different zk roll ups and like hermes and xero and so forth you know that are inevitably coming online that just enriches our developer tech stack long-term solidity no-brainer like come on over you know um but then i think it's going to be like okay but i want to work with people that are going to actually help me enrich my gain that are going to help me understand how to go to market who are gonna really help me build this big ecosystem who are gonna help me understand the creator economy and are gonna be able to leverage all of those resources and that's where the studios team is gonna come in place so i think of it as like this two-pronged approach of world-class tech and this world-class kind of development arm or studios arm those two things merging together is is really what's going to be really interesting um and i thought for me if like well then why do you join it's great to be on a platform where you have horizontal visibility across the entire industry i'm like learning about music and entertainment and you know we have doing something from adidas to prada to ubisoft to zed run right you know the crypto unicorns and everything in between right and so you get this great visibility of the space um and i i appreciate how much they've invested and spent on acquisition of tech and the thing that they're missing right now is truly that developer support and so i think once we bring that into play over the next 12 months you just have a really you know you're just really well positioned to to work with everybody then ryan we love to get practical at the end here so tell us are there any games we should check out on polygon or you know in crypto in general or anything upcoming that we should watch out for in the in the gaming industry like in the in the gaming ecosystem yeah i mean i i i kind of threw crypto unicorns out there a couple times because i'm actually pretty impressed by what that team has been doing um but i'll tell you i'm already um i'm already in a lot of conversations with people that i think that's why i'm like so bullish long term there's awesome awesome games on the horizon and that's all you know and they just happen to be games that are going to be built on blockchain and i'm excited for all gamers to get their hands on that and what that means for the web 3 movement but that's exciting i appreciate you all having me on it's been fun to talk about this we probably could chat for hours on end about this topic awesome yeah we'll definitely have you on again ryan i can't wait to see where this uh space evolves you guys are doing a lot of the um the business development and the onboarding uh to crypto that that i think the industry needs right now so uh thanks for spending some time with us yeah thanks for having me bankless listeners i gotta end with some action items we'll include a link to the crypto unicorns game that ryan mentioned also a link to polygon studios and i think be on the lookout for some awesome games in the future is the message here if you haven't tried uh some crypto games then uh get your hands dirty we have two other episodes on crypto gaming that we'll include in a link in the show notes as well of course risks and disclaimers none of this has been financial advice ethan's risky bitcoin is risky so is crypto gaming you could lose what you put in but we are headed west
