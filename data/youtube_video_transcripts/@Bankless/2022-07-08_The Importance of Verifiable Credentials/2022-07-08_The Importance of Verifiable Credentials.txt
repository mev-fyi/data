you can think of a verifiable potential to be an off-chain non-transferable nft it still has all the cryptographic properties that makes them fully verifiable to where if anybody tampers with that credential you would be able to verify that that happened these credentials can be used for a wide range of use cases and it could be your driver's license your birth certificate your college diploma and you can prove to somebody that that credential is valid and that that credential came from the source that issued that credential the other use case that comes to mind especially as we come out of nftnyc is you could have other types of credential within the tokenproof app like your h verification you can have a credential within the token proof app in the future that says that and so when you're showing up at the event with one single qr code you're showing that you have a ticket to the event and that you're over 21 so you don't have as many boots on the ground checking for your id and giving you that wristband it can all be done in one single step
