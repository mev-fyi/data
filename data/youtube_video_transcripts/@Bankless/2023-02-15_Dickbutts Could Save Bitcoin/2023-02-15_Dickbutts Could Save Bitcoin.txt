Bitcoin Maximus have been saying that Financial transactions are the most economically dense type of activity which isn't necessarily true now the fees are actually going up and it's because of these dick but pictures it might be possible that the dick butts are saving the security budget problem for Bitcoin dick Bots may actually make it so that we don't need to increase the number of coins in Bitcoins so dick Bots could be the solution but some bitcoiners really don't want that kind of stuff because they believe that it's going to weigh down the chain which is also an incorrect interpretation of what the long-term consequences of ordinal inscriptions actually will be in my opinion
