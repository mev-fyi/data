like groundhog day yesterday too wasn't it do you know if the groundhog saw a shadow i have that happened i have no you don't track this no is there no d5 prediction market on this perfect for groundhog day hey bankless nation it's time for the weekly roll up david first week of february how you feeling man i'm absolutely stoked there's so much that happened in this last week i say that every single time but again it's always always true and at the same time that so much happened there's always also so much to be excited about and we are going to talk about all of those things what happened in the week and also what are we excited about moving forward because there's a bunch of shenanigans going on in crypto as always and we're going to cover it this week on the bankless friday weekly roll up oh my god so much to discuss uh largest exploit ever okay this might be a 300 million dollar exploit and it happened on a bridge this was um actually the second largest in d5 history i should say we're going to talk about this this happened on solana it left 120 k worth of eath on solana no no no no 120k eath on solana yes yes nothing but nothing okay so we're gonna dig into that why did that happen what's going on what are the takeaways also gamestop partnering with immutable so this is the wall street bets love gme and they're partnering with immutable to do a 100 million dollar fund we'll talk about that more trouble in wonderland as well an extension of the conversation we started last week on this d5 project that was managed by a convicted felon also the irs are they taxing staked income as income or maybe not maybe they're not only you would include that as a hot topic of the week ryan this is super hot okay i mean i want to know if my uh staking rewards are income or not there's a potential they might not be and some guy named josh is suing the irs to push that which is awesome ryan just thinks this is the coolest thing my best my new best friend is josh she has a fitness center too we're going to talk about that also david nft season i know you want to get to that too january's been a hot month right nfts are up nfts are in vogue nft season it has been in it's not the old nfts there's a bunch of new crops of nfts uh some new celebs that justin bieber is included in the new celebs that are aping into nfts what nfts did justin bieber buy i'm sure everyone listening to that is on the edge of their seat waiting to hear exactly what justin bieber is up to in the world of nfts yeah you just got to front run the beeps now that's the objective in uh nft trading so so much to discover to uncover as usual uh it was like groundhog day yesterday too wasn't it do you know if the groundhog saw a shadow i have that happened i have no clue you don't track this no is there no d5 prediction market on this i'm perfect for groundhog day does this not matter to people i don't think the overlap is all that big okay all right groundhog day is a thing of the past guys uh we're gonna talk about all of these things before we do we should talk about some updates from our friends and sponsors at xerion xerion is something we've talked about on bankless often it's like an app that i check almost every day to see my d5 portfolio and they're adding some cool things david what are they adding oh so so many things they've added this fantastic graph that i actually really really appreciate just to see like all the different tokens the aggregate value of my entire portfolio but as we expand into the multi-chain multi-l-tube cross-train ecosystem xerion is being the one-stop shop to get all of your money in all the places that you want it to go so they have included all of the evm compatible networks that we're familiar with optimism arbitrary avalanche and they also have other layer ones coming soon into into the integrated into xerion so you can easily just put your money in the places that you want it to be through the xerion user interface just drop down the and select a network and it's really just becoming the terminal to access all your money on all the bridges and all of the chains all at once all from one single spot so go load up your wallet into xerion uh and start doing your cross-chain l2 l1 transfer shenanigans today we got some bridging as well this is a great place if you've got assets scattered all across different chains to see them all in one place so you guys can find out more the invitation is to connect your wallet and see what's up with xeron at bankless.cc xerion all right david let's get to the markets man bitcoin price what are we looking at this week yeah started the last week started this week at thirty six thousand five hundred dollars hit a high of thirty nine thousand dollars and fell back down to thirty six thousand seven hundred and seventy so yeah just uh up up less than a percent on the week um but you know at some point in time when everyone's talking about bear markets uh being flat is good so that's what we saw out of bitcoin this week uh and then turning to ether ether started the week at 2 500 hit a low of 2 350-ish dollars hit a high of 2 800 but then bounced off that high a little bit of resistance at that 2800 mark fell back down to 2620 where we are right now overall up seven ish percent on the week six to seven percent so strong week for it for ether love it bitcoin flat ether up what does that imply for the eth to bitcoin ratio then yeah ratio i think it was last week it bottomed at point zero six five we are currently at point zero seven one almost seven two excuse me um so significant ground cut like recaptured by the btc ratio uh and gosh look at that just look at that just floor being printed oh my gosh like la higher highs back in july we hit .055 a few months later but in october november we hit .06 as a floor uh just last week we hit .065 as the floor so for the last like coming up on almost a year now the e3 btc ratio has hit higher lows consistently which is really cool very interesting as well to track especially going to the merge we'll talk a little bit more about that later the bankless bet index if you want a third a third a thirds a little bit a third d five third bitcoin and thirteenth this is the index for you what's that looking at uh like on the week david yeah marginally up on the week start of the week at 98 dollars currently coming in at 101 dollars so up a little bit more than one percent on the week there you go uh good exposure to those things uh david let's talk a little bit about eth all right because it's up seven percent a little bit the ratio going up um it's going to be a big year for eth we think and part of the reason why is because we have the eip 1559 burn in full effect market is discovering that of course we have the merge hopefully later this year but one of our favorite websites ultrasound.money has added some new really interesting displays where you can see what the burn is doing by category so this is the burn over the last day and it splits it in categories nfts d5 mev l2 and miscellaneous and what's really interesting here is nfts as a category looks like it's consuming 47 of ethereum block space in the burn so it's contributing to 47 of the total burn um d5 is 21 okay and those are the big categories that like everything else is um you know after that but nfts are the product market fit for the product that ethereum sells right now which is block space what a blockchain sell blockchain sell blocks really interesting to see that breakdown in the burn categories here and it's it's more clear on what you're betting on when you're betting on ethy assets product market fit for nfts and for defy and some of these other things as well any thoughts on this david yeah this is a 24 hour time frame what happens if we zoomed out to like a week can you uh there you go okay uh and it stays about the same about the same so it's relatively stable uh and yeah even zooming out to the 30 days about the same pretty cool breakdown pretty cool to see these categories i expect the l2 category to grow significantly uh especially as things like nfts and d phi move on to layer two the layer one burn rate of these things is going to go down and be replaced by l2 burn rates and so this is actually kind of a proxy metric for how much activity is going on on l2 versus l1 and so that will be the thing to watch over the long term eventually l2 will start to just gobble up some of the blocks based share because when you make an nft or d5 transaction on layer 2 that will consume block space on layer 1 ultimately but via a layer 2 bridge so that's what's going to happen there totally agree these are the users of block space many of them will be layer 2s and by proxy maybe your transaction will be rolled up into this you as an individual will not be able to compete with a whole entire layer two blockchain for block space on the layer one so just capitulate now and move your stuff onto layer two hey stop making assumptions david i'm sure we have some massive whales in the bankless listener group that'll always remain on l1 well they can only remain on l1 if other people are also on l1 humans want to be around other humans it's just you and the robots will so you might as well my company there this is cool too i love how ambitious this website is monetary premium track and it's tracking a percentage of market cap of ether versus some other uh monies one is bitcoin of course and ether is about 44 of bitcoin in terms of a value but the next is gold and so ether right now is only 2.6 of gold and it's tracking the flipping so everyone pull out your calculators and multiply the price of ether divided divided by .0026 uh uh i'm bad at math anyways pull out your calculators and do the math yeah it's like it could get a lot bigger is what david's saying also um it's 1.49 of us dollars and i think that's probably us dollars i don't know it's it's it's probably you know one of the m zeros or m ones of us dollars so anyway uh interesting to track that over time uh another chart that i think is pretty bullish for ethereum and paints this picture in a different way chris breninski tweeted this out it's the percentage share of fees over time okay this is block space sales and again what do blocks chains sell they sell blocks uh this is bitcoin in red and ethan green look at this chart david this tracks from incredible inception of bitcoin basically where it was all read it was 100 bitcoin were all the sales of course eth was not a thing and this is tracking these two assets side by side and then eth comes along to uh 2016 about like less than one percent i would say of the uh of the market share of block space between these two and look what happens 2017 you can see and now look at it 2022 okay this is so fast it's blowing me away and chris berninski says almost didn't believe it when i saw it bitcoin currently at one percent of eth in terms of the amount people pay to use the network it's one percent of eth in terms of blockchain sales and look at how fast this happened absolutely mind-blowing the reason why this happened so fast is because of expressivity when you have a turin-complete platform you can generate infinite reasons to use the blockchain and that is turns into fees ultimately at the end of the day it turns into demand for block space if you have infinite use cases it turns into infinite demand i i just i mean it's something we said very early but you can now see it very clearly is if you're betting on eth you're betting in a an economy and if you're betting on bitcoin you're betting just on an asset which is very interesting uh to see this dichotomy also david this was cool you and i did a um state of the nation episode where we went through a dollar cost average for uh ether the asset and that was very well received can you just give the tl dr of of that episode and then i want to talk about this after you do yeah so a discounted cash flow model is a tried and true model that is just used by all of finance like ever that's what that's what finance uses to value the uh the capital assets of the world based on a discounted cash flow model how much money is this thing going to spit out into my hands over time and we can come up with a model for evaluating that ether is the only asset the only l1 crypto asset that has the metrics that are needed in order to actually create inputs into a dcf model and so with that we brought on ryan alice who has done a very robust dcf model for ether uh and we can actually using comparable metrics comparable p e ratios uh to other uh like depending on how fast you think ethereum as a network is growing like do you think it's fat growing faster than amazon do you think it's growing faster than facebook do you think it's growing faster than netflix making some assumptions as to how fast the ethereum network grows we can actually come out with some sort of justifiable model for the price of ether and let me tell you it's bullish if you're surprised it is a bullish output of a model and the cool thing about that is that is just one aspect of ether that makes it so cool is the the cash flow analysis of ether there's also reservation demand by locking it up in d5 that's not even included in that model so definitely go just watch that state of the nation it's on the video it's on the video on the youtube it's also on your podcast feed and if you just have any people from tradfi world that wear ties send them that send them this model like this is the language that they speak this is how ether is going to be understood by tradify and how is it how it's going to be justifiable to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into this asset coming from uh people that wear ties send the bottle to your thai wearing friends is what david's saying and what's cool here is we say all this to also uh tee up this there are other takes on a discounted cash flow type model a dcf and so after that episode one bankless listener messaged me and said hey i've got some an even more dcf more precise dcf estimation here and uh passed me his spreadsheet and uh it's an even more bullish prediction okay i love it i like this one now and it's not just more bullish this listener says it's also more accurate because it looks a bit more at the monetary side of things and the demand side it's a bit more precise with respect to issuance in the future i think that ryan alice's dcf was sort of a floor model based on some more static assumptions and this gets a bit more dynamic with ryan alice the the model spit out an eth price of 10 to 12k at about like 3.5 to 4 trillion dollars in market cap this one's spitting out neath price of 73k all right but you the thing is like that's such a high crazy high number that i feel like if you sent that to your thai wearing friends it would just break their brains like is that even allowed then check the numbers time to check the numbers like put your own variables in the spreadsheet anyway optionality here guys if you like these types of uh analyses i will include this link to this dcf model in this in the uh show notes you know that the listener also mentioned to me because we said we asked ryan hey do you model other layer ones this way i know you're bullish on layer ones ryan ellis do you ever model other layer ones this way and he's like i've never done that actually well this listener did he modeled cardano based on its dcf and the fair price of cardano was about one to two cents which is interesting because it's trading above a dollar right now i'm i'm look not sure what the model say i'm just it's just a model plug your own numbers in and you can assess the fundamentals for yourself and choose what you invest in right that's all we're saying love you cardano love you charles uh visa visa two billion in transactions on their crypto linked cards that's a lot that happened really fast it's a lot yeah do you have one yet do you have any i do not no no i don't waiting for the gemini one yeah waiting for the gemini one i have a block five one uh that i use a little bit also coinbase has like a debit card that i have it's like blue looks kind of cool i don't know i don't know how many of these i'm going to collect yeah it's really good uh we did that episode anchorage where we talked about the bulk case for for all of this i think this number will go a lot higher um david some staple coin numbers reminding us that stable coins are big yet small but what is this number we're looking at here yeah we're looking at total value settled with stable coins per year so every single year the graph resets back to zero and you can just see how much more money is being settled by stablecoin so like at the end of 2019 we settled like i don't know 0.2 trillion dollars by the end of 2020 we settled a whole entire one trillion dollars by the end of 2021 we settled six trillion dollars so we went from .2 trillion to six trillion inside of three years uh and then you can just look at how steep the curve is at the start for of 2022 and compared to how steep it is at the start of 2021 and it looks like we're just going to have another record-breaking year in terms of stable coin value settled so cool it's just another like 5x per year where are all these fees coming on ethereum i don't know 5x per year right so next year maybe 30 trillion yeah you could be larger another another chart reminds us that um well it's a lot settled there's only 140 billion dollars in stable coin supply outstanding so uh still lots of room to grow still very small if you compare that to like money markets which some people compare as sort of like uh quasi stable coins like some people say shadow bank stable coins money markets are like 5.5 trillion and um you know the euro dollar is in the in the you know large trillions i don't know it's like three to five trillion uh or more so just a ton of room to grow on stable coins and i have kind of a thesis i don't know if you agree with this david but i feel like when we've seen stable coins grow they often grow faster during kind of bear or crab markets where people are like uh i i want to hold some usdc and i want to harvest some yield on my usdc rather than having all of my cash deployed into like crypto native uh assets so like you know during bearish markets people tend to collect more stable coins they you know might sell their assets and wait for the bear markets and then um you know have have stable coins but you got your david spec david a skeptical face on what do you think about that yeah that's not that's not what i've seen i've seen a stable coin supply grow up uh grow really high during times of of bullishness because that's when yields are super super high and also people are being degens and borrowing against their crypto assets more and more and more and so there's twofold demand there there's more demand to borrow uh and and also because of higher yield and i think that's what we see in the charts during times of number go up stable coin supply also goes up um jim bianco actually thinks that it's actually stable coin supply that's really a leading indicator towards bull markets as in like more anyway for d5 yeah more stable coin supply makes bull markets easier to happen because because the cost to borrow are low and we see that out of the federal reserve right like what are the problems that we're having today is that the markets have been so bullish because the cost to borrow has been so low that people have been taking out infinity leverage and that's been pumping up the value of assets so i've taken the other uh side of that i have one more thought about this chart but i'll let you respond no i i i think that there's some give and take so i don't feel strongly on that i think um it just tends to go up telling i'm telling you i'm right yes you're right david i know you you wanted to hear that today you're right david uh what's your other take on this chart though look at look at all the different colors look at them it's so balanced like look look at how yeah it's a very pretty pretty rainbow nothing's really too dominant but also look at the um as soon as what around like i don't know may of 2021 happened tether growth really tapered off in favor of usdc growth and other uh other stablecoin growth so this is starting around may 2021 was when uscc really started to take the lead in rate of growth and now we so just a couple weeks ago we saw uscc finally pass pass a tether supply and so regulated stable coins really taking the lead versus uh you know more black box unregulated stable coins i would like to see more d5 native staple coins take the lead and we still haven't seen that yet um but uh we'll see we've got some regulatory information coming on stable coins as we get to the new section but guys so much more to cover we're going to hit releases we're going to talk about the big news items that you have to know in crypto but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

right guys we are back with the releases of the week david uh d5's favorite lending and borrowing protocol is getting ready to launch its v3 has just been deployed to testnet this is ave v3 what's going on here uh ave v3 deployed to seven test nets and so yeah that's what yeah look at it's pulling everywhere yeah deploying everywhere and i think that's just lending themselves to how they're going to deploy uh i think obvi is about to become a cross-chain multi-chain ecosystem play uh and so like i mean look at that graphic there's avalanche optimism arbitrary polygon uh phantom i think is that one harmony uh so of it going everywhere turning into a protocol of protocols uh and so pretty cool um there's gonna have just probably a lot more crosstrain features capital efficiency features because the fees are lower you just get more optionality with what you can do in the protocol uh so just like rejiggering and rebalancing your your portfolio without incurring like bajillion dollar gas fees uh so cool i'm really excited for aveb3 yeah same here great protocol uh david let's talk about some of the exploits okay i think that's the main message of the week or the main news item is this massive exploit uh but this is cool from poly market there's a way to to actually trade and hedge against this risk uh here's a question on poly market will this d5 protocol suffer an exploit by march the end of march 31st 2022 and you've got prediction markets for all of these protocols uniswap maker dow compound so people think there's a five percent chance that uniswap could suffer an exploit by 631st seems really high you could bet against that you know i'd love to see a market like this for bridges especially on the back of this week right right right right five yeah the problem is like i would love to put money into this market and just collect that five percent uh you know winnings because uniswap's not going to get exploited by march 31st 2022 but also the reason why i'm not gonna do that is because ether i think it's gonna go up more than five percent in that same time frame like i mean i always think that but like so like what's the point of holding usdc to get five percent by march to the end of march when i'd rather just hold eth well it's you know it's free money if you're right yeah but i kind of feel like that like ethan other assets like it are kind of a black hole for all of my available cash too let's talk about this david this is a new protocol release kuiper the kuiper like the belt the kuiper belt um it's a kind of like set maybe kind of like index co-op but also a bit different uh what's your take on this it's an index protocol of some sort right yeah it's a governance minimized uh like trustless more trustless index protocol being established by some of the guys over at d5 polson uh a few other just independent developers um uh they're trying to go the very very dense uh protocol sync route by just being permissionless and uncensorable uh from day one uh so going to be keeping tabs on that yeah me too i think it's uh interesting still looking at like how different it is versus index and set and some of those things but it feels like it's a bit closer to the metal deeper in the critical sync as we might say in bankless terminology uh let's switch to raises of the week we got some unicorns we got to talk about here's one analytics is now a unicorn one billion dollar valuation above 1 billion and they raised an amount what do they raise here 69 million 420 000 dollars nice nice i just love how like dune analyst is a very serious very in-depth analytics platform and then they just go the meme route of raising 69 million 420 000 and i just think it's great we're just making a farce about like money and i'm kind of here for it uh yeah you know krypto sometimes is just hilariously irreverent and um i just love that that's part of the uh the fun for me uh solana their wallet anyway phantom is raising 109 million dollars this is another unicorn so 1.2 billion dollar valuation pretty cool wallet and i guess a metamask competitor-ish except for one thing it's only on solana at this point in time uh what do you make of this yes metamask same niche as metamask but not a competitor because they're just are in completely different ecosystems i've heard fantastic things about uh phantom wallet and people wishing that phantom wallet were in the ethereum ecosystem at the rate that metamask is printing money via their native swap feature i would imagine that phantom has incentives to try and penetrate the ethereum market uh but they they might be solano maxis so yeah well i'm not sure and they've talked about deploying to you ethereum um you know i've heard rumor that maybe second half of next year oh but it's kind of they're kind of busy on phantom at the same time so that could keep getting pushed back uh meanwhile metamask is making some moves what do they do this week they acquired my crypto so my crypto is this uh very old reputable uh team which is working on wallet infrastructure uh led by taylor monahan who's a veteran of the ico era imagine ryan being uh the the founder ceo of an ethereum wallet during the ico era where like she was a veteran of keeping people safe during the ico era we should yeah she was one of the good good guys right yes yes and but also just like imagine like imagine being responsible for like 80 of the inbound support requests for icos because no one knows where else to get customer support so they go to the wallets and that was taylor monahan her team was like basically ethereum support yeah it really was like that and in the same way that people complain about metamask and how like oh like where did my money go help me help me metamask team and like the metamask was like yo we just are the wallet infrastructure like we don't know where you've sent your money dude um anyways uh my crypto is teaming up with metamask uh getting acquired by metamask to help them build out the metamask ecosystem and we are having both dan finley and taylor monahan on the live stream on tuesday to talk about this acquisition uh and where metamask is going from here just makes a ton of sense so congratulations to both teams uh looking forward to chatting i do want to hear where metamask is going next uh that'll be interesting conversation so make sure to tune in david this is weird this week do you know ftx is now more valuable than coinbase how how is that possible they're not even publicly listed where do they get all the valuation from it's it's you know private valuation so it's on the private market and so if you add up the private valuation most recently of coin of ftx and then also you add uh ftxus which is a separate subsidiary which i don't know didn't we talk about that last week is like worth eight billion dollars on its own and you take the cumulative amount it's worth more than the public price of coinbase on the market which like surprised me right does that surprise you yeah it definitely does because like you know ftx is a gargantuan in this space and they're doing a lot more and they move a lot faster than coinbase but they also just don't have the same branding like when people when you ask people like yo like where should i go get my my crypto should i just get a coinbase account like that's always what they ask first like oh like do i just sign up with coinbase and like obviously yeah sure great it's a great spot um but somebody said so a couple things when i tweeted this out somebody said one one is that um well there's a difference between private and public markets and when you go public you're going to be marked down okay so maybe there's a discount when you go public which would be interesting i don't know um and then the second thing was okay the difference with ftx is derivatives huge focus on derivatives which is a massive market and also international focus where they're stronger so you might tell your retail friend like hey start with coinbase but if it's a you know fund of some sort and they're getting into like more exotic derivative type products pushing a lot of capital ftx might be the go-to spot i don't i don't know what this all implies for for coinbase but it's uh you know the battle of crypto banks is a real thing and it's going to keep on going if you told me back in like 2018 2019 that there would be a an exchange that would be rivaling coinbase and that hadn't existed yet because ftx wasn't around back then i'd be like you're you're absolutely crazy there's no way like the exchange marketplace is like way too competitive there's no way a new exchange can come back to to dethrone coinbase turns out that's what happened well if it happened once can it happen again making any exchange bets david these days no i'm not d5 changes yeah there you go uh also big congrats to our friends at castle island they just raised a hundreds of millions for a new fund this is nick carter who's been on the podcast i don't know five six times yeah something like this uh what does castle island invest in yeah they up with their pod yeah yeah i do they they invest in they're pretty heavy in bitcoin infrastructure investment but they also do defy investments and and are really big in the stable coin world uh and so they kind of span themselves out pretty well i'd say um with emphasis in the bitcoin ecosystem uh and they are definitely just um uh true crypto believers through and through uh they understand how this industry works uh i get so much of my knowledge from the carter uh i wish that likeness of him was actually better i don't think this looks like i think nick looks way better than that in real life it's not terrible though but yeah it's not terrible yeah but yeah i could tell it's nick i guess it's just like wax museum nick yeah that's great exactly right anyways uh congratulations to castle island looking to looking forward to hearing where you guys put that money uh on your pot fun fact uh the their weekly roundup was the inspiration for the bankless weekly rollup uh and that's how that happened so that means we stole that from you yeah we totally saw that jobs jobs get a job in crypto look at all these companies raising they're all hiring we put this strategically in our roll-up agenda where it's like look at all the money these protocols and companies have and then we're like jobs jobs jobs go get it new jobs on the job board this week a senior product engineer at moment ranks go check that out also a slew of dydx positions some technical some not you want to be a community manager at dydx do it governance growth lead as well business operations and finance associate marketing associates see all of these don't require technical skills fantastic all of these jobs are open for you now accountant smart defy a web3 engineer solidity and react at goldfinch a senior go rust engineer as syndica a smart contract tech lead at star x that's just the start i could keep david dancing for this entire episode if i read all of these off but i'll leave you to do that at the bankless job boards that's bankless.palette.xyz signup if you want to learn more about goldfinch which is a company that ryan just listed off as hiring we did a meet the nation with them that youtube video is on the that video is on the youtube if you want to learn all about goldfinch they're doing under collateralized lending via d5 via a dow type organization and they have funded some really really cool things all across the world there you go very cool cool companies david news time news uh here it is we gotta start here oh yeah right okay the bridge hack for track yeah 300 million dollars is this 300 million i heard 250 somewhere between 250 and 300 you know depending on the price a lot okay um i said 200 million this but um it was more and um this i maybe we'll start with kind of first off that's big that's very very big that's a big number that's the second biggest defy exploit of all time yes it is yes uh millions when you get in the hundreds of millions that's that's very big territory it's a nice bank heist yes bank guys keep getting bigger uh it's well i'll start here with it's it's kind of a prediction that i feel like bankless has has made and uh not happy about this prediction but like it felt like an inevitability in 2022 this is a tweet that i put out earlier in january sad prediction there will be some monster bridge hacks in 2022 that will make people question their multi-layer one chain thesis i feel like that's a little bit what happened right multi-channel bridge really fast it did okay and uh then i probably doubled down on that prediction which is again sad okay sadly this exploit is just the start and i feel like that's the case too although hopefully everyone with bridges is double checking their code right now to make sure this thing doesn't happen but we'll start there tell us actually what happened this thing is called wormhole on solana i believe give us the scoop here david yeah so uh this everyone's attention got raised when sam z's son who's a famous white hat hacker who can like almost like fix any exploit before everyone knows about it uh tweeted out that wormhole is not having a good time uh and it turns out by the time sam paid attention to it uh it had already it had already happened so the wormhole network which is a ethereum two solana bridge that lets you wrap up your ether on ethereum put that ether into a smart contract on ethereum and then that smart contract pings another smart contract on solana to tell the solana chain that some ether just got deposited into it and they can mint new ether fake ether wrapped ether solana ether on the salon chain uh and the reason why that will have value is because you can go back and forth and that's how bridges work uh what happened allegedly from what we are understanding from all the people that know how to code and uncover these things is that the smart contract on the solana side had an exploit that allowed the exploiter to mint uh a bunch of solana ether a bunch of ious for ether on the ethereum chain that was and and so they just minted new ones uh kind of in the same way that federal reserve prints new money if you can get a hold of the money printer you can print a bunch of new monies but that doesn't mean that there's actually more ether backing it on the ethereum chain so the exploiter minted a bunch of solana ether and then sent that slang ether back through the bridge so that they could take the ether on the ethereum side out of this out of the wormhole smart contract and that came out to a tune of 120 000 wrapped ether uh and then that 120 000 wrapped ether is now in the exploiter's wallet and i don't know if they're actually watching it through tornado cache yet um but i would imagine that's just kind of the only way that they can get that value cleaned this happened as we're recording it this happened i don't know 12 hours before we're recording this maybe maybe a bit more so the story the story and what's happening is kind of still developing as we're doing it but yeah exactly what you said right so you've got these fake ious on solana and then the hacker just caches these ious for real eth on the ethereum side of things but this causes some downstream effects doesn't it what are the downstream effects the cascade of effects when something like this happens right so ether is fantastic collateral and so is used as collateral and liquidity inside of solana d phi and so all of a sudden the ether collateral in these defy applications like providing liquidity to other tokens uh becomes unbacked uh and so it kind of goes from like an iou to ether to an iou of nothing and so all of a sudden like the value in these things just evaporates right because it's like if somebody if somebody like stole all the gold out of a bank that had issued ious against that gold well if there's some gold there like you can't issue any ious for it or the ious that you do have are worthless uh and so it has cascading impacts on d5 liquidations happen because if a value of the collateral goes to zero then like people need to get liquidated but also how can you liquidate anything if there's no actual value there like you the ious aren't worth anything and so it really just it just messes up everything it's a it's a systemic risk to have uh all of this unbacked collateral in in in solana defy uh and so like uh this is exactly this uh giorgio's constantinopolis from paradigm says domino effect of now under cloud uncollateralized loans against wormhole eth is severely under mentioned that was yesterday uh this has been fixed actually uh as of like literally one or two hours before recording uh somebody uh we think jump capital has foot footed the bill foot footed footed footed the bill uh i have a hundred foot they they coughed up in all the ether and so now the wormhole bridge is actually whole again because uh we think drum capital coughed up is it jump capital i think so that's what everyone is still developing that's that's unconfirmed but that's that's kind of the only people that we can really consider to have this much money 250 million dollars just like okay here like we'll we'll make wormhole whole again uh absolutely crazy um yeah so so basically we had all of these uh ious that were minted this causes a cascade of problems everywhere this wrapped ether on solana and the solana d5 ecosystem is used right because now all of these assets that you thought were backed by eth are no longer backed right so it's a lot of problem all the while wormhole is saying hey look guys we got this like they were tweeting out we're we're finding a way to restore funds in the background they were negotiating with the hacker i believe and they sent messages to the hacker saying hey if you just return the funds we'll give you 10 million dollars you'll be a white hat right you'll be helping us out for the 10 million bug bounty yeah yeah and who knows there's probably lots of other conversations that we're not not privy to right and so um but now what's just developed it seems like and what you're saying david is uh wormhole is back up they somehow procured the funds amazing and you think it was this was from uh jump capital that's what that's what funded this yeah so jeff garcia asked that question where uh where did the funds to refill the bridge come from uh and so if you click on that tweet and then scroll down you'll see a lot of speculation that it was jump capital um jump is covering because they believe in the future of crypto and what they're building so jump capital i think maybe had some like um maybe were there investors in wormhole or something like that um jump capital is it's a trading desk i think and they just print money from doing trading stuff uh so they're very well capitalized obviously but i mean they could pay for this if they wanted to at the end of the day 250 million dollars is nothing i'm sorry even uh george soros will will notice 250 million dollars missing from his treasury i think yeah that's that's incredible um you know i guess i guess so that you know what do we learn from this episode here there's maybe some lessons that are starting to emerge uh i feel like the first thing we're learning is that bridges are dangerous bridges are dangerous um and they're dangerous they're dangerous in two ways they're dangerous in one the smart contract code for a bridge can actually be hacked that's what happened here there's a smart contract code hack which happened on the solana side which ryan is is differentiating from the bridge it's like so yeah you have that you have the bridge that spans two endpoints two structures and the bridge can break and be broken in the middle or the two structures on the end can also break and those are the smart contracts on either side of the bridge so the bridge was fine because even that even the exploiter was able to transfer assets across the bridge it was the entryways of the bridge that got exploited here and these are each individually weak points and we've seen hacks like this not for a bridge but like this in d5 many different times right you know the famous parody multi-sick hack is you know smart contract code that's basically hacked so that's the first category the other category that we haven't yet seen but vitalik has been talking about um for a while and particularly for the last month is economic attacks so this is like you're sort of dependent on the multi-sig signers or you're dependent on the security of um you know the solana chain or any side chain to actually secure this bridge and that's another iceberg i think under the water a little bit that people aren't seeing um you know from my perspective it's good that people are paying more attention to bridge security so there is a uh i guess a a sunny side at the like at the other side of this um i think it's important to note that both layer ones like this bridge layer ones like this and layer two bridges can have the smart contract vulnerability though they probably don't layer twos don't have the same economic attack uh surface area that these layer one bridges have so i'm happy to see that bridge security is coming into focus it seems like it's good that there's a happy ending where maybe a big capital provider like jump is um reimbursing all funds um i do think that look this bridge was talked about as if it was you know safe and secure and i think a lot of people thought it was safe and secure and i think there is some troubling i guess market pressure for everyone to say their bridge is secure when it's really not and that is troubling and i hope we we we see the lessons of of of security from this and we take those lessons and we apply them and we um look at these bridges with a lot more scrutiny moving forward what do you think the takeaways are david my my the biggest thing i'm surprised about is i had no idea how much ether was on solana via this wormhole like a quarter billion dollars is a lot over a hundred thousand a hundred thousand units of ether is a lot reminder there's 118 million uh ether in existence a lot of that's locked a lot of that is lost so maybe like you know 10 to 15 million of that is actually lost somehow somewhere but like a hundred over a hundred thousand ether is a lot like that is not trivial um and so that's what i'm surprised about i'm i'm surprised that a bridge where in such a nascent part of bridging's like story with crypto had that much ether wrapped up in his contracts um and it also like whenever um solana goes down like we have kyle simani and anatoly come out and say like a main net beta salon is in mainnet beta like you know we got ddos it's going down i'm sorry what kind of mainnet beta has a quarter billion dollars of value in it like we need to pick we need to pick a lane guys uh is this is this a beta or is this a live ecosystem because if people are getting liquidated it's not really a beta um they are very very the whole solana ecosystem is very very fortunate that jump has the means and the reason and the ability to actually cover the losses here um part of me wonder if we we get the wrong lesson out of this as well like i'm glad that um users are going to be made whole for this i think that's a great thing and i'm you know i'm happy individually but i feel like it's a dangerous precedent for bridge users to expect that any hack or economic attack is going to get bailed out in the future because just because this ended with a happy ending doesn't mean the next one will you know there's not necessarily a jump capital who's going to like step in and reimburse everyone um and so especially when these bridges and layer twos and everything decentralize like there's not there's supposed to be no one there exactly so there's there's some brittleness in this structure that we're building in particular in the bridging structure i think we talked a lot about this with roon christensen on the episode that we did with him uh so go check that out that's somewhere in the archives as well uh and uh yeah bridges are gonna be a main topic of discussion this won't be the last hack that we see of 2022 sadly uh and uh yeah we're gonna we're gonna continue talking about it um so um what is this exploiter gonna do with all the money what does one do with 250 million dollars well okay so they can't touch usdc they can't touch usdt they'll get frozen because it'll get frozen so like they can touch die if they want you're going straight to eth yeah and then you're going to tornado cash yeah right but like you can't you can't just wash a hundred thousand units of ether through tornado cash like you can maybe do like a couple hundred each a week but like if you you have to pull it out into different wallets you can't you because but then also like sure you can you can start to liquidate like the the trickle of eth that you push through tornado cash so yeah you hack you exploit something for a quarter billion dollars and then maybe over the course of one year you can discreetly withdraw one million dollars across like you know spreading it out and obfuscating and just wait a long time yeah exactly just wait a long time but like what the hell do you do with the remaining 249 million dollars just keep it neath you take out some loans use it in defy i don't know that's an option to do what if you can't do it where is it it's stuck there yeah i guess it is although like i think a lot more will be built like you could just um expect that there'll be more privacy preserving solutions in the future more off-ramps this sort of thing sit on your hands and so you can get your money later if they're if they're inside the united states like they where are they gonna how are they gonna tell the irs that where they got their quarter billion dollars from oh there i don't i it's very different it's going to be very difficult for them to exit that's why if i am the hacker i'm pr like i'd be pretty tempted to be like oh okay yeah no this just a prank guys look i'm a white hat that's a prank i'm it's i'm a white hat because they because they offered the exploiter 10 million dollars i'll take the 10 million free and clear right and but i'll although i do wonder is that really free and clear yeah you hack something can you just be like yeah yeah can you like remove yourself from all like courts and liabilities yeah just by just taking the 10 million dollar bribe to give it all back yeah or maybe maybe you're supposed to play koi and pretend that you were just a white hat all along maybe that's the way to do it and maybe that makes it free and clear i don't know look i'm not a hacker david do you want to interview a hacker yeah yo if a hacker wants to come on bank list let me know i will throw you a zoom link we're just curious we're just curious what are you going to do with the money that's all i want to know i just want to know what you're going to do with the money dm me yeah but also um i don't want to draw attention to us uh with with hackers david right you know sure yeah right dm anthony sessano will be our go-between david let's talk about this there's trouble in wonderland still there was trouble last week there's more trouble update us on the story that was developing so this was as listeners will remember this was um i have felon in charge of the treasury uh wonderland yeah yeah wonderland so what's happening now david uh yeah so the community has been uh in turmoil i guess trying to figure out how to continue uh what to do with the wonderland project now that one of the core developers core founders one of the multisix signers was discovered to be the uh ex-quadringa guy who's a convicted felon for identity fraud and stuff like that and then also discovered that danny sesta uh just knew about that and didn't tell anyone uh the community has been reeling about like well okay what how do we what are the next steps and that's where we left the story last week there was like a governance vote of you know should we boot this treasury should we continue the project it was it was that that's the 2b continued from last week right and what's also not helpful is all of the the very very uh depreciating asset prices uh time and spell and mim there's just and all the curve a bunch of money has moved around because of as a result of this turmoil so the state of things is unclear um asset prices are down it's and so the community is you know very stressed uh and so danny uh the the leader of the the whole wonderland project says uh tweeted out in a tweet thread that got over two thousand likes so a lot uh wonderland experiment it's coming to an end it's clear from the vote uh from the vote that the community is divided the core and heart of wonderland is still the community if we cannot find agreement on whether or not to continue it means that we failed the duty of the team is to enact the will of the token holders as the vote is so close to 50 50 there's only one path forward uh the vote was to uh keep uh xerox sifu as a treasury member or to oust him um uh and so danny says why does anyone want to keep that i have no clue i i hope that's the right vote uh as the vote is so close to 50 50 there's only one path forward it is to reimburse unwind those who do not feel a part of wonderland and can fight so they can find a new home who feels attached and in line with a frog nation vision uh and so that is what the community of wonderland is currently reeling with um kind of uh oh oh also at the same time uh xerox sifu the the ex-quadringa guy is pushing all of his ether through tornado cache uh and so has put actively exit scanning on the chain yeah just like watching like disappearing through a puff of tornado cache uh and so like that so he his address is becoming uh washed uh so there's that uh and then danny inside of the um uh inside of the discord he said he said this was on january 31st he goes this dow is going going to be managed directly by me the circus needs to stop now and we need to gather more serious proposals and structure to move forward so i mean danny just really pushing himself as i mean at some point like in times of turmoil like some leaders need to step up and like who else is it going to be other than danny he has the most at stake here um but like dao is saying like danny's kind of saying this dao is going to be managed by me it's like well let's take the d out of that dao at the moment yeah so some some mess cements going on yeah how do you think uh this resolves i mean some people are saying like uh governance is so messy it's a mistake to even do this um you know i don't know how does this end in your mind i have no clue but i'm definitely reminded of that uh thomas jefferson quote or george washington quote that said like the biggest argument against democracy is a conversation with the average brother is this the biggest argument against a dow it's actually dow votes yeah yes it is yeah i get it the project will you know hopefully come to a good resolution uh we'll see just a quick update danny uh did not get back to us after saying he would come on the bankless podcast open did not get back to us someone saying being a part of wonderland is like living with a schizophrenic person um no comment following that from me let's move on to other things all right cool things gay things happy things immutable and gamestop the team up gme investors have been waiting for on layer two what is happening with immutable and gamestop david yeah so there was a ton of speculation that gamestop was going to be using loopering to uh issue nfts and they still might ish really but i don't know i think i think that this is a pretty pretty strong commit commitment to the immutable ecosystem so gamestop could be publicly announced that they are going to be issuing nfts using the gamestop like all the all the games that gamestop own and all their platforms and all their ip are going to be issued as nfts on the immutable x layer 2 the zk roll up layer 2 along with in partnership with the immutable team establishing a 100 million dollar fund to help grow the gaming ecosystem on immutable x so huge partnership this is making a ton of big news we are uh you guys by the time you hear this we have already done this but we are right and i are about to go on a live stream with robbie the co-founder of immutable uh to talk about all of this oh my god people are like it's hours away and people are already waiting for this that is crazy it's just because it's the wall street bets community it is very exciting about this different community yeah so uh if you guys want to learn more about everything that a gamestop is doing with immutable go to youtube uh check out that that video uh and then we'll probably put it on the rss feed this weekend or something meme stocks meme crypto producing nfts i don't know sounds kind of fun uh i'm in gonna ask robbie about that uh david what's happening here l two two two stuff okay we uh we talked about this last week where binance ran out of eth to deposit onto arbitrary layer two binance by the way you can you can take your ether and deposit it from the binance exchange you can get it deposited on arbitrary like two weeks ago uh after rolling out that feature they ran out of eth because everyone deposited their ether on arbetron from binance and so they had migrated they had their binance had to put more ether from the l1 into their optimism excuse me their arbitrary layer two so that more people could use that that arbitrarily layer two eth to withdraw onto arbitrarium they ran out of eth uh and then they resupplied it and then happened again they happened again uh in less than 20 hours for binance's new east supply to get drained uh and so there's clear demand i said it last time there's clear demand to deposit money on layer twos coming from centralized exchanges coinbase once again please take note and open up withdrawals onto things like arbitrage and optimism and all the other layer twos so we can drain you coin so we can drain you yeah well look man bankless that's what this whole thing is let's uh ultimately we gotta get a lot of these assets off of exchanges that's um that's the reason we're here this is cool too on layer 2 22 rainbow is now deployed on polygon displays polygon nfts rainbow wallet's pretty awesome david do you use this i have it downloaded i don't use it too much although i think we might be doing a show with them in the future yeah we should and i guess they are deploying on you know on all layer twos it's uh definitely one of the best nft wallets out there um the nft uh layer two ecosystem is definitely not very strong and not as strong as i wish it to be and it's the reason why is like stuff like this hasn't been like deployed yet so you know wallets you user-friendly wallets that allow you to check out and do nft stuff on layer twos it's definitely one of those stories so uh nice job rainbow wallet yeah is it like the the ethereum mainnet sells 90 of all nft traffic right it has like 60 of d5 but it hasn't a total locked value but it's 90 percent of all nfts which is pretty insane but look nfts are doing well at least january nftc i thought bear markets i thought all the liquid jpegs would just evaporate in a in a puff i know you're not the the biggest nft guy ryan but like when i uh cope with down prices i go and look at like pretty jpegs on open c you do i i think that's what's happening i think that's what other people are like yeah let's see go go away coin gecko open up open c like i don't want to look i don't want to look at crypto prices i want to look at my jpegs um i mean that might be a little bit reductive but that's definitely my behavior and uh you know at the same time january has absolutely broken like smashed through records in nft volume just wild and there's a bunch of brand new nft projects that have really just caught people's attentions and that's what we put in the market monday for this week we just kind of ran through all the nft projects that have really captured a lot of attention board apes have a has a floor of like 115 eth absolutely insane justin bieber bought a floor ape for something like 5x the value of it for some reason uh justin bieber also bought doodles uh these brand new doodles things have a 15 like 10 to 15 east floor and where just a couple weeks ago they were two to three eth azuki's are these like anime style profile pictures that are really hot with those that are really into anime and other asian culture type stuff um cool cats and they're cool pets i'm a big fan of the cool cats uh they have their their cool pets launched that happened earlier this week kind of like a board a kennel club type derivative project and then there's a bunch of other nft projects that have captured my attention that aren't necessarily pumping but i decided to include those krypto kovins as new celebrity just bought one of those and that we'll talk about in a second and then also mf'rs which i think are just like these things are janky perfectly offensively it's like it's like ryan's it's ryan's turtle brand but a little bit better than the turtles but not too much better than the turtles in terms of the drawing and just like it's just like so offensively simple it's just like yes like this thing does cost a thousand dollars it's so basic yeah definitely my brand david even convinced me to get one of these so i don't know what i'm i'm an mf or two um it's it's like look is the game now we're trying to just front run justin bieber we're trying to front run the next celebrity because what's interesting is they're buying nfts but it seems like they're not uh they're they're not buying tokens right right i guess that's because when you buy an nft what are you actually buying are you buying some clout are you buying some signals you're buying things you can't get from you're buying clout in community you love it that's what you're buying you're buying a community or didn't you say it's like um this is like a social media experiment when you buy an nft that has a robust community around it and you said hey i'm now part of this mft i'm now a cool cat i'm now a board ape i'm now a punk i'm now a uh mf er than like instant community love right like instant followers it's a clout it's like a like people that don't know the twitter world like you can go and buy followers on twitter and like it's super obvious that you do uh but like in the nft world you can kind of in a roundabout way buy followers by buying an nft and then that community just follows you yeah it's actually really interesting it's composable communities it's one of us that's what's going on all right so here's another celebrity uh cat official cat this is kat dennings kat dennings from two broke girls and also thor she brought a crypto coven which is uh this female lead nft project that has all these very cool drawings of different witches um i think that you're just scrolling through her your twitter feed yeah i'm trying to see what i recognize her from and i don't like but she's in thor i guess oh yeah she's thor and a few others yeah yeah definitely seen around uh not in real life [Laughter] all right board apes okay maybe this is why board apes are worth what five billion dollars and it's not four dates sorry not board apes the yuga labs the creators of board apes the startup behind board apes is receiving this 5 billion uh valuation potentially from a16z 5 billion 5 billion what that's insane what how is that happening i guess you're betting i guess what you're betting is like um that board apes are sort of like marvel comics level ip that they're going to be used in the future across like movies they're going to be part of pop culture that seems to be like a unicorn level 5x unicorn uh level bet and what you're doing is like you're buying the uh the marvel you know the company that created uh like the marvel characters essentially i guess that's what you're doing but i don't i don't i can't i have a hard time wrapping my head around five billion dollars for this it's like a lot of assumptions well i mean it's a 16c so they kind of just like pile into anything that they do and really inflate valuations that i i want that unpacked by somebody more smart than me because that's that is carly riley carly riley overpriced jpegs i'm sure she's on it fantastic nft podcast by the way if you want to hear more about this stuff david and i just you know we tinker at least i do david david's all right ryan just buys what i tell them to buy buy an mf what okay this looks stupid i saw like very rudimentary drawings plus low floor price and i was like oh ryan's totally gonna get one of these yeah all right coachella they are partnering with ftx they're gonna launch nfts maybe tickets is that what they're doing no i think i think they're doing it yeah they're doing the whole like nft collection type thing so coachella i mean i feel like it's the right kind of ecosystem to do an nft style project like all these very very like you know hip young kids that stay up with the times like they maybe they want some nfts for going to coachella like yeah anyone who goes to contrella likes to flex like that's kind of why you go there it's interesting it's like it's uh the headline is coachella partners with ftx to launch nfts where are they launching them on solana it's kind of like whenever you see ftx you see solana it's like solana is to ftx what binance chain is to binance i very much feel like that's the case and you know when we talked to brian armstrong he's like they haven't launched a coin based chain have they they haven't picked like a winner and he seemed like um it's ethereum oh okay that's what you're saying yeah yeah fda system it's coinbase issue ethereum well ethe would like he can't get the value on top like he can't extract the value from that in the way that you know ftx can from solana i remember brian was like oh i like open permissionless uh decentralized and i respect that yeah but i wonder if that's not the profit maximalization time oh so it's definitely not it's already not and that's why ftx is maybe greater valuation than coinbase right now yeah at this present moment you got to do the right thing though brian all right okay so that was a lot of exuberance and chris burniske who's one of my favorite people ever but also has been a bear lately has tweeted the downer big downer nft volumes and prices in january 2022 have been strong many say this shows how everything in crypto may not crash simultaneously again uh i would rephrase that as how everything in crypto can be in different bull markets at different times uh sometimes super cycle like some sectors go up while some sectors go down um chris says that one could say that nfts are at the furthest end of the risk spectrum the most illiquid and so the last to pump with the euphoric gasps of a dying bull oh last gasp of the bulmer chris chris come on we're trying to be bullish here uh chris will not be bullied into being bullish uh unlike most people on crypto twitter so he's always he's a very independent thinker um and when i hear these bear tweets out of chris i just like ah damn it chris like did you have to say that he might be right though i mean there's always a chance he's right what do you think he's what you're betting against obviously it's wrong it couldn't be couldn't be a bear market it couldn't be it's possible it just couldn't be ryan look we said it last week i'm going to double down on this this is this does not feel like you know 2018. it's different it's different it's different bieber's here does that make you feel better oh no that did not make me feel better oh shoot what have we done oh no anything can happen guys reminded bankless listeners anything could happen uh we don't know bull market bear market we're not sure uh chris reminds us of that all right hey let's talk about this uh dm is selling this is facebook's libra turn dm project stablecoin project you you offered a bid last week of 5 000 apparently that wasn't enough okay because silvergate outbid bankless for dm and it's now i think they paid 132 million dollars for this oh that's that's that's a lot that's more than that that's a lie yeah that's a lot but actually it makes sense for silvergate do you know uh so silvergate is like the the actual bank behind usdc and coinbase there were some other banks but it sort of gave coinbase and other exchanges a bank account when no other banks would support them now and that's true for a lot of companies in the ecosystem oh for sure silvergate has been like the uh the traditional bank yeah because everyone else could do it everyone else you know gave gave exchanges dear john levels letters and said get out of here we don't want your business silvergate didn't uh and they have an exchange as well uh like sort of a bank to bank kind of crypto network exchange called the silvergate exchange network so i feel like this kind of makes sense for them david it's just diem has pivoted to a private company-owned blockchain that's going to do bank to bank style transactions oh that does make some do something with it yeah still wouldn't it still wouldn't pay more than five thousand dollars for it though yeah there goes the eth killer is uh getting bought by a bank the youth killer got popped by a bank [Laughter] two years later or three years later i should go back and read some tweets for those that don't know that context dm was originally uh it was an evm fork i actually think it was a death fork or something and then people were talking about that they built their own code but it's like going to kill ethereum right yeah right that was definitely one of the brandings like oh yeah this is going to kill ethereum and then meanwhile buy a bank it's facebook what are you gonna do oh god the irony look at this crypto leaders are launching a political action committee to back congressional candidates so this is a pac all right crypto funded pac uh framework ventures is in there uh ftx is in there blockchain capital missouri multi-chance big money damn dana matajus i can't pronounce his last name dan dan the guy that donated a bunch of money to get coin to for us to host udi on the podcast ah cms holdings cms yeah that's awesome um anyway they're spending 20 million on crypto friendly politicians and you know that's cool to see that is cool i think that's the backdrop where we get to some of these other stories um last week and this happened i believe last friday after we recorded a word came out about um the sec dropping uh a rule a proposal for a rule a proposed rule this is kind of like executive order so it's not coming from congress it's not a law and possibly broadening the definition of what a securities exchange is to include automated market makers and d5 protocols all right it's unclear if that was really their intent but they only gave the industry and everybody involved 30 days to comment so this feels very much like trying to slip the vote through and hester purse of course um dissented on this but it feels very much to me that that crypto is under attack maybe in the executive branch been coming out of treasury coming out of the sec coming out of some other agencies there and i don't know what to make of it so there's that and then you couple that with um there's a great story in decrypt and if you're curious about this we'll include a link in the show notes about the plot to hand crypt the crypto industry to the the big banks and the tl dr of this story is people think and it seems it could be the case that the biden administration directed by treasury and others in the executive branch they don't like stable coins very much they don't like the freewheeling uncontrolled uh like you know nature of stable coins and you can understand when you see things like tether but they're worried about this industry getting too big and uh you know getting outside of the u.s regulatory control so their plan according this article is actually to give it to the banks like make the banks responsible for it if you want to issue stable coins you have to go through the same steps a bank would be uh go through it it's unclear whether this would apply to decentralized stable coins as well how far they would push this in the d5 stack but that is kind of the plot that uh might be uncovered and we're going to see a stable i believe a report from the biden administration uh hopefully like this month about crypto and the actions that they intend to take with respect to this growing industry what do you think about that david yeah it makes me think that this uh very significant amount of success by usdc and tether has actually um taken wind out of the sales of decentralized stable coins because why do we need decentralized stable coins like look at how much usdc we have it pay is pegged to the dollar so well maybe this is the thing that really um puts the brakes on uh things like uscc and tether and really really incentivizes true decentralized stablecoin uh stablecoin projects that we really really need because we need more stablecoins uh but we also don't want them to be issued by banks um i mean even even defy has some amount of systemic risk in uscc alone uh and so like we need to get out of out of that um for just a little bit of context the usdc model and also the tether model of issuing stable coins and then allowing anyone to buy those stable coins in internally in d5 is a is a great gigantic shift in a paradigm and so that allows banks who issue uscc like circle to have some of that money be held by users that never kyc with the bank unlike paypal unlike unlike uh you know any you know wells fargo or zell or whatever if you want if somebody needs to send you money in paypal both people need to have accounts the sender and the receiver and that is not true with usdc or stablecoins and defy the buyer can buy uscc off of the secondary market and send it to someone and it's so much better it's so much better and there's no kyc for either of those two people and that's what really triggers like cash by the way like very much just like physical cash yeah and that's taking the power out of banks it's taking the ability for uh banks to capture us away from them and then it's also taking the ability for nation states to know where all the money is and to tax all of its individuals away from them so there's friction here um and so uscc is this in my mind a very amico amicable middle ground between the desires of the nation-state wanting to push dollars into all corners of the world and the desires of the individual to freely and and permissionlessly transact dollars between their friends and family and whatever um but the banks and the uh the nation states are saying like no no no like it's our way or the highway uh and so uh they are fighting to see it's like let's hope they don't screw it up i think is is the message here and there are lots of ways they can screw it up particularly by giving this entire industry over to the incumbents right rather than the crypto natives uh i hope you guys are ready for a banked future if they get what they want i hope i i hope not this seems to be what i'm not ready for that i'm not going to leave the united states yet you would oh yeah uh where would you go portugal well look this is one guy who's pushing back his name is josh jarrett josh quality fitness he is uh the owner the owner of quality fitness also a crypto staker tezos what's he doing he is suing the irs yes all right this is insanity wolf stuff and why why is he suing them uh it's because he doesn't think that staking rewards should be treated as ordinary income which is sort of maybe the posture of the irs so far and if you are staking in an exchange they'll issue a tiny 1099 and they'll consider anything you know that staked any of the staking rewards ordinary income josh is saying that we don't have clarity on that it's actually new property and you shouldn't have to pay taxes on staking rewards as ordinary income you should only have to pay capital gains when they're sold and so apparently he had a favorable in his district he had a favorable interaction with the irs the irs offered him at first a refund saying okay it's not ordinary income you know staking rewards and uh then he refused the offer and then he went to court and said no i want more than that i want some additional clarity so kind of cool it's like it's you know small because it's in i believe some sort of district court but um some precedent is being set this is what jake travinsky says about this josh sued the irs for clarity on taxation of new tokens created through staking the irs tried to pay him off to drop the suit he turned down the money to continue the case and seek building precedent for all of us king how many times do i have to play the soundboard you're done with me talking about that's what that means dude we need more heroes like josh uh we need more people with uh with spines to stand up and say hey the way that this is working is bad and wrong and we should fix it um you're a citizen you have rights yes push back against the stress use our court system for for what it's made for you know some cpas are saying look like some people are saying irs will not tax unsold staked cryptos income it's far far too much it's far too early to say that right now and so we can't say that but we what we are doing is establishing some precedent in court and can continue to to fight this um meanwhile in india what's happening india is proposing pretty aggressive taxes on just all crypto activity uh so 30 tax on crypto income in addition to i think like a one percent tax on like crypto transfers so i think what that means is like if i were to send you like uscc ryan and i send you a thousand dollars of usdc i got to pay if i was in india i would have to pay them ten dollars what yes like they're at the visa network or something yes exactly yeah so like everything about india is just going like hey that that crypto thing that you did tax like that other crypto thing that you did tax uh and so they're just trying to capture all the activity the native indian activity in crypto as much as possible do you see what it's paired with so this headline is paired with they propose a 30 tax on crypto meanwhile they announced the digital rupee launch yeah probably no taxes on the digital rupee not at all taxing freedom to try incentivize you into coercion this is something that uh you know remember when we had eric peters in the podcast and we asked him the question are you worried that like uh big governments will ban krypto he's like no i'm not they're not gonna ban krypto what they could do and what they probably will do is tax the hell out of it yeah they'll try to disincent you from using crypto using all of their traditional means and that's what we're seeing india do here india is doing it aggressively by the way that's kind of the news uh it's not just like oh india is taxing crypto like no they are taxing crypto yeah uh it kind of sucks as well i mean some people are saying it's good that there's some additional clarity but like the clarity to me to my mind is bad news now david and i aren't from india so there might be some listeners who have better information on this we'd be interested to hear from you what you think about this uh does not seem like great news seems like a little nation-state hostility towards crypto guys we're going to be right back with the takes of the week get to the meme of the week as well but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since i got into crypto i use gemiini to both buy the dips and also manage my regular automatic monthly purchases of my preferred crypto asset on gemini you'll find over 50 different cryptos including many of the top defy and metaverse tokens like wi-fi and axionfinity using gemini earn you can earn yield on your various cryptos including eight percent on the gusd stablecoin gemini is available in all 50 states and more than 50 countries worldwide so if you're looking to upgrade your crypto exchange sign up at gemiini with gemiini.com go bankless and get 15 of bitcoin after you trade 100 or more within the first 30 days that's gemini.com go bankless when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswapgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back with the takes of the week david why don't you start with this from chris dixon yeah i really really like this take chris dixon says if you think right click and save is a dunk you really don't understand nfts the more copying the more valuable and the reason why i like this take ryan is because the same is true for how blockchain networks need to be anti-fragile and resilient is blockchain networks need as many computers to download the chain as possible bitcoin ethereum these things survive by self-replication and what that means is can they self-replicate like evolution and put their dna on all the computers in the world and the more that they do that the better and so when someone says like oh i just right click saved your nft i tell them thank you for doing that make sure you print it out and frame it as well because i want my nft which is mine not yours to be pro like propagated all around the world and so the more that that's why you see like cool cats on uh the times square and board apes on times squares because we want these things to be right click save like we want to lean into the right click saving please right click save my nft please download it make it your phone background uh make it your profile picture please please do that it it it it makes a lot of sense right and this is not uh this is not foreign i mean we see it in kind of traditional art markets as well right it's like if the louvre was selling mona lisa uh posters in their gift shop does that decrease the value of the mona lisa no you're propagating the mona lisa you're making it more valuable by doing this you're making it a cultural icon and a staple so not not surprising that this is the case but it's a very basic criticism that really doesn't understand things why don't you do this uh this is sort of a follow-up related tweet from chris lewis of scott lewis yeah scott says for any for people active on social media a hundred thousand dollar nft profile picture will get so many more impressions per month than a wrist watch that cost a hundred thousand dollars of course more people choose to spend more on nfts than watches and scott says for me over a decade it might be point zero zero zero three dollars per impression for his super expensive nft versus three dollars per impression on your super nice awesome rolex so really it's just a matter of like what lets you flex more that super expensive watch or that crypto punk as your profile picture and how and what is the roi on the number of flexes that you can get per person versus your rolex where you can only wear your rolex in real life where on the metaverse you can flex your nft profile picture to everyone on on the internet and so the value per impression while these nfts are in these jpegs are super super expensive the dollar price of an impression is really really cheap and that's why nfts are so hot i feel like you're selling me on that five billion dollar board ape valuation i've been trying to get you to do a crypto punk for a while now ryan this is uh this is a really good take this is like i've never thought about it like this is what i would say i guess the other value is like a rolex uh can break can you know deteriorate you can lose your private keys though i guess have you ever lost any private keys before ryan um i have never no i've never lost my price i have never had a wallet error before i have also never done the thing where you send money to the wrong wallet except one time i have done that okay i've done that once and i did it to my own wallet though oh i also did that i also did that it was like i sent i sent money to an address and like that's not the address that i wanted to but i recognize that address where are the private keys for i double checked and i was like oh oh  it happened and i was like you did it my wallet yeah dude i was tearing apart my like my all the places that i had this was like a while ago and i was like where the god where the hell is this goddamn private key for this goddamn wallet and it took me like an hour and a half to find it and i finally did awesome well i mean knock on wood right uh it can't happen i guess that's your point yeah let's see this another minute it's all the takes are nft this must be nft week what's this nft take yeah this is from uh gabby diesen from uh yield guild gaming he goes nft blue chips are the l ones of ip interesting comparison i think he's saying stuff like crypto punks board apes uh whatever other nft projects you consider to be blue chips i'll throw in cool cats are the layer ones of ip kind of i think it's kind of a riff off of like the fat protocol thesis where like these nft blue chips are just like these blockchain native brands like board apes like crypto punks like like uh doodles i guess are now in a blue chip like cool cats these are these the like og like l ones but for ip internet native ip well i i think he's saying this is this is mickey mouse right i think he's saying this is uh marvel this is dc comics this is that kind of ip that people are going to build against into the future and it could turn into you know shows cultural icons movies cartoons action figures all sorts of things i guess that's partially what you're you're betting on too uh we've also seen that in the past here's another nft what's this uh okay so this is a facetious take so this a person's being sarcastic nfts are a scam i prefer to pay artists real money like point zero zero zero four seven eight cents to my favorite musician for my spotify listen or twenty dollars for a photography print on a website that gets seven hits a day or my favorite one instagram follow to a digital artist whose work i absolutely love so this is just like there's a lot of nft haters out there uh but then like we have to remind where we're coming from like the alternative is like oh i'll pay you in likes or i'll pay you in followers oh are you a really really cool artist here's 10 000 followers on your instagram good luck paying for dinner like uh and so you know this is this facetious take about how like you know actually nfts are a great way to monetize art um which uh there's a lot of people out in the world that are not ready to hear that take i don't think money directly to the creator that's where the money's going that's what people don't understand uh um this is well this is a dc investor who's nft periphery but uh great take you want to read this this is more about this is more about conviction i think uh i'll read it one of the partners at my old firm used to call me blockchain used to call it blockchain that's funny after 2017 bubble pop to remind me of my misplaced exuberance for the technology he got fired three years ago meanwhile i quit one year ago because i no longer needed to work because my exuberance was correct there's dc investor looking at history i guess maybe getting a a bit of uh schadenfreude yeah that's my german it's not great uh uh out of this what do you think did you get made fun of in 2017 like 2018 after the were people like why are you still in crypto david it's dead you led us wrong i don't think i really was made made fun of back then but i definitely had a harder time of convincing people to come into crypto no i didn't really get made fun of people don't want to listen to you when prices right are depressed like that the very time they should be buying they just think you're exactly click on uh click on eric connor's uh meme that he drew so here's a dc investor's profile picture out of drawn as a restaurant receiving a poured glass of champagne while somebody in in pain and some waiter and pain has support for him yeah i uh yeah i i look it it pays to invest with conviction at least when you write all right this is your take ryan what's your take here yeah my take is uh this is just you know not about joe rogan at all but it's about the protocol so people want to cancel spotify over joe rogan i saw a lot of this conversation but no one ever called for the cancellation of rss that's because one is a company and the other is a protocol when rogan switched to spotify from rss he gave someone else the ability to de-platform him i think that's an interesting take because look rss is a protocol it's a standard so we distribute the bankless podcast lots of podcasts podcasters do via rss and any third party a spotify apple itunes whatever podcast listener you listen to podcasts in can subscribe and can aggregate our feed or any other podcasters feed but they don't control rss why because it's a protocol it's a credibly neutral protocol so apple can't de-platform us from rss and when there's some controversy about a particular podcast like as they're as there has been lately with joe rogan over you know some of his um uh coved uh conversations and stances there um no one calls for the d platforming of him on rss because rss can't de-platform you it's credibly neutral it's a free speech protocol meanwhile if you're spotify you have governance you have a management team you have shareholders you absolutely can be de-platformed right and whether you agree with jo what joking rogan is doing or not is like it kind of completely besides that's not the point yeah it's not irrelevant it's just illustrating the difference between a protocol that is credibly neutral and a platform which has a set of decision makers that can de-platform you uh and uh relegate you to the sidelines for for whatever reason so i think that's a good thing because a lot of things inc it's a good thing to realize because a lot of things in crypto they talk about themselves as if they are censorship resistant credibly neutral protocols really are they all they are if they don't preserve those qualities they're just platforms they're kind of like companies rather than protocols yeah remember when dfinity uh i think took down some nft project because it violated ip copyright laws yeah well that's kind of the same thing and this this is why a lot of uh you know cypherpunk fans all chant the chant that uh code is speech rss the rss feed allows for free speech to happen say for example the united states uh nation state decided to get super authoritarian against crypto and demanded the deep platforming of every single crypto podcast bankless would still be able to get out its podcast via rss feed rss and that protocol is free speech spotify is not free speech that's permission speech and it goes down to exactly what ryan's saying down to our crypto protocols true decentralized permissionless protocols are equivalent to free speech others that aren't done that don't have that property are not yeah great illustration there uh david what are you excited about man oh man uh i'm excited about youth denver ryan yeah i got my ember shirt uh oh man i didn't even notice right yeah i think this year was that this is i think 2018 i think 2018 yeah uh actually this might be 2019. um but ryan did you know that there are 25 east denver and uh uh east denver 2018 poeps and i own one of them how many only 25 oh my god that is rare one yeah it looks very rare yeah and i also have the 20 20 uh 2019 one uh i did not get the 20 21 because that one didn't happen it was live stream uh but only 13 sleeps until eat denver uh 12 sleeps for you guys since the recording that's a day early and so that is one of the things i'm excited about ryan and then the other thing i'm kind of excited about also super excited about i haven't haven't totally committed to this yet but i'm more and more every single day my lease in san diego ends at the end of may and i'm real real thinking about moving to brooklyn ryan no way why yeah uh why don't you want to get on the east coast time zone huh yeah yeah this is all of a sudden we're gonna be synced up in our time zones that's gonna be weird um you're gonna have to get used to how early i wake up you wake up early yeah um just the amount of friends that i've meeting that live in new york city and brooklyn is just through the charts that's absolutely astronomical and there's a lot of cool things being built out there and i want to be there for it so i might eff around and move to brooklyn at the end of may there you go we'll see is is david coming to brooklyn should he come to brooklyn sure yeah what do you think leave a message in the comments on youtube if david should move to brooklyn oh david you can sleep on my couch i'm from brooklyn man all right all right ryan what are you excited about look this is going to sound super nerdy but i'm pretty excited about the dcf model discounted cash flow model that we just saw in the podcast we recorded but i'm excited for different reasons right it's like we we knew this model existed and um you know people have modeled this in the past the reason i'm excited is because i feel like part of the the purpose of bank list when we started this podcast and when we started the newsletter was to explain the value of d5 and the value of ether that's honestly why we started it all right we started it in the bear market because we were like look what's happening look at this thing called ethereum why aren't people paying attention to this why do people keep saying crypto is only bitcoin and also that it's dead that's all people were talking about and i feel like it's it's working okay so we had a bit a bankless lister brian alice who came up with this great discounted cash flow model how did he come up with it well after being inspired from listening to our ultrasound money episode with justin drake around last year at this time okay that seeded like the seed of the idea for him and he created a discount on cash flow on top of that now and he's saying you know 12k is conservative fair value now for uh the price of ether and then we we saw earlier in this episode a bankless listener on reddit who did a riff on ryan alice's discounted cash flow model uh more improvements for the for the model and this is how it kind of works its way up like an idea a good idea a narrative that sticks kind of goes through the forges the meme forges and works up goes to the crucible and it starts with shows like bankless but then other smart investors are like you know what you're right looking at the numbers yeah and there's something here i am bullish on ether yeah these guys aren't just like the other you know shills we see on youtube there's actual like numbers and fundamentals backing this stuff uh and then big name analysts start to step up and pretty pretty soon like the banks and like the you know the jp morgans of the world they're like oh we're running the numbers too and here's our price prediction for this asset and then you get to maintain acceptance wearing their ties then you get to mainstream acceptance for the stuffs on you know cnbc and that becomes part of the the narrative so the cool thing i think is that uh you know we've been part of this if you've been a bankless listener you've been part of this and this is an opportunity to participate in the story to front run everybody else and like i'm not saying this is the last chance there'll be tons of opportunities for this in crypto but this is probably the most obvious chance to do that okay like the merge for eth is happening in like six months and no one's running this discounted cash flow analysis no one's actually looking at supply and demand for this asset being like well if this comes true what is going to be the price of eth so you get to front run these opportunities and you get to say probably to your kids and grandkids you were here listening to bankless well eth price was below 3k that to me is exciting and um yeah it's i'm just like education is alpha we talked to kyla about that that's our podcast coming out on on monday um just keep educating yourselves keep keep being curious about this it's always going to be alpha and uh you know we're glad you're here and the other thing i would say is like what's nice about this is we're not shilling eth we're just saying like we're just showing run the numbers we're just showing the numbers we haven't received come and see go check it out the the the numbers and the metrics and the ability to evaluate these things is uh unprecedented in the world of ethereum and specifically with ether that's why ether is so cool is that the amount of supporting numbers that you can generate to back up the things that we are saying is more than stronger than any asset in history and so the ultimately the level of confidence that ether the asset will be able to instill once people get over the hump of like oh crypto's a scam uh is is going to be uh massive um so you're right ryan i'm also excited about that you know somebody could start a podcast a once a week podcast on just ether the asset so that isn't ours no no it's not it's we don't do that enough somebody could like go really do a deep the deepest dive into ether the asset what happened in last week you should buy the metrics as well the metrics like the updates uh the the global perceptions around it a once a week podcast that dust just dives into the metrics and numbers behind ether is uh ripe for the taking i would be a frequent consumer of that podcast well message to another bankless listener who feels inspired to do that we're going to stop talking about ether now um can't help that no we're not let's talk about nfts let's talk about the meme of the week what are we looking at meme of the week david meme of the week it's a bunch of lines a bunch of lines all going down into the right a bunch of different colored lines they're alluding to a price prices of your nfts and your nfts are the ones that always go down except there's that one line that goes up into the right and that's the nfd that you didn't meet sorry man it's bittersweet huh i guess you know turtles are are the ones on the downward side the one i did is up there yeah the green one is the board apes that's right i did not meant to board ape guys uh thanks for hanging with us again of course none of this has been financial advice we have no idea which nfts or crypto assets are going to pump next and we won't pretend that we do uh eath is risky so it's defy so is all of this crypto stuff you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey
