[Music] thank you we are at the axillar interoperability series I'm not going to fit from squid fit from squid I had no idea what squid was but when I came to the axillar event I talked to the the co-founders of axelar and other people in this space who should I talk to and so they said you should talk to Fig from squid so here we are about to go talk to Fig from squid right after talking it's one of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you're a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of defy where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrone the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the eth layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrum is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview alright Bank location I'm here with fig the co-founder of squid just kidding I'm not that short but he's unequivocally a member of tall Dao uh fig how's it going my man yeah good man nice to be here so I came into this axelr interop Summit learning about this interoperability world and I that's uh one of the guys who should I talk to and they said squid and I asked somebody else they should also said squid so here we are talking to the guys at squid so fig what is squid so squid is a cross chain swap protocol which allows you to swap any token from one chain to another but it's built on xlr's General message passing so what it means is you can call a contract on any chain but you can also swap into a currency on any chain so you can think about it we allow you to sort from any token to any token but you can also buy an nft with any token you can stake with any token you can really do anything across chain and it's all done via axillary which is a really secure decentralized uh cross stream protocol and yeah so squid is an application on top of axillar exactly yeah so you can think of axler as the execution layer and Squid builds the payloads okay so we have a set of smart contracts which are on every chain and we have a back end which calls every chain um calls all the taxes on every chain generates a route and then we send it back to the user we have an SDK so devs can add it to the application or to a front end where the the route is translated into a single payload which you sign with metamask once and then it gets executed across Chain by axler so I've heard similar pitches like this before especially back in like 2017 the big whole like interoperability was a big big meme uh not to say it is it doesn't mean fundamentally but like I've heard the pitch of just like any chain any asset what's the what's the big difference about squid that's different from all the other previous interoperability Solutions that's out there yeah for sure so the atomic swaps have been a a narrative for a long time um the real difference is that squid is modular so really what we're doing is we're composing existing liquidity across trains we don't have any of our own liquidity we just we plug into uni stop we plug into Quick Swap and polygon whatever the best uh swap is anywhere we can route liquidity through it um so there's the there's that sort of modularity and what it also allows users to do what devs to do is you can plug it into your application so until swap you can swap from USC on polygon to usdc on Avalanche but you might not be able to buy the nft also in the same click so I think this has been this switch where we're not just swapping anymore we're starting to what we have on ethereum in the early days of like you know these default Lego idea any any app can be plugged into any other app permissionlessly now we have this cross chain so the ecosystem can scale whether it's cross roller cross chain between L1 and roll up you can compose an application with another application no matter yeah where it is okay so the the mental model I've had is um there's a couple applications in the ethereum ecosystem uh one is uh Bungie bungie.exchange if you're familiar with it that's powered by socket the other one is li-fi and these are really cross-chain aggregator decks aggregators right and so it Aggregates the liquidity on across the layer two across all the chains but I'm getting the sense that squid is that for the broader ecosystem but also more logic than just simple erc20 tokens you also get to do application logic passing through application logic am I on the right track here yeah I think you're in the right track so life and soccer uh also Bridge aggregators so they use different infrastructure providers under under the hood we only use zaxler and the ability so the benefit that gives us is because cross chain is already so complex we can compress all of the hard stuff into one package and give you a really reliable execution and then we can also you know buy nfts across chains so I just did a workshop where I showed uh users how to buy an nft across chain it's basically the same experience as building on a single chain and because we're always using axillary we get very reliable execution the user always experience this is the same thing and also we can add access specific um features so actually has deposit addresses which is this idea where you're withdrawing from a centralized exchange and you can't sign a transaction all you can do is withdraw to an address that's so in order to do something more complicated like do a cross chain swap or buy an empty on another chain which the The Exchange might not support say you're in finance and you want to buy an out of town Cosmos and the and binance can't withdraw to that that Cosmos chain we can create an address by axillar which you can withdraw onto eighth on L1 or whatever cheap the cheapest chain is like Avalanche and then it automatically triggers a cross chain swap goes across buys the nft sends it to the user's wallet and these are very actual specific features which you know we we get because we're only built on axle okay beautiful I I'm starting to see it and really I think the the theme the meta that I've started to identify here at this interop Summit is that there's definitely going to be more chains uh and this is a Content team that we've had recently on Bank list when we talked to Jesse in the optimism team about the super chain a lot of chains are happening even though people are definitely getting chain fatigue and so it sounds like axillar and also squid are doing a lot of abstraction work not obfuscation work so the idea really isn't that axelrs brand new chain and we're all going to migrate to axillar that's not its purpose and that's not what squid is trying to do either it's really actually trying to reduce complexity more than ad complexities yeah exactly yeah Axel has done really well uh just being a messaging layer and making security layer messaging layer to start with keeping getting the basics down and now they just launched this V2 which you might have already talked about so you can you can uh you can connect any Bridge protocol whether it's a ZK Bridge or light Clan fully trustless protocols into axler so what it means is that you know if a new chain pops up it has its own Bridge protocol which is fully trustless and built into the consensus actually I can adopt that as well so yeah we're really happy to be building on them because we feel like we'll get the most exposure and probably the best security so cool yeah what's the uh Exemplar use case that you like to use an example to get people's minds wrapped around is there one that you have in your pocket to share yeah sure I mean Cosmos is a great example that's where you know a lot of people might have used Cosmos or Axel already they get to the cosmos osmosis is a massive attacks in in the customers that we're working with as well so you send a message to uh on the ethereum chain and then axla has a set of 70 permissionless validators they all um check that the message has actually been submitted on the source chain so that's polygon and then because axler so they because axler is connected to IVC it's a cosmos chain natively as well you get ABC out of the box and we send uh a transfer to osmosis via ABC so you've got actually two interoperability protocols being used you've got axles native validators checking the chain and then you have ABC on the other end and that's just going to extend so you have Zeke and ZK connecting to IBC you have different formats of light client proofs other than ABC you have yeah anything um under the hood but from the user's perspective if you're using squid or even XLR with the access SDK it will automatically use the right one um so you never have to think about it yeah yeah the idea is that the user never has to think about the infrastructure the chain they're on they're just they want to use an application and they have money in their wallet they want to use it like make it simple yeah I think it's crypto people we do have to admit that the chaininess that we love and touching the chains is really just for us nerds and most people don't really want to be faced with any of that yeah I mean I love it I I do get frustrated though even deploying our contracts on every chain it was impossible to get gas I had to I actually had to use binance to like to get cast to the place yeah you have to go be banked yeah yeah exactly and so yeah I mean that's one amazing feature I feel like what we do we've added this so um when you on board into a new chain so you buy an nft on a new chain you've never been there before you can do that in one click but you'll have an nft and then you won't have any gas there so you can't use it sure and so we have gasless transactions coming we have account abstraction but squid currently supports the ability to also send a small amount of your Bridge tokens and swap them into gas with it so you need any crosstain transaction onto a new chain and get some gas so you can keep using it it's just like more of these things that you don't want the users to ever have to think about yeah well I think I think the use cases and need for this is obvious so thank you for helping build out this world of all this cross training virtual sure that we're definitely going to need yeah thanks so much for having me cheers if listeners are peaked and interested where should they go to fall down this Rabbit Hole yeah we'll follow us on Twitter um squid router outside handle squidrel.com is our website check out our docs um yeah reach out to me I'm ecdsafu on uh on Twitter and happy to happy to help you out the mascot of squid definitely makes sense like tentacles going everywhere right that's kind of the vibe yeah yeah everything around and we got one thing controlling everything yeah well awesome thank you so much Cheers Cheers thanks for having me
