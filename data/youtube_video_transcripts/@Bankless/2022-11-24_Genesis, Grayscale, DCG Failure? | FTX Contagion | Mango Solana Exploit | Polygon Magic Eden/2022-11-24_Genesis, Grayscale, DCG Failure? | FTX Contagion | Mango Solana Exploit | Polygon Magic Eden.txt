is Genesis going to take the entire crypto industry down Bangla station happy third not Friday Thursday of November Happy Thanksgiving to you if you are in the US and enjoying the holiday David what time is it oh Ryan it's the Thursday Bank list weekly roll up where we cover the entire well not the entire week uh four days in crypto uh which is uh still an ambitious Endeavor even though we're missing a day yeah so we persevere into the frontier nonetheless with coffee among other things great modifications David people are really going to appreciate that um to do that on the seat of my pants maybe maybe turkey too I don't know look if you think anyone's actually listened to this on Thanksgiving uh maybe they're on their way they are yeah to a Thanksgiving like uh meal with their with their family and they're wondering what the heck they're going to say when their friends and family ask them about crypto that Sam bankman free that complex controversial Sam bakeman freed character yeah so how's it how's it going in crypto these days we know you love it we know you're into it what's happening I bet that's going to be a question uh we're going to prepare you for that question too we're going to I'm going to ask Ryan how he's going to prepare for that question and I'm sure he's going to ask me the same David what are your Thanksgiving plans you going somewhere I know you are but tell me more after after you record this roll up uh go take a long cab to Newark fly home uh good to see my one and a half year old nephew see how much he's uh he's turned into a chatterbox apparently I keep on joking with my family I'm going to turn him into a podcaster do you know what's awesome though is like um being able to spend some time with normal people uh for a while it's rare it's rare for me let me tell you I know I know I know you moved to New York to hang out with like crypto friends and such um and like I hang out with I guess virtually a lot of crypto people as well it's just like crypto talk blah blah blah blah blah right just to talk about regular things for a while especially after the the month that was November so far that's actually gonna feel pretty refreshing to me anyway what do we got this week coming up oh my God so we of course have to talk about the Genesis contagion is Genesis going to take the entire crypto industry down we'll talk about that FTX of course there's still plenty to talk about FTX there this news has of course gone on to Capitol Hill where there is a bankruptcy hearing going on uh and third a DEX hack on Solona leads to an exporter shorting curve using Ave and then that exporter getting liquidated because of a short squeeze leaving bad debt and off a what the hell are we going to do about that we'll get into that story and more but first please like And subscribe because Ron and I like we always say at the beginning of the show persevere into the frontier nonetheless and sometimes it really just helps to get those likes and reviews and those subscriptions uh so if you are watching on YouTube please subscribe if you are listening to the podcast please give us a five star review so we can get to the top of the charts and make it through this bear Market absolutely we're thankful for you a bankless nation for tuning in uh we have a lot in store in 2023 we're not going anywhere in fact fact we are doubling down tripling down on content in fact there will be a few ways to get involved with that some Alpha that will drop in the episode today uh some deals coming up coming out of bank list too but before we get there David gotta talk about our friends and sponsors over at infuria in Fiora of course they run archival nodes for um for ethereum among other smart contract networks if you've ever used something like metamask for example they are an RPC client so that means they provide some of the historical data node architecture that serves up your metamask transactions and the cool things that you're doing in D5 you probably maybe you know about inferior maybe you don't what you might not know is they are taking steps moving forward to decentralize their infrastructure okay previously this has been quite centralized in including a centralization vector but if we're going to rebuild on the other side of this bear market and during the bear Market we need to rebuild it on D decentralized rails so how can folks get involved in what infuria is doing and how should they tap in David oh I think they should just go ahead and click the link in the show notes Ryan where you can join the Early Access program for inferior's new decentralized infrastructure Network so how do we take the service and products that inferior has and makes that may and turn them into a network a protocol A permissionless system that anyone can join that is the frontier that inferior is taking on and if you want to join in that journey into the frontier man I'm really milking this metaphor today you can click the link in the show notes to sign up and uh get your your expertise and your information oh for two and for your so they can coordinate all right David speaking of coordination I guess price markets what is that it's just a coordination game so let's get to the markets all right talk about Bitcoin and the price and I was told by the way our editors might throw in some music here and uh it's gonna be sad music if if we mentioned that it's gonna be sad music this week because what David are we up are we down we are down we are down well actually I would say Bitcoin is in inside of the flat range down 1.3 percent uh so started at 16 500 ending at 16 300. like that's just like you're just kind of flat-ish at that some green candles toward the end of this some recovery candles at the very end to make it not so bad I mean we're still we're still like at the the whole like yeah look at this look at November November is still a bad month yeah this is uh the FDX drop right thank you very much for that one I appreciate you uh okay how about you up or down uh down actually down start of the week at 1210 currently at eleven hundred fifty dollars down about four point eight percent so oof okay so um so above still above uh in a four digit mode actually um in fact like fairly fairly well so you haven't bought yet then huh um I am planning some buys um so but I'm tempted just a little bit okay but like I'm still also waiting for triple digit I think triple digits coming David I could be wrong but I mean you said last time you said it I was like get the hell out of here and and and then you turned out to be right and this time I'm like get the hell out of here I think we're done with triple digits you think we're done with triple digits if it wasn't just if it didn't happen just now like yesterday with a dcg news uh then I don't know how's the thing you're talking local crypto though all right we still got macro ahead we haven't talked about macro and I think we've got some Tailwinds on the macro front they could send us down also we're still getting attention I mean even though bad things are happening we've got eyeballs on the space anytime you get eyeballs on the space you get some price action sometimes it's negative sometimes it's positive but the worst possible time for markets is the doldrum period no one cares no one cares so you could be waiting for triple digits and like you know a cute three or two four not a spike down triple digits his apathy my friend yeah and um yeah look uh I think apathy liquidation candle yeah yeah but uh call us all right the David versus Ryan bet it's on we headed to Triple digits or not how long can David last we will see to be continues David David makes another bottom call great fantastic the contraindicator add another one to the closet we'll see you might be right on this one though but uh if I keep on calling them eventually I'll be right I for one am thankful for David bottom calls because um you know they give us some historical perspective here what's this one each Bitcoin ratio anybody you want to call here yeah ignoring that uh 3.5 down on the week to .0706 yeah so yeah down okay total crypto market cap give us the numbers we lost 10 billion dollars we were down to 850 billion in total crypto market cap all right still well decently below a trillion um all right you know what let's let's zoom out for a minute because there are some other people that are like my friend David here and they're calling the bottom right now there are other bottom collars and by the way I am calling a bottom-ish see David I'd like to head I like to be in all campsite you're saying you're saying we're close to the bottom I'm saying I please also call me a bottom collar but approximate bottom caller I'm not going to put a number on it I still think it's triple digits but like we're in the zone my friends plus or minus 10 or so that's what I think and this is one of my favorite charts to look at it's sad but it's the chart that I was like it's not a chart it's a percentage it's a metric that I was glued to uh in like 2018 2019 previous bear cycles and this is percentage down from all-time high I really like this as a metric during the bear Market um it's a painful metric but you can also see like the the precedent that we've set before so just some context I remember these numbers are burned into my brain Bitcoin last uh bear Market down from all-time high about 83 something around this range ethereum down 94 uh into 95 I think you got like if you round it it's like 95 I thought we were stopping last cycle at 90 and I'm like there's no way we're going to 95 and we did okay and also to drive that point home the difference between going down 90 and 95 is another 50 drop it is not five more percent it is 50 more percent and boy that last 50 hits it really hurts that one that one is the knife of the heart man all right so let's let's look at where we are right now in like the percentage down from all-time high is a proxy for pain to me yes like how much pain are we in duration is another one because that brings the apathy but like raw pain that you're feeling in the pit of your stomach right now Bitcoin is 76 down from all-time high compare that to 83 percent Last Time bottom ethereum down 76 percent as well yeah that's unprecedented crazy yeah crazy that these two assets are down because Bitcoin was supposed to be the the king asset right uh when there's a a bear Market there's a flight to safety there's a flight to stable coins a flight to bitcoin and we're seeing ethereum hold up the same and that is after Ryan uh the FTX exploiter hacker sells a bunch of ether for Bitcoin which you know is a one-time sell event and not systemic so so like not a ton of pain in these two ecosystems to be honest compared to what we've seen certainly in theory only 76 like whatever that's just a flesh wound my friend right uh well why is tether down 20 for me uh BNB look how uh the CZ Empire is holding up 57 down from all-time high and this is because of the buy back and burn mechanism in BNB which I will remind listeners is the same similar mechanism as eip1559 in ethereum it's also because the CC Empire has uh held very steady yes uh during this so far yeah and and he's just knocked out a few competitors but uh other decentralized networks um let's talk about uh cardano for instance 90 off 90 all right last time they went to like 98 99 from all-time high right uh Dogecoin 90 polygon 71 Layer Two token wow that beat both Bitcoin and ethereum didn't it yeah polka dot 90 this is also the Proving Ground of like right how many holders do you have you see this in the numbers like people don't have faith in polka dot right now uh in comparison to uh to polygon Litecoin 81 God only knows what that means who's holding Litecoin I don't know Solana David look at this 95 and this is what I've been saying like the Solana Community from what I've seen on Twitter is still around and they are still pretty bullish on their ecosystem I am not necessarily like interested in Solana the technology but I am impressed that the community around Solana is still holding out and they are down as bad as we were Ryan back in 2018. uh and so that interests me that is interesting if if a community can survive this that is an interesting thing like the cardano community survived this and regardless we think of the network the community survived and that led to a more bullish uh return maybe the last one um already doubt is Avalanche that's uh down 91 from all-time high but Adams on the other hand I don't know where the Avalanche Community is I haven't heard a peep out of any avax person in my Twitter mentions in a while it's been real quiet like their equivalent Ico you know they're they're having kind of their Ico um you know all the unlocked coins get you know all the locked coins get unlocked anyway I love the three hours Capital uh locked Apex tokens yes so that's where we are all right um who's calling the bottom though bottom caller number one who's this David Kathy Wood goes on coinbase and gbtc buying spree I'm not sure if you're calling the bottom but with that but it's just implied uh Kathy Wood of Arc invest she buys well Arc excuse me buys 1.3 million shares of coin coming in at 56 million dollars and she also bought 315 000 shares of gbtc basically the grayscale Bitcoin trust at 2.5 million dollars uh so Kathy Wood going to the market there you go not afraid to call the bottom um Kathy's also not afraid to to buy the top as well Kathy's that's a buyer and that's why we like her there you go dollar cost averaging who's this here's uh Kobe Kobe is calling the bottom in fantastic Kobe fashion Kobe tweets out the way I see it it's up to us now probs can't sit around on the benches anymore to the arena uh this is for those that don't speak Kobe this is Kobe calling the bottom you think he's called the bottom this is called yeah I can't I can't sit in the benches anymore to the arena you have to read a lot into that to be like that's a bottom call but that's what you're reading yeah yeah that's all right um so that's happening and of course we talked about Chris bruninski last time he's been calling the bottom that we put out a podcast on that um last week uh well let's talk about another thing that's happening in the markets and this is the journey towards people going bankless what uh uh we are looking at Ryan people going bankless uh so this is a chart of the amount of assets uh AUM of all centralized exchanges uh and so right at right before the FTX demise we were coming in at basically 130 billion dollars of money inside exchanges uh then the FTX happens and we are now clocking in at just above a hundred billion dollars so we almost have 30 billion dollars of people taking well we also lost some Capital so there's that but but also people have taken a lot of that money off of exchanges into self-custing if it's not on centralized exchange it's in self-custody uh so we are watching people in real time take custody over their assets cool we like it is that okay David I mean they're doing it out of fear rather than love they're going back that's fine it doesn't it doesn't matter that's fine we'll take them fear or love either whatever the motivation is we'll take it this is some interesting motivation some uh metrics coming out of polygon on unit swap as well what are we looking at yeah polygon uh the uniswap implementation on polygon hit its all-time high in volume numbers with 10 days to go in November so this is monthly volume and November has already beaten all previous months in terms of all-time high and we still have and at the time that this was tweeted we still had 10 days ago so polygon unit swap on polygon putting in some some massive numbers I think that's uh wow is that oh yeah 3.3 billion dollars so far in the first 20 days of November so yeah congrats to the uniswap implementation on polygon yeah never congratulated a specific implementation of the protocol before but here we go congrats on the version update to iOS software to Apple yeah fantastic uh well it's cool I mean uniswap on main chain hit all-time highs too I mean we uh not all-time highs excuse me but um we're just crushing it in terms of volume last week we were talking about that this is though I think this is my favorite chart right now in all of crypto it's the only chart that makes me uh bullish I guess um what are we looking at here this is a chart from token terminal and it is I think something that I hope has been impressed upon regular Bank list listeners hence a concept that we've been talking about from the very beginning but why don't you explain the chart then we can talk about the significance here okay so on this chart we see two things we see the purple line which is the East price chart I'm sure no one really needed that because we all know what the chart looks like probably the green area which largely corresponds with the actual price chart when there's Pikes spikes in the price chart there's definitely spikes in the green area the green area uh and there's two different axes here you have of course the eth price uh or the youth market cap and then you also have revenue and that is what the green thing is the green thing is profit I believe actually it's earnings oh it's earning excuse me okay so net net revenue right net earnings yes and how do we calculate so the way we calculate earnings is we take um Revenue uh minus costs fees transaction fees yes minus block reward issuance so how much people spend on a transaction aggregated into a block minus how much that block how much ether that block issues yes and so as we've said I hope this is nailed into people's heads what do blockchains sell David what are they say space they spell block space Ryan that's the only thing that they have the only thing that they sell is blocks block space all right so blocks blockchain cell blocks blockchain cell blocks this is the the profit on the sale of blocks for ethereum you're seeing that in green and by the way this is a all-time history chart yeah it's all the way back and so what are we seeing in the green David from the early days up until now up until now when the price of ether goes up the loss of ethereum the the negative earnings goes up and this is the fundamental like problem with proof of work is that as ether goes up the size of the block reward goes up right so ether started at like ten dollars and then in 2017 it got up to fourteen hundred dollars so the revenue that was coming the issuance coming out of ethereum for every single block did a 14x right that was just sold that wasn't captured that was just Soul that's loss because that is what uh people the ethereum is not collecting enough uh transaction fee Revenue to offset the amount of ethos that they are issuing basically selling its product at a loss right the higher the price and it's worse in bull market yes exactly yes and so the higher transaction fees under a proof of work Paradigm and the higher uh the higher the price of ether the bit more the loss ethereum has because the US dollar amount is sold if you're controlled for ether this would be a different story uh but this is what we're looking at in dollars at the very end of this chart if you zoom all the way into the very end where there's the merge you can see that all of the loss goes away and there's little bits of profit little bits of profit you can see you can see the small little spikes of The Upside uh but of course if we went to Ultrasound Dot money you would see how much we have been able to recapture uh the combination of the fp1559 and proof of sake okay anyways the point is that ethereum is now profitable profitable in the green for the first time ever in all of crypto in the entire industry the first profitable blockchain that happened with the merge and now we are seeing some data it's happening in a bear Market when people aren't looking do you know what this reminds me of a little bit is um do you know uh Amazon during the the.com bust um people like it's over dot coms are over Amazon goes down 95 percent okay during that time it was absolutely crushing it right in in terms of market in terms of the core metrics for people who are looking but no one noticed why because websites were dead like dot coms were dead Amazon was never coming back these are the sorts of Silent metrics we should be looking at here and only people who are in the space and who haven't left only the settlers not the tourists are paying attention because the uh this is by the way the first blockchain in history to ever go profitable and it's not happening during a bull run when it's easy during when it's easy it's happening during the bear run and uh and I think David you have some extrapolate extrapolation on these numbers because uh yeah and you somehow slipped this in I put it in my research hat and my data analysis hat and I made an extrapolation for the next full run uh and I put that into this chart here explain to me how you uh extrapolated the profit in the next uh Bull Run uh so what I did is you actually might notice that the shape of the green Revenue chart on the right is the same shape as the green loss Revenue in the 2017 and I flipped it and I made it way bigger and that is my projection and David is roughly projecting that all of this loss turns to uh to profit on the other side during the during the bull market and um we all know who are the recipients of of that profit um who gets that the upside of this that's a good question uh is it ether holders I think it might be David I think I think it might be anyway look that's happening in the background it's a chart that makes both David and myself uh optimistic stupid foolish again God imagine Ryan if like that if it was going in the opposite direction if it was negative and all this bad news would be like sweet there's like literally nothing that's cool about crypto right now guys I just want to say this is not the story for for all chains this is this is the other thing right it's like you have to decide if you're going to hold through the spare Mark you have to decide what assets you're going to hold what you have conviction on coming out of this uh for this story the one that's generating Revenue you can't see this story in other chains you won't see this nothing against other communities and such but except for BNB except for BNB because that's what train B and B chain that has this similar mechanism it's it's uh manual which is fine sure um in bottom line what does this mean is the block space that we're selling the product that we're selling uh is profitable now and it hasn't previously been until now um I think we've beaten that dead horse here's something cool though all right so this is Thursday when this episode is released but on Friday bankless is doing a Black Friday deal okay and so we have this thing if you've never uh gotten into kind of the the newsletter side of things or the the membership uh side of things we have this thing we call a bankless premium membership all sorts of great perks the newsletter you get the premium podcast feed I get all sorts of questions yes and you get um uh you also get uh our airdrop reports you get all kind of our token ratings reports all sorts of things and this is actually um because it's been such a crazy bad month and because it's Black Friday this is the most discounted we've ever offered a bankless subscription I'm looking at a draft email here but it's set to go out tomorrow morning Friday morning so

self-sovereign hub for cooler and neater things uh and so uh bankless during the last bear Market went from zero to one as in we didn't exist and then we existed and now we're going from one to ten it feels like and this wait you said this was 2.0 but it's a 10x Improvement it's all it's always yeah is about a one order of magnitude of growth and this is part of that story Bank list is going to

of the show um we really want you guys in into this um I think it'd be cool to kind of grow grow uh the nation this way all right we got some stuff coming up next David what are we going to talk about uh is Genesis gonna take down the industry Ryan that is what everyone is worried about uh the FTX story continues all the way to Capitol Hill uh and like I said Ave is left with bad debt after someone tries to short curve and then curve Sucker Punch that curve shorter by releasing a new stable coin product yeah anyways we're gonna tell the stories and more right after we talked to some of these

mind going into this Thanksgiving will Genesis fail the berry silbert Empire grayscale Genesis is this the next point of contagion David we've got some things that are developing this week can you tell us the story of dcg group Genesis grayscale and what we need to know at this point in time all the way back in June of 2021 right almost a year and a half ago Barry silbert who's the the head guy at digital currency group who's a very informed been been in OG been around since like 2012 2013. he tweets out and if you remember June is right after that big big liquidation candle from like ether's all like all-time high at the time from 4 300 down to like Seventeen hundred dollars remember that but yes right it was it was the first big drawdown after the bull market started and Barry silbert says he tweets out right after that happened there's a daisy chain of borrowers and lenders in the crypto space most well capitalized but some are not loss of Leverage still in the system including some non-obvious places important to understand counterparty risk and where the week links are in the chain wow does that tweet hit different now as it turns out uh it would take a year for all of that daisy chain of liquidation events to show up uh and Ryan that is the video that you and I made yesterday uh so it was a hour and doing the whole like conspiracy thing starting with going all the way back to 2020 when the gbtc trade was on and how three hours Capital leveled up on that and then they went long on bitcoin and ether and then they went long on soluna avax and then they got liquidated and that got liquidated riveting tail it's it's pretty crazy honestly that people are gonna anyways Genesis is the final final piece of that puzzle and we're calling the bot we're calling the final dominant we're calling the final Domino and that's that is uh why this everyone is like so worried about Genesis is because it is the foundation of everything what is Genesis it is probably the biggest lending desk in all of crypto it is the only Prime brokerage for all of crypto uh facilitated so much of the basal levels of yield across the space the Gemini earned program Etc uh and so the fact that we are have arrived here at Genesis is indicative of like this is the last Domino this is properly named arrived right right I've been thinking about that if someone is something biblical Genesis okay so just for people who don't know what a prime brokerage is just think of it as like a regular brokerage except for big institutions what I mean by regular brokerage maybe you've dabbled in stocks and this sort of thing so maybe you have an e-trade account or a Fidelity account or Charles Schwab account it's like that only for Mega institutions and in genesis's case a mega institution would be like a large hedge fund like a theorist Capital uh for instance and it also has some Advanced features that they don't generally provide the retail but you know some some brokerage accounts do like the ability to go margin long on some sort of collateral so I've got this stock here I've got this crypto asset here and it's worth a hundred thousand dollars right can I borrow against that and go do something with that that leverage with that bar and of course the institution The Brokerage can liquidate them all sorts of things anyway that's all all it is is actually pretty simple it's just not something that regular Average Joe people in crypto can access it was the big institutional Billboards yeah yeah anyways uh people start to get worried about uh Genesis just because how related they are to every other lending desk in the space and also on November 9th they tweet out uh we took a seven million dollar haircut when we liquidated a bunch of collateral uh involving some of the contagion involving Alameda only seven million dollars tiny not that bad not that big of a deal they're just saying hey we took a haircut oh but the next day they announced that they actually had a 175 million dollars in locked funds on the FTX trading account but then they said this does not impact our Market making activities uh six days later Genesis halts withdrawals in the wake of the FTX collapse not going in a good direction that's bad that's a bad trajectory uh and then of course anyone that's plugged into uh to Genesis like Gemini earn also can no longer facilitate withdrawal so Gemini turn has to stop facilitating withdrawals well that does have retail exposure right there right and now people this is Max fear crypto Twitter was in a state of Max fear all of this week to the point where grayscale which is part of digital currency group part of the same subsidiary that Genesis is although these are separate entities and of themselves graysale felt compelled to tweet out in the wake of recent events our investors should know that the Safety and Security of the Holdings underlying grayscale digital asset products are unaffected saying hey we still have all the assets under the balance sheet just because Grace Genesis is is like has a hole in their wall doesn't mean that like our assets are affected these are unrelated and then on November 20th it leaks that there was an undisclosed loan from Genesis to digital currency group again nothing to do with grayscale and I'll just plant this lag grayscale's totally fine there is no further news greyscale is totally fine this is just between Genesis and the larger uh digital currency group the thing that owns Genesis there was an undisclosed loan from Genesis to digital currency group and that perked a bunch of people's ears like all right like well these are owned by the same umbrella why are they like loaning each other money anyways and given recent events people are probably hearkening back to FTX and Alameda exactly exactly yes uh anyways that was a very fast timeline it was just a recap uh November 8th uh no material net credit exposure November 9th we lost that a million dollars okay November 10th we lost 175 million dollars November 16th sorry no with new withdrawals we don't have any money for you uh November 17th okay we need one billion dollars November 21st which was two days ago okay we'll go bankrupt without the money so we need to fundraise a billion dollars uh and so then Frank chaparro out of the block uh he disclosed that he reveals that sources uh tell the block that uh Genesis has been struggling to raise emergency emergency Capital they wanted to raise a billion dollars but they are lowering that to 500 million dollars because it faces potential bankruptcy without funding oof not looking good everyone's PTSD from the week prior is getting triggered um Barry silbert the owner of currency group the guy that like owns everything the guy that tweeted out the daisy chain of uh borrowers and lenders basically the uh the same bank sorry I shouldn't say the same because that has negative connotations Barry silbert is not saying begman freed from a kind of scammer perspective but he's just the leader he's the leader The Godfather the major owner behind digital currency Group which is Genesis and grayscale and Associated companies right yes Barry writes and sends out a letter to All Digital currency group investors to clear up some of the details uh and someone uh this Twitter account Chad Phi whale put in a nice summary thread which we will go ahead and read here starting with a tweet number one Barry States that dcg had has three loans a 350 million dollar revolver a line of credit to a 1.1 billion dollar loan from Genesis which is due on June of uh 23. uh I think it's a 10-year okay that's probably a 10-year that's probably right and also another 575 million dollar loan due May of 23. that's the 23 loan I thought so what does this mean a revolver is a short-term credit facility that a company generally pays an upfront fee to have to help with cash flow issues it usually has a high interest rate and restrictive covenants that need to be maintained generally revolvers are used as stop gaps for working capital or as a time uh in or as a last resort in times of stress this is not a great sign that dcg has this revolver but then again that's why it is there the second loan 1.1 billion dollars due in June of 2032 this is where it gets very sketchy basically win three arrows Capital went under Genesis had a large hole in its balance sheet I think uh like if you're as capital blue something like a 200 to 400 million dollar hole of this year June of this year yeah they were insolvent and an order of Genesis wasn't solvent and in order to solve this they did this a little bit of magic accounting while also putting dcg the parent company at risk so dcg took on the liability of Genesis the whole in Genesis bounce balance sheet but they didn't have the cash to give Genesis for its hole in the balance sheet so they took out a 1.1 billion dollar 10-year loan from Genesis and then they gave the money back to Genesis to fill the Gap but up at a whole whole totally plugged right totally it's totally crazy how many people were just swimming with no pants back in June and we didn't know and it was we did because of the doke one blow up and three areas Capital blow up and these were one of them it was kind of tenuous at that time for PCG so the 1.1 billion dollar came from The Lending book Gemini earn and other retail yield products that use Genesis oof so retail is paying for this essentially Genesis borrowed from their own deposits to filled a whole but used digital currency group as the go between make it legal also there's another 100 and 575 million dollar loan to do in May of 23 so uh you know that's not that far away um so this explains why investors are bulking with dcg this is clearly not fully above board what next Genesis has a liquidity shortfall of 1.675 billion right now to the depositors of the lending book it needs to file for bankruptcy I suspect that they will they were trying to get someone to buy out dcg's 10-year bond at some discount to give liquidity to depositors but no takers dcg grayscale business uh the grayscale business from dcg is extremely valuable so here's what they did Genesis was insolvent dcg bailed it out and so the equity holders of dcg are now at stake the other thing that is in dcg is grayscale and so since the it was basically the equity of great of dcg that plugged the Genesis hole but the equity of dcg is involved with grayscale grayscale is minting money by the I think you're printing money I think you have a chart early like later on that's like what grayscale and by the way the grayscale products are what eth um e that you can buy in trading accounts of trust and gbtc's this is where you can kind of buy you know proxy trust type ETF uh products not ETS but those types of products inside of your retirement account how much was that minting David like hundreds of millions of dollars okay and that's just like this year I think there's a chart we have about that later so that's a totally healthy very profitable business completely solvent right the problem is that's bundled up with this whole Genesis thing I guess the problem for dcg is and so they're using some of that funding to try to bail out dcg right yes right so the equity the value of grayscale the company is is backstopping the value of dcg the equity and dcg's Equity is basically what's plugging the hole in Genesis yikes yes okay contagion contagion yeah uh and so uh to resume dcg's grayscale company extremely valuable uh dcg does not want to fire sale this so they will likely let Genesis go under dcg and dcg probably should have no problem raising 575 Million by May of 2023 to pay back that loan the question is whether they spin off grayscale and sell some Equity at a depressed valuation or they fire sell Parry crypto tokens and raise Equity or long-term debt at the dcg entity it looks like to me that dcg will not file for bankruptcy grayscale is easily worth over a billion dollars so tldr Genesis borrowed from depositors to fill the hole in their balance sheet damn I've heard that one before by using dcg as a go-between entity Genesis likely filing for bankruptcy I think creditors will eventually get most of their money back and dcg will survive with a black eye and a marred reputation and that is the story wow you know what this looks like David is not quite SPF level no no there's no fraudulence here I don't think well question mark this kind of thing is sketchy borrowing filling holes go between to make it legal from dcg grayscale this is some questionable thing some sketchiness here okay it's questionable in contrast to FTX which was just an absolutely fraud show there's no question could there be a bigger this is all like you could probably take them to court and but like you could definitely argue that this is above board maybe yes uh so but but what's going to happen from this is like this this person predicts that um DC dcg will survive with the black eye and a marred reputation and uh Genesis will probably get some of uh its money back uh in some way so people aren't like creditors to Genesis are completely sunk I don't know how all of this results but we'll come to the market liked it so the market this is when this news came out this is not as bad as FTS FTX not even close ether went up a hundred dollars Bitcoin went up like almost a thousand dollars so when this news came out the market was like okay this isn't so bad this is a huge black eye to the Barry silbert Empire though one of the ogs was just taking down a whole bunch of notches after this for those that don't know uh dcg also owns owns coindesk uh so that is also part of the dcg group of fire sale of coindesk maybe uh no no I don't think so it's all part of the system you could sell anything if I guess like you have to yeah um okay so that's what's happening do you have any update for people poor like retail yes money stuck in a gemini or for me David do you have any updates for me any good news please well I'm happy to let you know Ryan that Gemini put out a tweet thread updating their urn customers with what's going on and they said that there is no update okay I have heard through back channels that maybe some people are getting their geost out not quite sure about this but just the gusd Rochester USD I don't know if that that hasn't been totally confirmed but um so I don't know about that for all I know is uh any crypto that I had in uh Gemini earn is still stuck I do know this and they're not really updating they actually pull apps for every instance of Ryan no no if we issue a co-op for David's bottom calls then we'll then we'll call it eBay a big secondary market for for bankless bad call poapps here yeah uh what's this uh this take on the SEC so yeah I thought this was this was useful a lot of the a lot of the contagion of 2022 is underpinned by the gbtc negative premium So in theory one gptc is backed by one Bitcoin yet there's a discount well there's a discount of 42 as in the gptc asset is actually priced 42 below what is the net asset value of all Bitcoin in grayscale and that is because they can't turn the damn thing into an ETF because the SEC won't let them I'm gonna look at the chart real quick just explaining that's bad if you want to see the chart it is basically if you buy gbdc in your brokerage account and buy this gpdc trust you're getting it at a 43 discount right cheap Bitcoin it is cheap Bitcoin but there's no assurances that that discount is going to go back to zero yes and it's also it's yeah that's why it's Bitcoin like you know um uh Bitcoin TM typically remember like Ben Hunt our friends Bitcoin it's very much Bitcoin TM it's some Bitcoin covered it wrapped in a trust wrapped in a like proxy price thing it's not a real Bitcoin spot ETF is it yes okay so back to the tweet this I just thought this tweet was great uh by failing to create an ETF for Bitcoin the SEC allowed the grayscale to gbtc trade to rip retail for five plus years uh that's the reason why the pre the discount is there is because like uh other people are able to milk retail out of their Holdings because they're diluting retail and something and selling into the market also charging two percent for just holding Bitcoin that's why grayscale's so profitable I mean that's why grayscale is a profitable all big all the net value of all assets under grayscale grayscale charges two percent that is an absurd fee if compared to an ETF but we can't have that ETF because Gary Ganser doesn't let us anyways it also the SEC also forced most trading outside of U.S jurisdiction which allowed for the contagion to go rampant and also let ftx's fraud hit millions of Americans it couldn't uh anyways I just thought that was a good tweet yeah um protecting retail question mark uh that that discount by the way is uh the record discount 43 I wonder if this is kind of a like bottom call to it's like yes I mean are you bullish gbdc I think this is not necessarily bullish well that would cause you to be bullish Bitcoin how about I am bullish Bitcoin just I'm bullish on ethermore okay the point the the this bull market Ryan the 2020 bull market the start of 2020. it was indicated by a premium in gbtc as in people were buying Bitcoin more than people were supplying Bitcoin to the trust so people were buying Bitcoin at a premium because that's they wanted demand for Bitcoin and so this the the coming 2020 and 2021 bull market was marked by external outside demand for gbtc it's been negative ever since and so we are so low we have 42.7 off of the premium and that it's that is a new low and to me that is just indicative of kind of another bottom signal a bunch of C of other bottom signals and you could solve this very easily if you're the SEC by just converting a sec into an ETF and then it basically trades for something that is much more proximate to spot price of Bitcoin so it would unlock there's there's something like 800 000 Bitcoins in grayscale it would unlock uh 42 of the capital of all of that assets that's that's available the reason it's going down is what people are fire sailing people are fine yeah they need liquidity so they're saying I'm not going to wait for my for it to turn into one Bitcoin I'm just gonna sell at a 42 loss oh this was the chart read this uh this is a chart from Shane chaparro grayscale bought brought in 477 million in estimated Revenue since the beginning of this year wow combine gptc and eth products wow almost half a billion for doing what for 500 million dollars producing that product for retail and what is the product you hold custody in coinbase custody coinbase custody gets a cut what is the product Beyond this you could I I don't know how many people they have at grayscale but like that's a lot that's a very healthy margin I'm gonna take 20 people to run this 30 people and 500 million dollars yeah I'm the last Twitter thread said that this thing was worth a billion dollars that is way underplaying it just do a revenue multiple on 500 million you know what like a 5x Revenue multiple uh or 10x something like that you're already like five billion dollars 2.5 billion like this thing's worth a lot because of this stupid Arbitrage because another way to say this uh retail spent in addition to getting destroyed in all sorts of other ways in crypto retail spent a 500 million dollars in fees on these subpar products this year sick and it's not grayscale's fault they're trying to get an ETF I mean this piece of it wasn't all right uh but yeah it's waste okay so why do you think this is the last Domino to fall David is just we'll get this out of our system contagion Genesis the last piece and then it's over so the contagion of 2022 started with three arrows Capital where did three hours Capital get all their money they got all their money by milking the gbtc premium uh retail and like you know traditional people would buy gbdc on the stock market that would create the premium uh what what would three hours Capital do they would take Bitcoins which by the way they borrowed from Genesis uh and then they would get that into the grayscale trust so they think they could park at that Arbitrage and that was three hours capital's first big like profit and then they just levered up all the way and through and through and through and so and so many people followed them into this trade uh they they borrowed more with Genesis they went long Bitcoin and ether which worked well for them then they went along saluna avex which which went well for them then the FED raised interest rates Tara collapsed all the illiquid uh altcoins like went way down 80 Bitcoin and ether went down a 50 three hours Capital gets liquidated Alameda gets liquidated uh then Alameda plugs the hole with their fake ftt funny money from FTX and also a bunch of customer deposits uh that plugs the hole for like four or five months six months uh but that hole finally opens up again FTX has collapsed uh that's gone and now we are at the final place where it all started which is gbtc and grayscale so we've come full circle so there's no that that's the whole thing and so we are the bull market started with the gptc premium and it will end with the gbtc discount uh that just makes sense to me and there was a pile of dominoes but it was just in a circle on a straight line and the last one to collapse um I think by the way you just gave the explanation of what just happened over the last two years in about 90 seconds and uh we were calling this the uh you know everything from 2021 onwards at some level has kind of been Ponzi Funny Money economics right yeah and so no no surprise then that we are resetting the clock and going back to 2021 January prices which is about where we are so in a way not surprising given what's happened all right let's go check in on FDX and Sam some stuff happened this week let's burn through this quick FDX bankruptcy hearing what are the takeaways uh from this yeah so I got some notes here so there was a bankruptcy hearing uh you could have been into the zoom to watch uh but basically the tldr is that FTX is being investigated by state and federal Regulators it's still unclear what exactly FTX has in terms of assets and liabilities uh because they didn't do accounting so they're trying to figure that out the lawyers representing FCX told the judge you have witnessed probably one of the most abrupt and difficult collapses in the history of corporate America calling the FTX worldwide organization Sam Bateman Street's personal fiefdom and alleged gross mismanagement um kind of like the Celsius Celsius bankruptcy issue customer privacy is also going to be a big question uh the parties are going to try and find a way to balance publishing the names addresses and email addresses of all creditors including fgx's customers and not doing that so like how do we do this I don't know they're going to try and figure that out do that also the jurisdiction there's a jurisdictional fight between the U.S and the Bahamas who has the assets right uh that is at a ceasefire at least for now a Bahama appointed judge a joint provisional Liquidators have agreed to allow for the ftx's digital markets chapter 15 bankruptcy in the southern district of New York to be transferred to Delaware to join the other 101 chapter 11 bankruptcy cases chapter 11 maybe sweet so that was the tldr of the FTF bankruptcy hearing meanwhile what a mess uh Sam Bateman free sends an email to employees did you read this Ryan no I'm reading it now well he starts off he would like to tell the employees that he's really sorry and that none of this was their fault he said that like five times and I'm sure that's an important being like I never thought it was my fault bro this is your fault [Applause] but what do you say I I don't know what you say I just would stop talking at this point but um Sam seems unable to do that I don't know if there's anything you could say um I read this whole thing there was nothing the only thing that really stuck out to me this slide was kind of interesting where he just did some back of the mat napkin math about like what happened and he's he this guy has no clue what assets or liabilities they have he's just like okay so number one a crash in the market uh LED uh this last spring led to a 50 reduction in value of the collateral in FTX 50 billion in 60 billion in collateral with only 2 billion in liabilities turns into three billion 30 billion and of collateral and two billion of liabilities he's just doing a napkin math also he's just like aggregating all assets and Cloud will be like yeah this is our balance sheet and if we got this information on Twitter never mind how this is customer deposits and should not be considered like collateral anyways uh if you are interested in Reading Sam's letter to employees there's a link in the show notes no why not yeah making an nft out of it I don't know I'm sad what are we looking at here this is a really cool uh chart yeah it's really cool yeah so this just shows the FTX SBF Empire between Alameda research FTX FTX and FTX Ventures and all of the things and that they have invested in that they're owners of there's a lot of Investments if Sam did all of this in four short years David yeah all of this yeah like like the guy came on the scene in 2018. um you know what you know what's kind of weird to me is like we should have probably popped our heads out and been like how does somebody go from like nothing to 30 billion dollars in crypto in one cycle isn't that this I'm here though is the story not in one cycle I think like the Voorhees is of the like the people who have been here it you have to do if you're doing this the right way you have to do it over multiple Cycles like the Brian Armstrong It's like not really crazy to make a bunch of wealth that level of magnitude was unheard of but like I don't know I think it's I think probably but my antennas are going to be forever up about this kind of thing is like we Pro like how did that happen I go from zero to 30 billion into your first cycle well everyone that's made made a ton of money too quickly also lost it really quickly in 2022. uh so that definitely tracks uh meanwhile in unrelated news Elizabeth Holmes just got sentenced for 11 and a quarter years in prison um completely unrelated uh just all she did was scam investors money yeah right uh okay but then uh the hacker the FTX exploiter has converted millions of ether into Ren Bitcoin tokens well that's a background story there's a hacker he was managed to get FTX some FTX funds while their security was down I guess right yes right yeah we're tracking this hacker on chain and this is what I was alluding to earlier in the market section about why the ether Bitcoin ratio is down this week the hacker is selling ether for Bitcoin which is actually confusing a lot of people in crypto Twitter because ether is generally the more censorship resistant capable asset out of the two because you can do things with ether so on Sunday hacker moved over 5000 ether of the stolen funds to a new wallet and then later an additional 35 000 ether was also moved over that wallet into three separate transactions that new wallet started to convert ether to Ren Bitcoin using one inch if you aren't familiar with what Ren Bitcoin is Ren is like this inter blockchain protocol Network so if you have run Bitcoin on on ethereum you can transfer that Bitcoin over to the Bitcoin Network first transactions had 4 000 ether being converted to rep to BTC and then traded into Ren BTC uh and the ren Bridge has also previously been used to launder stolen funds uh at least 540 million dollars of it in other instances and so maybe that's what's going on here I don't really know the hacker is a Bitcoin maximalist yeah it clearly explains it good luck with that yeah all right uh okay um and so there's uh moving on into different stories in the SPF verse uh Forbes put out this article that says really the SPF his he wasn't really as lucrative as he was made out to be uh his 2021 tax returns shows a net operating loss of 3.7 billion dollars they lost 3.7 billion dollars in 2021 wow that would have been nice to know a year ago yeah I would have loved to have known that how did you lose 3.7 billion dollars in 2021 that was the most that was the most lucrative year of all time no how would you do that I mean leverage I don't even know how you do that leverage margin no I don't know yeah that's really I don't know that takes skill it takes skill to lose in 20. there's a regulator response in Capitol Hill I thought this was a really useful thread but in I'm going to try and speed run this as much as possible uh so uh Ron Haman says this week in Congress and crypto last week the blockchain association hosted our first annual policy Summit with industry leaders regular and Regulators members of Congress and staff the timing couldn't have been better with the FTX Fiasco playing out in real time here is what DC is saying number one they are shell-shocked that is the word mainly used by policy makers when describing the FTX Fallout many of them met with SPF personally asked questions of various healing hearings or at least knew how often he was in DC meeting with colleagues as more reports about FTX came in the anger in DC Rose number two the hill is still largely in fact finding mode and that is important Congress tends to have a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis but bipartisan calls from Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry for a hearing in 2022 showed the desire to learn hear from various parties and then engage the Senate uh housing fine and financial services committee uh light hearing which is going to happen likely won't be uh won't be the only one this year the Senate banking House and Senate agricultural committees have hosted SPF several times in hearings and meetings and likely will want to host a meeting to hear what happened and what can be done to prevent this number four what could have been done what were the regular where were the Regulators why did FDX domicile in the Bahamas and many other questions I like that last question these are some great questions uh and many other questions are top of Mind in the hill many still don't uh know uh and thus a large reason to suspect both FTX execs and The Regulators will be called in for these hearings number five the episode uh will easily bleed over into 2023 where the Republicans have the house and the Democrats have the Senate the fact finding will still continue and both Chambers will likely find a bipartisan regulatory solution could be bills introduced previously or brand new uh stable coin Bill still in play um maybe um looks like dccpa is uh dead that's what he says largely dead but it could reappear in a different form uh this is interesting and by the way this I think this is the Ron Hammond Twitter account I don't know who this is but I think he was the one that tweeted out about you know after SBF for his debate like everyone in DC was talking about this yes yeah um so it's interesting that that still happened like 11 days before people in DC that was the conversation and then the next week the weeks that follow it's this yep um I wonder how that changed things damn bankless is on their radar that's great yes yeah in a good way in a good way come on guys all right we're doing the right thing here uh SEC facing Rising scrutiny after ftx's uh explicit implosion I don't know how they're going to respond to all this yeah so uh Bob Menendez a senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee was asked uh if the SEC could have been more aggressive in investigating FTX prior to bankruptcy guess what his answer was Ryan whose answer uh Bob Menendez the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee oh he was he was asked could the SEC have been more aggressive in FTX in investigating FTX prior to the bankruptcy I bet he said uh hell yeah he said uh the article says he replied simply yes and asked if you plan to question SEC Gary Gensler about that Menendez replied I am great I wonder what the uh the tone of the that speech pattern was yes I will be doing that yeah um all right uh what's this Finance this is taking its shot unrelated but related binance us steps into National politics with new campaign pack so binance filling the void of FDX lobbying I wonder how that's going to sit with Capitol Hill or crypto Bankers fight for our values guys please don't make the same mistakes all right tell us about this crazy story here's the context of the week can I just say this so in the mid in the midst of this chaos almost like you know the little finger chaos is a latter thing it's like the Joker from Batman it's just I mean he's like chaos in the midst of this a defy attacker starts attacking defy and he had been previously but now it's like there's weakness in the industry I'm gonna go attack it so give us the context here it involves a few different uh exchanges um a few different chains but uh try to tell us the story and then like let's get to what happened okay so back in October the end of October there is this mango Market on Solana was exploited for 114 million dollars it was not Dex right it's a decks yeah it was not a hack uh it was an economic exploit it was like an oracle attack it was basically Market manipulation so he used The Exchange as intended he was they were just able to manipulate the markets in a way that extracted 114 million dollars in an economic exploit um that person uh is avra avraham Eisenberg uh and he declared that he thought that this was just a simply a profitable trading trading uh strategy and that everything was legal when open market operations technically true good luck defending that in court anyways he returned 67 million dollars definitive actions uh and then later fast forward a few weeks also now on the ethereum Chain instead of Solana Eisenberg would put 40 million of usdc inside of Ave to borrow 20 million dollars of curve of the CRV token from the curve curve exchange he then sent that 40 uh 40 million curve tokens 20 million dollars to okx with his short position on Ave and the idea was that he was just going to dump the curve to short it and then buy back the curve later at a cheaper price and be able to park it the Arbitrage same thing economic exploit Market manipulation trying to trying to like you know geek out some some money right this time with a on a bigger network with some bigger players like her it was much bigger than uh the last Target exactly uh it just so happens that while this individual had his curve short open curve releases the white paper and the code for their stable coin which was very hyped which caused the curve price to uh to be on to stop going down and to stead go up and he got short squeezed and liquidated uh and so you can actually see the liquidations on chain because this is defy and we are all crypto Twitter is watching this all happen in real time and so here we are watching the liquidations roll in in ways that we could not have seen the liquidation from Ave so Ave is liquidating this guy Eisenberg because of his short position and so we are watching this in real time in stark contrast to what was going on with FTX and Alameda uh and so that is always nice to see you live by the sword you die by the sword that's exactly right playing this game that's exactly right uh so Ave tweets out about some bad debt so as a result of the illiquidity of CRV actually Ave was left with a whopping 1.6 million dollars a million with an m with an M yes after after this Fierce attack after this fierce fierce attack which represents Ryan a whopping less than 0.1 percent of total volume on Ave I can't remember the uh I can't remember the the I saw it it's less than uh 0.1 percent excuse much less than one percent yes that's what I meant that's what I meant 0.1 yes I can't remember where the numbers were I saw a tweet but it was something like I don't know eight weeks of Ave Revenue I think at worst uh and so yeah D5 even on its worst it's still okay uh robust right all this happen transparently all this happened people were watching this happening people like again Genesis had a hole in its balance sheet last May and we didn't find out until November we watched Ave grow a 1.6 million dollar teeny little hole in its pocket which is totally gonna plug up uh and anyways so that's that story uh but also curve the other big news is that curve releases wow and so this uh this stable coin is kind of like maker Dell but more governance minimized with an algorithmic liquidation engine so you can put your collateral into curve you can mint their curve stable coin if you get liquidated it will liquidate you in the most modest amount of ink increments possible and then as the price goes back up it will recapitalize you and so it's kind of like maker Dow you're still taking leverage you're still like minting this new stable coin but it is a new decentralized perhaps David uh curve deposits whatever's in curve whatever's in curve and whatever what kind of things are in curve right now uh like kind assets so stablecoins are the big one but like you have re that's cool staked eth I wonder I don't know I don't think that you can make the stable coin out of the youth pairs but you can imagine that curve makes the meta staking token well this is the kind of thing I want to have some more time to dig into to be honest to get us back to our old like kind of d55 Route building cool stuff rather than talking about FTX yes this is yeah a white paper it's been a while since I've read a good white paper good old-fashioned way good old fashion white paper they're coming back yeah uh Gauntlet Network put out a tweet and gotland for those who don't know that is uh tarun chitra's organization that they do these economic simulations they made uh as they did the analysis and they made some recommendations they said the attempt to squeeze curve on Ave has been unsuccessful and unprofitable despite this Ave has accrued a much smaller insolvent position our immediate recommendation is to freeze a number of tail assets on V2 to mitigate the risk of smaller likely unprofitable squeezes defy all of this these attacks happen in the open the learnings happen in the open as well the defense all happens in the open this is how defy levels up and this is why I think what we can build at the end of the day here is a much more resilient Financial system right we get the attacks and we adapt right we get stronger The Shield increases for every attack re-harnessing the the energy of the attack I love that that's your take Ryan because the next tweet is exactly this oh really this poor Dart Twitter account says I think Avi the Liquidator the the curve short seller the guy who's trying to economically exploit all the protocols he goes I think Avi is good for defy we need people to operate the guy not of it right RV yes I'll be the guy it's good for D5 we need people to stress test these protocols as in if they can be exploited then they should be exploited they can't be exploited then they're robust and as a result like unlike FTX which is now gone and destroyed unlike Genesis which might file for bankruptcy unlike Alameda which is gone when all of those things fail they don't come back Ave failed lost 1.6 million dollars has to pay that that's fine but we can learn in real time and now we are going to build back better I built back David's running for office we're not going to cut it editors do not cut that Dave wants to build back better um read this follow-up tweet though I'm also really glad that lost a lot of money oh all right I kind of feel good about that too um guys we got more to cover as always but before we get to sponsors we want to remind you that

some updates on that there's a lot of fun out there saying withdrawals will never happen that um Foundation like deleted from the roadmap blah blah blah blah they're happening in 2023 but what's the update here uh so in order to unlock withdrawals we need all of the clients to have that enabled uh and so there is a new devnet with all the clients low star techu Lighthouse Netherland Geth that is up and running so there's a successful staff net with withdrawals up and running it's basically what you need to be able to test this thing and then next step uh main net uh rumors that it will be in the next hard Fork we do not know we do not know I just don't listen to the Twitter accounts look at what the devs are doing look at this yeah the progress is being made okay speaking of devs flashbots they've just open sourced their block Builder which is right in and of itself so that brings more competition in the space and also they have a new short-term censorship resistance strategy so here's vitalik saying there's a new short-term censorship resistance strategy dropping a courtesy of flashbots and he recommends that any Staker using Mev boost which many are take advantage of this new Option David what does this new Option give us what what problem does it solve for the ethereum protocol yeah the problem that solves is that block building is a pretty damn specialized expert level activity and it also a block building whoever can be the best block Builder will build them at most profitable block what we're worried about is that activity becoming highly centralized so uh with vitalik and this new flashbots blog post and this new thing that you can now plug into we are trying to do a Best of Both Worlds thing you always want to choose the most profitable block but we also want to be resilient not have centralization and also be able to construct our own blocks so this is really this new update that allows for an optimization function so when a block Builder produces an extremely lucrative block that passes some level that you set in your node you can accept that block Builder's block and if it doesn't cross a certain threshold of profitability you as the node operator can just build your own block from home and if you do that if you build your own block from home when there's not an extremely profitable block when there's just like normal Divi things not crazy D5 things if you just build it at home you're going to get 99.9 of the value that you otherwise would have gotten if you had to use a block Builder if a block Builder sees some crazy Mev and then capture that and they build you a block and your block was going to earn you two e's and that block Builder's block is going to earn you five eth because of this optimization function which is what this release is you can opt in to the occasional high value block when it is produced by a centralized block Builder and that Ryan is how you get the best of both worlds that's cool yeah my TL DR on this because my brain was kind of full this week when reading this is like um they're trying to make doing the right thing for the network more profitable yes and decreasing the cost or doing the right thing so basically you opt into this and you still get 90 of the maybe 99 of the profit and uh you're doing the right thing for the network which is you're decreasing centralization you can still run um you know staking from from home your own validators uh and you don't have to centralize and that is a good thing for decreasing the decentralization of ethereum and increasing decentralization of course uh increasing the censorship resistance of the network David this is cool too Matic magic Eden match made in heaven magic Eden is a Solana nft ecosystem and they are moving to Matic not exclusively but they're deploying now on Matic what's the update here uh yeah that's basically the update they deployed on ethereum not too long ago and now they are also on an ethereum Layer Two is this the layer 2 thesis playing out um I will leave that up there for the listener to design tantalizing tantalizing how about this oh I love this one our eth adds collateral in maker Dao our eth out of Rocket pool the state East uh token out of Rocket pool the friendly neighborhood decentralized taking as a service protocol is now collateral inside of maker Dao this is huge for our eth liquidity this is one of the big things that rocketpool really needed to be competitive with Lido uh there is a five million dollar die debt ceiling but that's just like the first rodeo yeah and it's where it starts yeah very good very good on that okay um also arbitrum new arbitrum feature this is this is actually really sick and it's interesting that arbitrum didn't actually really like be like loud about this uh so basically uh there's we all know that our layer twos are more centralized than we would like them to be uh becoming a validator for a layer two for optimism arbitrum is a permission thing you can't just go do that but Arbitron recently uh did this upgrade where if the centralized arbitrum run validator uh sequencer goes down for a sufficiently long a period of time the network becomes permissionless and anyone can spin up a new arbitrum validator and join the network to start processing withdrawals that is crazy and that is something that is implemented today that is this is good this is this is good this is like that we like this this is decentralizing our layer twos which uh was always going to come but it's happening faster than I thought so great job in Arboretum this is from bartek too who really keeps track of this stuff yes so if you want to read the whole tweet thread and what they're doing you could do that and you're right they didn't get loud on this it's because so much going on speaking of getting loud uh we talked about Collectibles last week bankless launched his first nft collectible project uh a high level is I didn't know that a hundred were gonna sell and they I didn't get one David and I also did not get one it sold out in the first minute and I spent 50 or something on on each gas fees and I was there I was clicking refresh I was doing the thing that you told me to do with nfts which is get there first right and I still didn't get one yeah um so I did not expect there to be this level of demand I guess the good news around that is more are coming uh including I think not not tomorrow's don't worry about it take that off the holidays but the the Friday after um and so you can get the next in a series of Genesis Collectibles the first one is really quick back up though yeah what the hell did we drop it was the SPF Eric Voorhees uh are now we are now turning our podcast into Collectibles that's what's going on so we we turned the SPF versus Eric Voorhees into a one of 100 collectible which we uh sold for .05 ether all revenue went to coin Center also all royalties also go to coin Center 100 is going to coin Center uh and uh we sold it for .05 eth the floor is now 1.9 ether that is insane I did not see that coming there have been three sales at one ether uh turns out collectible podcasts are a real thing also turns out I will never make money on this nft thing David because I always miss the great opportunity you can't even make money on your own nft bro that's how bad it is I would have had one on the back on this monitor here and it's just dark oh that would have been cool yeah it would have been cool I could have been great nft for that monitor uh anyway uh what else we got tornado cash this is sad uh Alexa pertzeff is detained still in Amsterdam um for another three months that was a renewal he was in there for 90 days of this again is the developer one of the developers responsible for creating tornado cash the Privacy tool on ethereum that U.S citizens can no longer use and Alexa pertzeff finds himself in prison as a result of this no charges have been laid so another 90 days in prison that's the reports that we're getting out um look man unfortunate people like like I can't believe this people like Alexa Sam bankman treat is running around with his cargo shorts and backpack in the Bahamas I'm sorry letters right like an out uh is uh in prison right now um and why because he put together a public open source privacy tool for the entire world okay it's like coming up with SSL or some kind of like you know encryption technology do you know why they cited this as like what they're doing like not detaining him for another three months they cited it the governance token because he was an owner of the governance token he is like an operator of the business this is so this is this cannot stand we've said this before you guys have heard us talk about this but um it's um it's just really sad that injustices like this go on especially when you see actually who the threats are to crypto and to actual retailers so someone building real code here um so very unfortunate um we're doing what we can here including um one of my good friends and a co-host of this this podcast is actually uh suing um secretary yelling as we speak um so we're doing what we can but um just just keep Alexei on your mind as you hear about the scammers like SBF remember we've got uh we've got some folks that that need help JP Morgan a crypto wallet now a registered trademark in the US I saw this headline go forward uh anything else that we should say about this uh that's I mean patents are kind of a no news kind of news it's like an indication of like okay in three years we'll like see a JP Morgan like products the trademark it's a trademark the JP Morgan wall is something I don't think I would ever put money in a JP Morgan wallet I I hope you you wouldn't but actually I kind of think you would because you put money at all no more never again all right I told you guys it's an experiment it's not something I was Man issue the PO app whatever anyways okay coming out of uh coinbase and optimism you can now transfer from coinbase to optimism hey cool great good job I mean it was a long time coming glad it's finally here we asked for this and Ryan Armstrong delivered great if we asked for it David and I went to Brian we're like yo the one thing we need is this and he just we literally did that oh yeah we did true story uh Bitcoin um bad news in New York Governor what's this yep New York Governor signs first of his kind law cracking down on Bitcoin mining uh Governor Kathy hochel signed a law on Tuesday that's my Governor uh it's Banning certain Bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources for the next two years unless a proof of work mining company uses a hundred percent renewable energy it will not be allowed to expand or renew permits and new entrants will also not allow to become online there's a quote from the Chamber of digital Commerce here that says this approval will set a dangerous precedent in determining who may or may not use power in New York state and that is a take that I 100 agree with let's not get political about what we think is good or not and who can have access to energy that is bad I totally agree because I like Christmas lights uh and I will continue to put Christmas lights up in my house and Christmas lights and Bitcoin mining is probably the same amount of net Global energy my friend Bitcoin mining is less less than Christmas lights yeah but yeah and this is a thing I mean it doesn't affect ethereum and other ecosystems we care about and like we knew this political pressure was coming but that doesn't necessarily make it right yes um all right raises so one big raise this week across protocol they just raised 10 million dollars or 200 million dollar valuation this is of course is a bridging protocol we've told you guys about a number of times maybe you're using it maybe it's on our airdrop guide maybe you get it maybe it's become a premium member oh are they yes they are the good news there is when companies are raising and they still are there's still some money in crypto it means you can get a job in crypto that's what we got to tell them about um the crypto jobs board developer relations at uniswap a front-end engineer at uniswap ernify coming in high coming new uh looking for a full stack engineer at earnify looking for a senior back-end typescript engineer I like that earnify company think they're doing big things uniswap Labs nft Engineers a lot of Engineers on here uh you can tell us the bear Market because now we got no Tech no non-technical jobs it's all technical David because we're building we got to build because we're building yeah anyway you want access to those go to the bankless job boards banklist.pellot.com and you can find that of course uh Black Friday shout out 25 off coming to you tomorrow get your bank list premium and what do we have coming up next David after the break this time we'll talk about how the hell do I talk to my family yeah you Greg just last time I did big rug uh people just don't care about ethereum withdrawal elsewhere um how do I talk to my family about crypto followed by the takes of the week uh followed by what Ryan and I are thankful for so stay tuned for all that and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless because you need it arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to Orbison Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free if you've been listening to bankless you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network questions from the nation David I think in the US is Thanksgiving morning so the one thing that happens uh tradition in the US is you get together with friends and family and these could be relatives you haven't seen for maybe an entire year you haven't seen in a very long time they probably know that you're in crypto right because like it's that weird thing that you do on the side and you can't stop talking about it yeah maybe it's because you can't stop talking about it maybe uh you know they've asked you questions they've texted you about like buys anyway your family knows that you're in crypto so what do you say to them when they ask you questions how do you talk to your family about crypto this Thanksgiving some real practical advice here I think this is the question from the nation today um actually we're putting together a post on this from uh Michael Wong who's one of our writers and uh there's a number of questions here we could get to but let me before we get in here David this is the high level all right what are you do you have do you have family members like this who are kind of distant relations they know like oh David's got some podcasts I think your family calls you Dave right oh yeah some of them yeah all right so it's like Dave's got this podcast and he knows in crypto what's going to be in the top of mind what questions are you expecting to to be asked uh so this year they're not gonna be bothered to answer because they've I've been in crypto long enough so I'll go backwards to like 2018 Thanksgiving what did I do back then and so they were like oh like David like uh are you gonna like leave crypto now that everything's on fire and like the whole industry is like collapsing there there's two answers to this what are the words that you say but also I think that's less important than how you say it because humans respond to emotion so if you come into Thanksgiving and people are like uh is your conviction shaking about crypto like how how's your job going like he's still doing that crypto thing you just got to come in harm be like damn straight I'm still doing that crypto thing like s Sam bankman freed a banker told it showed all of the industry exactly why we need to not have Banks and now I'm fired the F up and I'm doubling down oh my God and you should totally buy ether right now because it's so cheap wow that's what you'd say to them is this what you said in 2018 uh so like there was like oh the Ico Mania is over I'm like uh yeah it turns out it's a bunch of hot air turns out our defy yield Farms were like not really all that sustainable yeah uh but like it's still gonna be the global like Foundation of all Future Finance and like nfts are still going to unlock a ton of human culture it's really just about like is your conviction shaking all your conviction conviction shaking and you just need to be a stoic individual because of how you understand the business card though you know you're being stoic you're like and also Grandpa you should buy you should have some that part you would be excused to say if you just don't give your family members Financial advice don't do that that's but it's about the conviction right because people because people are like going to be like oh like like some of them especially people people some people love to be like hahaha crypto broke uh now I don't that one cousin that you have right the people that don't want to have to deal with a cognitive dissonance of 2021 when they're like all the crypto people were making money and now it's on the flip side of this now they're gonna be twisting in the knife but hey remember when you shot remember when you told me to buy four thousand dollar each well so glad I didn't yeah I remember when you said it was going to 10K you idiot yeah and then you say like it's still going to 10K yeah it's still happening right so I'm buying more yeah like I yes um yes it's about the conviction and it's about like hey like there's a mission here if you can show that you believe in this that there's a mission that's actually how Ryan um my first company in 2017 that blew up uh it's an Ico advisory company destined to blow up yeah uh I got a like a 130 person company I think five or six or seven of those people got jobs in crypto after that I was one of them one of the reasons why I I survived through the 2018 to 2020 bear Market because I was enthusiastic and people saw it like I was very clearly about the tech and that's what like kept me a very hirable person when there was literally no jobs left so it's just it's just like I I is it kind of an answer of like I don't like a price at times like this so look at the fundamentals and you look at what went wrong that's a great way to do it yes a banker blew up the the financial system used posing as something he wasn't and we're glad I'm we're detoxed we're come back stronger that's if you even want to engage in that conversation depends who you're with I don't know family relationships are you know you also don't have to bring it up you can also relax and not talk about crypto yeah you could just smile and be like yeah it's been rough lately and then that's that's more like my my mode is I just try to not talk about it honestly because if they want to hear what I really think I mean oh my God how many hours of content do we actually have right like it's almost like you can opt into it um but okay so here's grandpa saying how are you doing job wise right and you got an answer for that mom is asking what happened to nexo Celsius Voyager my friends used it and lost it all sorry Mom you gotta have an answer for that Ryan here's a here's a hard one uh and this is one that's in the actual uh newsletter if somebody who says hey I have my money on coinbase or Gemini I'm worried about like Gemini earn or something I would just like to take self-custody of your assets like where do you start with that yeah I think so there's difference between like Gemini earn and like crypto lending thing and like just having your your assets on account so first of all you want to make sure it's a reputable account right like uh like a coinbase uh maybe a kraken I put there still Gemini even though their their earned program is going through some struggles and then you kind of have to weigh it David because you have to weigh the risk of one of these exchanges going under versus your relative's risk of losing their own keys if they if they mess up a setup and this is really important it's just I kind of I actually don't love going through the process of of teaching like friends and family about it too much unless they are kind of coming to the table with with their knowledge and their learnings and they're asking me more specific questions right because if you kind of do the work for them then they weren't really ready to hold on to their own keys and self-custody you kind of have to just like hey you can leave it on Exchange until you're ready to move it off and then go figure out what you think are some of the best and then I'm happy to give you some help or pointers or that sort of thing but like making them do it themselves is kind of a key because that's like an acid test of are you ready or not right right um that's what I generally do but it's important uh are you gonna be single forever that's grandma asking wow there's a lot of there's a lot of good questions that come up in Thanksgiving you have anything else to uh to to end it with what else can people expect to be asked uh what else can people expect to be asked um is price going when is price going down to zero is crypto dead yeah I feel like we've talked we've tackled that I think I think really the main point is is like Celsius FTX three arrows Capital like there's all these buzzwords that people have heard and I think all you really need if you are going to talk about this all you really have to say is like yes this proves exactly what crypto is here for and and teach them the delineation between FTX and crypto like that's really the point to drive home there you go there you go and then tell them to listen to bankless if they're really curious uh takes of the week what do we got here this is a fantastic uh automated take from uh this uh guy Ryan Sean Adams he tweets out the Tower of Babel is a story about Mankind getting too full of themselves and trying to build a tower to reach up to the heavens and become Gods so God foiled them by confusing their language and scattering them all over the Earth where is this written Genesis chapter 11. wow dude that is no lie all right I I looked this up because I was like genesis huh that's I wonder what's in chapter 11 of no way yeah wow no this is real okay Genesis chapter 11 look this up I'm Googling it now wow this is the Tower of Babel this is the whole thing and it was really about Mankind's hubris it's kind of like an Icarus type story of like you're trying to be bigger than God uh and then what what happens David uh God foils their languages they all start speaking in different languages and they scatter all over the Earth so they can't complete the centralized project they decentralize David wow centralization that's crazy Tower of Babel goes to decentralization afterwards and this is all Genesis chapter 11. let me tell you the the scripting in 2022 is just like off the charts man I just I just Googled uh why is it called chapter 11 and turns out it has nothing to do with the Bible so that's just no that would be too much sorry that would be too too many hints in the uh the simulation there all right what do we got Arthur hey no this is uh yeah what's this take uh Arthur Hayes is uh retweeting a suzu quote suzu founder of Heroes Capital says FTX set crypto back years Arthur Hayes says uh per the zoo per cycle in Reverse Where's My Money mofo basically saying uh oh yeah three hours Capital says FTX set crypto back to years so did you bro like what I think three years capital is on a mission to be like this one's worse than us yeah so can we come back now yeah um no you can't come back okay this one this one was my take I want to watch I'm going to read it though you want to read okay yeah because or else it'll you'll seem too self-aggrandize for sure people already think of that all right uh 2013 this is David a proof of work fork and fair launch we printed proof of work coins in 2013 2017 Ico Mania we minted Ico tokens 2021 yield farming we issued governance tokens every bull market is a Ponzi scheme under the guise of new token distribution models in the Emoji of slapping hand on forehead yep it concludes this tweet uh the bitcoiners really like this one because they're like oh David's finally figuring out that anything outside of Bitcoin is just a big Ponzi scheme uh but then I would actually like to go to uh exhibit a my next tweet okay uh which is a platform that is for finance is synonymous with a platform for ponzis uh and so like we've talked about this before uh money money is real Finance is perceived ponzis are just the like extrapolation of the that on steroids right perceived money hot air money um and so this is really how bull markets in crypto start we create something cool in 2013 was like oh we can Fork Bitcoin a bajillion times let's do it uh and then in Ico the Ico Mania was like oh we can just mint a token let's do it and then in D5 yield farming it's like oh we can just like have these governance tokens and do yield farming to produce yield and attract investment let's oh let's do it and then it just gets you know mutilated right so starts with a core primitive that adds a tool to the tool belt of this crypto economic future and then we like eke out all possible hype and value out of it over the next year uh and then that's when people get hurt uh it's a little bit frustrating but that's how this industry proceeds it's frustrating but like it collapses back down to like its true utility value and the cycle resets again there was no super cycle it was just always the human cycle of like it's just basically that the hype cycle right all the way you go up to the point of um yep uh I always said euthanasia um Euphoria and then you come back down and like the the cycle resets every single time I I think that's what we're seeing here um what are you thankful for David this Thanksgiving November uh 2022 November 24th people are listening to this what is David Hoffman thankful for this year oh there's a lot to be thankful for um I am excited it's going to be practice for me to like go home with my family and like for the first time I actually don't really want to talk about crypto things I just like you know want to cook food and hang out with my one and a half year old super adorable nephew uh and so I'm definitely thankful for that um I know I'm I'm I I'm also thankful that it appears to be that we're like at the basement you said you just said just now that like we are back to our like actual value of these networks like nothing is hot air these are now real uh and so I know it's corny but like we're gonna build our way out of it and now the amount of signal that we're going to have over what's being built over the next six to 18 months is going to be so high uh it's not there's not gonna be any fluff uh and so all of the hot air is out of the industry which just lets everyone progress forward faster and I remember in 2021 I remember you and I talked about this is like as soon as the bull market got frothy and manic this is tiring like we need to wash this stuff out I didn't like it right we got our wish everything's washed out too much and a little bit too much I was talking with some friends giving it's like so we lost some of the baby but the bath water is definitely all gone yes uh and so uh I mean we're on the other side and so like now there's only signal and so I am thankful for that yeah I I think that's a great thing to be thankful for it and uh you know look Dave and I met during a bear market right it's really a fantastic time to be in the industry be a settler you meet some of the best people and I guess that goes to what I'm thankful for David um I'm thankful that makeless listener that you're still here if you're listening this right now it means you are a settler and not a tourist all right because the tourists the last few weeks the the last six months the 2022 uh they left or they're in the process of leaving but you're still here um I tweeted this out uh earlier if you didn't make it this time make sure you make it next time crypto's not dead Yep this is a multi-year multi-cycle multi-decade experience right and we've always said this it's long term it's not about overnight gains but you're still here that means I'm confident you'll be here for the next cycle and you'll be maybe a veteran the next cycle you know who responded to that tweet David oh our friend Anthony sassano and he said this he said I didn't make it in 2013 2014. I didn't make it in 2017 2018 I made it in 2020 and 2021 my overnight success was seven to eight years in the making that is the opposite of SBF story right of make it rich in one cycle crash and burn all right this is actually all of the people that I've seen in crypto who've quote unquote made it and when Anthony says he made it he clarified that he's talking about like he's now financially independent and he can do what he wants and work on the projects He cares about right that is part of you know we say it bankless like in order to make you healthy we have to make you wealthy right but like wealth doesn't come overnight all right and so this is a multi-year multi-cycle thing and the bottom line is you're still here so I'm optimistic about your future because you are still here and this is where everyone I know in crypto who's quote unquote made it to the other side has been here for multiple cycles and it goes back to like the quick shortcuts often just like Crash and Burn like you can't it's it's not about the things that are easy right you got to find the things that are hard but still worth doing and for for me that's what crypto is like sometimes David um in the euphoric Cycles I felt like oh my God like we don't deserve this I don't deserve this what did I do I just helped here's where you earn it here's where you earn the upside in a way you don't you shouldn't feel bad about it you shouldn't feel bad about a 10x or like a 50x on the last cycle because you were here during during the bear market and I know you resonate with this story too because um you know like quote sorry yeah you may like it's it's Anthony's story right of like you you made it because you persisted during the last um bear Market yeah and uh just to drive that point home one more time the people that stuck around after 2017 to 2018 and stuck around during the bear Market of the very long hard bear Market of 2018 to 2020. everyone talks about the most lucrative time was defy summer that's when all of the money was made without without much of the risk without much of the degeneracy and people that were around for D5 summer saw the 2021 bull market coming a year ahead of time and so if you want that level of front-running the opportunity you gotta stick around Ah that's right stick around and we're going to continue to be putting out content for you um look 99 of everything that we do is completely 100 free so I know we've been talking about the uh like the bankless Black Friday sale that's on throughout this podcast um that's if you want to take another step on the journey that's if you want to get some extra type of thing but if you can't afford that okay just know that there's a place for you in the bankless nation by the way it's only 13 a month but still I know like if you have to choose between Netflix or bankless subscription I'd still do backless but maybe there are some other choices you have to to have to forsake so we're still gonna be putting out content the vast majority is going to be free and uh we hope you stick with us be a settler uh I think you'll um you'll appreciate it on the other side 100 all right let's talk about meme of the week David I hope we got a Thanksgiving meme today I think we do this was uh perchie out of bankless Dao this is in classic perchy uh artistic fashion uh and it's four people around a dinner table one person's talking one of them has a very furrowed look on his face and the person that's talking says I read an article about SPF it sounds like he wasn't complicated and somewhat controversial figure and clearly the crypto person is just angry because he's actually a fraudster yeah at that point you have to choose whether you want to say something at the Thanksgiving dinner table or not I think the response to that one is like he had Bank in his name Dad all right guys I hope you enjoy some time with your family if you're in the U.S if not thanks for humoring US during this American Thanksgiving episode risks and disclaimers got to tell you of course as always crypto is risky so is D5 so is he so is Bitcoin as we've seen this year so many times you could lose what
