[Music] hey guys welcome to another state of the nation episode i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman this is an episode where we this is a show rather where we talk about what's going on in crypto we we zoom in on one item we relate it to some of the big picture stuff we discussed in the podcast and the newsletter we tried to drop some insights and action items to you as well this is streaming live right now on youtube this also comes out on the podcast david how you doing today oh absolutely fantastic it's coinbase week it's all-time high day it's building day there's so much to talk about uh which is why we actually have two guests today on today's stay of the nation because what are we talking about then today yeah yeah so uh some interesting projects have come out with a slightly different flavor to them i would say um they're really cool projects in of themselves but it's also the people behind these projects that i think is also uniquely interesting uh we have uh people who have been in the actual ethereum protocol building the ethereum protocol preston van van loon and will villanova uh hopefully i got that pronunciation right i forgot to ask him ahead of the show um preston van loon has uh been with the prismatic team building out eth2 uh and and will has been uh doing our r and d with uh phase two the sharding aspect of ethereum two in his past as well and so the through line here is that we have ethereum ethereum builders turning into app builders uh and that is a unique story that we have not yet seen coming out of the ethereum ecosystem yeah i think that also gives them a unique perspective to david on like both the protocol layer on ethereum and also the app layer and you know what david i i won't be able to help myself i'm definitely going to ask some eth2 questions at the very end of this because i just want to like we're five months into e2 staking launch what what's happening next what do they think how do they think it's gone timeline that sort of thing so we'll try to fit that in at the end david what is new in the bankless community we gotta talk about bankless badge week that starts next week so next monday let's see monday the april 19th what is bankless badge week what are we doing i thought i thought it was bankless multiple badge weeks i thought i thought is yeah so we're gonna be giving it's badge week that last two weeks how's that badge weeks yeah so uh we've been we've been uh hammering this out in previous episodes and so we finally figured out the uh raffle giveaway agenda first week is all about bats all about baps people are getting their uh gonna get people with the bankless badge are going to be getting baps and that's what these are uh and so there are only six maps left which means only six more people will ever get this shirt that you can you are seeing ryan wear right now uh and so that's pretty cool uh and then that is week one uh and week two uh will be uh uh and now soon yeah we too um the rumor is it the the raffle weeks is going to rain raffles for the next uh two weeks starting on the 19th rumor is the last day of the raffle we will be raffling off one eath sir wonder what the price of one eath will be at that point could it be two thousand could it be ten thousand we don't know but one eighth is one eighth and that's why there's one roughly um and for for those of you don't know uh the way to get a badge is you can become a bankless subscriber get a badge but we're doing this raffle really because we want a lot of the people who have subscribed already and have a badge link somewhere in their email to go back through make sure you claim your badge so you can participate in these raffles we want everyone who is a full bankless subscriber who already has a badge link to go claim their badge that's what badge week is all about so go do that this is a a what you're seeing on the screen if you're viewing this in video is how you enter the raffles when they come in this is a grid plus raffle that we did previously you just connect your your wallet to it has to have a poet badge in it could be on xdi could be on ethereum main net and then you're entered in the raffle and it randomly picks a winner uh every single day is is how we're gonna be doing this so super exciting that that is uh that is happening soon yeah so just to reiterate if you are already a bankless subscriber you can go get your badge right now you gotta peruse through your history of your email inbox to go claim your badge uh and then future raffles uh if you want access to future raffles you can go and become a paid subscriber to bankless and then you will get your badge on the first of the month yep uh may 1st is when we meant those if you're looking for an email specifically uh search for lucas at banklesshq.com he's gonna hate me but that that's where the email is coming from it's all coming from lucas he is the the master of minting the master of coin maybe i should say it thankless uh all right um what else we have hester purse commissioner crypto mom turns out she's also defy mom we had her on the the podcast episode released on monday that's just a fantastic episode everyone should go listen to that to figure out how regulators at least the good ones how they think about crypto and more importantly how they think about d5 specifically any takeaways you want to mention from that episode david yeah uh the biggest complaint i think out of the crypto space is the lack of clarity that the sec has uh provided our industry uh and i think that's something that hester purse is on a mission to help solve and i feel like that's why she's coming on to shows like ours uh to to help uh explain her thoughts and her her thinking about how things could be and what she hopes to have as a regulatory relationship with our industry um so that was my big takeaway since hester's trying to make things really clear the other takeaway i have is that she loves the bankwest podcast which [Laughter] that was awesome not only hester but apparently the sec members of the sec listen to bankless podcast on a regular basis which i'm not sure if i should be uh excited or terrified but i'm more excited especially after that conversation with with hester that the last thing i'll say about this is it feels like 2021 could be a time for a um a blank slate in crypto gary gensler is the sec commissioner he's coming aboard as part of the new administration so there really does seem to be a push to get some things right provide some that clarity you were talking about um david all right i've got to start with the question i ask you at the front of every state of the nation episode david what is the state of the nation today sir the state of the nation this is a good one pioneering we are pioneering so in multiple different fronts and always always state of the nations are always and mean multiple things in multiple different ways i can't believe we haven't used this one before pioneering there's a decent chance that we have okay as well if we did it early once yeah so we are pioneering into the world of the nasdaq today or in this week uh and so coin is getting listed on the nasdaq tomorrow uh is that why some of the crazy price action is happening right now is that why ether is currently breaking through all-time highs all right what's coin for people don't know oh coin is the the ticker symbol for coinbase which is going to be listed publicly so that is going to happen tomorrow that's going to cause a bunch of news um the the bankless opinion we put this out on the market monday piece yesterday is that no matter what the valuation is on day one coin pumps um price go up um it's just it's perhaps the new meme stock that's that's my predictive uh statement about the future not financial advice but we are not only pioneering into the nasdaq but we are also pioneering with new defy apps um and and this is what we are going to get preston and will on to talk about shortly is that uh element which is will's project is pioneering into the world of splitting one token into two the principle and the yield and then presence project is pioneering into the synthetic asset world of producing tcap which is the total crypto market cap so new defy apps building on top of other defy apps and also allowing other defy apps to build on them pioneering new surface area in d5 guys you will not want to miss this upcoming brilliant conversation with these two fantastic e2 developers who are also now developing d5 protocols but before we get to the conversation we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this state of the nation episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of the cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigramps.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless metamask is your go-to wallet for the bankless journey if you're going bankless you need metamask period browser and mobile get them both this is your tool to unlock the world of d5 here's my favorite part now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe this has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens choose a token you own a token to exchange it with get your quotes if you like what you see you hit swap that's it what makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes it compares dexes aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage this means you can swap a wider range of tokens and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity you don't even have to think about it try it out download metamask for desktop or mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping all right bankless nation we are here with preston van loon and will villanova uh guys welcome to the show thanks so much for for coming on yeah thanks for having us yeah glad to be here yeah i'm going to do my best at your guys's bios and then we're i'm going to hand it off to you to help fill the gaps but uh preston you are the founder at prismatic labs which is um perhaps the most downloaded uh eth2 client uh i think it has the most east staked in it so so congratulations to that and uh preston's been been working on ethereum ever since he was full-time at google and then started working just on ethereum on the side because out of passion uh and then i believe what happened is uh vitalik yellowed a thousand eth into the prismatic treasury and that's what really enabled you guys to go full-time uh full-time at prismatic and then uh will you were part of the quill team at consensus doing r and d on the sharding side of things uh so specifically phase two and now you are working as the ceo of element finance which is what we're about to get into uh so so preston let's start with you give you a chance to correct any errors in the in the bio that i might have just made and also expand on it as well now that was pretty close so yeah i was working full-time at google and i was working on ads and ads are not very like globally impactful at least positive to most people i mean they help people find products and whatnot but it's not what i was interested in and i found ethereum at the tail end of 2017 kind of when icos were getting big and cryptokitties and all this kind of stuff and seeing like wow you know ethereum has a lot of potential use cases but it's super kind of maxing out right now kind of slow so i wanted to get involved to the protocol layer with e2 so at the beginning of 2018 i ran into raul jordan online and he and i started prismatic labs with uh terence and nishant we're the four founding members of prismatic and we just kind of moodle it through all of 2018. we we got some grants during that year but it i think it was the yolo grant that really signaled the confidence of the ef and of the community that if we all quit our nice jobs that we're gonna be okay like we're not gonna i mean none of us had any ether at the time like we're just kind of interested so it was a big risk but it it really paid off i mean we have an amazing community and and and it's been really good um but i still have this passion for like how do i further increase my impact and so uh we started uh cryptex financed um as a as a moonlight project to prismatic so i've been work still working full-time as prismatic but on the side working on cryptex trying to build a new financial product for mostly for retail investors like if you talk to normal people they they they know bitcoin and they they might know ethereum but they they don't really know how to invest in everything they know there's a lot of cryptocurrencies but they don't really know like how do i get into the whole market so that's kind of what we're trying to solve with cryptex and tcap awesome and yeah we are going to get into each uh the details of each of your guys's projects in just a sec but uh will uh maybe explain a little bit about yourself and your background as well yeah for sure um so similar to preston actually i was also in the ad space and uh you know saw that it wasn't you know moving towards the greater good um and then on the tail end of 2017 um you know hopped into the space i'd been following it for a while um and built the bounties network at the time uh built that from from the ground up um we did uh some of the contracts that get coin uses as well so we were pretty uh pretty close to the bitcoin team um and then sort of after that i was you know making a decision whether to um i kind of had two two routes that i was going to go i was very very passionate about the breaking d5 space and at the time you know i had a friendship with fernando who you know is the ceo at balancer and actually almost joined balancers the cto there but ended up instead you know at the time joe lubin had you know asked if you know i could dive into some of the research on youth too you know help help look into some of the areas and so i ended up doing that and you know i was i was really excited about that helping helping scale things uh diving in a bit deeper working working closely with the eth2 research team and you know a lot of a lot of bright minds there um so i did that did that for a while um you know we we did a lot of uh you know research and and development on you know what what do shards look like in the future how do we generalize them how do we bring wasm onto them you know how do we make it so um you know eth2 and in the long term can serve many different uh types of blockchains and and uh many different structures that can grow on that um and so we we explored a lot there which is which is really solid and then also ended up um working on some uh some research on eth1 um and actually uh you know put put forward an eip 2938 on account abstraction which brought some of the research we had done on eth2 into sort of the stateless world and some of the generalization we want to bring into eth1 um and we you know put together a implementation in uh the go theorying client um and did did a bunch of simulations on that and saw how that could you know improve some of the execution uh currently uh on ethereum as well and that was part of you know all of that was a part of a team quilt that i had started um and had grown to just you know work and and further develop and uh research things uh in the space and so quilt is still moving forward strongly um and about six months ago i had you know been really excited about some of the developments in the d5 space um kind of going back to some of my routes um and you know almost uh joining in building balancer uh you know a few years ago um kind of re-centered around that and so that's what's what has brought me here with element and yeah very cool very cool so like we alluded to at the beginning the reason why we have both of you guys on here is that you guys are both building cool new defy apps with a unique perspective of coming from the ethereum side of things and so that's where we want to end up with the conversation is like how has your guys experience building ethereum translated into uh skills building defy apps and then also why have specifically you guys chosen to build on the app layer now instead of a year ago or perhaps a year from now like why now and then also perhaps some conversations about what surprised you about the trajectory of ethereum both at the protocol layer and at the app layer but first we want to start with the actual details of your guys's projects uh and so uh will's project element got announced first so we're going to start with elements uh and so uh will can you kind of give us the uh the bird's eye view birds eye pitch of element and then we can go in from there yeah definitely so uh the element protocol basically you know for the casual user average uh user uh they can come to uh to the protocol and they can purchase uh bitcoin eth die or usdc and they get it at a discount um and essentially that you know that can be translated into um securing a fixed rate of income on that purchase so if you're looking at ten percent fixed-rate apr on eth um and you're looking at over a year period then you can secure um 11 eth that can be redeemed a year from now and so we make that process really simple we make it really really easy and we let those users you know in reality avoid a lot of the issues around variable apr um gas issues having to manage their funds which is which is really cool um on the as far as like how how it works behind the scenes um we essentially uh take uh positions that you know current defy users are already staking in uh specifically in yearn and we split that into two new tokens so we're able to represent the yield that's gained in one token and then the principal and essentially for users who are already staking they're given further avenues of revenue so they can go ahead and take those two tokens they can provide liquidity on an amm and they can actually get you know higher apy off that um but also what it allows them to do is is it allows them essentially to sell their principle and give them a bit more capital capital efficiency they can sell the principal and they can gain more liquidity to get exposure to more and more interest and essentially when they're selling their principal they're selling their principal as a fixed uh a fixed rate of income and so that's for the casual user basically it's subsidized by these more active users who are actively using their funds um and selling their principal as as fixed-rate income so it's sort of like the circle of the the two sides of the market and how they how they benefit each other so will can we talk about like fixed rate income just in general like so in the in the old world um how does fixed rate income work are these like i go to my bank account and i know that interest rates are crappy i know you're going to tell me that but like i go to my bank account i have some money and i go and i buy cds right are like cds in a bank account are these fixed rate income maybe you can talk about what this is in in the in the old world and how this translates into crypto yeah typically when you look at a cd or you look at a savings account um but that you're evaluating you're given you know a rate that uh that is fixed and so um you know it's for example in a savings account right now i think the best that you can find is maybe you know half a percent uh apy which is uh you know nothing in comparison to what we're seeing in the uh in the d5 space right now so people in d5 on variable apy positions are seen anywhere from you know 10 to 50 um it can even be you know higher in some cases and so um essentially you know for the users in the traditional finance space who you know sort of are accustomed to at least being told like this is what we can guarantee and this is what you'll get um you know the element protocol offers the same thing but those rates are going to be you know significantly higher than what you see um in traditional finance um and uh the other thing that you could sort of compare um you know deeply when you you look at the traditional finance space is um also this is somewhat akin to a whole space of um zero coupon bonds this is where you you know you essentially get an asset at a discount um but you you basically commit to it being locked until um until a final date and because that asset is locked that's that's essentially what introduces that that discount you have an opportunity lost um instead of using those funds depositing and getting apy um you know the fact that it's locked means you can't do that and for the opportunity cost um that's why it's it's sold um essentially you know at a discount um so this is like a cd for um crypto assets basically and specifically like the the crypto monetary assets which would call like bitcoin eth and usdc so if i'm bullish on eth and i want it to generate yield i i can park it into this this um into your system basically into element and then i have to hold it there for a period of time right uh and then at the end of that period of time i've received my yield is this kind of how it works or am i paid the yields continuously yeah as time goes by yeah so the the way it works is essentially um technically uh yes so you sort of go and you bring your eath you trade your eat for the locked eath essentially and that may be locked let's say for three months six months but you get it at a discount that then gets redeemed for a larger amount at the at the end of that period however sort of what's what's really innovative you know about about what we're doing um is we've you know put a lot of effort and research into making sure that market is liquid um and so what what that means we're actually you know doing a custom trading curve where a launch partner with balancer v2 as well so we actually built um built a uh a invariant it's the uh constant um power sum and very invariant um an iteration some of the work that yield space has done um and so we we're you know launching that and it's you know been audited on balancer v2 um and so it enables liquidity for these assets and so what that means is even though technically you know you have three months that you know you have to be locked into this or six months you can actually exit at any time so you could go through let's say you're on a six-month term you could go through uh halfway at the three-month mark and decide that you you know you actually want liquidity again um and then at that point you can you can sell it um you know with this with this uh custom curve um and then you'll have gained uh the interest uh along the way as well this is something you can do in like traditional consumer level you know cds that you might get in your your bank account right they're really locked in i i've never seen a way to like you know trade these on the secondary market yeah yeah no that's correct and that's what's so cool about this is um we sort of you know and this this is what i love about the defy space is it sort of opens up all these new avenues of innovation and all these new primitives that you know i think a lot of them haven't even been explored fully in the traditional finance world and just due to the you know nature of amms um the fact that you know like in balance or v2 you can uh you can write custom trading curves um which is which is really really cool i have a lot of good things to say about uh balancer v2 so a huge shout out to them um but it just opens up so many so many cool things and so something that you know you would have originally thought you would have been locked in exactly you now have liquidity around being able to exit any time and so there's no real commitment towards that locking period which is which is beautiful so will i'm interested in so this if i'm bullish on a particular asset this allows me to express my bullishness by committing to a lock-up period uh and then because i'm committing to that lock-up period i get to access that that asset that i'm bullish on at a discount and if i'm bullish on an asset what would i like more other than the asset that i want offered to me at a discounted rate uh and of course the measure the magnitude of that discount is probably correlative to how much yield is is that asset can bear but the cool thing about uh finance is that this separates this allows uh two groups of people to separate from each other people who want to purchase an asset at a discount and that is uh and that's one half of element uh go into details on the other half was who's is there some other half of this equation where people are getting extra yield on this where's the other half of this equation uh fall in yeah yeah so this this is what's really cool and this is um this is what i you know i love about um you know about the product in general is we're sort of you know we we've done a lot of research and ideation and shared a lot of what these like market effects you know will be or what we think they'll be um and so we're sort of letting the market push this forward and so what our general hypothesis is and we write about this a lot and we've you know dove into it is essentially for the other side we're talking more the sophisticated defy user right these are the d5 users that are depositing into a urine vault and maybe shifting their assets over time taking bets on different positions um and uh you know it might not just be urine it might be you know a number of different uh protocols that they're jumping into and so what we do is uh they sort of feel the market um and so we say that you know it's the sophisticated users who are subsidizing uh the discounts of the casual user and the casual users subsidizing the strategies of the sophisticated user and so if i'm you know the sophisticated d5 user and i am depositing into let's say the uh yearn s t ether and the st vault um is you know basically uh uh investing in the eth2 uh staking position right and so let's say i'm you know in investing in that anyways um then with the with the element protocol um what i can essentially do is i'm still investing in that position but i get a little extra so i now kind of split i split that position that i'm in um into the principle and the interest and so this this lets me do a number of cool things um one i could you know stake both those tokens and get a bunch of extra trading fees and we've simulated that you could you know boost your apy significantly creating this market um but but additionally it gives me other like ways of escape right so um i for example um if i want to shift funds around but i still want to keep exposure the interest i can sell my principal i have new liquidity i still have exposure to that interest um on that position and now i can use that liquidity for um to put into any other position in the space and uh and so however we've we've dove into this concept called yield token compounding and so this is this is the idea where you uh you sell your liquidity um your principle um and in general you know variable rate will always be higher or should always be higher than fixed rate um sort of how markets you know generally work and so um i can go ahead because there's that split i can go ahead and i can sell my principal and i'm getting a higher rate of interest on the variable interest that i'm betting on and so when i when i sell my principal i'm selling that at uh less less of a discount and i get that liquidity and then i can redeposit into that position and i can basically increase my exposure to the interest and i can do this multiple times so i redeposit i collect these yield tokens i'm getting more and more exposure to the interest i sell the principle get liquidity again redeposit sell the principal liquidity recursive right yeah it's recursive and i can do this like 10 times do this more and essentially it's another way of leverage so i could have started off with 10 eth and assuming the variable position is going for 20 and fixed rate is going for 10 percent um you know i can essentially get exposure to 63 eth worth of interest yeah yeah and if you're doing this with you know there's really other cool things like if you're doing this with flash loans as an example you don't even have to put through the full capital this is where you can essentially get you know 10x uh leverage um on these on these positions um and on the interest um by by you know sort of selling your principal and doubling down on on the yield and your exposure to the yield so will we talk about money legos so so often on bank list because that's kind of a great mental analogy for like what we're actually building here right so i'm gonna ask the question of like you mentioned some other money legos what money legos does element build on top of like you mentioned urine is that kind of a strategy piece are there other pieces involved and then a follow like a second question of that is this seems to be built on money legos but is its own money lego it's kind of a new d5 primitive so any thoughts on what could be built on top of it let's first take the the first question of what money legos needed to be here for you to build element yeah so urine urine is a huge one um and then right yearn is built on the number of legos too so if you look at like what what sort of you know turns the d5 d5 world around um a lot of that is you know curve behind the scenes and so a lot of you know the apy and interest that urine is getting uh comes from curve um and and specifically also um you know for example the eighth position where we're you know likely supporting within urine is also into st eath which in general is a uh eth2 staking protocol a tokenization staking protocol and so um yeah there's there's all these like legos and it sort of depends on the vault uh certain vaults have uh different dependencies and so we'll kind of finalize which faults we're gonna support out the gate um right right before our launch um but uh but yeah those would be some of the some of the core core pieces so guys the the yield is coming from places like eve two staking that is a source of yield another source of yield is curve and that's an exchange platform for stable coins that also has a token which is kind of like a an equity token if you will capital asset that rewards users and then urine wiring wi-fi we've we've had um wi-fi on the on the podcast previously that acts as kind of like a strategy layer where these all these automated uh like money robots optimize for the best strategy and that's what you're using under the covers here um now that you have this new money lego element essentially what what cool things do you think can be built on top of it yeah there's there's a lot actually um that we're that we're super excited about and we're actually really excited for ideation from the community um you know we're gonna be a community uh first protocol and we uh want the community really really run it um but in in general um so there are a few things uh i'll mention some of the ones that i'm really excited about um so just first of all introducing fixed rate to the market that has liquidity around it is is a beautiful thing in and of itself and so um there's a lot of directions that that can be taken uh into one thing that i'm particularly excited about is this concept called yield yield ladders and so essentially what this is is you can get a uh amm that essentially gives you exposure on a basically continuous rolling basis uh to uh categories of uh of yield essentially and so for example you could have these yield tokens um and you could have categories that are like eth2 or validator positions right they might be like e2 or layer 2 valid tokenized validator positions and because we have these you know lockups and these these times you can essentially buy exposure to that whole category as a whole um and uh and it sort of averages out the interest as it goes along you could do the same thing with the um with the principal tokens and the fixed rate interest as well um where you could get exposure to the highest rate you know fixed rate interest and and you don't have to worry about lock-up periods you don't have to worry about redemptions uh you sort of have this pool that is sort of always buying uh new fixed-rate uh tokens and then selling uh the ones as they come to maturity and sort of automates that process so you basically get this like this consistent exposure and uh you don't you don't have to worry about too much and so there's that um a number of the other things i'm particularly interested in is using using these principal tokens as collateral for lending um is really fascinating as well and so this sort of like if you think about it you know you can take out loans for eth um you know by staking uh lochte essentially and this this opens up a whole new market around um our strong market around borrowing eth and borrowing bitcoin and that market hasn't really taken off um and this this protocol in essence uh creates that demand uh which is fascinating and so uh we'd really like to see in um you know in the coming uh coming months um a strong uh demand for borrowing uh bitcoin and borrowing eighth through the protocol well guys if you want to get more into elements there is a massive uh an awesome awesome uh documentation at element dot phi uh one thing i've learned about will is that his documentation skills are excellent uh and so if you want to learn more you can check out uh that um but let's go ahead and turn to uh preston and cryptex kryptex is a new synthetic asset uh protocol specifically going after total uh total crypto market cap uh preston you want to explain a cryptex to us yeah absolutely so cryptex is it's an open organization so it's it's um we've kind of built this for the community um to be run by the community but the basic well the first token that's been created is a synthetic asset that's backed by different types of collateral uh where it has over collateralized the value to create tcaps so you can be ensured that cryptex or the cryptex org is not you know they're not just printing money they're actually backing it by something uh it it kind of borrows from the cdp idea from maker dial so the collateralized debt position and with this we're able to use an oracle price feed where tcap can always be redeemed for the true price which we just saw above to 210 and this value is really the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies traded on major exchanges and that's currently 2.2 trillion dollars which is crazy i mean when we started thinking about this idea it was about 30 dollars for tcap and you know i wish we could have launched it two years ago and and given this product out then and it could have been you know something where you're getting huge gains on but the potential here is is huge because it doesn't stop just a tcap with the same kind of model we can really apply to any kind of oraclized data using the same cdp model that we have what's the collateral in this case preston yeah at the moment we have backed collateral so it's very similar to maker dial where you have a vault deposit the collateral and then you can draw out a certain amount of tcap so we have eth as one and then die is the other one and then of course it's pretty flexible so any erc20 could could be a vault if it's if it's accepted by the protocol so um the potential for other types of tokens or or um backing vaults is open once the uh like the you know the dow is fully operational so here's a quick lesson for new bankless listeners is that dye is actually just a synthetic asset and it's priced by an oracle uh and so what cryptex seems to be is exactly what president said a pretty similar system as maker dao and so but instead of uh collateralizing just uh collateralizing all the collateral that maker dow lets you collateralize you put in ether or die and then you mint this new token and this new pro token is priced by a price feed from chain link and this price feed comes in at uh the total crypto market cap and so this is something that the the market has always wanted because no one's really been able to produce something that tracks the total value of the entire crypto industry at least all of our crypto assets except that's what this is going after um and so uh preston where do you where does uh chain link get the price feed for tcap where does all of that information come from yeah so there are there are five data sources to get it from i'm going to try to name as many of them as i can but it's things like uh coin market cap uh sure i'm not gonna be able to coin gecko i know is one yeah coin get go things like that i mean it's it's it's if it's a currency tracked on one of these major sites or major exchanges even then it's eligible for consideration in the total total market capitalization so there's a little bit of vetting there at least at least that's the intention is that i can't go create uh my own like uh stable coin and give it a an insane market of five trillion dollar market cap it's not gonna influence tcap because it has to have some credibility to it so uh with the the data sources that are coming through chain link there is the vetting process for those this is kind of this kind of goes back to a recipe that that we talk about so often david which is like on bank list which is like you take you take a money lego store a value which in this case is eath and die and then plus an oracle a price feed oracle and you can create basically any synthetic that you want so we have store value bunny legos oracle money lego and then on the other side of that you get any synthetic in this case you're creating a synthetic and index for the total um market cap of crypto and if if i'm just a casual user then preston right i i don't have to know the mechanics necessarily of how this works although i might want to understand them for like to understand what the dependencies are and what i'm really trusting in the system but i could just buy a tcap as near c20 and then i have exposure to the entire crypto index and i don't have to make a bet on whether you know bitcoin or eth is going higher in a certain day or whether you know binance is having its uh its pump it's temporary pump or not i don't have to make any of those bets and just get the entire market right yeah that's right i mean you'll get exposure to things that are very volatile so like for example ripple's been having issues with scc uh lawsuits so they were sued the price dropped significantly then the lawsuit stayed making progress so the price goes back up i would probably never invest in ripple but like to have some exposure to to good news is excellent and i think that this is something that a lot of retail investors who who don't even want to take the time to understand how those types of protocols work they just see that this type of innovations that are out in cryptocurrency world have value and could be going up in value as it gains more mainstream adoption of course they could pick the big contenders like bitcoin and ethan you you probably should do that i mean not financial advice but but for all the other things tcap can solve that problem of what should i invest in maybe i should invest in everything so so preston what are the uh parameters for producing tcap i know uh at genesis uh when maker dow first launched you needed to lock up 150 of ether uh and then you could mint uh up to a certain amount of dye could you go into the details of the parameters around the system yeah sure so the the minimum collateralization is 200 so we need double the collateral that the user interface will recommend to you that you should do 250 just as like a safe maximum and this value can be lowered at a later date it does seem a little bit high but in order to get the product out there and to stabilize it and to move quickly and to keep it safe we we aim for a higher than than 150 model um and then we can of course revisit it if if we do some analysis and and say well 200 is too high we could do it with a hundred percent especially since um some of the vaults really move in tandem with the price of t cap so e for example it doesn't move um much compared to t cap but die might move a lot more compared to t-cap because it's pegged to the dollar and and not really moving a whole lot so uh maybe at a later date some vaults have a higher collateralization ratio than others but we started at 200 just to be safe right and this is uniquely different from maker dow where the ether collateral is uh has it's the collateral against a stable asset but this this is not printing a stable asset this is supposed to have an asset that ideally goes up in price and so having die as the collateral for something that uh owes that where you owe something that could go up and twice as much in the future that could that could get into some hairy circumstances yep yeah so you can think of it as kind of the opposite of the maker down model where if i put in eve and draw and draw i'll die i'm kind of probably going to buy more ethan so i'm i'm long on on that uh well your short die long short die along the collateral yes so in this model it could be the opposite if you're short on the whole market i mean we're at the work in a bull market bull markets don't last forever maybe you're going to be one of the people who can pick the top and say i'm going to draw out a bunch of tcap and sell it for die with my die back fault and then go back and pay it back later when it's a lot cheaper i mean that's that's one opportunity for vault owners the other one is that um keeping the price in the secondary market stable so the oracle and cryptex core contracts have no control over what it trades on unit swap or sushi swap or any anything like that but we do have a place where you can redeem this token for the for its true price based on the oracle so if tcap's traded too high you can mint some tcap and then sell it on the secondary market once it stabilizes buy it again pay back your debt and then same with the opposite as if it's trading too low it's a good time to buy and pay back your debt at a discount so the opportunity here to me is that uh not only could there be tcap but there's also this governance token which could in theory govern over further um further synthetic assets which makes uh cryptex in the same sort of uh boat as perhaps synthetics which is a a synthetic asset platform uh what would you say would be the long-term uh vision of cryptex are you guys just going to pump out a bunch of synthetic assets like what's that what's the deal possibly i mean we we have a lot of ideas for for new innovations that we that aren't out there and our founder joe stico is more of a finance guy wall street guy and he kind of interacts with um a lot of type of the retail investors and users of this type of protocol so he really understands what they want and we have a few ideas we want to work on um it's it's pretty interesting to me being as a developer not much of a finance person to hear some of the crazy things that that people might want to um almost it's almost kind of like gambling i guess in the market but there are some like synthetic products that you can come come up with that are specific to the cryptocurrency world that just don't exist yet so we have a lot of interesting ideas and and potential uh future synthetic assets to come out so i'm trying to get my my mind mapped around how to compare cryptex versus maker dao and synthetics and uh with maker dow it's very different in this with the sense that like the uh the price feed oracle is not die or is not the dollar it's it's tcap and it's also very different from synthetics in the sense that the collateral is not the native token of the system its other assets between those two differences is that basically the the main differences between um other protocols or is there other aspects that are different that are worth highlighting as well i'd say so i'd say that captures it pretty well okay fantastic you know what's interesting here is like i've been uh surprised that um maker dow actually didn't go down the the synthetics route but they've they've seemed pretty laser focused on dye um all of this time so it's it's cool territory that you guys are covering and we say this so often david that any experiment that can be tried on defy and on ethereum will be tried and so this is a a new experiment really excited about what you're building to preston so we want to pause for sponsors but when we get back we are going to dive into this trajectory of how you guys have come from kind of an eth to you know almost a core developer type of role core researcher type of role to move to the app layer we're going to talk about all of that when we get back but we want to thank our sponsors for making this episode possible and here they are synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects

to both be working on ethereum and also in the ethereum app layer and so president i want to start with you uh you're you're in the code for eth2 like not only are you working on cryptex but you are also still highly engaged with uh prismatic uh and you've been with prismatic for for multiple years now uh what's it like to build on both sides of the spectrum and how has the skills that you've developed with building an ethereum translated into building in define perhaps what are the other benefits as well is just do you know do you have more connections no more people more knowledge where what's it what's it like to be on on both sides of the the protocol on the app layer yes so with with prismatic labs i mean we're we're trying to make ethereum a thing for everyone right so make it scale make it easy to use make it fast make it cheap um and and part of that is understanding with part of part of building everything is like who are your users and what do they do right so that's our users of prismatic are first of all the stakers of of eth2 and then secondly people building on the application layer so over the last three years i've been studying you know d5 protocols and how these things work and how people are thinking about uh finance and um and what kind of impact that i can have personally and that prismatic can have in general as as a core protocol team and i saw that um you know there's there's still these fundamental issues with the the protocol there like i being a core protocol developer and not really interacting with the blockchain you can kind of hear oh yeah guess as high but you don't really feel it unless you're actually deploying contracts like i've interacted with you know whatever decks to do some swaps but it wasn't until uh last week we deployed tcap and i we were paying for these contract deployments and it was we spent like three ether to deploy a handful of contracts and i'm like this is this sucks right so i see why people are complaining and and it just brings you know more motivation to back to improving the protocol itself um we've also made a lot of friends along the way in the last three years you know we have been pretty lucky that the community supported us and that um you know we've we've done a great job the prismatic team is one of the best teams out there they've done an amazing job bringing prism to light and helping ship e2 of course we're not the only e2 client provider there are many out there and they're all excellent um but just you know the community has been really great to us and and we've been able to get fee as building tcap i was able to get feedback from a few slick people uh especially to validate the idea like is it cool is it crazy will it work what do you think um so it's been interesting which is harder pressed in building a defy app or building an eth2 client i don't know they're both terrifying you know [Laughter] there is like eight billion dollars running through e2 something like that and prismatic is a very large percentage of that uh so that's terrifying uh to see people um committing their money in vaults to mint tcap is also terrifying just because you know this is something that we built and if it if it doesn't work how it's supposed to work um it's just not going to be great and that's just something that that i never want to happen like everything's got to be excellent so i think the years with prismatic have really prepared me for this is that we have to think about every single type of scenario that could possibly be out there even ones that are ridiculous that don't really profit the the person initiating these types of attacks but that they would do anyway just just for the for the walls so just yeah like just speak just to wreck it you know so just to cause chaos so i think that adversarial thinking and more security-minded focus has become you know really it's really valuable to a d5 developer and and especially at a protocol areas you have to do it right at a protocol layer well what about you your experience uh doing r d on the uh on the sharding side of things and working at consensus how would you say that that's impacted uh the development of element yeah so in general actually johnny and i both came from uh both daddy to uh research johnny actually had built the initial tecu client um as well and you know we all want to interrupt together um you know it's all pressed in there um i think me and preston we have some good you know some other stories that we can share at some point in the call um but in in general johnny johnny and i both you know really take a um an approach that we like to simulate we like to be well researched um you know we it's it's really important to us that we dive into mechanim the mechanism design um you know and understand these are the vulnerabilities these these are sort of the parameters that tweak the system to move you know in this direction which can cause some um some misbalance um and this actually isn't isn't that different than uh what you need to do in the mechanism design for um figuring out how how does the shard work right um you sort of change and tweak this parameter um then over here it affects it affects something right and um and so uh even even in building uh d5 applications you have those the same challenges um some of the other other really cool things um is it you know i have i'm building you know we're building an application while having a really strong understanding of the actual core protocol that means you know when we start thinking about things such as you know scaling moving to layer two other mechanism designs we have a much much deeper context and understanding of that and so that that's uh that's super helpful as well um and so um i would say there's a those would be a few things and then um also just like all all the people we've you know run into uh you know like preston was saying as well along the way um so you know uh in general um it's it's been good to uh to you know both work with you know with a lot of people at the protocol layer who have been very very thoughtful in what they're doing and we you know in general have a pretty strong confidence in the future of eth and where eth2 is going at this point having been you know involved in that and knowing the teams that are working on that um and so i think that you know that sort of gives us a really positive trajectory and you know in general we um we as we you know build uh element protocol and um you know we put grants out for the community and different things like that um one of the things that we want to support is core protocol development um and we want to make uh you know make a specific effort to do that and we're hoping that you know other other protocols do that as well and that's that's in general you know really important important to us in the process too because that sort of that's sort of what like gives makes everything run and everything work so i want to get into the question of of why now and uh not only are both of you guys uh working on eth2 or or will in your case was previously working researching on youth too but uh with elements you guys have danny ryan as an advisor and uh with cryptex you guys have uh many other ethereum builders on on the team so it's not just you guys um there's other ethereum builders uh involved with both of your guys's projects and you know why it was interesting to both me and ryan and why we guys are why we're having you guys on the show is that these projects came out roughly around the same time you know give or take a couple days of the of the announcement um why why now uh why not why not defy summer or why not a year from now uh like what's what about the app player is telling you guys that uh you the the ethereum app player is ready for you guys to start moving in and start building there i will start with you yeah yeah for sure um so you know i've i've been like really excited about defy and what was burgundy and developing there for a while um and so uh in in general some of the research we were working on some of the prototypes that that we had done um was coming to uh coming to a wrap um about six months ago and that's that's when i started building uh element and getting the team together and about six months ago i was sort of looking at the space and seeing the sort of explosion of innovation that was happening um and the uh you know the lego pieces really beginning to stack in a way that we hadn't seen previously um and you know from my perspective that's that's sort of the time to to build right you want to put you know you want to put more foundational elements more um you know key uh pieces that can be built upon because this is sort of the foundation building period um and so that's that's you know what i saw um talk to johnny about it and he also was like really excited about this and what was what was happening and so we figured this is the right time to jump in and and build this and preston same question to you yeah for me um you know when i was working at google i had i put in my my 40 hours to you know keep the lights on right and then i would work another 20 to 30 sometimes even more uh on prismatic and then when i left google i was just spending all that time on prismatic doing you know insane hours and weeks like even you know even at uh socializing events you you might find us on our laptop um will seen us there right at uh east new york we were on our laptop right oh so yeah yeah so uh is this the story yeah this is like one one of one of a few but like yeah like preston raul one of my like favorite memories is at all at all the events whether it was east new york or some type of barbecue or whatever you could find these three constantly on their computer prismatic team by the way for listeners who aren't familiar with those names yeah yeah they're always constantly on their computer and you know everyone else is like talking and uh you know socializing you kind of you go up to terrance or press and you're like hey how are you doing and they give you the time of day they're you know super super nice super friendly and then you walk away and they're back there like hacking you know hacking at the computer it doesn't matter what the event was i think during that time uh that was sort of when uh some of the uh you know infrastructure was still building um and they'd have little like bugs and things things to tweak at that time um but yeah you know these these guys were you know 100 200 always always you know heads down which i think was really fun to watch yeah we were busy we were busy for the first couple years up up until it launched um you know we are working crazy hours and just as much as we can like skirting on the edge of burnout uh thankfully we were we were all like a good team together and we could communicate say hey i'm not like i need some time like you know we could share that with each other and kind of build each other up in that way but then when you two launched um we kind of had a little bit of breathing room right we said wow it's out there we just makes me try to like get these micro improvements get things making it really nice or faster but the the crazy sprint was over at least for phase zero and in all that time i had been thinking about you know building on the application layer specifically with this tcat model but had zero time to do it it wasn't until after phase zero had launched that i actually had a little bit more time to to commit you know i could still do uh most of my time with prismatic and then spend a little bit of time on tcap um and now with you know the the spec of e2 is getting uh ramped up again in the last couple months and we're starting to build into the next um pieces of e2 so things are getting a little bit busy again for me and and for my team it was a good time to just say take a break work on something you don't work on your normal role learn something new i learned a lot of stuff building on the application layer which i think that will help me build and the protocol there because i really understand some of the pain points of what users are facing i think that's key actually like that's that's really i don't know i think that makes everyone really comfortable knowing that you know you can take the learnings from working on uh the application layer and you know make sure that the research and movement on eth2 goes forward well well this is just part of the thing was like um i love the fact that you guys worked on uh you know e2 kind of core development client development and now you're in the app layer because you're like you know eating your own dog food you get to experience what sort of the users and the builders experience around this um and so i i love it and you know i'm hugely optimistic about it however at the back of my mind i'm also a little bit worried because um ethereum has classically had sort of almost a a public goods problem in that protocol development is funded by you know the ef which is kind of intelligent you know yeah vitalik yolos and you know press you know this because uh you know the way prism started prismatic started were yolo funded first that's right funded get coin grant when's the next chap check coming there's not a revenue stream associated with the public good that is the ethereum protocol and certainly there's the vestiges of the original eth foundation who has a treasury fair and maybe as william pointing out there are these other d5 protocols who will contribute into the future that now have some some decent treasury so i'm optimistic about that and yet um you know we're we might start to see a bit of a drain a bit of a talent drain from the um the protocol layer to the the app layer is this something that that worries you or um do you think that this is um you know this is good you know like are you worried in general about the public goods funding problem on the ethereum core protocol maybe we'll start with you preston well slightly worried i mean the ethereum foundation has been really great to us continuing grant sustainability and for growth and those will continue for the foreseeable future we have no doubt about that and in terms of talent i think that the hardest problems draw the smartest people whenever we're hiring for prismatic we are just flooded with amazing people that we wish we could hire all of them but there's always this thing in the back your mind where you're like it's it's not sustainable right like the the ef uh will fund us to see e2 to fruition but after that what's their obligation to to keep us going besides a maintenance part so we may have to scale back so we're always thinking about with prismatic labs like how do we reach that sustainability uh and so you know it's always there a little bit but i i i think as far as easy two is concerned i'm not worried about about it at all what about this so like the you said the hardest challenges um attract the the best talent right um there's also a financial consideration in this like if you want to get really wealthy in this market and you're a smart contract developer right depending on what you do the app layer might be the place to do it or or heck like maybe the best thing to do is to go fork uh you know and create your own eth killer right now with your all of your prismatic experience is this maybe not a worry for you personally um because i it sounds like pressing you're here for a variety of reasons right uh including like the world you want to see moving forward um but is this a a pressure point on the talent pool available to work on ethereum client development are they just attracted to other financial sources that might exist outside of it right because it's one thing if grants and funding is available but i don't think any amount of grants will ever be able to compete with uh tokens like tokens are lucrative uh and that is the competition that uh ef the ef and other and bitcoin has yeah absolutely i mean with with with prismatic we can offer uh some some some nice salary and like benefits and things and working on amazing teams solving hard problems but there is no 100x opportunity with prismatic we don't have a token uh we're not a core we're not a core protocol so we can't you know issue there's no like pre-mine or anything like that or like anything like that so if if you're looking for something like that i mean it draws different people like yeah everyone wants to be compensated for for what they do and of course we do that but there are there's also like you want to maximize your um in time investment because time is finite right so you really want to like earn the maximum you can and and that may not be working on the the core protocol but i can tell you this that you will not find a bigger impact opportunity than working on a core protocol of ethereum so that is more valuable than 100x to me or at least in terms of monetary value will what do you think about these questions yeah um i agree with preston like the the core the core value of uh you know contributed to the core protocol layer is um you know it's really rewarding you're you're building the foundation for everything else it's important work um it tends to attract extremely smart people um i'm i'm somewhat uh optimistic about some of the future funding um i tend to think that uh in general you know and element kind of wants wants to lead in some of this as well is a lot of the protocols that are are doing well and are having an impact um you know should really really get back and and uh put put attention towards furthering development on the protocol layer and so um i think you know you'll see a lot of the uh d5 products that are coming out supporting protocol development in general i think you know from elements perspective um we have a pretty diverse team so um of of experience so you know we have a good amount of researchers and so from our perspective you know this this uh sort of this first uh launch that we're doing um you know we see this as introducing a number of primitives that's going to sort of level up and move the d5 space forward um but then you know we think about like what's what's our next challenge right and from our perspective you know we we always want to be tackling the most interesting and uh um i would say uh fascinating problems and um if that means you know we we put some of our effort because um some of the l2 works need needs to be taken you know to the next degree or some some protocol work needs to be taken uh to to uh to um or need some extra um involvement then you know that's that's like what we'll do and so i sort of want to see this happen i want to see this kind of like merging between the two worlds um in the past we've you know sort of seen this like separation um and so i think you know in the future i think we're going to see more of these two worlds merging and working together a lot closely and so i'm i tend to be like pretty positive about that and i i'm hoping i'm hoping that's the direction things are going to go in i know you know that's that's what element wants and what what we you know what we'll sort of push for um as well so so with your guys's experience in both the app layer and the protocol layer uh and also just your time in ethereum uh which you know you guys have three plus years in ethereum i believe both um which i mean ethereum's only six years old so it's over half of ethereum's lifespan uh what perspectives would you say that you guys have that you wish the broader community had um because so many of the ethereum's community members have come in the last like year or or even less ever since uh defy summer um so with your guys's experience uh very long experience throughout ethereum what what do you wish was more commonplace as a perspective throughout our community uh will let's start with you yeah i would just say uh don't forget the devs and the hands that feed you right so if you're on the application layer like none of what you are doing is possible without the like strong and hard work that the protocol dubs are doing so you know that that should be front and center and on everyone's minds present yep yeah absolutely i mean don't forget when gas prices are back to a normal level that because the protocol invests advancements who who helped do that i mean that's what we're trying to do is make it a much better place um but also i want to point out that that this like it didn't six years old but this is still early when when i got in i thought i thought it was too late i was like oh you know me too i miss i didn't get a crypto kitty when they were like really nice and you know i i missed the whole thing but then in the last three years i've just seen incredible innovations and you know defy summer and d5 like really starting to become a thing and nfts and just constantly amazing people coming out of nowhere and building amazing things and just it's just there's still a lot to come from ethereum and we're not even close to a mainstream adoption yet so if you think you're too late if you think that you know i don't know because if there's reaching all-time highs it's not a good time to get in i'd say any time is a good time to get in even if the price is trading high so yeah i totally agree let me underline that point there's only five hundred thousand dfi users or less right now this is so early that's the population with like a you know mid-sized u.s city uh that's what we're talking about here so um all sorts of ways to get involved here make sure you do that um gotta ask a question about youth too because i have two eth2 devs and experts here um so it's been what like five years uh five or five years five months it felt like five years but five months since launch um how are we doing so far press and how are things going like have there been any uh surprises any hiccups or is it like going better than you thought it would go yeah it's it's definitely been a coaster of of emotion really like that if you look at the chain it's not a roller coaster at all it's exactly how it's supposed to go very stable smooth and and amazing um you know we had a few incidents with slashing people getting slashed and as people are learning what not to do this is becoming better and we haven't seen a major slashing event in a long time so this is great i think that the all of the clients are advancing in the right direction they're getting cheaper to run they're faster and they're also getting ahead of what's coming next so they're prototyping quickly and building quickly and it's just like last year and the year before where we're getting ready to launch test nets and getting users in and getting things going so it it's been exactly how i thought it would go if not better because you know some people were worried how they're going to launch at the beginning december there's no way you know but then if far exceeded our expectations on the genesis event and since then has just continued to be this um you know amazing protocol that's just been cruising along do you remember when we were worried that we wouldn't get enough stake in the contracts at lunch now look at this i i am like part part of me was uh is kind of knock on wood because um i'm a little bit surprised in a very pleasant way that nothing's blown up yet right like this is this is new territory so credit to all the the client development that went into this and um all of the teams that uh participated in it but um yeah are you surprised nothing's blown up yet preston uh no we like everyone did an amazing job and there are several people in the shadows that help you know find things before they become an issue uh thankfully there's not been any showstopper bugs in e2 because of all the audits because of all the process because it took so long people complain took so long but look it's it's gone exactly how it should have and that's why we took our time and did it right and just thank you all client developers all security researchers uh protocol developer spec designers everyone who has evolved did an amazing job and that's why it's succeeding so no surprises it hasn't blown up it's been just like we thought it would okay so what is now next in in the path so we've got to kind of phase zero launch right so the next milestone big milestone in my in my um world besides eip 1559 on eth1 is the merge when is the merge happen when do we get rid of proof of uh work or are there other milestones before that that you're paying attention to uh will that sounds more like you're well yeah sorry yeah a response yeah yeah um so i i don't know the you know exact timeline because um you know i was a lot more involved with this with this portion you know six months ago um but i do know that um you know we've seen um already uh the the emerge in a prototype of for example and some of the clients um you know lighthouse uh did this recently um which is which is really cool and so in general you know what's exciting about the merge is uh you know once you have this in place you now have this data layer um on on eth2 where applications specifically l2 applications as well um you know can also uh upload um you know some some of the state routes or things there that they're working on and then um you essentially can have um you know eth2 um secure the eth1 network and then eth1 point to um the blocks um in the eth2 network and so uh you know seeing that come to fruition is uh is pretty cool and uh you know txrx johnny did a lot of that group and johnny you know my co-founder did a lot of work on uh the initial merge um and uh specifically with mikhail and uh and so uh in general um very very excited and seems uh seems to be moving in in a good direction so i want to get your guys's opinions on justin drake's proposal to uh for a minimum viable merge where we could move that merge up basically as soon as possible to what is secure to really um prioritize the removal of proof of work uh with your guys's understanding as to the current state of the ethereum protocol how does that proposal land with you preston we'll start with you so i would love to see eth2 getting put to work right now it's it's finalizing the beacon chain and doing doing great work there but to merge things together into actually having it securing the whole of the network that's that's what i want to see and i'd love to see it as soon as possible i don't have any aggressions against miners i think they do a great job securing the network um but i would also love to see e2 validators people who have invested in e2 to start earning those gas fees rewards and things like that yeah i think it's uh it's smart um try and get the you know minimum possible to get the get the two uh merged and working together and then uh sort of put some of you know make sure that that's validated that moves forward and then begin uh some of the other deeper pieces like the statelessness um and uh evm changes and transfers and withdrawals so it seems to be like the the right way to do this you want to sort of start off with that first increment c um and then see the uh the the evolution and then and then begin to build on top of that because it's going to be a huge switch as we as we move uh you know eth1 towards a pos system well guys thank you so much for walking us through your individual projects at the app layer now not just at the eth2 protocol layer you're certainly doing some great work thanks so much for the eth price it's going up and i think that's because we are shipping eth2 and stuff is happening um question for you guys if people want to learn more about your projects where should they go first you will on element yeah so um i would say if you look at uh if you go to our website element.phi over there we link to our medium so we're going to be posting a bunch on there but the most i'd say the most informative thing uh would be

the element team they're all awesome they all you know we we have a good group that comes from maker xerox eth2 development um and then even like the traditional space and then i also um johnny made a bet a one-eighth bet if you know i could figure out how to uh braid preston's hair [Laughter] fortunately we're not in person because if if we were i think me and preston would have taken that bet and
