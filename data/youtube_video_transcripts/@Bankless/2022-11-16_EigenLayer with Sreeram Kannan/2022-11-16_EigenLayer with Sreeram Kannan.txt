foreign welcome back to the Devcon 6 experience we have a couple Alpha leaks some debuts of some episodes about particular projects in the ethereum ecosystem some that I think are getting particularly strong attention out of other community leaders in the space this one is eigenlayer and I'm talking with serem from eigenlayer the the co-founder of eigenlayer and eigenlayer is a unique a unique project that I think if it is successful it's extremely ambitious but if it is successful really changes the game for what it means to be an eth Staker and to provide security for many many many other things beside ethereum using eth staking kind of crazy YouTube Watchers will actually notice that the production quality of this video uh goes up bigly and that is because we happen to run into a scheduling conflict with the infinite Garden documentary so we just use their equipment and so they were very generous to let us use their equipment their video cameras and their audio uh so this production quality probably the best production quality video that we have on Bank lists so I hope you enjoy this exploration into eigenlayer and all of its potential consequences right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible trufi is leading defy into the future of on-chain uncollateralized loans opening up D5 to the 8 trillion dollar Global Credit Market whether you want higher yields on your lending or you're a fund manager who just wants access to global liquidity and the cost Savings of Defy trufi is here for you but if you're going to use trufi use it through the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet view your nfts and keep up to date with your web 3 communities another thing you can use through Brave is of course arbitrum and you all of course have heard about arbitrum but the arbitrum ecosystem is really heating up with a recent launch of arbitrum Nova arbitrum has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with a recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs arbitrum Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrum Nitro shipped to last month and has made Arbitrage from faster and cheaper than ever before we make sure that you can experience what arbitrum has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking fuel Network free from evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security also pushing the frontier of web3 development is the sequence wallet from Horizon sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for users sequence is a smart wallet and perhaps the most intuitive wallet in all of web3 but for developers it's a plug and play platform for all web 3 apps and games check out sequence which is already powering some of the best web 3 games out there and lastly diesel is a decentralized social platform built from the ground up to disrupt the social media industry disrupting social media takes a lot of data and dieso's infinite State applications can finally store and x large amounts of content and data fully on chain with multiple crypto native monetization mechanisms for both developers and creators DSO wants to usher in a new relationship with our social applications check them out at diesel.com and now on to the show thanks Nation I'm here with sriram Kanan from Eagan Lair and we are at Devcon Devcon number six which is also my first Defcon so I'm particularly excited about it serum are you having fun yeah this has been awesome thank you so much for having me on this thankless podcast yeah you your your project uh Eagen layer Eagan Lair eigen layer has come on my radar recently from a number of people that I consider very informed about this base and so I wanted to get you into the show uh and uh thank you for the infinite Garden document 18 for letting us use all of their equipment uh and to explore uh Eagan Lair what it's up to and why so many people are excited about it so let's start at the very beginning what is Eagan Lane eigenlayer is a mechanism that we have designed which allows the ethereum trust Network to be flexibly used to build general distributed systems so the way we think about it is just a little bit of background about myself I'm also an associate professor at the University of Washington Seattle where I run the UW blockchain research lab Joe Huskies go Huskies uh where over the many years we have actually uh worked on consensus protocols new distributed systems scalability one thing we saw which is amazing in the ethereum ecosystem is the amount of permissionless innovation that's available at the Smart contract layer anybody can come and deploy a new contract and they don't need to be trusted they're borrowing decentralized trusts from ethereum in fact when people talk about things like modular blockchain I think of ethereum as the first modular blockchain it modularized trust so that dapps can consume it I think which led to the whole pseudonymous economy you don't need as adapt Creator to be trusted the blockchain platform is trusted but this freedom of permissionless innovation does not extend all the way down into the stack if you want to build a bridge you want to build an oracle you want to build a data availability layer you need to go and find your own distributed Network to validate it and building a new distributed Network to validate your own particular thing is a whole set of other things and it is in some sense there is a large decentralized network with massive Economic Security and decentralization already existing the ethereum network and why not use that so that anybody can actually build new distributed systems on top so that's what eigen layers core mechanism is and the way we achieve it is by supplying the trust from the stakers stakers take to commit to producing ethereum blocks but they can also restake reuse the same stake to do other things for example I can make a credible commitment that I'm storing data I can make a credible commitment that I'm providing or Oracle inputs or a certain execution functionality and I'm putting my stake at risk the heat that is staked in the core platform address to do these other things so it is an extension protocol which extends the scope of what ethereum can do to so that there is permissionless innovation all the way down through the stack so the way that I understand this and I'm going to try and regurgitate this just to check my understanding is that we have this pool of ethereum stakers and they are doing a very good job securing ethereum but that doesn't scale out Beyond ethereum there are other things out there that we need to secure there are cross-trained bridges there are oracles that you know things like chain link uh but other oracles any sort of input anything that you want to be secure actually and so eigenlayer is commoditizing eth staking to make it more general purpose is that a fair way to describe it that is a great way to describe it if you go back to the core value proposition of blockchain it is decentralized trust right and you have this massive bowl of decentralized trust here that can be supplied through the ethereum protocol and we made it more flexible with the layer 2 era where you can build layer 2 Roll-Ups which can consume this decentralized trust by writing improves either validity or fraud Pros but we want to expand this even more we want to supply the ethereum trust from staking which is the root of trust to Applications far beyond the core conception if you look at any other you know blockchain protocol they will have other advantages for example maybe the finality time is smaller maybe there is some other advantage in or Mev management is better and what you can do is now start internalizing all of this Innovation and match it with the largest pool of decentralized trust that we have you can build a new chain on eigen layer you can build a new uh consensus protocol you can build data availability you can build Bridges you can build Mev management for ethereum L1 all online and this isn't this isn't something totally new we've seen other flavors like this in crypto's history uh we were talking about this and you're explaining this to me you used merge mining which is uh something that I used to once know very well but it's it's escaped me now because it was just like a different era it's a it's proof of work can you can you explain like merge mining what the general principle is and how eigenlayer is now like a kind of a new Evolution and and why it is new absolutely so merge mining is this principle of can I take the mass approval work underneath Bitcoin and then Supply it to New networks that want to bootstrap if you go back to kind of like already Satoshi made comments about we need we can actually do things like this but the the thing with merge mining is the economic incentives for merge mining are not well aligned why if for example even if you get 100 of the Bitcoin miners to run another chain if they in turned up attacking the chain they don't lose anything they definitely don't lose Bitcoin right they also don't lose their Bitcoin mining equipment so all they have at stake is very little when they're actually merge mining to provide services to some other new service so emerge mining you're a bunch of Bitcoin miners with a ton of hash power they already have the security layer that's doing a great job securing Bitcoin we can secure another blockchain by merge mining tapping into this pool of security that already exists so that this new blockchain can also become secure but what you're saying is that this doesn't actually work too well because it doesn't put anything at stake for these new for these miners because what they are really risking uh is really on the Bitcoin side if they are aligned to the Bitcoin Network they're not gonna they're just gonna burn their electricity that's a loss for them but that doesn't really extend to a minority proof a minority blockchain and so it's an interesting idea but in execution doesn't really hold up right that is exactly what we are saying and when you're uh merge mining a different chain you if you did anything bad on the Chain it definitely does not affect the Bitcoin to USD price which is the major sensitivity for a Bitcoin mining and so there is really nothing at stake in that merge mining so easy come easy go sure so you're doing is something for free and you're not really carrying anything from that right and so you don't you don't really have anything at risk right absolutely how uh so how is eigenlayer an evolution upon this what's absolutely so we just saw the merge and we're super happy ethereum did a great job right and with the merge what the what we realized is proof of stake uh trust is much more flexible and this goes to the root of why proof of stake is better is the ability to slash somebody when they are misbehaving sure so imagine there's a hundred billion dollar pool which is underwriting ethereum staking suppose you get only five percent of this to underwrite Security on your protocol what they do is they are actually taking their eat steak worth that 5 billion into your protocol what that means is now if they misbehave in your protocol and there is a concrete slashing contract for example if you double sign a block in your additional protocol they will just get slashed their Eid is getting slashed that this aligns perfectly the incentives so from the stakers Viewpoint they are taking additional risk the slashing risk in in return for additional yield which is by validating this other chain they may either get the new native token of the chain or the fees paid in that chain there is an economy around it and it aligns the positive and the negative incentives which is really what's staking dead is to expand the scope of incentive design from purely positive incentives to positive and negative incentives which is why the trust is more flexibly borrowed from uh ethereum after proof of stake rather than before proof of stake okay so once again I'm going to try and repeat this back just to make sure I understand and hopefully the listeners are following along uh merge mining didn't work because there wasn't really anything at risk here if you misbehaved on one chain you didn't really lose anything on your Bitcoin chain uh and so what what this is different with proof of stake is this this idea of slashing where what I think what eigenlayer is is a an additional commitment upon normal ethereum proof of stake saying hey I'm gonna I'm gonna behave with proof of stake ethereum because that's how the rules are but I'm also going to behave with this other network and I'm going to use my ether collateral as the collateral as the stake and so you are opting into additional slashing potential if you are relying on a different chain a different consensus mechanism a different thing an oracle Network whatever and so you as a Staker are opting into more responsibility and promising to not lie to an additional chain and it's the slashing that of proof of stake that is really the fundamental difference between merge mining of the Bitcoin world through the work world and the ethereum proof of stake world is this all right absolutely the fact that slashing is programmable and ethereum is a general purpose programmable chain in which right now we are seeing things like how do you do fraud proofs for general purpose execution engines so the slashing layer now has become extremely powerful both in terms of the trust that can be shared but also in terms of the level of programmability in the slashing that we can build so these two things converge into bringing something like eigen layer into reality and the just the raw incentive is that maybe I just want to like sign up for every single service possible I'll do an oracle I'll do another proof mistake blockchain and I'm just getting more and more rewards for everything I sign up for if I can like manage that as like a no operator yeah so the two things you are doing are your uh committing additional computational responsibilities we're also committing additional slashing risks and you calculate the marginal value of these two and if it is greater than the rewards that you're making out of that system yes please opt in so one thing we put a lot of thought into eigen layer is how do we make it lightweight how do we build services on top of eigen layer which do not tax the computational requirements of the heat shakers we're very much in alignment with the ethereum ethos of we need to have homesteakers solo stakers as well as you know other liquids taking pools so that a different category of people can participate in the staking ecosystem and so we've made our services to be uh run even by things like homesteakers at least some category of services which can be yield bearing even homesteakers can opt in and obtain receives yeah and I think one of the reasons why this project has really captured my attention lately especially as I've learned about it more is it really just it it fits some of the vision that we have for the crypto world and since we are once again using the infinite Gardens equipment I'll use the infinite Garden metaphor where if we have more trust then we can have we can grow more things and if we have more security across all these different layers of crypto first we can probably have fewer exploits which is which is good and we can create a garden where more and more trust comes about and what I mean by this is there's many new use cases that can now tap into ethereum's like Universe class level of trust and security because of proof of stake and now we can extend these things to new things so what are some of these new things what what are these things out in the world of crypto that need more trust that don't have it yup so if you look at one of the immediate things we are actually building ourselves we want this to be a platform where anybody can come and build but you have to bootstrap the platform so we're building the first service on top of eigenlayer we call it I eigen da is a data availability service run by its takers which can provide massive amounts of data availability throughput so that the roll-up era can come to fruition much earlier so our vision is that uh there is going to be a massive number of Roll-Ups which all can use the security from ethereum on top of it if we can supply massive data availability now these rollers write commitments use ethereum for censorship resistance use ethereum for settlement but use ethereum trust through eigenlayer to do massive data throughputs we're already talking about things like 15 megabytes per second throughput in our data availability layer one example of what we think you can build on eigen layer but there is a massive scope of other things that are coming up and we expect a lot of others to participate in it another category of products that can be built on our eigen layer is Mev management suppose you're a block proposer and you're participating in say Mev boost so one thing you're unable to do today is you cannot make credible commitments outside of what is the scope of ethereum so the way Mev boost works is is it show horns itself into the one slashing condition that you have which is if you double sign a header you can be penalized so the Builder sends you a header that you sign off and you have no agency to add anything new on top of it instead if you were restaked you could opt into eigen layer and you could say hey I will include everything that the Builder sends me but there is always some extra space in the block because of 1559 because if all blocks are full all the time then the price explodes so there's always extra space you can exert your proposer agency and include new transactions on top of the Builder's block thus contributing to increasing the censorship resistance of ethereum one example of what you can do on eigen layer you can start doing many other Mev management things for example you know you talk a lot a lot about D5 and one of the things that you can start doing is things like uh block proposals commit to doing collateral liquidations or refueling or taking Atomic Arbitrage and pass it back to the unit Swap and Sushi swap pools you can start building very interesting services on top of eigen layer because the blog proposes are state right they have authority over what can be written into the block they can even commit to things like threshold encryption and when you send me like an encrypted transaction I sign off that I'm going to include this and I have to include the decrypted transaction for this so there are a variety of things in the Mev space but beyond that you can think of bridges you can run like client Bridges off chain you can think of running new consensus protocols one of the things that we don't have in ethereum is fast finality yet right and other protocols competing saying that hey I'm going to give you one second finality somebody can come and build a kind of a consensus protocol on eigen layer on which roll ups can settle at like one second latency because you have a massive Economic Security underwriting the finality of this chain so these are examples of what you can build on ilm and I think the gist here is a lot of these applications whether it's another data availability layer D5 apps Mev all of these things if you add more trust to these things they become more expressive uh they can do more things because as we've commoditized trust in a new way and allowed that trust to work its way into parts of you know the ethereum protocol at the layer one the defy apps and bridges and oracles if we have trust we can have expressivity in our applications uh and and if I really want to take this into like uh some cerebral stuff when there's a lot of trust there's a lot of culture uh and so with with trust we can actually become the best versions of ourselves and that is also true for like Mev that's also true for defy apps they become with more trust they can become the best versions of themselves so that's what gets me really really excited about this thing um I want to go back to the data availability layer really quick uh with uh Deng sharding I think we get something like 1.3 megabytes a second of throughput at the ethereum base layer which is massively increased Beyond like the kilobytes of data a second that we currently have but 1.3 megabytes a second still is like slow how many how much data throughput could we get with a eigenlayer data availability data availability layer and what can be unlocked without so firstly we are building on the shoulders of giants we are actually just taking dunk starting's core cryptographic architecture and just building and Engineering around it and the degrees of freedom you have when you're innovating at an agile layer built on top of a protocol is very different from the degrees of freedom you have at the core protocol there are various sets of constraints as well as various sets of guarantees which are stronger in the core protocol so what we can do is we can start taking up these core Innovations and build engineering around it for example our estimates say that you can get gigabytes per second of like throughput on on the same ethereum data layer by basically using the ideas from dark sharing as well as building an engineering layer around it the fact that this layer does not have to run a whole consensus protocol and is not intermingled with it and has degrees of freedom like nodes participating in it can have different feed Dynamics different uh exposure of IP addresses all these different engineering freedoms we can exploit all of it in actually building very high performance data availability layers where each node does not need to have one gigabytes per second that's not what we're implying we do not want to go the Solana route where each node needs to take a lot of bandwidth the way we think about scaling is the net throughput of the system divided by the node requirements and if we can maximize that that's our and I think it's entirely possible and this is already behind the vision of Don crowd and Justin and vitalik in designing things like dunk shouting is that data availability is the one thing we know how to provision scalably and so data availability is provisioned scalably and then people can write execution proofs through the system so that's the same vision we share and I think something that bankless listeners should really pay attention to and take note of is that we have with tank sharding with the beacon chain we're going to have 1.3 megabytes a second of data throughput sweet that's like a huge huge Improvement uh with this uh eigenlayer idea we can get to 1.3 gigabytes a second is that is that the number that is that is a few year ago we are already at 15 megabytes per second today right okay yeah but we will get to you know uh 100 to a thousand X of this right yeah but also dank charting is also like two years out as well yeah so many things are two years out in this industry but the the point I want to drive home is that there's not an additional security mechanism producing that 1.3 gigabytes a second of data this is not like Celestia with a new blockchain and new security mechanism this is the ethereum stakers that are helping secure this this 1.3 gigabytes a second of data and that means that this is something like really close to the metal of what ethereum actually is these are the theorem shakers doing this uh securing this ethereum data uh and so it's a little bit like like rocket pool for example where like it is inside of the ethereum app layer helping secure ethereum as a as a uh staking as a service system and so it's an app that is about the protocol and so there's fewer external dependencies making it something like really really ethereum native and when we have like fewer external dependencies that's probably how you can get 1.3 data gigabytes of data a second uh and I'll again remind listeners that 1.3 gigabytes of data a second is that much data of expressivity of us doing cool things in crypto that is all trustless in this trustless world that we want to uh want to build out uh serem this is this has been an awesome exploration into into eigenlayer where are you in the developmental roadmap like what's coming up next and How might people want to get involved yep so right now we are at a phase where we are on internal devnets where we are actually having all of these protocols run we will be on a public test net in like the next three months three to four months and like another uh three to four months after hopefully we'll hit Mainland so we have this uh timeline and the way you can participate with us is if you're a Staker you can come and like talk to us on how you can actually engage in additional productive yield if you are a builder there is a whole bunch of cool stuff you can build on top of eigen layer if you want to build a roll up and want to consume massive data bandwidth you want to build you know new VMS that can actually be very very expressive or use evm in a very parallelized manner all of these things you can come and build on top of eigen ta if you're a Community member uh we will start engagement forums where we can kind of brainstorm on ideas for how to take this forward and uh beautiful welcome thank you so much for joining me today thank you so much David this is really awesome cheers [Music] foreign [Music]
