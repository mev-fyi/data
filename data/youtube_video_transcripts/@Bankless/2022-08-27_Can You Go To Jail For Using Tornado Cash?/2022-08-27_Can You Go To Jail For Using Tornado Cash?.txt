if a u.s citizen uses tornado cash right now what are the penalties if you intentionally transact with the tornado cash address which has been sanctioned it's a crime and it's punishable by fines and imprisonment but i do not think that a law-abiding u.s citizen who mistakenly transacted with tornado cash after it was sanctioned is actually very likely to go to prison but this is a strict liability offense from on the civil side and if you do it intentionally it is a crime as a matter of law what you just said is if i were to go use tornado cash tomorrow i could be thrown in jail for that that feels authoritarian af i understand why all of crypto why all of us and i hope you listener understand why we're talking about this so much is because it feels dystopian it feels scary
