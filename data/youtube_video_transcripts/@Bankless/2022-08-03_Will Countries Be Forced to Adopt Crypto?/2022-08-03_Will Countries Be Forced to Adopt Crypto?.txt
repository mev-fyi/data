the government is going to not allow this they are going to regulate this thing that you're trying to do out of existence this worry from people in the space about crypto has been present with crypto and bitcoin since the early beginnings and yet bitcoin is still legal here as a country you'll be slowly forced to embrace crypto for game theory reasons because you can't let europe if you're the us have the advantage or if you're china you can't let the u.s have an advantage you can't let emerging markets leap frog you this has always been my hopeful response when people say no the the government's gonna regulate the stuff you're trying to do out of existence the response has always been no the game theory won't let them because this technology is so productive so useful that they'll they'll be forced to adopt it in the same way that countries were forced to adopt the internet what do you think of this argument i think there's definitely some merit to it i think it applies more to smaller countries that have sort of more to gain than to lose and i think it's not really like unexpected that we see sort of these smaller countries making moves on crypto regulation and also buying crypto
