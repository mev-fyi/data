BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is hitting the mainstream media circuit and he's pumping Bitcoin bankless Nation Happy First Friday of July it is time for the bankless weekly roll up this is a a first of its kind David is out this week he is going climbing up mountains I think he's got three mountains over the next uh 10 to 15 days he's gonna climb so I am here with Anthony sassano and we are taking the role up to you this week Anthony this is the first time you and I have done this uh so I don't know what's gonna happen but I'm pretty excited mm-hmm yeah me too me too thanks for having me on again but yeah I've only ever done these with David so uh definitely excited to do one of these with you finally so um last week was of course the Fourth of July in the US so a lot of people um head off took a holiday is there like a an equivalency in Australia is there like a you know Independence Day equivalency or how did this work work out in Australia you didn't have to rebel against uh the Brits did you no no I mean technically we're still a colony uh or which is funny we tried to become Republic ages ago but it didn't happen um so uh we have like Royal ascent and things still like that it's just it's kind of weird but uh we have Australia day which is like in January late January but I don't think it's on the actual day like that we got our independence and as I said technically we're not actually like fully independent um but but yeah like people do do barbecues because it's summer in January here and things like that it's definitely something that people celebrate but it's not to the extent that Americans do it you guys are crazy around July 4th yeah America goes crazy I I grew up in Canada actually and so there's um there's a Canada Day on the first of July and it's much more muted than when you come to the US I didn't even hear about it on Twitter or anything sorry yeah I know there you go much more anyway we got some hot topics of the week a lot of things to discuss this week the first on my mind Anthony is uh Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock he's suddenly become a Bitcoin stand all right versus five years ago when he seemed to hate us we're going to talk about that I also want to talk to you about nft prices nfts are down real bad there's some tweets that kind of show this but we can also look at the the price charts I want to add get your take on it can they recover is the question today uh there was a rumor that Gary Gensler was resigning is that all fake news what's going on there uh Cameron Winklevoss sent a final letter to Barry silbert this is the final final letter I think Anthony asking for his money like you better give me my money Barry both bad things are gonna happen we'll talk about that and last lastly of course the building season continues particularly I think Layer Two Season coinbase layer 2 the base launch there's some news on that we're also going to talk about polygon V2 the upgrades there and a question I want to post to you Anthony will Solana become a layer two actually Anatoly of Solana uh answered that question I want to get your perspective on it so you ready for all that yeah let's get into it alright well before we begin uh bankless Nation I also want to mention ethcc this is a a conference that is upcoming in July actually if you have a ticket to that there will be a bankless event if you are a citizen make sure you check that out that's on Tuesday July 18th it's called bonjour bankless uh we are hitting Paris with the bankless nation David's going to be there a whole bunch of people from the bankless nation are going to be there so make sure you check that out this event was sponsored by our friends at Sega so go check that out um they have a yield product as well and then also I wanted to bring your attention to if you can't make CC of course the big event to go to is permissionless the second permissionless conference we've ever hosted this is happening in Austin Texas September 11th through the 13th this is the conference to go to I'm going to this one uh it's fantastic whether you are a builder a defy Aficionado a crypto native of any type this is the conference to go to we've got a fantastic list of speakers uh people like Eric Voorhees people like Hester purse people like Tom emmer all sorts of folks that you've heard on the podcast coming live in person so there'll be a link in the show notes and you can get your ticket that way um all right Anthony let's talk markets we got to start with our friend over there we still start with Bitcoin on bankless Anthony you probably don't on The Daily you're like you know like starting with eth but I've got to talk about Bitcoin current price right now as of the time of recording is a 30 000 898 dollars of course this will be very different by the time you listen to it we are up about 2.4 percent on the week what do you think of this Bitcoin chart just in general if we kind of uh zoom out a little bit Anthony how does uh how does this chart look to you it looks like there's a new narrative in play right now which we all know is kind of the ETF hype right it looks like the market finally had a reason to go up and finally something that people could latch onto and that has continued to I guess play out especially with comments from Larry Fink this week which we're going to cover of course um and I think people have just latched on to that and especially traders who love the volatility right and whenever there's a new narrative around they love to kind of cause volatility in the markets and play on that in order to to make money so I I definitely think that's reflecting that but also I mean there was um news a few days ago that sailor bought like another what 250 300 million dollars worth of BTC he did so that definitely played a part in it as well um but yeah I mean it it it's kind of the the chart still looks neutral to me I don't know I I kind of feel like there's we can kind of point to the reasons why it's bullish and ironically that's sometimes bearish for me because it means that everyone knows the reasons why it's going up so they're like trying to play you know the markets and things like that so I I don't know I'm still very kind of neutral uh right now on on the whole crypto Market but I do think it shows early signs of uh of uh of a bull market potentially forming early signs of a bull market but you are are still feeling neutral about it is this kind of this trap is this a Traders playing Trader games like it feels like from what you're saying and I guess my own feeling reflection on it is we haven't seen a new set of buyers right so I'd say you just mentioned it's old Michael Saylor dollar cost averaging in of course that's what he's been doing for the last uh two years um it's Traders maybe playing this ETF narrative game and by the way we'll get to it later in the episode but there was news that Gary Gensler resigned right like this week and that hit uh Twitter and you kind of wonder whether that was planned by someone or not to to make some money on some of this volatility some of this trading activity but is it the case in your mind that until we get net new buyers Bitcoin is kind of just going to be like this crap Market side to side up down that kind of thing yeah I mean I think so I think obviously you need net new money coming in for the price to go up like you can't have the pro I mean the price isn't really going to go up too much if it's just the same money sloshing around uh it's kind of like professional poker if everyone's if everyone's as good as each other not many people are going to be able to make much money so you need you need the noobs to make money from right like that's it's it's it's the same in I think every Market is where you like the more experienced people do better than less experienced people um but the less experienced people the ones that bring in the you know the fresh money and they're buying discriminately but generally yeah I mean if you look at the shorter time frames it's always just going to look very choppy right um you're in the kind of like our chart here I'm looking over the the past couple of weeks is pretty choppy but as I said I think that the the market um definitely is running on a narrative right now and if that narrative runs out of of steam it might sell down again because it was just Traders playing that narrative uh but then you know eventually it'll start going back up because of those net new buyers but yeah I'm not seeing any signs of like a huge influx of new money right now maybe here in there's a little bit but yeah I'm definitely not seeing like people coming in in in mass and being like I'm gonna buy everything right I'm going to buy Bitcoin I'm going to buy Ethan and buy all these other stuff that hasn't happened yet okay uh let's talk about eth I'm guessing it tells a similar story we are at the time of recording at uh 1919 that's up 4.8 on the week so a bit higher than bitcoin's 2.4 percent um does this chart tell a similar story Anthony is um eth just basically trading like like Bitcoin and kind of this crab market territory I think so I think uh it's just following Bitcoin on the USD pair um on 8th BTC it the 8th birthday says tells the real story where it's come down from like 0.07 and went down to almost 0.06 based on the the ETF stuff which is obviously more positive for Bitcoin from a narrative point of view than it is for for eighth even if you believe eighth is going to get an ETF it doesn't matter because then they're already obviously set into the round Bitcoin um but I think you know BTC has been stuck in this range for a long time like .06.07 um which you know it's it's it's quite an annoying range but I don't think anyone trades it I think what they trade is BTC and eth and you just ref you can see the different narratives reflected in the hbtc ratio um and the different kind of like Trader mindsets reflected in it as well so Anthony we were talking um prior to the recording and and you said something interesting you said that um you believe actually the bull market maybe began a month ago and now it's just a matter of getting the world to realize that and getting the world to kind of wake up to that uh what did you what do you what did you mean by that so I mean I mentioned before that I'm I'm mutual and I still am Mutual for probably the rest of of this year but bull markets can begin without you realizing that they've begun until like 12 months down the line be like well okay that's when the bull market began right um and I think this this has happened every cycle within crypto and the reason I think it I mean there's a few different reasons there's a big reason is is gut feel after being in the ecosystem for a very long time you tend to have a gut feel about these things and my gut has actually been pretty good over the last few years especially for both timing kind of tops and bottoms of the market um but obviously I'm not perfect I'm not going to get everything right but a major reason why I I um I thought this over the last maybe a few weeks is the ETF stuff I think that there has definitely been a big kind of like win change and I discussed this a little bit with David on the last roll up I did with him but there's been a win change where it's it's kind of like okay well you know these tradful institutions they're not only saying that they're going to get involved with crypto they're directly making actions and it's not just anyone right it's BlackRock whicheveras Everyone Knows by now is the largest asset manager in the world so when you have those kind of things happening and prices has actually been relatively muted I think as well you can kind of say okay well you know in 12 months we're probably going to look back on this and think okay that's when the bull market kind of started that's when the early early signs were yes it took a while for the market to become convinced and yes the price still kind of crabbed around went sideways chopped around um but I think that you can you know revisit in in 12 months or something like that and look back on on it but you know and that's why I think it's so hard for people to pick it because a bull market can start and the price can still go down I know that's a it's a funny thing to say but it's all about kind of timing it and if the prices just range bound um and the bull market actually did begin but buying in that and buying in that range was actually positive you know six 12 months down the line because the bull market had began I had begun sorry um I think that is uh is the way you'd play it um and you know it's not me saying that in the next couple months Bitcoin or ether going back to all-time high I don't think so um but I do think that we're in the convince the market that it's not a bear Market any phase anymore well I think one of the things that could convince the market is is you know um the even The Narrative of the ETF getting approved if an ETF gets approved that will prove to everyone else that we've sort of hit a a bottom on a regulatory flood right basically I mean I think part of the story of 2023 is like seems like the US is out to get crypto right and if we have major financial institutions like Fidelity like BlackRock that have an ETF approved you can no longer support that narrative right it looks a bit more nuanced it looks a bit more mixed yes maybe um us Regulators will be hard in crypto in some areas but they're clearly not going to like ban the asset class and that is sort of the the worst of the flood that we feel so I think it has that effect as well but what do you do in these types of like crab markets do you trade at all like do you trade kind of uh on the weekly or are you just uh you know stacking the no I don't I don't trade I I definitely don't trade I I funny enough I do more trading in Bull markets where where I kind of see an opportunity to rotate out of things into other things um and you know I do that over longer time frames I never do day trading or week by week but let's say I've held an investment for a while and it's gone up a lot but eth hasn't gone up a lot yet right I think to myself well okay I better take these profits and then take them into eath rather than going um to cash so I do a little bit of that in Bull markets and it's worked well for me historically but uh generally no I I don't trade I definitely do not trade the daily or weekly um and what I was talking about before about my gut feeling that's like on a year time scale that's definitely not like a short-term thing that's a long-term thing where I have to basically pay attention for a long time and then eventually my gut will start saying hey hey it's you know it's a bear Market or hey it's a bull market and then I listen to it and it usually goes all right but maybe maybe I'm wrong you know maybe the bull market doesn't start for another couple years or something I I don't know but that's just kind of my gut feel based on you know based on various things that have happened over the past few months especially and Regulatory stuff is actually very important I've maintained for a long time that I I never thought that the US was actually trying to kill crypto and I've maintained that I feel like a lot of what Gary Gensler has done has just been for personal benefit I don't think he actually hates crypto I think he just knows that crypto was an easy target to get nice headlines for himself um and I think that's actually been the case because you don't have Larry fink a huge Democrat backer by the way um being positive on crypto while Gary Gensler a Democrat appointed SEC chairman being negative on it who's going to win in that world who do you think is going to win it's the guy with the money right yeah I think um I think Larry Fink is uh more of a puppeteer of the of the politics than than Gary Gensler um but okay so let's um let's talk about another chart here which and I I was actually shocked to to see this because I don't typically look at um stocks very much Anthony so um do you know the NASDAQ is like 10 off its all-time highs like that's crazy so NASDAQ uh fifth over 15 000 this week um what's your take on that generally we're back to kind of like the the stimulus check like covid highs almost is this unexpected or what's your take yeah I mean I'm I'm definitely not an expert on like the stock market and I don't really spend much time looking at it but I I've kind of maintained a position for a while that because the economy um most of the economies are the stock market is so closely kind of intertwined with retirement accounts and money just keeps going into retirement accounts obviously um I feel like the stock market can't actually go down for very long because because you have that kind of buyer there that always buyer of the of the retirement accounts that are that are ready to buy whenever and if you look at the stocks sorry if you look at the indexes as well it can be a little bit misleading because for example not the NASDAQ but the S P 500 there's like 10 stocks in that that account for most of the the market share and those are the the strongest stocks like apple and Amazon things like that right so they can skew the data but if you actually look at a lot of the individual stocks especially the ones that were really popular during 2021 and 2020 uh you know the covert boom sort of thing that happened there a lot of them are down as much as some crypto coins are down like 90 plus percent uh because they were just completely overvalued they went through the same thing that the crypto Market did but in terms of of things like strong companies like apple and stuff like that you know of course they're gonna you're gonna go back up there's a bid there for that right people you know apple is not a not a super speculative stock like uh like like an early stage kind of tech company that just ipo'd or something so yeah there's a lot of that going on but I think a huge yeah a huge um portion of buying for these things comes from our retirement accounts and there's trillions of dollars in that obviously you know BlackRock is a one money manager of those kind of things and so is you know there's a bunch of others out there so that that's my general take on it uh but then you have the other side of it where a lot of the macro pundits are saying you know this is a dead cat bounce we're going back down because of all this all this economic data here you know things are going to blow up the inflation is going to come back you know roaring back and the fed's going to have to raise rates to such and such I don't know honestly I don't listen to those people because I just don't have enough insight into these things to know who to believe but at the same time I try to avoid people who just think in binaries like it's a lot of doomerism out there still for some reason but yeah it is what it is yeah it's uh very interesting that if you listen to kind of macro pundits even kind of the inflation the story of inflation right a lot of macro folks thought that inflation would be even a bit more persistent right now and here we are down to four percent and you can kind of look at uh maybe maybe the five-year chart here is uh we definitely took a pop-up to close to 10 percent and now we're back down to four percent and so there's sort of this macro debate we had uh Raul Paula on the podcast earlier this week and he's a big believer in actually deflation like he doesn't think we're going to see an inflationary decade he doesn't think the demographics point that way um he doesn't think that uh you know like technology will be a deflationary force and that will overcome some of the the inflationary forces here so this this um I guess there's these two camps that that try to push either inflation or deflation I think your perspective has always been hey it doesn't matter like don't worry about macro so much like just regardless of inflation or deflation we know that the government is going to continue to print money and we know that we're in for a decade of Fiat debasement where we have zero percent or negative real returns most likely negative real Returns on bonds and in that climate you want a non-state asset of some type you want an ether in your portfolio is that kind of still your take it's just like ignore the macro noise do you really you you take that into account at all when you're when you're thinking about uh when to buy and how to invest in this space yeah definitely I I don't think I've ever actually looked at macro kind of things and applied them to crypto and use them as a way to you know trade within crypto buy or sell things um you know if you the on the inflation chart if you look at where it peaked it peaked around June I think of last year which was the eighth bottom I did not buy eighth because I thought inflation let me tell you that much I bought it there because I again that gut feeling I had um based on a number of different factors like I saw 3ac puking up all of their eat because they had all these debts they had to pay I saw these you know the amount of fear in the market I saw that so much heat getting yeah exactly I saw it getting oversold and I not once looked at inflation and was like oh wow inflation's like nearly 10 still maybe it's not a good time to buy it no I didn't look at that at all so I I generally maintain that crypto is largely kind of outside of the scope of of the macro environment um at least for now just because it's still relatively small and it's still got a lot of growth ahead of it definitely and and as you said like it is non kind of like state-backed money for for things like BTC and eighth which is even more I guess like powerful now where a whole new generation is working up to the fact that the the economy generally is in very delicate balance and at any time it can get thrown out of bounds to any extreme degree and if you want to protect your wealth if you want to make sure that you know one year you uh and you have you know such and such amount of money and the next gr you actually have the same purchasing power at least the same purchasing power right even though all your bills have gone up you're not going to get that from Fear Fiat is literally designed not to give you that that's why everyone invests their money that's why you're encouraged to invest your money that's why retirement accounts don't just hold fit right they invest the money um so yeah I think the whole New Generation Um probably Generation Z to be honest they're just coming a lot of them have come into adulthood recently and have got coming to money obviously from working jobs full-time jobs things like that they've they've been kind of crypto pilled I think over the last couple years for sure yeah certainly um it did not what what you choose to denominate what you choose to store your wealth in is actually a much more difficult decision these days and that's why Anthony keeps stacking away um it's a good move you know another uh really interesting chart this week was the coinbase chart so coined the asset um a big move uh like over the past couple of weeks a big move up for coinbase so it's almost at its highs from April do you think coinbase as an exchange as an asset has been underrated maybe was punched in the face too hard by all of this regulatory flood and you know it prices are being restored to balance or what's your take on coin the asset I remember uh I think near the bottom I gave a take on it when I did a roll-up with with David I think it yeah it was probably towards the end of last year and I I said that I was not bearish on Queen but I felt like if you were betting on coin you may as well just buy ethyl BTC um especially eight uh but at the same time like coins performance has been I think around the same as eth um Maybe not maybe if you factor in staked you maybe inch out a little bit more um but I was talking more like long long term I wasn't talking you know six months or something I was talking on on you know the next few years or something like that that was my general take on on you know whether you were to buy coin or eth or something but generally yeah I felt like because coinbase is so classic closely tied to crypto and and crypto kind of markets because most of their revenue comes from Trading volumes it would act the same way as as kind of the crypto Market I would go down with all of crypto it would go up with crypto I think that's that's played out here as well um but also coinbase was that named as the the partner in a lot of these ETF filings so that's been a positive uh kind of thing for them they obviously got sold down pretty brutally along with the rest of crypto there uh so yeah I feel like they're probably poised to do very well uh they're the biggest us-based exchange yes they're being sued by the SSC but honestly they're either going to win that lawsuit or it's going to be some settlement that that is in coinbase's favor or the SEC is going to withdraw it I don't foresee a future where they lose that but I also don't think the market cares because the market knows that that lawsuit is going to be going on for years so even if coinbase for some reason loses that's still like you know many years down the line so the I think the market looks at this and like okay if the crypto markets are going to get hot again coinbase is the biggest company in the US they have the blessing of all these big Trad fire institutions you know coins probably a good bet here yeah it's also um increasingly hard to start a crypto exchange right like you gotta look at who are the competitors to to coinbase and Kraken in these types of exchanges and I mean I uh look at a lot of startups as do you haven't seen anybody trying to start a new crypto exchange from from um from scratch the last person you try to do that was SPF and look where that ended up um this is also a high contrast week from uh the perspective of nfts versus D5 so nfts were a down bad we've got beans down 69 azuki 58 Moon Birds 24 Port Apes uh down uh 23 and relative to D5 tokens so compost up 80 Pendle 66 make your 32 percent uh DPI which is a defy index up 12.6 now some of these are just probably picking assets to to prove a point this is only the seven day performance that said um maybe this is a sign of some sort of decoupling I mean I mean nfts have been on a tear have probably over performed defy in a lot of ways at least during the the last um Bull Run uh is this defy coming back what's your take overall on D5 tokens yeah I mean it's kind of hard because there's so many of them right and you can pick out any bunch of them um and you know maybe they have good performance over seven days for just no reason at all maybe they just went up because speculators were speculating so I agree with you seven days is probably too short of a period to draw any kind of conclusive narratives from but if you look at the assets listed here like Compton and mkr right maybe it's going up because people are betting on the fact that the Trad five people are coming and they know how to invest properly they know how to look at price to sales ratios and they're going to buy the the bags that actually have kind of metrics behind them they're not going to buy things for speculation's sake and that's a fine thesis to have but at the same time I think that's more of a narrative than reality because I don't foresee these tradful institutions buying random D5 tokens or just defy tokens generally for for a little while still uh not in any kind of size even and I don't expect like a comp or mkr to get like an ETF anytime soon right so I I feel like people are just betting on and speak circulating on on that side of things with nfts honestly I'm not like an expert on nfts but from everything that I've seen over the over the past few weeks I think the common sentiment is that people finally work up to the fact that a lot of these nft projects have no intention of ever actually driving value to the nfts themselves they have no intention of building a community or an ecosystem they took the money and they're just keeping the project alive to make it look like it's not a rug right that's my general opinion on a lot of these nft projects actually Anthony is cynical on nfts we got more uh stuff around nfts to talk about including is this an nft winter is there a way out of this pain is there going to be utility in the nft market also going to talk about um the SEC and these Bitcoin ETFs Larry Fink CEO of BlackRock came out very strongly he's on a mainstream media tour talking good things about Bitcoin uh and we'll get to the Cameron Winklevoss letter to Barry silbert as

like nft winter has come maybe it's been a long time building but this week certainly confirmed it to me this is a tweet from a Wall Street bets meme account someone purchased this board ape nft in October 2021 for 3.4 million dollars today the highest bid is 57 000 from 3.4 million to fifty seven thousand um apparently this was purchased in a Sotheby's auction as well so this wasn't just kind of like a wash trade type purchase at least it doesn't appear to be uh the meme account continues to go on the buyer could have purchased this 120 foot yacht instead uh instead they have a picture of a monkey or instead of purchasing a monkey picture for 3.4 million the buyer could have owned this Mega Mansion compound just really rubbing it in and this is the nft price floor so um a lot of pain in the board ape Community crypto punks are still kind of faring okay um azuki's down to kind of number eight um we can look at some of these things in terms of each denomination which is you know how I think both of us like to look at this and so like board ape has at its peak uh floor price was 128 eth for a an ape announced down to 30. so when you look at not just dollar denominated but each denominated drops we uh we have kind of a disturbing picture here so maybe just continuing your your thought um from from the last so you think this is basically the market waking up and realizing that all I have is a dumb monkey picture is that is that kind of it or is that too cynical of a take what do you think Anthony yeah I mean I think as I was saying that illusion that had been kind of prevalent with these projects that that were actually building out ecosystems that were going to drive value to these nfts in some way whether it be through creating like a video game or some kind of community thing or some kind of social thing um I I feel like with the azuki mint that illusion was completely shattered because zuki's is one of the you know biggest nft projects they've raised a lot of money and they came out with this new collection that literally as you said it was a derivative and it it barely changed anything right and people couldn't even tell the difference between the nfts so I think that triggered a massive sell-off where people were like people finally waking up and panicking and being like Oh my God if this is what they're going to do then one of my azuki is actually worth like if this is the best they can come up with even though they have all this money um you know this is this is really bad so and I think that sentiment just kind of played out very quickly across the whole kind of nft community and also uh it's a lot more efficient to trade nfts these days because of marketplaces like blur whereas in the past we didn't have these marketplaces so the price Discovery was actually less efficient but people were blaming blur saying oh it's blur's fault the nft prices dropped it's like well on the flip side you could blame the fact that there wasn't an efficient market around before for these nft prices going up so much because it wasn't real it wasn't like uh I wouldn't say real price Discovery but maybe it wasn't the most efficient price Discovery and now that you have more efficient price Discovery you can actually see the True Value reflector of these things right um so yeah that's my general take I'm not an expert on nfts I don't know what these things are going to do whether they're going to go up or down from here I do subscribe to um the fact that most of these projects especially the pfp ones are just going to act like every project in crypto uh or most projects in crypto they're just gonna like go down only a lot of the time um and they're not going to outperform either the long run so yeah that's my general take but as for specific nft projects I I don't pay enough attention to know which ones are going to do well and which ones aren't so I refrain from kind of making those kind of comments do you know I I want to ask you kind of a meta question here Anthony because I know you are a collector of uh real life things of real life uh you know action figures all sorts of different collections even I'm looking kind of behind you and I see all sorts of different things in your room that you've collected so that has appealed to you and you are also a crypto native um but the nft thing hasn't really stuck to you why is that why hasn't there been an nft that appeals to Anthony sassano yet so generally I like like physical Collectibles a lot more than than digital stuff even though I spend so much time in the digital realm I don't get the same connection to digital Collectibles as I do physical Collectibles and it's not just because they're they're physical and it's kind of a different a different thing it's more that like I like putting things on display and having them around me and kind of having like leave my my office right now uh you know I've got all these figurines around me have my collectibles around me it's kind of like a Vibe right I don't know how to describe it it's like a Vibe it's like a comfy place for me to be it's my safe space and I like that sort of stuff whereas with digital Collectibles I never had that feeling because a lot of these things there's no like in-game world you can go to to and like put on your crypto punk as your face and yeah you can't create a Vibe it's more of a social studies game wouldn't you say yeah exactly and I I don't care for those games at all I wouldn't be hiding all this figurine stuff in my room I I'd be I'd be opening up like a showroom for it or something but I I actually don't care about that stuff so yeah it's partly because of that the social status games don't really appeal to me um but also yeah the fact that a lot of these things are art as well like the most valuable like pieces not the pfps but the other things that are I'm just not someone who uh is kind of partial to traditional style art or kind of like Contemporary Art I'm more partial to Art and as an as kind of like um things like you know a lot of my figurines are from anime a lot of my other Collectibles are from things that maybe I grew up with and stuff like that like like video games so I'm all partial to that stuff but I understand why people like the nfts they make it their like the pfps they make their their identity but that could also be very bad because you're speculating on these things and there's a market for them whereas my figurines there's no market for it it's like eBay but like I don't check the prices every day so I'm not crying over already if it goes down and in value purist then you're actually doing it because you enjoy the um the vibe of it the feel of it um you're not doing it to play kind of status games I feel like that's much different than at least this version of nfts and crypto where you it's just board ape you're joining a club you're joining a group that can Flex on others because they spit and spent three million dollars on a monkey JPEG and they could put it as their Twitter profile it felt it has always felt to me much more like a you know Rolex type of you know social status game only in the digital realm than what you're doing here here are some takes from folks in the nft community lopify I've changed my position on most nft projects I'm infinitely bearish on 99 of ones that exist today unless things change I'm not talking about random new ones I'm talking about the top established ones the speculation isn't even around a future project a product no one even knows what is being built for most and if they do the value accrual towards the nft isn't clear on the our collectible side there are still some collections that I think remain pure punks Auto glyphs fidenzas ringers I'm not sure how long this extended bear lasts but this week certainly marks the next stage they go on our nfts done no that's a silly statement but if the bull market resumes it doesn't mean any existing projects have to pump that is another realization that I think has been reflected in the product which is nfts as a superclass may be very successful it doesn't have to mean the last generation of nfts will be the ones that pump I mean some could remain but this um this Twitter account lotify is saying 99 of the ones that exist today will probably go to zero it sounds a lot like icos it sounds a lot like uh you know 2017 2018 Avatar continues a thought that is related nfts are this Cycle's altcoins we are seeing liquidity flee and rotate out as the excess comes to an end just as with the icos the adiq belief is actually right just too early ethereum Solano layer 2's Define stable coins all came out of the excess of the Ico boom it just took a few more years some Marquee nft projects will survive this cycle a few new projects will learn the lessons from the Cycle's excesses and invest in real user value goes on humans need to socially signal to each other luxury goods Collectibles video games more applications will run on nfts in a decade the world's richest man sells physical nfts after all uh who are we talking about there are we talking about Elon this is the world's richest man sells physical yeah I'm not sure anyway this idea that nfts are this Cycle's altcoins what do you think about that yeah I mean I I think I said it before where I said like it's the same as any projects within crypto like most of them are going to fail or go to zero right um and I think that's true for the nft market as well but the Mt stuff is a little bit different or the entity ecosystem is a little bit different because it has the art side of it and I think when it comes to Art it doesn't actually have to do anything art doesn't have to have a road map it doesn't have to have like a future value accrual plan or a team behind it all that art does good art does is need to exist and evoke emotions for people or um you know uh be nice to look at for people or whatever people find valuable or the social signalings things like that right and that's actually why I think punks have held up you know relatively well to other nfts is because there's no roadmap for punks right punks don't exist too expectations exactly it's literally this is what you get right you get like a JPEG and it's a pixelated JPEG and it's a kind of pure nft collection because it came out like it wasn't the first but it came out in like 2017 where nfts weren't really a thing except like crypto crypto kitties I guess um and it is a social status symbol too because they're still relatively expensive um you can basically imprint yourself on it because a lot of these things look different and you can find one that looks sort of similar to you you can use it as a profile picture things like that but yeah and it's the OG right so it has OG status but I think the number one reason it's still so valuable and relative to others and it's done so well is because of the fact that there's no expectations here no one's expecting crypto punks to be more than just crypto punks well let's move on from nfts for now so uh Anthony some other big news out of this week um BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is hitting the mainstream media circuit and he's pumping Bitcoin here here he is in a clip on Fox Business I'm gonna play this the role of crypto is um it is it is it's digitizing gold in many ways it's a it's a instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation a hedge against the the onerous problems of any one country or or the or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you're in let's be clear Bitcoin is an international asset it's not based on any one currency and so it it can represent a asset that people can play as an alternative I would call the the foundation of BlackRock is about hope you invest for retirement because you believe tomorrow is better than today there you go the foundation of BlackRock is about hope I love that line um Larry Fink so remember BlackRock of course is a an asset manager with over 8.5 trillion dollars in assets this is where I think the baby boomer generation really uh has its money and Larry Fink is one of the most influential people on Wall Street for that reason and here he is doing a mainstream media circuit he's talking about the the virtues the value of cryptocurrency being a non-state store of value and non One Sovereign money system very interesting as well when you contrast that to uh what he was saying in 2017 this is Chris K pointing that out in 2017 Larry Fink the same guy we just heard from Anthony called Bitcoin an index of money laundering all right that was I guess five six short years ago it went from an index of of money laundering to this beautiful non-state store of value to protect us from government Supply inflation what do you think is going on here Anthony so he wasn't the only one uh that said stuff like this um like obviously Jamie Diamond's pretty pop uh pretty famous for saying kind of bad stuff about Bitcoin Warren Buffett as well um you know rat poison squared all that so there was definitely a lot of these traditional Finance guys just being very skeptical of crypto Bitcoin whatever whatever it was but I think a lot of that skepticism came from one these guys are like CEOs of massive companies they don't have the time to pay attention to crypto and all the exposure that they get to crypto is probably via their morning read of the mainstream media news that's that's probably all of their exposure right but then what happens is I think over time and it takes a while if it survives which crypto has they pay more attention right they start getting uh more and more involved with it they pay more and more attention they start hearing about it more and more and they think okay well maybe there is actually something here and I think that these these guys are changing their tune because they do believe right at this point in time that there is something here they believe of that crypto currencies you know Bitcoin ether stuff like that can be Alternatives uh to gold and it's actually pretty wild to hear him say that you know crypto is digital gold um because it's it's literally the one of the main narratives that we've been saying for a long long time and now we have the world's largest uh sorry um the CEO of the world's largest money uh money manager uh fund uh saying this so yeah and this is what I was talking about earlier about this kind of like wind change where we haven't seen anything remotely close to this before in terms of positivity when you have people that have been super successful uh in the traditional Finance kind of Market um and super influential there saying positive things about something that five years ago or six years ago they were you know they were saying that was just used for money laundering was saying it's rat poison Square things like that that is a marked difference and a marked change of opinion and I don't expect them to change their opinion back just because we'll go through another bull bear cycle things will blow up again I don't think they're going to change their opinion I think they're going to financialize this asset problem complete within the traditional System benefit from it of course as as they do because they're for-profit companies but uh yeah I think this is finally the time where the institutions are actually coming to crypto yeah I agree I think this is a total sea change in terms of messaging and this to me it's it proves that we have already bottomed unregulatory flood I don't see how the um you know Elizabeth Warren's anti-crypto Army and Gary Gensler and all of the anti-crypto folks in government can stand up against kind of the onslaught and lobbying of the Larry Finks of the world and the fidelities of the world like that's just not how the the political apparatus is uh I think you gave a very kind of like positive take it's just like these guys needed time to get educated right and they needed crypto to survive and prove its Lindy and prove that it exists there's another more cynical take which also might be true which is basically like uh yeah Larry Fink and BlackRock they felt their bags and that's why they are now pumping it I mean they have an ETF application basically in the works so they have a reason to say nice things about crypto and Bitcoin and plant that narrative why because now they have a product for it they were anti-crypto because they couldn't sell anything that was Pro crypto and now that they can again maybe more evidence that the ETF is coming relatively soon if not this year they'll have a product so of course they're going to start to say um good things about it those incentives line up to me as well yeah I mean I think so but they could have done that in 2018 2019 as well um and honestly I don't know I I don't feel like Larry fig needs to fill his Bitcoin bags I'm pretty sure he's doing all right I think he's doing all right on the money front I was laughing by the way when we were playing this clip from Fox Business look at the assets that um are behind on screen we got Bitcoin we got ethereum mode we got Litecoin baby we got excellent these are the top four crypto assets uh according to Fox Business worth reporting that triggers me hard I don't know oh man Litecoin and xrp are just those assets that just won't die they're being grandfathered in as the traditional Finance approved assets I don't know why but yeah it's just weird and and xrp mind you Ripple still has an active SEC yeah enforcement action against them so it's just crazy yeah it's funny I mean this is again proof that we are early uh of course if mainstream media is still um you know talking about Litecoin and xrp is top four a few things on the ETF that that will update you on this week so one bit of maybe bad news uh apparently earlier in the week the SEC said that spot Bitcoin ETFs the ones that were filed recently by Black Rock and and Fidelity uh they were inadequate so the SEC reviewed them um called them inadequate um and uh that seemed like bad news an ETF analyst said hold up a second though is this really bad news this isn't as bad as the headline the key paragraph is deep in the story basically the SEC wants them to name the crypto exchange and give more details uh in their in their application that's understandable arguably good news so some people are saying well maybe it's good news that there's some back and forth uh Dan McArdle seems to agree yeah quickly engaging back and forth with applicants versus staying silent simply waiting out the shot clock for many months and then rejecting them seems like big change so the SEC even saying that the the filings are ETF findings are inadequate at least that shows that they are talking and that could be a good sign so a little bit of of back and forth on this and uh the Market's not sure and analysts aren't sure really how to interpret this I guess my take is um I don't know um I still think he gets approved uh maybe this year I you know I predicted that on the last roll up because I think it feels so close and the SEC going back and forth with BlackRock BlackRock also updated some of its filings um added some additional information uh you know Fidelity submitting I think that like the Larry thinks of the world know what's going on and are in conversations with the SEC and know that there is a path towards approval and that's why this back and forth is is happening so I still think it's bullish for the ETFs we're gonna have a an episode with some ETF analysts tomorrow on Bank list to get the full story but what about you Anthony are you over under a Bitcoin ETF happening this year yeah I mean it's more likely than not um I think I I I thought that before this recent spat of news came out but as Dan says here the fact that the SEC is actually going back and forth here instead of just waiting it out to reject the um the ETF is huge because why would they go back to these kind of applicants unless they want to troll everyone but why would they go back to these these applicants and say hey you need to fix your application in my mind there's only one reason to do that is because they want to approve the ETF they just need to dot the eyes and cross the t's so unless they are just trolling us all they're going to rug us at the last minute um you know which could happen right like it's not it's not impossible I I do feel like yeah it's it's likely that these ETFs are going to get approved yeah I mean it seems like the typical SEC approach is just to plug their ears and ignore if they don't want to do something they just ignore rather than discourse right so discourses make people assign uh speaking of the SEC and Gary Gensler there was a rumor this week that Gary Gensler was resigning from the SEC which is very interesting this new website popped up that I had never seen before it's called crypto alert uh had an article posted SEC sources confirm Gary Gensler resignation so of course crypto Twitter you know took this up there's all sorts of tweets um I was waiting for it to be verified it was never verified Anthony so this is fake news uh interestingly enough this website crypto alert um you know cointelegraph scanned this this article itself um 97 on AI detector zero DBT that the text was generated by an AI all right so this entire story was very likely generated by an AI this entire website is new it popped out of nowhere okay and it has this story generated by AI um this is very interesting like because I I think why why is bankless even talking about this I I think everyone listening crypto investors need to know there will be all sorts of sources of fake news that hit crypto we don't know the intent of this with someone you know producing this maliciously were they trying to troll crypto are they trying to cause some volatility uh open up some trading positions and manipulate the market that way I have no idea but with all of the AI tools these days I mean the cost of fake news is basically dropping to zero so you as a consumer of crypto media and crypto news have to be very careful with what you uh what you believe and you have to not trust but verify all of the sources I think that is the lesson here what what are the takeaways from your perspective yeah no I think that's the right way to think about it I mean I saw this and immediately in my mind I was like no that's not true like especially because I looked at the I looked at the website the crypto alert and I'm like what is this website never heard of this before this makes no sense and then I saw a few people post that I'm like guys like I I can guarantee you this is fake news like there is no way this is this is true um and and the thing is is that if there was an anonymous source why would they go to crypto alert why wouldn't they go to like the block or coin desk right um so but I agree with you you have to be careful you really have to kind of I feel like the default of when you read anything online is to second guess it like always second guesses like don't just believe anything you're told at face value that should actually be the default now um not just because of AI but because of the incentives at play where obviously everyone wants to get clicks and attention to monetize and stuff like that and to um to get engagement uh from different people um so you always have to second guess things and that's been my Approach for a while whenever I see stuff like this even from reputable Outlets like I even well like with the block or coin desk I'll be like that doesn't actually make sense if I think it doesn't make sense just because it's come from them doesn't mean I believe it I look at it I'm okay that doesn't really make make much sense let's see what the details are Let's cross reference this let's see what everyone else is saying and even even if you do your quest reference that even if the reputable Publications all post the same thing it could still be fake news because they could still be tricked into publishing it I know so you have to be really really careful um but obviously this was just Prime crypto Twitter bait right here everyone on crypto Twitter everyone wanting it to be true yeah exactly he's like Enemy Number One but at the same time I actually think even if it was true this isn't a like necessarily a positive outcome because he could get replaced with someone that's worse for crypto right or he could get all his replacement could just be like neutral and not care about crypto at all and that means we wouldn't even get like legislation oh sorry um regulatory Frameworks put in place for crypto which is even worse because that's what we want we don't you know so it's just it's really just an article that that um plays people's biases and everyone wanting him to resign but I don't know I feel like if you think that's going to change anything don't uh don't hope for something that might not come yeah you think Anthony that the government is basically a Hydra too you cut off one head and like three others screw to replace it it basically yeah you know that that said there might be a compelling uh case for Gary Gensler to actually recuse himself though from issues related to uh crypto at least Jake travinsky makes that kiss um he and the blockchain association wrote an entire letter kind of an open letter making the argument that Gary Gensler has perjured himself by saying digital assets are securities and that basically SEC Commissioners like Gary Gensler are meant to be neutral Arbiters uh impartially weighing the evidence and arguments presented by the SEC staff and the enforcement targets of the prosecution the defense but when it comes to digital assets Jake travinsky claims chair Gensler is far from neutral since his appointment He's recently reportedly stated that his view that all assets other than Bitcoin are securities end of story I think there's something to that like for whatever reason politics control otherwise we don't really know it seems like Gary Gensler has it in for crypto and so um how can you play your role as a regulator and be a neutral Arbiter of the space if you just hate the asset class so much at least that's the argument Jake travinsky made so maybe these he's not resigning but maybe he should or at least recuse himself from some of these crypto things we also had an episode earlier this week with representative Warren Davidson who's created this hashtag fire Gary Gensler he's actually proposed a bill in some legislation to curtail the power that the chair of the SEC actually has and distribute that power more to the entire commission uh the the all of the SEC Commissioners rather than just Gary Gensler who kind of has a power structure such that He Reigns as as Tyrant King I would at least like to see that in the U.S um but as you say uh Anthony these things are probably like modest changes at the end of the day um you know Gary gensler's kind of been painted as as our our core enemy but I don't think he ultimately has fangs uh in this industry I think the forces at play around crypto um aren't going to like mean that he will not be a long-term impediment to us so what's your take on all of this yeah yeah I I generally agree with that and I agree with what Jake said as well that like he obviously like as I said earlier I don't think he necessarily hates crypto but he's obviously got his own kind of incentives at play here for him to go after crypto and he's not being impartial at all right um and you know we've seen plenty of clips of him saying things that contradict other things that have been said in the past and and and basically make it look like he just has it out for crypto he wants to go after crypto for for whatever reason so uh yeah he's definitely not someone who is fit to run the SEC definitely not someone who's fit to run these cases against these different companies I I just don't understand why they brought this case against coinbase given that coinbase has tried to play ball with them for so long now and that the only kind of rationalization I came to was that it was like a massive headline case for Gary gunsling gets his name in the news um and you know improves his own his own standing but other than that I don't know I I feel like if you have a company willing to work with you why wouldn't you work with them instead of going through through the I guess much longer and more obvious process of suing them right um so it didn't make much sense to me that that kind of happened there um so so yeah I agree with Drake's thread here but I don't think garrogance is going to recuse himself there is no I guess requirement for him to do that um and there's no one there can do that if his incentives are to get in the news and to build a career on this why would he recuse himself exactly and while Democrats are in power I doubt they're gonna like cam one of their own right so like there's a there's a um there's a representative in California who's basically I don't think she's brain dead but like she's got she she's kind of suffering from all these mental conditions because she's so old and the Democrats aren't even replacing her so you think they're going to replace genslaw no I don't think so I I think they're gonna let him do what he wants uh unfortunately but that's just the way it is I think guys we got more coming up on the show so base is preparing its mainnet launch of course that is coinbases Layer Two we're going to talk a little bit about that and also Cameron Winklevoss sent a last and final nastygram to Barry silbert asking for

description below what an absolute mess this has been this whole Gemini versus Barry silbert thing uh Cameron Winklevoss just sent a final offer to Barry Silber at least that's what he calls it this is an open letter posted to Barry silbert I love how this all plays out over Twitter and social media Anthony by the way so we get to kind of see what's going on uh behind the scenes he says this Barry today marks 229 days since Genesis halted withdrawals and 174 days since I last wrote an open letter to you as a reminder I wrote you on behalf of the 232 000 Gemini earned users who have over 1.2 billion dollars of assets trapped in Genesis a company owned and controlled by digital currency group a company owed and controlled by you basically he goes on to say you better get my money uh Barry and uh if you don't I'm gonna drop a lawsuit on you and you have like two or three days that was the contents of the letter he goes on to explain um you know I think this is more of it in for the public than for for uh Barry silbert you guys want to explain all of Barry's misdeeds um so there's a bit of PR behind this but the reality is dcg those Gemini and Gemini earned customers a hack of a lot of money it's it's just a shame Anthony that 232 000 uh crypto users people who thought that they were maybe using some sort of a safe product are now out of their money 1.2 billion assets trapped and this definitely hit retail uh fairly hard what's your take on this whole Fiasco right I I don't know that um that Barry that dcg will you'll pay the money back but like what's what's your overall take here yeah so it's funny because Barry has been around for quite a while in crypto um he's had his company digital currency group for quite a while they have a very large portfolio of companies under them um ones that they've invested in that they own and control things like coindesk is part of digital currency groups so they're not a small player but I don't think a lot of people are aware that Barry's like the original crypto villain um because he did a lot of villainous stuff he's actually responsible for ethereum classic um you know he was the one who got it listed um and started pumping it really early on and made it a thing or at least one of the the chief parties that did that so he's definitely one of the OG villains of the industry but because he made so much money and he had his kind of like tendrils in everything in crypto people wouldn't really call him out and they didn't really think that he'd be someone who would get into this position where he basically owes another company billions of dollars right um so I think that it became as a little bit of a surprise for people but at the same time the fact that he hasn't even bothered to engage with Gemini or the Winklevoss twins here and try and work out like a peaceful resolution is or has to be incredibly frustrating for the Winklevoss twins like I'd be incredibly frustrated as well I mean it's the same thing with what we saw with three hours Capital how they're not working with their Liquidators through the bankruptcy process imagine how the people they owe money to feel right so it's just like a really poor kind of showing even if you can't pay the money back at least work with them to try and work out a deal right um but yeah so this I guess like as you said is the final letter that they're going to send and as you said it is more of a PR thing I think to kind of maybe drum up support for the Winklevoss Twins and make sure that there's not really much support for Barry silbert uh and then they're gonna you know do this lawsuit which everything's gonna come out in that right well I think I think there's an element of retail kind of wants blood too they're like uh Barry silbert you have the money I mean look at your other assets you're like you know a billionaire you can pay this if you really want to and then other people are saying to Cameron and Tyler hey aren't you guys billionaires too incredibly wealthy like can't you like so uh and then of course no one wants to pay because this is a very large uh sum of money um a massive amount of money one other contrast Point here though for me Anthony was like from 2020 to 2022 if you wanted to lend out your crypto there are basically two ways to do that one is you could use a centralized uh third-party an exchange um a C5 Bank let's call them so you could go to Celsius you could go to block five you could go to Gemini you could you could lend that way the other way was through defy there's Ave and maker and compound these other things um of course we we all know what happened the centralized lending providers went bad a lot of them almost all of them basically uh and uh one line was interesting from this letter in addition to um Cameron says this in addition to dragging out a resolution they have ballooned professional feasts over a hundred million dollars all of which have gone to lawyers and advisors at the expense of creditors and earned users just the waste here we are almost a year later from the blow up so the kind of the start of the blow-ups 100 million dollars at least has been stent on lawyers and professional fees and we're no closer to settlement right contrast that to defy everything was on chain right the liquidations happened in a fair orderly efficient way you know the thing that SEC says is their mission Fair orderly like efficient Capital markets it happened basically instantly everyone got their money back it was fully transparent it was fully regulated there weren't a hundred million dollars in lawyer and professional fees that had to go into arbitrating this and trying to settle it like it just contrast those two systems and uh man what a win for defy when you zoom out and and look at that that context it is so much better particularly for these things called um collateralized loans then the centralized providers that to me is when you look deeply the actual bullish thing is the kind of the contrast Point here what do you think definitely I mean I totally agree with that and I think you know where was the SEC on this sort of stuff right like uh these aren't new companies that just came onto the scene suddenly and you know I guess like uh we're under the radar they're big billion dollar companies and it seems like none of the regulations that existed uh you know had any effect here unfortunately um and the same is true for all the other blobs we saw like FTX and things like that right I know FTX technically was was domiciled in the Bahamas but there's FCX us which and then there was the whole SPF you know cozying up to politicians and the SEC and stuff like that so you know at the end of the day like you can either have uh you know uh I guess like not control but like uh an orderly unwinding via the D5 system or you can have an unorderly unwinding via the traditional system because the traditional system as was noted here costs a lot of money right it costs 100 million dollars in lawyers and advisors to actually arbitrate this whereas within D5 it's all run by code right yes there the car can have bugs and there are exploits and stuff like that that happens but I mean more money has been lost on these C5 platforms than all of D5 combined the last time I did the math on it so I think Defy is winning here yeah I definitely agree with that um let's talk about base so base is nearing its Mainland launch this is coinbase coinbase is a layer two of course uh they just announced the completion of their audits and so they fulfilled four out of five of their criteria for mainnet launch of course base is built on the op stack uh we've talked a lot about base what do you think about base in general uh Anthony are you bullish what do you think kind of this this progress to mainnet means it certainly sounds like base will be released this year um what will be the effect yeah I mean I agree I think it definitely will get released this year in case something happens to delay it um we still you know have like six months after the year so it's plenty of time and Jesse the lead of bass at coinbase has teased um this year as well on on Twitter so yeah it seems pretty strong signal that'll be released this year but I have said this a lot of times I'm incredibly bullish on this I think bass is going to be the coinbase what BSC or binance smart chain was to finance really that big huh yeah yeah I I definitely think so and it's launching at the right time too like if you're a believer that the market is going to heat up again towards the end of this year into next year uh then you should believe that um there's going to be a lot of new people coming in to coinbase who are then going to get onboarded to base because as well and this is not something that I think a lot of people think about if coinbase is under scrutiny by the SEC for assets that they list are they going to list any more assets like are they going to list any of the new assets probably not but what are they going to do is they're going to have an asset page on their website they're going to say hey you can go trade this on base right our Layer Two and here's how you do it so they're going to bring a lot of new people on chain in my mind um and and I think that that will translate to new people on not just bass but other l2s and ethereum generally so I think what's going to happen is we're going to have a potential layer to Summer not maybe not in summer but like what we're having with D5 summer where these layer twos get so much usage from all this new money and all these new users pouring in because of of bass I really do think bass has a potential to kick start that because of those users that coinbase has and um bscl binance smart chain definitely kick-started a lot of this evm stuff this alt evm stuff that we saw this alt layer one stuff that we saw play out um so I do think that bass can kick start or at least continue the growth of the l2s and and make it into something similar to D5 summer where we just had so much money coming in and it was so much activity happening and it really kind of uh I guess kickstarted that that massive growth trajectory for for things like D5 Anthony if I'm bullish on best what asset do I buy because Facebook's already said they're not rolling out a token okay and I already have my bags packed with eth right I'm going to continue to dollar cost average that is that maybe a case for a coin or like the you know the the stock that we were talking about and the outset of the episode are there some other assets that my extrude value as a result of the potential success of this yeah I mean I think Kryptonite is generally are going to buy crypto assets instead of coin even though a coin probably seems like the obvious bet as well but if if we're talking like people in crypto and crypto natives I think when you look at base and what it is in L2 and then everyone's going to show that it's built on like op stack and then people are going to be like oh well optimism has a token right it's okay I I think that's what's gonna happen but but the thing is is that if we do have like an L2 summer a layer 2 summer what's going to happen is that people will just buy anything related to l2s right so I feel like if you are of the belief that that's gonna happen then buying any of the L2 tokens or at least the popular ones could possibly be the the winning move as well as eighth of course because eighth will obviously benefit from this but yeah I don't think it's just going to be one asset um but if any of the most sorry the most if you go for the most obvious one it would be op because everyone will be saying oh it's built on op stack right yeah what's also very interesting to me about this model is this is also true the coinbase wallet is if base is successful if coinbase wallet is successful it kind of cannibalizes uh coinbase's underlying centralized business right it's like they can't take the transaction fee that the trading fee that they take on the centralized exchange if it's a decentralized exchange built on base with uniswap so I think I always I always admire companies that take those steps because I think they're like very it's very bold to say uh you know Steve Jobs style we're going to take the iPod we're going to completely cannibalize it inside it's just going to be an app on the iPhone right that's the future and we're willing to cannibalize our business model I think that's a bold step and I'm glad they're taking it a few metrics from op while we were talking about it this is optimism there was a Bedrock migration this was a new optimism migration that happened a few weeks ago um some pretty substantial metrics that are worth celebrating here so after that upgrade op May net users are paying 54 percent less layer 1 gas per transaction so if 54 optimization average transaction fee of about 14 cents so far this has saved community members 1.36 million in fees there's some other stats here that I think are are pretty impressive but in general how are layer 2's able to achieve these optimizations without any kind of um ethereum layer one upgrade Anthony yes so the the biggest thing that they can do is what's called call data compression so call data is basically the the data that they put onto ethereum L1 um and that's the most expensive part of an L2 because they they post two things they post the call data and they post a proof the proof is very cheap to post the call data are very expensive and in terms of numbers I think the proof is like maybe five ten percent of the cost so call data is is 995 so what they've done here at least one of the optimizations that they've made with bedrock is that they've compressed that call data down so just like it looks like like compressing a file on your computer like zipping it yeah pretty much yeah yeah yeah you can think of it that that way and and use that analogy it definitely fits um so that's that's one thing that they did there's other optimizations they can always make to to how the actual code of the optimism Network um you know runs how efficient it is things like that and there are there are some other tricks that they that they can use as well I think at these costs down but honestly I didn't think that they would get the cost down this much like that's a huge huge huge production and as you said there was no L1 change here there's no increased gas limit on our one you know bigger blocks or anything there's no upgrade specific to l2s that have gone live yet obviously those are coming later like erp4844 or Proto dank sharding which will actually reduce fees a lot more than this so um just to quickly explain for people it replaces for l2's call data with something called blob style transactions and these are much cheaper so it's the same data that can be posted but it gets posted as a blob instead of call data and that reduces fees from 10 to 100 x it depends on you guys 10 to 100 x by the way it's 0.44 do you think that's roughly still slated for this year yeah I mean I on my estimates put it November um I I'm pretty confident in a November date um it could come earlier but yeah the um the upgrade that it's a part of then um I feel like that's going to go live in you know November oh big that is so big for Roblox exactly exactly it will it will require the Roll-Ups to take advantage of that I think they have to change how they how they do things but um yeah I mean I would expect these and also another big part of it isn't just a reduction in fees it creates a separate fee market for these l2s so if gas spikes for on layer one ethereum say it goes from 10 gray to 100 gray the price of blob transactions of the of the whether they're storing their data the price of that stays the same it doesn't Spike with the rest of the network so it's actually a segmented fee Market from the rest of the network which means that even if the rest of the network goes crazy because some nft mint is happening these L2 should still have those low costs which in my opinion is the the bigger you know what you just taught me something I didn't actually know that so it really bifurcates the actual um your kind of block space market then yep yep it's it's it's a kind of thing that is I think live I think Solana has this actually and it was something that was spoken about um as part of uh Erp um 1559 a while ago this multi-dimensional fee Market where essentially you have different segments but because it has a roll-up Centric road map where we're pushing all the execution or user-facing stuff to Roll-Ups we figured well let's not do it for every transaction on ethereum because that would be too complex let's do it for just the ones that the Roll-Ups take advantage of and and that's what we're doing with with this 46 ethereum is giving a massive subsidy basically to layer twos like it is a massive upgrade for there is a there is a trade-off though in that the call data or the blobs expire after a month and what that means is that you can't so if if after a month you haven't downloaded that data you wouldn't be able to access that again unless someone else had downloaded it but it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist on on layer one it exists as as part of the state it's just that you you can't access the specific data that was part of of that right but you want to access it if something goes really wrong right I mean it's not well I'm not even that you only need to access it if you need access to the historical balances of accounts so let's say you want to know what the balance of so you only need it for like tax related purposes and stuff like that right and there's going to be third-party services that keep this data and it'll be it'll be fine um but yeah that that is the trade-off because as you said it is a big subsidy that ethereum is giving these Roll-Ups and it can't be stored forever because it would balloon the the um the size of the chain but uh but yeah it's still I think amazing because it's a really smart approach and I think we're seeing it in the Innovation right it's not so it's not just these optimizations from arbitrum and uh optimism and other groups on compression as well um so late last week polygon Labs just uh proposed their polygon 2.0 architecture um we're gonna have polygon actually on the show next week to to go into this in in some detail what's the tldr at the highest level uh on polygon 2.0 Anthony what are they doing here yeah so it's kind of funny because it's not just polygon that's that's doing this but um like you have op stack you have uh the ZK ZK stack from ZK sync and now you have polygon 2.0 what they're all doing is they're building this L2 infrastructure that um can all be interoperable with each other all settling on ethereum right but basically where anyone can spin up their own polygon L2 chain or their own ZK sync L2 chain or their own op chain right standard that's the term for this are we calling them super chains or what are we calling them well optimism calls it a super chain um I think polygon has their own name for it uh and I think uh ZK um Sync has their own name for it as well may the best meme win I kind of like see yeah super Chain's pretty a pretty good name I think um but it's all about unifying as polygon says here unifying the liquidity unifying the the kind of like scalability making sure that all these things can interoperate with each other without having to go through you know third-party Bridges and stuff like that so they can natively enter operate and giving developers the optionality of what to build right whether they want to build an app chain or maybe they want to build a generalized chain um so that's what it seems like all of these l2s coalescing around which I think is is pretty is pretty cool um but I don't know how many of these we can have because it gets to the point we have too many and then it just doesn't make much sense so I feel like you might have a handful of them that succeed and maybe some others don't don't really succeed because they just came too late to Market or didn't do the BD right or stuff like that but if anyone can pull it off polygon definitely up there in terms of being able to pull it off in my opinion yeah certainly I should mention uh both Anthony and myself are advisors to polygon as well we've been very very bullish on this project since the very beginning as well as many other layer twos out there uh speaking of layer twos Anatoly from uh Solana asks himself the question would it be possible for Solana to eventually be an eighth Layer Two do I recall Anthony you asking him that question you bring that up to him in person there is some sort of interaction like that where he was very much against it called you sort of I don't know maybe said some things I'm not sure what happened but it to me it was it was interesting that Anatoly actually brought that up as a hypothetical and his conclusion is uh no it's not it's not yeah of course as as one would expect what's your take on this yeah I don't think it was me that said that to him publicly but I have actually said this a lot of times over the years that like Solana in my opinion would work better as a layer two but look it depends on what you want Solana to be now obviously Anatoly and like the course Alana uh Community what they want Solana to be is this chain that essentially allows you to send transactions across the globe at the speed of light that is like one of their main selling points that they're going on about right um and they want to do this in a distributed way you know distributed across the globe with validators in a place in different places around the world but to achieve that you need to bump up the hardware requirements to levels that just are not sustainable right in my opinion and they're just not at a point where it would lend itself to Everyday users being able to run nodes run infrastructure be part of the consensus stuff like that so that's the kind of trade-off there is there but that's what they want Solana to be but if you just want to harness Solana's execution technology so it's like paralyzation technology G and and kind of um the underlying architecture you could build that as an L2 you just wouldn't get the same Solana you would get as an L1 because a cylinder is an R1 is going towards that you know speed of light transaction uh kind of finality stuff like that uh and that's what Anatoli says in this in this kind of tweet here um but as an L2 you can still harness uh you know Solana's benefits in its execution layout side of things but I don't think the Solana chain as it exists today is is going to be an ethl2 I don't think that they should be in efl too because that would be really bad for them I believe I don't I don't think it would be good for them to do that because it would mean that they basically aren't competing with ethereum anymore and I think that's one of their selling points that they're competing with ethereum that they're a better architecture they're competing for for different apps and there are certain apps that they're trying to build um that aren't necessarily possible on ethereum at least layer one and they want to do it at layer one so there's um there's these apps where basically it's decentralized infrastructure things like helium which is that that hot spot where you can buy this piece of Hardware you put it in your home you know you generate uh kind of uh um I guess like they have their own coin that you can kind of farm or mine or whatever it is they want to do that sort of stuff and there's a few other things that they're focused on I don't think they could do that as a layer too so all the power to them on on that front but in terms of harnessing Solana's technology um you know this paralyzation a transaction um uh technology that the evm doesn't have uh it could be built as an L2 and I think there's actually a team building that as an L2 on ethereum that's interesting I love in crypto that we get to let all of the experiments uh play out and run uh and ultimately we get to make bets on all of these experiments too so if you're bullish Solana you can make that bet if you're not bullish Solana you're more bullish on ethereum's modular approach with Layer Two so you can make that bet too so um May the best chain win um this is a vitalik Twitter thread one thing I I think uh was notable he just said I'm taking an AMA on uh Twitter um someone asked him how he's feeling about the U.S policy's approach to crypto and he said this the one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that Solana and other projects are getting hit in this way they don't deserve it and if ethereum ends up winning through all though all of their blockchains getting kicked off exchanges that's not an honorable way to win and in the long term probably isn't even a victory this is especially true since the real competition is not other Chains It's the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak I wish all honorable projects a fair outcome in this whole situation of course vitalika as usual kind of rising above the the tribal Fray and wishing well on all honorable projects painting kind of the true enemy as the the centralizers what's your take on uh vitalik's take here yeah I mean I completely agree with him I've always not been a fan of the way uh you know certain groups in crypto uh like Bitcoin maximalists use the state as a weapon uh which is just completely ironic and and just hilarious to me that they would do that um to take down you know the competitors in the ecosystem so yeah I don't want the state any state basically choosing um winners and losers based on some arbitrary rules that they've come up with I want these things to win or lose based on the free market right and and I think that up until this point crypto has been a relatively free market and that actually has been a pretty decent Arbiter of what is valuable and what isn't um over the longer term short term longer term that's key yes yes short short term not so good not so good long term pretty good on on net I know there are some things that the the Market's not going to ever be able to optimize for and not going to be able to sort out but on net it's it's been pretty good um you know over the long long term uh but I still wouldn't want state to come in and say okay you're not a security you're a security you know you're not allowed to operate in the U.S you you know you are allowed to operate in the US we're going to ban you know mining we're going to keep staking I don't want ethereum to win like that I want ethereum to win on its merits and and that's why I completely agree with vitalik uh on that on that front well uh speaking of kind of winning a nation state level actors it is notable I think that a presidential candidate is now making crypto part of his platform this is uh RFK Robert F Kennedy Jr I believe he is running uh as a democrat in the 2024 election here's what he says about crypto this is from the Bitcoin Miami Conference let's just hear a clip proud to make an historic announcement our campaign will be the first presidential campaign in the history to accept Bitcoin donations through [Applause] through the lightning Network as president I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcline is inviolable interesting as president I will make sure that your right to hold and use Bitcoin is inviolable interesting words I think from uh somebody um on the presidential ticket now bankless of course is not a political podcast we'll make no comments on the the Merit of this particular politician but just seeing crypto rise to the level of being a presidential issue now I haven't heard Trump weigh in on this I haven't heard Biden weigh in on this but here is a presidential candidate who's um you know the critics would say pandering to the crypto audience um I think supporters would say trying to protect trying to enshrine uh Americans rights to hold their own private Keys what's your overall take on on this is this uh surprising to you or is this playing out as Anthony sassano would have suspected all along well I mean I I wouldn't say it's it's surprising just because crypto has been you know for the last few months at least talked about more and more in the political sphere obviously with the regulatory stuff but also as part of Democrats and Republicans going at each other right in in the US over over this issue so it's not surprising to see that a presidential a presidential candidate uh like RFK I mean I don't know him very well I don't follow us politics that closely but from what I see from him he's definitely the underdog candidate so obviously he would try and appeal to the communities that um other candidates aren't appealing to um and it I think it fits his platform for what I've seen but yeah I'm not surprised that this has become a thing now given that it's already a thing in you know in the existing politics uh and has been at least for the for this year I think has been a big part of it um and I think since the FTX blow up definitely it's just become more of a more of a talking point um so so yeah and even though like I don't make any really comments on on the candidates themselves and and whatever in their policies just the fact fact that crypto is is there right he's being discussed in these circles and he's kind of front and center for a lot of these people is in of itself I think pretty bullish uh for crypto overall yeah I think the contrast point is something that uh Belarus is doing uh Belarus wants to ban a peer-to-peer crypto transactions wow actually ban peer-to-peer crypto transaction so if I send you my eth and uh I was Belarus that would be potentially illegal um this is a bill that looks like it will go into law I think this is kind of worth a broader conversation though of something to be wary about um of course this week in the US it was kind of independence day which is sort of a celebration of the Declaration of of Independence and uh is enshrined you know at least to Americans as kind of a document um that uh that purports freedom freedom from tyranny I I do think Anthony that um you have to like we should be in the west very careful about what our countries are doing with respect to like peer-to-peer transactions and bankless wallets like non-custodial crypto wallets because if we get to a place where they start to talk about banning these things or making them illegal or limiting them in ways that um are very gatekeeping I think that is a terrible sign and in fact it might be a sign and the crypto is an acid test for like how authoritarian your government is and I think it's like confirmation that your Society is veering towards an authoritarian surveillance state so it's something that's always in the top of mind for me and of course you know I think it's worth fighting for in your respective jurisdiction wherever you're listening in is to fight for these rights to hold your own private keys in your country um but I'm worried that they won't be upheld what's what's kind of the state in Australia like there hasn't been anything close to this in the U.S of like a ban on peer-to-peer transactions or a ban on crypto wallets um but there can be a slippery slope of if you start to get your travel rules and these kinds of things that that limit exchange withdrawals uh over a certain size you can start to see us like veering towards that uh what's your overtake on this and what's the climate like in Australia yeah so I mean I guess first I give my overall take is that I think it's funny that for the last maybe 10 15 years uh at least Western governments uh I mean not just Western governments even even China been trying to get rid of cash right cash is not very easily traceable uh cash is uh you know not very easily taxable stuff like that and then Along Comes crypto it's like here we go here's digital cash so it's just kind of a funny contrast but I agree with you that you know if your country's trying to ban peer-to-peer any transactions uh I think that's a big red flag and and definitely uh you know a potential harbinger of other things to come um but in terms of what the climate's like in Australia crypto is not really a talking point for our politicians really at all um I don't remember the last time I heard one of them talk about crypto but I mean we're we're just a very small country as well compared to to the US I mean there's only like 25 million people here right so very small so NL and our politics is generally very muted compared to the US like just to put this in context the I guess campaign for when the new prime minister is getting voted in is like six weeks the campaign in the US for a president is like what 18 months yeah so at least yeah and and we have the same terms I think like four-year terms for for our leaders but um the only stuff that I've seen lately has been our biggest bank Commonwealth Bank saying that they were going to impose a 10 000 deposit limit to crypto exchanges uh per month um because of scams and they weren't just using that as a cover point I looked up the stats last year in Australia three billion dollars was lost to scams not crypto scams just scams generally of 300 million of that was crypto scams and I think they walked that back um I uh haven't uh seen the that I'm documented anywhere on the website or anything so I think they actually walked that back but I think they were just trying to protect people from getting scammed because uh a lot of these uh what they do is that these scammers say hey send this money to this crypto exchange address right the um the Fiat to this deposit address and then obviously it gets exchanged for crypto and then it gets sent off and there's no way to ever recover that money ever again because it's gone right um which which speaks to how censorship resistant and decentralized something like ethereum Bitcoin is as well mind you as a side note there which is pretty funny um but uh other than that no not really haven't seen anything yet but in saying that Australia is known for being quite uh not authoritarian but definitely doesn't question authority very much as a populist so I would say that something like this would unfortunately be probably not hard to get through if you really wanted to get something like this through um and generally people who are into crypto in Australia we have a very big gambling culture unfortunately um they like the speculative side of it so they probably you know they probably wouldn't cry over the uh over something like this I would I would love an amendment uh to you know kind of all worldwide uh charters of freedom in in Bill of Rights and constitutions it's like a right to private keys to own your own private keys I think that's very important to enshrine in the meanwhile though bankless Nation I guess the message is stay vigilant for these sorts of things a Banning peer-to-peer transactions is an absolute no-go we got a few more things to discuss Anthony I want to get your take was actually a question from the bankless Nation about optimism switching to ZK proofs and the idea of a super chain in the in the super chain environment will we still need a bridge I also want to talk to you about uh Mark Zuckerberg's new Twitter killer and see if that is worth setting up your early thoughts on that a few other things what are your Holdings during the bear Market we'll get to all of those things and more but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible you know uniswap it's the world's largest decentralized exchange with over 1.4

web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free questions from the nation this week this one from Kyle Kaplan bankless citizen uh the question goes so if optimism switches from optimistic fraud proofs to ZK proofs and chooses the ZK prover will it reduce the need to bridge between networks and would that make it the hyper super chain well the hyper super chain that's a new marketing that I've not heard of but this idea of optimism switching from optimistic fraud proofs to ZK proofs choosing the ZK sync approver what does that do for bridges in general when an application deploy is on the super chain let's say do we obviate the need for Bridges so from my understanding the bridges enshrined as part of the the stack right so the bridge is still there but it's enshrined in that all for example the op stack chains can use that bridge and have the same security guarantees um without having to have like extra assumptions baked in like these third-party Bridges that's that's my understanding of it and I think that's that's true for any enshrined Bridge um so for example there is an enshrined bridge on ethereum layer one for the optimism chain right the op mainnet chain that you send your funds to and then you get them on op mainnet and that gives you the the security of ethereum L1 obviously because it's on ethereum L1 so if you have a bridge enshrined as part of the actual Tech stack which is what op stack is doing with the super chain from my understanding then you would get the um the kind of similar benefits to that in terms of choosing like the ZK sync prover instead of something else instead of their home growth improver I don't know for sure what this would look like but my intuition says that it wouldn't make it like a hyper super chain because you would still have um you would still have separate networks from my understanding you would still have like the networks built on the ZK sync ZK stack the ones built in the op stack and while they're sharing the same prover they probably have other parts of their stack that are different enough that it wouldn't give you the same guarantees but I think it's still very early days for stuff like this I don't actually think any I don't I don't think anyone would have a good answer to this just yet maybe some of the people that are actually developing this would have those answers um but yeah it's still very early and the fact that he that um Carl's even asking this question speaks to how uh how close he's paying attention to these sorts of things I mean to the extent we can um kill and eliminate the need for like Bridges with bad uh like multi-sig Bridges these types of things there was a story this week that we didn't get to to jump on but this was a a let's see um another bridge that had a massive hack or something I think I deleted the the poly Network it was yeah they've already been hacked and apparently the second hack for this bridge right I mean yeah it was a it was a multi-sig one where they compromised I think uh I don't know if it was like a 204 or something but they compromised multiple signers on the multi-sig and that's how they were able to do it yeah so with this type type of Technology like kind of the super chain technology I don't know I don't know about the ZK sync prover um we are in Layer Two is kind of obviating the need for these types of multi-sig bridges like we're trying to eliminate Bridges because bridges are basically security risks is that an oversimplification or is that roughly right yeah I mean that's the thing that there are different types of of bridges right like um there's bridges that literally just act as an account that does like balances where it takes in assets and then spits out an IOU on the bridge chain and then that could be protected by a multi-sig then there are bridges that are more look like uni stop liquidity pools for example where you essentially are trading out of an asset into another one in order to get out of that L2 into another L2 and the people providing liquidity are the ones taking on that risk essentially that withdrawal risk or whatever um and then there are the kind of enshrined bridges where as I said optimism has one arbitrim one has one where you send funds to one ethereum L1 and then you get issued them on the L2 um so there's different types of contracts but yeah those those kind of like easy Bridges I like to call them the ones that have multi-cigs on them those need to go like we do not need those that's for sure uh some takes of the week okay um threads is threads worth checking out so this is um of course uh Elon put through some Twitter rate limiting this week there was a maximum number of tweets that that Twitter users could could actually view I didn't get to a point where I exceeded that that Maximus it didn't affect me a lot of people are are talking about uh The Meta competitor the Zuckerberg competitor called threads I think crypto Twitter was talking about it a little bit is this worth looking at switching to I mean for me personally Anthony I'm really waiting for like a a web 3 Twitter alternative replacement something like a lens or a forecaster to really take off I'm not so excited about another centralized company so you switch from Elon to Zuckerberg like wow um but it does feel like I don't know about you but like Twitter is uh they're making some interesting design choices these days and I I I don't know that that's a good thing it hasn't proven to be a good thing to me have you taken a look at threads what's your overall take here yeah I mean I I signed up for an account because I already have an Instagram account so it like forces you to sign up with with Instagram which is I guess like a typical meta because they want all their products to be integrated with each other so it makes sense um but yeah I mean I I've spent the last you know five six years building up a Twitter audience building up that Network effect you know everyone's already on there I don't have the energy to do that again on one of these platforms right I really don't um and and people really do undervalue how hard it is to break a network effect um like I I agree with you that Twitter's been going downhill since since musk bought it I think that they're actually going to go bankrupt relatively soon because they're just bleeding cash um they're bleeding cash so badly that the reason they put in that API limit was because must then want to renew the Google Cloud contract with with Google because it explains it lights off you can't do that yeah yeah so I I think what's going to happen is that like Elon probably I don't know if his ego is going to let him do this but he's probably gonna have to sell Twitter right like unless he changes something going to a point where it can actually keep making money and keep the lights on I don't know how he's going to keep the lights on when it's bleeding so much money as is because it's not cheap to host something like Twitter and then threads comes along threads okay that it's going to be run better than Twitter just because uh it doesn't you know it it's it's new it's um it's it's based on like Facebook Instagram and their run all right you know they're not doing any erratic moves or anything like that but it doesn't have the network effect and can it build their Network effect can it actually peel people away from from Twitter I actually don't think so because as you said it's basically just a clone um in that it is centralized it's the same product essentially it's not offering anything new right um and also on top of that it gives me Google Plus Vibes I don't know if people remember Google Plus yeah but it was the social media platform that Google created try and kill Facebook yeah and it didn't kill Facebook at all it got shut down eventually because it just didn't really do anything good um so yeah as much as like Fred's has that massive Kickstarter or Head Start of a network effect with the existing Instagram and Facebook user bases and stuff like that I I don't think that it's what they've got the product they've got right now is enough to draw people over it's literally a Twitter clone it doesn't offer anything new I hope that crypto can kind of do something here some sort of web3 social messaging type tool with a crypto wallet embedded there's something there and we we haven't quite found it but I'm hopefully that is is the real kind of Twitter killer one thing that's interesting though is these platforms like Twitter the idea of them becoming basically like um uh data sources for AIS and ai's being kind of Free Riders um this is a comment from a Twitter user saying the timing of Elon Musk data scraping rules is basically limiting the Twitter API and open AI widening the release of browsing function are not a coincidence pretty much all the content IP is going to need to move behind paywalls to blockchain or something similar to charge micro transactions for interactions and Page views I don't understand how ad-based internet business models are going to work if you can create content and it's gobbled up by an llm once and then shown to thousands of other people who might ask a similar question are advertisers paying when chat GPT says clicking on a link this idea that like kind of the llms and the chat dpts of the world are basically just slurping up all of the Twitter content all of the web content all of these things any kind of breaking the ad model that has held web web 2 for so long because they're essentially Free Riders on top of all of this free content I think that's a fascinating idea and part of what might be going on at the highest level do you have any thoughts yeah I mean maybe but like musk is involved with open AI I mean he's one of the early uh I guess like investors I think and also on the board so I I don't know if I buy that argument but at the same time I get this right I get that it is definitely a concern but there's also the other side of it where a lot of these kind of web 2 companies existed on VC money they were subsidized by VC money maybe not Twitter but other companies that have exist to animate their IPO and their stock went to crap because they're not actually worth what they say they were they don't make any money right they have Revenue but they do not have profit because they were just subsidized by VCS um and a lot of them have to raise their prices now because that subsidy has run out um because obviously VCS aren't interested in in subsidizing anything once it's ipo'd because they've exited right they're they're gone that's that's that investment done um so there is a there is a point here about data scraping and stuff like that but if you're just going to paywall everything or limit things what's going to end up happening is that the open platforms are just going to win anyway I I just I don't believe believe that um that this is going to succeed I don't believe you can pay all everything it's interesting I do feel like there's some sort of evolution the internet is going to take in the the 2020s that is going to surprise everyone uh one other take I want to run by you this week is to take that I tweeted it's one of those tweets where I don't know if I fully agree with it myself but I partially agree um and it's just you know calling to question a a mood right now and that mood is crypto feels lost right now maybe it's just crypto Twitter but the vibe the mood has felt off in um in a lot of ways at least some people have felt this way and my question is how can it find its way I think you answered this question in the Tweet um and a lot of people had a lot of great answers including like hey Ryan you're wrong crypto isn't lost at all like um I think you said something to the fact that yeah maybe crypto is lost but ethereum isn't uh that was your take what do you think about this feeling this idea that that crypto is lost do you think that's just bear Market sentiment um what's your overall take yeah so my reply actually got like a few replies that were upset with me and they basically said this is just the same thing as when Bitcoin maximalists say you know Bitcoin not crypto which wasn't my intention at all I I said you know crypto maybe lost um but ethereum isn't yeah the ethereum is doing just fine and I didn't yeah I didn't say like uh actually someone replied you know this is this feels like a Bitcoin not blockchain moment for eth Bros I'm like I didn't say that at all right crypto is a really broad term if you if you say crypto you're referencing literally every single project in the crypto ecosystem every single token coin whatever you wanna whatever you want to call it including Sam bankman freed and everything exactly exactly Alex machensky and all that yes and most people would agree that 99 of that stuff is garbage right this trash it's going to zero it's it's literally not valuable so I don't know why people were attacking me over this but that's why I said crypto may be lost because crypto consists of a lot of that stuff whereas the actual true signal such as ethereum and there are other signals out there I'm not going to name any specific ones but there are other signals out there they are doing just fine but for me I said ethereum because that's the one I focus on is when I pay attention to that's one I could speak to specifically if someone asked me um and it really does feel like ethereum is doing fine from that lens because we have the l2s thriving defies having a Renaissance with defy um new J5 projects coming online real world assets stuff like that so that's why I I said this but generally yeah I mean I agree with your take that that crypto feels lost because there was this kind of narrative in 2021 The multi-chain Narrative right that was one of the big narratives like everyone's saying it's going to be a multi-chain world we're all going to use these different l1's they're all going to talk to each other blah blah and it's like yeah okay like I get that thesis back then but even though I didn't agree with that but I think that's this has mostly been disproven that it's not just going to be all these at different l1's it's going to be l2s and where do l2s live predominantly and oh my most all of them ethereum right so that's why I did ethereum is doing just fine because we've just seen crypto explode and just go to go to zero basically a lot of the time um whereas ethereum has thrived so that was my main main take on it yeah there's certainly more like blockchain ethereum infrastructure being built at an earning point in history it's like absolutely phenomenal to to see this is Eric wall stick which I thought was also interesting what you're experiencing is the realization that crypto isn't the new coolest thing AI is the new coolest thing that might be part of it too right crypto really had a kind of a cultural moment in 2021 2022 and then sort of an epic downfall and culturally and now everyone is talking about Ai and so um I think maybe that mood has sort of uh you propagated across crypto Twitter as well uh but let's turn to something maybe even more interesting Anthony which is um what you're bullish on and the thing I want to ask you this week is actually um what are you holding in terms of assets through this bear Market so um I tweeted out early so I was just thinking about it things I'm not selling things I'm holding during the bear Market eth I still have some Bitcoin um Layer Two tokens to me they're still very bullish and uh Blue Chip D5 those are probably my highest conviction Holdings a lot a lot of other things that are like not as high conviction but these are things I'm I'm holding during I held during the the bull run and I'm continuing to hold during the the bear cycle um my take is selling these uh in the bear Market would be a colossal mistake uh how about you what what does your list look like in terms of categories of things that you are holding during the bear Market yeah I think we have probably similar lists here um I haven't actually bought anything except eighth for for quite a while now with like fresh fit or anything like that I usually just just buy eighth um but in terms of positions I've held for a while I mean I've been public about uh Matic being my my kind of like second largest holding it I've held that for a while um that as you mentioned we're advisors so um that was kind of from there but I could have you know I could have sold it all and and be done with it but I I held it because I I'm I'm obviously bullish on polygon as a project but not to single them out um I'm bullish on l2s generally uh and and polygon is obviously at the heart of it but along with optimism and arbitrim and a lot of these things I'm an angel investor into so I have a long list of um of companies that I've Angel invested in some are liquid some are not right you know there's vesting times and stuff attached to it but in terms of of public market stuff it really is yeah just eighth the L2 tokens generally um you know as I mentioned D5 d5's been a funny one for me because I don't currently hold any like large positions in D5 tokens I have Angel invested in a few of the new D5 protocols that I was talking about the ones that feel like they're actually innovating but I haven't um you know bought any on the open marker or anything like that in a little while and then I have some other tokens like uh Rock couple or RPL um because I'm a nerd operator and part of the odow as well which which you're a part of too or which Bankers is a part of I should say so yeah just stuff like that but I would say like it's all heavily concentrated within the ethereum ecosystem I own no Bitcoin uh like literally zero Bitcoin I own no alt L ones um the last altar one I had was was Dot and I had that because or polka dot and I had that because I bought it at the Ico end of 2017 and then it went live like three years later and I traded it for eth and that turned out to be a good trade because it went up after that but other than that no that it's just heavily concentrated in the ethereum ecosystem and I'm the same as you like I think selling any of that stuff now is a costal mistake because bear markets aren't for selling right unless you're forced to sell for whatever reason um or unless you you're selling something that you truly believe is just dead and it's not going to go back up in the bull market but other than that no I I feel like yeah selling during these bear markets and these crab markets and just not the way to play it um I feel like you should be accumulating your favorite things you think things are going to do well and then if you want to sell you're selling things uh are hot when when people are coming up with nowadays like super cycle again yeah I mean look investing is as simple as a cell when it's going up and you buy when it's down right I mean like I I don't know it's funny you say it's simple but like that you know you unpack that and the complexities you approach Infinity because it should be that simple but humans being humans we make it complex we do definitely make it complex uh speaking of that we got the meme of the week this week Anthony cesano so this is a tweet that uh I think both of us found humorous if you believe in the gansler Step Down News you're exactly the person gansler want to protect so yeah there's a lesson here in this um I guess retail needs to up its game be smarter about trusting sources is is that the lesson that this meme is is sharing for us yeah I mean there's layers to this meme um and you know I I loved it because basically what it's saying is that if you don't want to be regulated stop being someone who should be regulated like it's that's that's my takeaway from it like if you want personal responsibility right you need to take personal responsibility when things are bad yeah if you don't want to be treated like a child don't act like a child I mean that's disparaging on children but like have somebody have some personal responsibility here that's what um basically crypto is it's all about taking responsibility over your money your finances your life decisions uh hopefully you're ready for that uh bankless Nation uh this has been the roll up this week Anthony thank you so much for joining us um by the way can you do a quick tell us about the daily Quay okay tell us about the refuel and what you're doing every day on your channel uh and I think you guys are spinning up a new podcast you and Eric Connor as well not in I should say resurrecting an old podcast and taking that new again so give us the latest there yeah yeah so I think uh you know a lot of people if they know me already they'll know me from from the daily way which is uh kind of it's like it's in ethereum media um uh I guess uh ecosystem uh they're similar to bankless um but it is definitely more of a of a kind of like public good uh where it's like nothing's monetized or anything like that um but I've done that on purpose because it's really just me every weekday you know going for about 30 minutes talking about ethereum things happening in ethereum for anyone who wants that and going deeper into a lot of things as well like pretty deep on something sometimes people will know me for my rants on there about certain things not not um bearish rants bullish rants rants a lot but but yeah it's basically just there for people that want to stay up to date with ethereum but I also do it a lot um I actually I guess I get asked this question a lot by people like why do you do it you know why do you do it for free you know you could easily monetize this blah blah I'm like well for me it's just like something that I do to keep myself engaged as well like and and keep myself up to date with things because I find that the more I repeat something the more it just sticks in my head I know that's not a you know a unique Insight but for me that's that's kind of like how I work really well to retain information and I feel like it's a waste to just keep it in my head so I want to I want to impart that kind of knowledge and wisdom on other people uh and you mentioned the podcast that has been resurrected with Eric Connor yeah so for those who are OG's you'll know that Eric Connor and I used to do a podcast called into The Ether uh back we started that in late 2018 uh we did that once a week where we recapped the the latest news your M ecosystem and then we kind of sunset a tub um during the I guess like bull market essentially uh and then we've resurrected it recently where every two weeks Eric Connor and I on The Daily way we'll be doing a a podcast for about 45 minutes an hour uh just talking about our views on ethereum and Eric brings a lot of unique insights to um you know to to the uh to the refuel or not the refill to the Daily way because you know people listening to me all the time you know you can kind of get used to my insights but Eric has has really great takes on things so I'm excited to be back with him on on that one there but yeah thanks Ryan for letting me do my little my little Shield plus one on those resources uh no one works harder and goes deeper than Anthony sassano in the daily Quay and um they're really excited to to see Into The Ether being resurrected in this uh new form it's always been one of my favorite podcasts uh bankless Nation gotta end with this as we always do of course none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks lot thanks everyone foreign
