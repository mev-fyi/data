[Music] hey bankless nation it is the fourth week of august david what time is it it is roll up time time to roll up the entire week of news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor and it's always for me the most fun piece of content that we produce here out of the bankless world so ryan let's go ahead and get right into it yeah you know what i feel like we're not just rolling up the the week here it almost feels like we're rolling up the summer a little bit david you know kids are going back to school this sort of thing we're creeping into september and it feels like we have a lot to roll up maybe create some themes out of the summer because it didn't turn out how i thought it would a little bit different wasn't necessarily defy summer layer two is kind of coming but it's not entirely here but oh my god nfts i think that's gonna be a major theme as we discuss it today yeah unlike the weather when you try and predict the the future of this summer in the crypto industry it just changes right right around you yeah and so what we thought was gonna be d5 summer which you know still still kind of was like there's a lot of stuff going on on layer two summer um but no it was definitely like jpeg season for sure jpeg summer that's what we got uh speaking of seasons guys we think a next season a future season don't know when it's going to become it's going to be dao season and so it makes sense to start get involved in all the dows you can as many as are interesting and exciting one of which are friends at tracer dao they are launching a new perpetuals product which is super cool it's going to be a new money lego primitive they're deploying that on layer 2 as well as layer 1 i believe and they're looking for contributors they're looking for governors they're looking for dow members if you think you can fill that role if you want to experiment in a dow try your first style maybe you're a dow master and you want to uh join another then go ahead and do that there will be a link to the tracer doubt discord in the show notes you can check that out all right david you ready to get into markets let's do it market time bitcoin what are we doing all right bitcoin started the week at the low low price of 48 000 going up to the highs of right above fifty thousand dollars so bitcoin brief nice fifty thousand dollars this week hit the high of fifty thousand four hundred dollars and it's been down ever since then so we are coming in right around the 47 000 mark at the time of recording look crabbing crabbing around this week but like you zoom out new highs are fantastic new highs are fantastic uh even though it didn't hold it like getting up above 50 000 is is really really nice the the lows keep on creeping up on august 4th it was a low of 38 000 on august roughly like 19th it was a low of 44 000 and we are currently uh maybe at a new high of a low at 47 000 if this is as low as bitcoin goes in the in like the the local seven day time period like that's really strong that's really strong yeah looking pretty good on the month for sure okay how about eth what's the story here ether started at 3 050 which is also the low for the week we climbed up to the high of 33 350 for the high uh and then we are currently back down just above 3 100 uh and so again a decently good week for ether um but again we we i mean no it was a good week but uh i did like that 3300 number and i wanted to be back there yeah i wanted to be back there you know what i just feel like it deserves to be back there post eip 1559 but when you start to talk about deserving maybe you shouldn't talk that way right like we are not entitled to any of the games that we receive in crypto let that be a lesson to everyone who subscribes to uh bankless content um okay let's talk about this though eat bitcoin what are we doing on the ratio here yeah we've been bleeding a little bit for the past like seven days or so but again a really high uh threshold currently at point zero .066 uh ether bitcoin ratio not too much to talk about just kind of still in that ranging in that high plateau area maybe a little bit on the higher side maybe higher middle um i don't know 0.066 is still a really strong number this is starting to look like the conclusion of the summer david and it always brings me to the question of uh what will fall bring what will the next season bring in krypto and i'm curious if we're just hanging here and then getting ready to launch up or whether we get some more crab or or down i guess those are all the options it's gotta be one of those available we we promise you it will be one of those three options all right let's talk about um total value locked in defy man i'm hoping any any day now we're going to be reporting out that we hit that 100 billion mark but we're not there yet 82 billion any more thoughts on this david yeah eight billion away from breaking a new all-time high and total value locked in defy i believe we're at 80 billion last uh last weekly rolled up and we are at 82 billion right now ave continues to dominate uh at the top number one total value a total value locked in ave uh and yeah i think all it really takes is like man if ether can break 3 300 in some of the assets that are in defy all appreciate a little bit like it'll absolutely break through the the all-time high of 90 billion locked indeed you know someone's talking uh on on twitter to me david i'm wondering your thoughts on this so the fact that eth has been so strong lately and this was a tweet i mentioned about all the eats were burning um he asked the question is that bad for dpi is that bad for defy tokens to have a very strong eth with supply shrinking um i i'll give you my thoughts but i'm curious to hear yours first do you think that a strong eath is bad for defy tokens uh in dollar terms absolutely not in ether terms perhaps yeah like i i think ether is going to be a really really hard asset to outperform like it's ultrasound money how are you supposed to compete with that uh and so defy tokens for eath is like a it's going to be a massive tug of war i kind of view these things as kind of like a binary star system is like you know they're kind of rotating around each other one benefits the other which benefits the other but even when binary star systems there's usually one star that's bigger than the other and like the compelling case behind ether is that it's a really really big gravitational black hole of a bunch of value yeah you definitely want to have both you definitely want to have all three if you can we'll get to the bed index in a minute but let's talk about dpi that is the d5 pulse index so where are we where are we at for uh tokens on the week defy tokens that is a little bit down on the week still overall a very strong monthly performance but we started uh dpi at roughly around 400 to start the week and we have fallen down to 370 dollars per dpi token which is roughly about the low for the week so a little bit down on the week for dpi let's check our seasons are we in d5 season no no we're not david uh are we below 0.13 we are below point one three we are at point one two but again the bottom is strong the bottom is strong your prediction was point one two instead of one three i mean you're holding you're holding pretty close to that right yeah you know horseshoes and hand grenades right okay so it's nft season it's not yet defy season and are we awaiting the return of fifa is now a time to go check out these uh interesting defy token gems what do you think i mean we're always waiting for defy season right like it's always right around the corner as soon as nfts can shut the hell up we can we can have a defy season maybe um but like like i've been saying like the bottom on dpi eath is the bottom of his painting is like really really strong it's hit that point one two level over and over and over again and granted it could just break through and fall and fall even more everything anything is possible it could go up flat or down we all know this um but like like we've been saying nfts are really really loud and generally that's been kind of the time to allocate into really really quiet things um that's kind of like a nice rule of thumb you know every rule of thumb has like an equal and opposite like counterpoint to make but you know if generally buying things when things are quiet has like worked out yeah agreed especially if you are buying and holding let's talk about the uh bed index that's another index that we track this is a combination one-third bitcoin one-third eth and one-third dpi all put together what are we looking at on the week yeah deep excuse me bed started at the week of around 140 hit the high of 162 dollars and is currently at 145 dollars ryan can you hit the three month on on the bed dude it has ever since inception bed has just performed beautifully it has hasn't had like a down maybe it's had like a down week here or there but like no the whole entire thing is a straight line up and to the right on the on the three month chart which i think is really longer than the bet has even existed so like it's really the maximum chart ever since bed launched up 54 again bad index best crypto index of all time it's gonna be interesting to see this one perform over time i'm excited about it um all right let's talk about a big story which is look dude over a hundred thousand eath is now burnt we just passed that milestone a hundred thousand twenty days is by the time people are listening is 21 days from launch over a hundred thousand each burnt that's um what are some of the numbers here david in terms of per day per minute seven each per day is that what that equals yeah so uh uh go ahead and scroll down and go to that fee burn and okay so we see the all time ever since eip1559 got launched we've had an average of 3.3 eth burned per minute but if you go and uh turn those those metrics more recently like i think yesterday the 24 hour level had like nine eth being burnt per minute uh today it's 6.2 eth being burned per minute so especially in the last week we have seen very very ultrasound ether uh ryan go to that burn leader board and hit all and you can actually see how much of this is actually nft activity because of the 100 000 ether that's got burnt the biggest burner is open seeds these are crushing it 15 or 15 million ether so nfts just on openc not including the other nft platforms it's 15 of all ether burn which means 15 of all economic activity flowing through ethereum is open c and buying and selling nfts which is pretty crazy yeah that burn rate i think i said earlier that burner is 70th per day of course that's wrong i meant uh youth per minute right um but this openc activity is absolutely crazy dude like um why are people spending this much on open c i did a little like i i haven't done much with nfts you know this david yeah but uh i i i did a little bit this week and i was like blown away by the gas fees i've seen high gas fees in e and eve before of course ethereum no stranger to that but like to buy an open c nft 130 worth of gas right for something that's i don't know some of these some of these are trading under 100. like you're not going to pay that i can't believe people are paying this much for nfts on openc well the erc 721 contract which is the nft like token contract is much more gas intensive than a simple erc20 transfer so it automatically gets the complexity premium associated with it as well plus um there's like royals he's involved with openc and so like you know there's some and so there's contract uh information with that um and overall uh nf 721s are just overall more computationally intensive so they come with a higher gas premium um but like the reason why people are paying these gas prices is because like they think that their 100 gas transaction will net them more than 100 worth of profit when they flip their nft if they're flipping their nft or they just want to buy and hold the nft and the it's worth 100 to them so people are just baking in the gas prices into the into the valuation of the nft when they buy it it's a lot of nfts though hanging out on main net not so many on layer 2 or side chains it's going to be interesting to see um yeah so we did hit a new burn record i think you mentioned some of those metrics um eip 1559 dominance the transactions now we're at 50 so that means 50 of all ethereum transactions are now eip 1559 transactions not the legacy transactions that's moved up a lot since last time we talked about it i think last time it was like hovering around 20 30 or so now we're up to 50. this is going to go all the way to like eighty ninety percent right a hundred percent it's going it's approaching a hundred percent with with certainty and just for there's no no confusion every single transaction ultimately becomes an eip15559 transaction there's a legacy transaction that like you're allowed to use and still is compatible but like it's less optimal as in you might accidentally be overpaying versus the base fee and so this is really on the wallet providers people like metamask metamask eip159 support rolled out and so it's really just allowing the users to uh optimally express save some money right save some money right yeah but literally everything everything ultimately becomes an eip1559 transaction at the end of the day it all burns eth okay let's talk more about some that open c volume david so folks can see the uh the axis of this chart here but that axis on the left is 200 million at the top look man this is open c volume um i earlier in the week there was celebration of three days over a hundred million dollars in volume those are days 100 million per day i'm looking at this and i'm seeing days over 200 million in volume now on openc absolutely insane daily usd volume on openc crazy man and all of this is denominated in eth as well which is also staggering right like you can actually sell your nfts for usdc on openc but no one actually does it which is crazy yeah um yeah the the biggest three days one is like 160 million per day 193 million per day and then the highest one is 208 million per day so three really strong days in a row and and the fourth day today isn't even over yet um and this to me just kind of feels like when uniswap finally experienced like defy summer in 2020 like uniswap hadn't really experienced the bull market before then and it blasted up the nft platforms also have are yet to experience bull markets except for the one that's going on right now and so we really see open c really dominating in the volume on nfts open seats like kind of like the unit swap of nfts except for the fact there's a very very big difference on openc centralized blah blah blah but like as like market share and share it's a killer app yeah it's a killer app of nfts now and it this might be 100 million days might be the new normal for openc i think it's really interesting when you start comparing openc to like the uh traditional web 2 companies we might be familiar with or web one this is eric connor saying open c is at 70 of ebay's volume now 70 of ebay in terms of transaction volume uh he makes a kind of equip here i'm sure this is all just money laundering and wash fading though it's nothing commenting dc's comment blower are so funny he goes  that reminds me i forgot to move my drape eggs to the dryer right wait is that is that a thing are people talking about nfts and money laundering as like a way to explain this i haven't seen that now yeah i've heard murmurings about this i haven't actually seen any evidence for this but like in theory it's like super possible right so like you own an nft you like you p to p sell it to another wallet and then you sell it to that wallet turns out that wallet is also your wallet but only you know that uh and so you can kind of like get rid of your nft and put ether in a different i don't i don't know i don't whenever i've seen this comment though david it always seems like just a little bit of salt somebody's just angry about nfts because maybe they're angry about ethereum because just maybe they're an angry individual i don't see any evidence of money laundering substantiation and that sort of thing going on i mean the critics will say like yeah that's the point right like no one can it's completely deniable and completely unprovable so maybe this actually does turn into a broader conversation um but like until until like something somebody like chain alice's comes in and says like with definitive because they're they're the only ones who can really actually have the data enough to actually prove this out david do you know what it goes back to though it's still going to be easier to money launder through traditional art just like it's easier to money launder through like is full of actual cash anything that's digital is just inherently a 10x easier to track doesn't matter what chain you're using oh ryan have you been reading the essay that's coming out on bankless on wednesday i talked about this oh really yeah nft nfts are all serialized right like every single nft is unique and traceable on ethereum uh the painting that i have in my bedroom that you can't see you don't know what that's like then it's not registered with the nation state it's not deployed on a theory no idea you have no idea you know what the picture is yeah right like is it is it 50 or 50 million you have no idea because and like neither does the united states government it's not 50 million dollars i was wondering it might be though it might be it there you go okay so this is another look compared to web 2 companies open c is about to break into the top 1000 list of websites in the known universe this is like an alexa ranking which ranks the most popular websites so openc the top 1000 just a little bit behind wow look at these though david these are some other crypto native websites etherscan is already broke the top 1 788 coinbase is 764. finance is 155. wow this is crypto just bursting into mainstream this is what this looks like and i think we'll we'll get to the top 100 for a number of these before long okay look at these numbers he finishes up saying gotta catch ebay at number 39 in etsy at number 70. right so like think of the how massive ebay and etsy are from like a traffic perspective and we're already almost like eric connor said we're at 70 of ebay's volume and this again we're talking about this on the last weekly roll up this just goes to show like how scalable digital goods are because you don't have to ship anything they're not physical they're not actually atoms and so like one person can actually account for like a hundred times more volume on openc than they ever would on ebay or etsy uh and so there's there's and so like we expect digital volume uh of digital goods to completely dwarf physical goods just because it's they're unencumbered right uh and so like it's cool to see the volume flip but also it's also would be cool to actually see like the users flip as well yeah i mean how much more revenue per customer are you driving is another way to look at this like i feel like web 2's metrics primarily are about like daily active user the number of um visitors on the site and that sort of thing and that's all important when you have an attention economy but when you have like an economy that's all about capital coordination and capital then you're looking at other things you're looking at things denominated in like assets under management trading volume the amount of revenue that's flowing through these become more important metrics when we're looking at like web3 and crypto look if openc is at just almost at what 1 000 in the top websites and it's basically almost on par with uh ebay volume imagine what happens if like open c turns into like something closer to like where ebay is on the websites at number 39 like how much volume do you think openc's gonna be doing then this is the bookcase this is why it's easy to say nfts are in a mania but then you also say but like are they but like what about the future yeah i i don't know um my neighbors aren't talking about nfts yet you know what i mean like i'm not having casual conversations with anybody so it's what's the top signal david i don't know love to see all right let's talk about this tornado cash this is another i think good indicator of um market health there's over 218 000 ether locked inside of tornado cash i think this means aetherians value privacy tornado cash of course listeners are unfamiliar this is a privacy protocol on top of ethereum so you push money in it kind of jumbles it mixes it around and individuals don't know what your address is coming out of it so this is great if you value privacy on chain i think a lot of people do this they don't want to dox themselves in their address by shuffling funds through an exchange but then of course the exchange knows your identity aml kyc this is a way to do this purely on chain and i think is a sign of good things super cypherpunk application and just you know really instantiating the rights of the individual inside of ethereum right you have the right to have private funds right now it's ether only but when the reason the rationale behind why ether inside of tornado cash when that number goes up that means like more and more people can and can access more and more privacy the more ether in tornado cash the more privacy uh that you are able to achieve think of think of yourself as like a little uh fish inside of a bigger school of fish if that school of fish is massive you're even more safe right you're more safe from the sharks uh and so like the pride the ability for individuals to access privacy tools is going up which is the through line here yeah i've always wondered what the what a potential authoritarian aggressive nation state's reaction to something like this is because there's been talk before that in confusion well exactly they'll be confused at first but there also could be there i mean there has been talk about um making us uh privacy coins illegal like something like a z cash or era but what's interesting about this is like this is an app inside of ethereum so like you don't want to make all of ethereum illegal do you in your jurisdiction so do you make this particular privacy app illegal and what are the implications of that and you know is there a world david in a in a future dystopia where you have exchanges that are not allowed to interact with any ether dress that has interacted with tornado cache i don't know but if that's the case we still have an entire decentralized banking economy we don't have to use those exchanges we can start trading on uniswap and doing this sort of thing so um i'm not sure where this is all going to evolve but i love where ethereum is uh positioned in that it has these cypherpunk tools available to an individual who's trying to become self-sovereign there's and there's there's definitely ways where like authoritarian or top-down controlling nation-states can like get what they want because like if you have a doc's address and you want to use tornado cash to become private you're free to use it but everyone can see your funds going into tornado cash they just don't know where they're going out from but like if you are like getting in trouble with your country because you forgot to pay your taxes always pay your taxes so you don't have to deal with this but like they say oh like you sent a hundred ether into tornado cash like where'd that go and you don't get to be like well i don't know i don't know where it went like that's not going to work that's not going to work exactly exactly um all right let's talk about this too this is another good number indicator for ethereum over 1 million eth now staked in lido finance huge huge for lido a number of other staking things haven't launched yet uh we're waiting for a rocket pool quite anxiously but um lido has just been crushing it recently and this is the closest thing if you're looking for a staking provider the best thing you can do is run your own validator at your house sticky that way but um if you're not going to do that and you're looking at staking service companies aside from rocket pool which is probably maximally decentralized lida is probably second your only other option is some kind of a centralized exchange or centralized staking service provider so it's good to see i think it's good to see yeah and lido's strategy has always been like go to market first decentralization later and they have very like very concrete paths towards the whole decentralization thing um but they the their strategy has been like well if no one goes to market as soon as possible on like with with a decentralization ethos then the staking as a service centralized exchanges are just going to take up all the all the market share right and so they their strategy has always been like market share first decentralization later um and i mean the strategy has generally worked out for them uh they have a million ether locked in inside of lido now the path is can they actually decentralize fun fact i'm actually a lp a staked ether from lido with ether normal ether inside a balancer earning a cool 8 percent apy in ether denominated terms and also earning ldo oh ldo rewards uh so that's what i'm doing that's cool did you buy that steak ether david you don't mind me asking uh no is that a result of actually staking it a result of actually staking it i actually sent ether and so like some of this one million ether is mine some of it maybe uh nine hundred thousand or something right yeah give or take a little bit more yeah give or take you know put that fifty million dollar dollar uh paid thing in your bedroom all right uh guys we will be back with the hot releases of the week of course some news and our takes but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smartchain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets arbitrarum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing defy too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrome arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord all right guys we are back with the news of the week the first is this euler announced this is different if you've heard of euler beats this is euler which is a um a lending protocol sort of a uniswap for lending is kind of the original idea this has been a long time in progress what's the tldr on this one yeah this is supposed to be a governance minimized lending platform uh which is why ryan just compared it to uniswap but it functions a little bit more like ave or compound right borrowing and lending money markets in between determined by algorithms but with uh fewer governance controls uh and so we we on the bankless nation like the protocol seeing thesis uh the less governance and the less powers that humans have over these things the more systemically scalable they are the more trustless they are and so this is an experimentation on governance minimized lending platforms um disclaimer ryan and i are seed investors in euler with paradigm there you go okay let's talk about um lyra on optimism so i think we've mentioned lyra a few times which is basically a a derivatives exchange that wouldn't really be possible on the ethereum base layer well it is possible in layer two they just deployed on optimism i haven't tried this out yet but super exciting to see any other thoughts here yeah this is i've never really been an options guy i've kind of never really wrapped my head around them always kind of just been a spot market individual but options with ethereum with ether sounds really really interesting maybe i finally dive into options on on layer two uh if anyone knows a really good like tactic or is interested in writing one hit us up absolutely i think we'll publish something with lyra here soon for sure um this is cool from justin drake in the category of releases kind of releases breakthroughs baby that's a new category meb research okay when justin drake says research there's lots of people talk about research breakthroughs all of the time in crypto right but when justin drake says it i gotta take notice have you read about this what's going on uh i have not read about this but i actually was able to talk to justin drake he mentioned this in the um layer zero podcast episode i was recording with him and he was like wait when is this coming out can i talk about this and i was like it's not coming out for three weeks so you can definitely talk about this so he talks about what's going on uh the breakthrough is that uh ether is becoming even more ultra sound okay so we have the base fee right stop and oh yeah yeah right uh-huh get ready for this all right like you know grab onto your seats um the breakthrough is i like justin drake accurately predicted that base fee would be between 60 and 70 percent of ether burned uh turns out that's actually about right we are around 70 ether burned with that 30 percent uh of tips being paid to miners and that tip is largely mev right like minor extractable value um or or now really maximally extractable value and this is uh just the the fighting for the rights to um to have a certain transaction in a specific spot uh and like it's actually relatively significant like most base fee most transactions are just like you know the average base fee with no tip but a few of them are a little bit of base fee and comparatively a massive tip uh and so that actually accounts for roughly 30 of all ether fees um being paid to uh actually validators rather than the ethereum protocol the breakthrough is that apparently the this guy that justin drake has been working with i i his name escapes me i haven't actually met him yet discovered how we can burn the remaining 30 of ether this is the first time anyone has heard this by the way i'm pretty sure bank list is the first content company whatever to actually talk about this we are we are earning the other 30 uh so we with this according to what justin drake told me we are able to approach a 100 burn rate of ether for all transactions because of the way that this uh committee-driven mev smoothing mechanism allows us to instead of taking that tip and paying it to one validator smoothing it across uh a larger time frame i need to read this article i'm but i'm also going to be recording with justin drake and the individual who like sort of cracked this code and so there's going to be a bankless youtube video about this coming soon but basically yes uh they've found a way a possible way to capture the remaining tip uh and actually burn it over time uh i think i think that's how this works um and also that seems that seems to have good implica like ramifications for mev itself and that mdv becomes less of a problem correct on the main chain i'm sure it's not eliminated can't eliminate it but less of a problem yeah okay that that's enough of a teaser now i'm definitely tuning in to both uh the the layer zero episode and the justin drake episode coming out so guys another reason to subscribe to youtube i'm not sure if we're gonna be publishing the full thing on the podcast but subscribe to youtube you'll get that justin drake tldr on mev smoothing that way ultrasound money becoming more ultrasound how do you even get more ultrasound than ultrasound like it just keeps on going i gotta tell you you know that the podcast ultrasound money podcast we recorded with justin was that february march around that time look that's going to be completely prophetic right like even the estimates he did in the follow-up podcast where he was like yeah probably 70 to 80 um you know burn like that's been radon on point so if you're looking to understand the future of what's going to happen next because this is like not even the halfway mark uh mark we're like a third into this ultrasound money experiment go listen that episode like we laid it down for you justin drake laid it down for all of us in the ultrasound money episode now it's just you have to be patient and wait for it to play out the the funny thing is when i recorded the layer zero podcast with with justin again not out yet it'll be out in a few weeks um like we couldn't help to talk about ethereum and like more more like of like you know ethereum and ether stuff and like i was just having a casual conversation with him and like the alpha just kept on coming out right it's like oh my god i haven't even thought about that so you got to tune into that episode too so good guys all right uh hop protocol what are they doing hot protocol you can now hop your assets between ethereum and optimism using the hop bridge uh hop is uh trying to solve that seven day withdrawal period coming out of optimistic roll-ups uh and everyone was kind of concerned about this no one really wants to wait seven days to get their assets back but everyone was like oh yeah well we can just make bridges and you can pay a small fee and then you can bridge instantaneously and so this got deployed so the problem was actually solved even before anyone was even able to complain about it so that's pretty cool um and yeah it's literally live right so this this interface looks just like uniswap right but like there's one extra instead of swapping tokens you're swapping bridges right uh and so you instead of all in in addition to going from optimism to ethereum you can also go from optimism to polygon right and so you select your asset uh and then you have your genesis chain and then you have your destination chain and then it'll tell you how much like you have to pay in fees right so we we have 420.759 usdc on optimism and then via hop exchange hop.exchange you can go to polygon for 420.69 usdc wow nice nice nice joke guys nice joke guys okay you only pay seven cents to go from optimism to polygon which is the point you know what's blowing my mind is this is all happening so quickly now it used to be the case that there'd be a problem like um it takes a long time to withdraw from a roll-up and then be like okay research and then months and months of work and then maybe six months later you get kind of a partial solution and a half works now i feel like stuff is just happening right in the d5 ecosystem like boom boom boom so many different teams so much capital deployed here so much talent deployed in this industry that we are just getting solutions to these problems like in in the space of like before we can complain about them we can't even make any drama about it yeah like i'm no longer angry about withdrawals now from my excuse i'm very happy uh david speaking of layers tell us about layer zero yeah so some guy in the bankless world is releasing a new podcast as if there aren't any enough already uh so there's a layer zero podcast coming out on the bankless rss feed if you are a deep bankless listener you might have noticed that come out on uh the rss feed this uh tuesday with dimitri buterin the the father co-founder of vitalik and this is all about a show that focuses on the people of the ethereum community not just the code or the tech right because there are people writing the code and writing the tech which means the the brain behind the code has other things going on in its life that also impacts the code that it's rights and i want to find out what those other things are as we say on the bank list program it's always layer 0 all the way down and it always has been and so the persons behind the code become extremely important as the code that we all use dictate how we live our lives and so i want to explore the lives of the people in the ethereum community so like i said uh dimitri buterin came out on tuesday eric connor is coming out next tuesday justin drake is coming out the tuesday after that and then then i believe i got anthony cesano lined up as well uh it's going to be a fun time plus one on the on this uh it's just a great it's a different format for bank this one that works really well so my wife like occasionally listens to our bankless podcast david like you know here or there she'll be interested in a guest or a topic but like i told her i was like you know i know it gets into the weeds in a lot of bankless content material but you're gonna love layer zero because it's all people and stories so it's relatable and she loves that kind of content and um yeah it's just a different format really unique kind of interview style and experience like you asked the co-founder of vitalik different questions than we would ask on a typical ethereum uh podcast like you know do you ever fear for vitalik safety interesting question how did you meet vitalik's mom like really interesting life experience stories like and uh dimitri talked about growing up in russia and what that was like and how that has changed his and impacted his view on the world so anyway really cool stuff um as always we are we are bringing the i think some of the most interesting crypto content in the space to the forefront and uh we we thank you guys for uh for listening to us every week as we as we do this as we're on this journey uh brian's also stoked he just gets to sit back and listen to podcasts rather than producing i did no and i just got it like popped up in my my um rss reader my podcast uh device and i was just like oh this is great now i can just enjoy this right nice and speaking of brand new content coming out of the bankless ecosystem we also have a brand new anchor to the to the bankless content sphere we got luke coming in with tl dr which we have put out like at least like 10 to 15 hours worth of content on the bank list program and so luke does a fantastic job rolling it up for you uh in a tl dr format so this is these are like nine to like 12 minute long videos summarizing all the content that came out on bank lists uh and so if you want to roll up of the roll up uh hey subscribe to the youtube and also check out luke's brand new show tldr i expect really cool things to come out of this every sunday and you know what this this is great you take a week off bank list it's a long time you're on vacation whatever we understand right well you just catch up with this episode in 10 minutes you got the whole week in your brain um david let's talk raises so fractional we've had them on the podcast fact had and andy from fractional on this week where we talked all about nft mania go catch that episode too but they just completed a 7.9 million dollar raise seed funding from paradigm really cool to see this team get funded yeah fractional is such a silly silly stupid simple concept i'm not saying it's stupid i'm just like it's so incredibly simple that like every smart contract dev is like hitting themselves in the forehead like oh why didn't i think of that all you do is you put a erc 721 into a contract it fractionalizes it into a bunch of erc20s and then it has some contract logic to allow all those erc20s to be recalled and that have that original uh you know fractured nft could be composed back into one such a simple concept david so that's that billion dollar idea yeah you take erc 721s and we turn them back into erc20s well no see that's part of fractional that's what that's half of what fractional does right exactly it does this it does the fracturing and then it does the recomposition of them uh and that's basically what fractional is it's and so what this really allows uh nfts to to do is to become collateral in d5 as an erc20 token and ave or compound they can feel secure about putting an erc 721 or there are these these nfts as collateral because of the way that the mechanism of fractional allows for the reconstitution of the nft it's an atomic swap between the nft and ether so if the nft ever gets sold the erc20s of that nft get swapped out with ether and all lending platforms except ether as collateral uh and so it's just a matter of an atomic swap between having an nft as collateral ultra having ether as collateral which is why these lending platforms can feel so secure and that's just one of the one of the first like use cases of fractional that could come out so congratulations to andy on the race bullish jpegs bullish composable jpegs that's what that means uh speaking of nfts and jpegs but other things as well immutable they launched they initiated the sale of imx tokens behind immutable x this is ethereum's first layer two a layer two using starcraft technology that is dedicated to nft trading good time for this um here's the kicker david people can purchase it unless they live where in the united states right yep because of the sec i feel i feel so protected by by the sec protecting me from drops yeah so you said the sales initiated it actually starts on september 8th so this is kind of like fair fair warning to anyone who is interested in participating in the imx token sale is starting on september 8th uh l2s and nfts i think are really really important to unlocking a bunch of possible new activities i really think where like the high value nfts like crypto punks and like fidenzas they're going to stay on l1 just because those things are like millions of dollars you don't necessarily need scale if you're going to pay like you're going to pay like 50 gas fees for a million dollar crypto punk that's fine uh but for things like gaming or or high frequency trading of nfts or david like we were saying earlier like i don't want to pay 130 just to mint an initial nft right but like i don't necessarily want to go to a side chain either like i want to stay in the ethereum ecosystem and have the security of ethereum particularly for high value nfds and that's why this layer two is nice because it provides you the security of um layer one right this is not this is not even roll-up it's darkware tech so it's all like zk magic um that's what's super cool about it and i wonder in addition to trading if we start to see some minting going on in layer two and then once it surpasses a certain amount of value then maybe it moves too back to layer one absolutely yeah think about all the people in the world who like are compelled by like jpeg trading which are a lot even we know that a lot of people come to ethereum just because they like the game of nfts and they don't give a flying f about what ethereum is or like eip1559 or ether uh and so like think about how many of those people there are in the world and like that's what immutablex unlocks is people that don't care about ethereum but really love nfts they're going to find themselves on immutable because like you know minimize gas fees instantaneous trades you know super scalable it's just going to be where a lot of people call home yeah you won't even know you're using it also disclaimer ryan and i are early seed investors in this as well also true let's talk about this wow just raised 16 million dollars to tokenize music royalties look when we had him on bank list he said he was gonna do it i guess this is him doing it yeah no he said that straight out like that was one of the last things he said it's like yeah i want to help artists tokenize their revenue and like in my mind instantaneously went like uh so you want to make a security uh and smart too super smart knows what to do absolutely uh justin blau the dj um grammy award-winning dj i believe and uh the platform is called royal right which is a fantastic name that's a really hot name yeah io royal royal as in like royalty and then royal as in also in royalties which makes a ton of sense uh i really hope i really hope this gets instantaneous adoption like the whole like if this is a security thing is one conversation but like at the end of the day let's democratize financial access and financial tooling towards creators let's make artists more easily able to tap into revenue streams like a security aside like security is like an invention of like nation state regulation so that's a separate conversation it would be unfortunate if this didn't work out because of securities but let's generate financial tooling so artists can get paid for their creativity so we can have this cultural revolution that we all want but you know what this is going to force the conversation david because how stupid is it if uh blau or any other artist rules out a portion of like their music and allows fans to participate in royalties we have this infrastructure set up how stupid is it for the sec to then say no sorry are you an accredited investor you have to have a net worth over a million dollars a fraction of blouse um newest newest album how crazy so it's gonna force the conversation right it is a conversation we've never had because i remember jay clayton the early days he was like we can use the securities laws from 1930s and the 19 because nothing's new here nothing ever is new and i'm like no this is completely new you can't just like take securities laws that were written for a stock market in the 1930s and try to apply that to today's uh defy infrastructure we're talking totally different things so it's going to force that conversation right right if if artists feel uncomfortable about this because of securities laws like that is a huge loss towards uh united states innovation and united states cultural innovation right and cultural expression like we literally will have a stunted culture because of this if the sec comes and like starts starts preventing anything so uh wow i know you listen to the show if you need any of like our support happy to help you out with this all this reminds me of course guys if you are looking for a job in crypto go find a job one place to do that is job boards we will include that a link in the show notes some hot jobs this week a senior front end web 3 developer at tracerdao we're just mentioning them earlier and hey there's immutable they need a senior product manager to work on that fancy new layer 2 that they have deployed also a full stack ng software engineer at pallet check out some of the best jobs in crypto and go to the bankless jobs website a link will be there for you in the show notes or just google bankless jobs it's highly likely that all of these jobs a are a way more fun than whatever your your dumb legacy job is but also probably come with like tokens too right so think about that when you when you go down to this drawboard we all had legacy jobs right we are just uh very excited for you to join the bank the the crypto industry and partaking this journey in a new way so uh check that out good cop bad cop yeah we got both methods news david let's talk news look man this is the biggest news visa the plastic probably in your wallet you probably have a visa card if you're listing this they just purchased a crypto punk right dude that blew my mind they purchased a crypto punk for their balance sheet like the company went out i don't think they bought some eats but they they used eth through a third party in order to purchase a crypto punk ethan's money crypto punks are cultural internet cultural artifacts and fortune 500 companies are jumping into the fray here this is insane to me it's so funny that like i mean visa has already had some sort of integration with usdc payments and so they are already working on like settling payments on ethereum but like the the headline of just like you know announcement visa announces that it in instead of like settling payments on ethereum it's like visa bought a crypto punk it's like not even at all their core competency competency turns out visa has a collection of historic commerce artifacts from early paper credit cards to the zip zap machine is what they say on the tweet i have no idea what is it that's the zip zap machine no clue but apparently it's a cultural artifact uh and so they're adding crypto punks to their like uh collection of cultural artifacts that's awesome hey what do you think about this crypto punk um crypto punk expert pretty ugly crypto punk so it's got it's got the the mohawk uh green eye shadow red lipstick female um so it was definitely a floor punk uh but it definitely looks like a punk it looks like a punk that's right it's a legit punk it's a legitimate important yeah look they even uh changed their profile picture i think they changed it yeah damn they've rug pulled us they used to have the crypto punk as their profile picture uh which is kind of funny because that means whoever is like leading this charge definitely knows like the profile picture nft game going on on crypto twitter who i think is partially leading this charge as um guy by the name of q sheffield who um we are trying to get on bankless hopefully he's coming in september dvd we'll see you guys um he has definitely been talking about that look at that this was big too budweiser just bought beer.eth for 30 for 30 they paid over a hundred thousand dollars for a beer.ethe ens name that's crazy look um there's some symbolism i think here i mean they were one of the early purchasers of all of the alcoholic beverage dot coms now here they are oh i didn't know that i mean yeah i mean like budweiser has to have their brand everywhere right and so um now they're recognizing that with i think this is related to nfts not only are ens names and nft but large companies are waking up to the fact that hey this is a new internet inspired movement in cultural movement and our brand needs to be part of this and associated with it and so this is not the way i thought uh corporate america would enter crypto david with culture culture first no i didn't think that i thought well you know um you know there's a time i thought well maybe they'll do enterprise blockchain stuff and then kind of migrate over well maybe they'll start to put crypto on their balance sheet yes some of that has happened uh in various pockets but it looks like the floodgates are just opening up because of nft starting with the memes starting with the memes and working backwards from there yeah we'll take it we'll take it uh anyway very cool visa buys a crypto punk budweiser purchasing beer.eth the first of many headlines like this i think we'll see um let's talk about this the ethereum client teams are getting a big donation from d5 protocols d5 apps this is pretty cool what's going on the story here goes all the way back because in the depth of the like the 2019 2020 bear market like ethereum almost ran out of funding right like client teams didn't have enough money the ethereum foundation it had their store of ether but that ether was 90 and so they had something i can't remember exactly the exact numbers but they were they were like you know running not running on fumes but like you could see the fumes on the horizon right and all of a sudden we had defy summer we had like the uniswap token uh lido's token has done fantastically well almost all of these tokens in the app layer have done fantastically so we have compound lido synthetics graph unit swap which all have tokens that have significantly outperformed and also kraken nice rob kraken all donating 250 000 each to support ethereum l1 client teams ethereum one client teams uh and so that's things like aragon nimbus go ethereum that's another mind and so we have the app layer returning the favor to the protocol layer which i think is really really cool in in terms of funding right like this is this is how you get a flywheel of an ecosystem like no we don't have to go out and ask for dollars we will build our own app layers with our own currencies with our own like defy tokens they'll go up in value because of the reasons that they do and then we will return that value back to the people that built the damn thing in the first place i think it's so self-sovereing it's so awesome it's such a circular economy and it's completely inside of the values of ethereum which is absolutely fantastic yeah total agree i've got like nothing to add except that better this sort of funding than issuance to protocol teams at the dev layer that is less credibly neutral in my opinion that was a serious consideration in 2018 and we're solving it a different way which is awesome to see cough kevin lucky yes shout out kevin owaki bitcoins for spurring a lot of this on um let's talk about this ave maybe doing an app right on your phone mobile app is awesome i've yet to see a d5 mobile app really take off especially for an app specific one but ave has such a large ecosystem that it makes sense that they would go first plus they also tend to develop in like literally every single direction and also do it really really well um so that's going to be a little bit interesting i wonder if this would be like a native wallet on your phone uh it's also interesting to know that ave is like significantly diving into the world of social media in web 3. they're doing everything the fact that they are building an app alongside like also experimenting with social media is kind of interesting like they are basically just building out an entire empire yeah it's really cool to see um good good job ave the team that keeps shipping um speaking of another team that's shipping starcx we're doing it more quietly but this is powering a lot of the layer two ecosystem that's up today um the zk roll up ecosystem in particular so dydx and diversify um and then also so rare and immutable coming up we mentioned immutable uh earlier but the the the headline is starcx just crossed 10 billion in cumulative trading across dydx and diversify super cool to see that 10 billion in trading yeah a significant amount in this activity definitely comes off of the tailwinds from the dydx token turns out tokens garner communities and garnered communities put volume onto layers that have the tokens involved with them so that makes a ton of sense uh and so yeah congratulations to starkex and dydx yeah let's talk about some of the dydx success metrics while we're at it david what are they doing here what are some of the highlights yeah antonio from dydx who we've also had on the show if you guys want more details about this it says daily trading volume over 400 million for the first day and growing 73 000 lifetime users with 34 000 added since launch again the power of token and then also 1.8 million dollars in revenue towards dydx per week so that's pretty cool that is a successful app if ever i've seen one yep sorry if you're a us investor you can't have the dydx rip token just a reminder that's sad 90 crypto punks hey look let's talk about crypto punks in general but i love let me start with this headline because it's kind of been crypto punk week month i'm not sure the 90 crypto punks just got snapped up in one hour following visas 150 000 purchase so large company enters it's bullish for the entire crypto punks market and 90 gets swapped up at once that's not an individual it's got to be some sort of capital pool um some sort of a fund swapping these up oh no that's just like everyone that's not any one specific person that's just like one visa announced that they got their crypto punk and so everyone foam owed and bought like 90 more in the next like outcome that raises the floor right right exactly right because people are just like okay this is now a financial asset i don't even care what the punk is i'll just buy the cheapest one it's super super ugly uh but like it's also a quarter million dollars for the cheapest one crypto punk's had an absolutely insane week and so there uh the this dude analytics dashboard for crypto punks which i really really like you can see the url at the top uh if it has a weekly volume chart a little bit further down ryan and a couple weeks ago we had these all the two all-time highs bars uh in in weekly volume uh keep going just keep growing a little bit more down there you go right there we go bar chart a little bit uh there we go okay two super high uh all-time high charts uh and then and that was uh two weeks ago before this week and then this week which again it's thursday at the time of recording so probably by the time you're listening to it the most recent bar is going to dwarf the previous two weeks in punk volume so punk volume is on track to set an all-time high in weekly volume this week yeah that's incredible a huge week for crypto punks um let's talk about general bullishness on nfts this is one of the leads of youtube this is the head of gaming look he follows bankless look at that oh no on that i'm bullish on nfts he says i believe play to earn is the next major gaming model as well as an open market for in-game digital assets most in-game assets are liquid which is insane to me all of this will change long term though through blockchains and nfts it's self-evident self-evident this is ryan wyatt who is uh the head of gaming at youtube calling nfts for gaming now self-evident and that's the wave we haven't seen hit aside from axes but maybe that's where things are headed next just imagine think of it think of ryan watt uh you works at youtube so like his job is more or less they get more attention on to youtube and we already have an insane amount of attention with like you know esports and gaming right like gaming has all the attention it needs but now add financial assets on top of that right so like if you win or lose a game you win or lose nfts right imagine some sort of like object permanence with the outcome of gamers think about how much more attention there is when there's financial loss or financial rewards at the outcome of some of these games and so that is like the collision course that we are seeing behind nfts on ethereum and like the world of gaming that is what we are seeing on the horizon like it could happen so quickly too uh yeah so you don't want to get lost left behind on this trend uh neither does facebook so this is david marcus who is the lead of facebook's used to be called libra now it's called dm project um facebook and novi that's the wallet behind facebook are definitely looking to integrate nfts as well so facebook social media platforms talking about the interaction integration of nfts like this could be so huge i mean just imagine uh instagram starts doing something with nfts right it's a perfect platform right for social sharing of nfts like i mean the platform where everyone tries and flexes on each other and has their own social signals all social social that's exactly right that's the whole that's the whole platform so like why not do it with nfts of course that's going to happen like guys david sometimes i feel like so much of this is just right in front of us it's like if this happens then this will happen and look i mean we could trace exactly what's going to happen every single social media platform from reddit to facebook to instagram hell linkedin i don't know you like they're all going to incorporate nfts encrypted you have to it's going to happen they can't get left behind and i think that's going to be an outcome of jpeg summer it's basically everybody in the web 2 world's going to wake up and be like oh this is a thing what's our nft strategy david you know what should it be and that's going to be an outcome a lot of movement on that i think two weeks ago in the market monday for bankless i talked about the intersection between defy and nft and ryan i know that you were in the same camp with me i thought defy was going to be like how ethereum goes mainstream's like oh we have these all financial primitives you can literally make more money by living in this defy world that's what's going to pull in so many people to ethereum it pulled in a fair amount but no nfts are absolutely dominating defy as like ethereum's like marketing layer i kind of call nfts is like ethereum peacocking itself to the world and like look look at after just like two or three weeks of just like manic nft activity we get visa to buy a crypto punk we get the head of facebook finances uh says he's interested in incorporating nfts we have youtube head of gaming saying like nfcs are absolutely a thing like everyone has like negatives negative things to say about like a mania because that's everyone everyone gets really excited but then a lot of people get really bitter but no one can argue with how much positive marketing this nft movement has done for ethereum and what's about to come after as a result of that look you know the other thing for these big companies david with nfts no regulatory risk you're not going to piss off anyone with a jpeg right like i bet you i'm i don't actually not so convinced about that i bet you that i bet you the sec could find a way maybe they will but what i'm saying is like this is not like the ico market or something certificate something like that is uh anti-bank i guess or aml kyc they're just jpegs how mad can you get uh about like a board ape or a cryptic punk um and and if you can you need to do some self-reflection far less regulatory risk i think that's why they're making a move here bitcoin world what's happening in bitcoin is uh microstrategy is purchasing some more go michael saylor he is nothing if not consistent he just bought another 177 million dollars worth of bitcoin just dollar cost averaging his way in michael saylor come on just one crypto punk just one just one like it's the only thing we talk about personally what else is okay the the other like bitcoin news is that like hash rate is returning to bitcoin also with ethereum you can see in the gpu market as well uh and like other than that like god bitcoin is so boring david you know what look so like for the listener here are our notes right so they showed us i like i print them off because i have because you're a boomer sorry i have it on my second screen a young younger guy would do as a younger guy yes but i'm old i i don't know i can't see well whatever um so i'm looking at the notes but like every week we've been looking to add some additional bitcoin stuff and what i thought we tried we try our best in december of last year when everyone was very excited about um companies adding bitcoin to the balance sheet i thought by now every single week david we'd be like oh you know mastercard uh jpmorgan uh here are the lists of companies adding central bank of argentina yeah you know boom balance sheet what have we got every week we get michael saylor like once again that's michael it's him cost averages we had some news about el salvador like it just hasn't happened and i'm not like excited or gleeful about that i'm just like um it's something that the crypto market i think has been wrong about right that aspect has not happened very fast or as fast as everyone was thinking you know six nine months ago but the nft thing hit a lot of people by surprise right i mean we'll see how long the nft like market lasts it's lasted a whole entire quarter now uh i mean we were using that metaphor of like you know michael saylor starts allocating to big bitcoin and he does it again then he does it again and then like one more company does it and then another company does it and then another company does it that that did that did happen and then we were using that metaphor of like the guy like dancing at the festival and he's like dancing solo and then a bunch of more people come it kind of just feels like everyone else except for that one guy went back to their scene just michael are out there there's just michael saylor left just like dancing out there like it kind of accident everyone goes yeah i'm bored i'm going back to my seat it's weird it still might happen i mean i remember he was putting on seminars and there were like supposedly hundreds of various uh executives attending these things but i don't know maybe they're all just waiting and seeing um hey earlier in this episode i said you should allocate to things when they're quiet and so like to be consistent i'll say the same thing like maybe bitcoin is just quiet right now and and maybe maybe this is the time to allocate to bitcoin there you go yeah i'm time to allocate is when it's got one headline a week which is michael saylor um i'm allocate maybe let's talk about this someone who is buying is the crypto industry and i think this is super bullish this happened last thursday or friday after our last weekly roll up was recorded but coinbase has revealed a board approval to purchase 500 million dollars of crypto on their balance sheet that's adding 500 million to their existing crypto holdings i'm not sure what the value of those are but i imagine it's significant and then on top of that they're going to be investing 10 percent of profit moving forward into crypto by crypto what do we mean not just bitcoin not even just bitcoin underneath bitcoin ethe and defy surprise surprise those are the main investments according to the coinbase blog post hey look super cool you can't ever accuse the crypto industry of not being bullish on its own asset we are very bullish on crypto so is coinbase the exchange i would expect nothing less good for them and that's just like what i said about the circular like flywheel economies like hey we only need ourselves to be bullish like we can just do it ourselves so if we are buying our own assets fantastic yeah i mean it's just all getting bigger right and so coinbase is now a publicly traded company i mean four or five years ago this would not have been a major headline now it is because they're deploying 500 million cash uh from all the crypto industry profits i can't pull up the headline because i'm uh getting the the bloomberg or should i say the bankberg firewall bankberg firewall the bankberg firewall from bloomberg but this is a headline about uh coinbase and circle they are now backing usdc by treasuries purely treasuries it was some other things in addition to treasuries and dollars in the bank account now they're making a move to bash back it all by basically t bills right and uh and cash in the bank and you know what this speaks of i think david is they're getting ready to talk to regulators and talk to dc about usdc as a potential monetary tool that the u.s government can use i think that's what this means they're cleaning things up they're saying we're not like tether you can actually start to export usdc to other economies around the world and us government don't you want that for us dollar supremacy monetary supremacy across the world we can help export this for you i think that's really what they're gearing up for and they're removing the objections which is like we don't know what's backing usdc and they could say no you know exactly what's backing it's dollars and t bills and they could say yep that's cool um i have another take on this but i'll get your reaction first yeah and this just goes back to the early commitments that we had about stable coins is that they are one to one swappable for the actual dollars for all dollars so they're 100 percent backed right this is what tether has kind of failed on but turns out the market didn't really care about that but it is definitely what regulators care about and this is uh definitely a strategy from jeremy elaire and circle and company to front run like future like top-down regulation coming to like impact their business they're just doing it themselves uh and so you know there's the the whole uh risk of of you know uscc becoming like too big to fail what what happens with this like regulators get concerned about too many u.s dollars on ethereum but at least they can say we have all the money in the bank there can't be really all that much risk because we have all the money think about the traditional banking system which operates on a ten to one fractional reserve and now compare and contrast that to usdc which operates on a one-to-one uh reserve yeah but actually also that same ten to one because it's eventually it's it's us dollars in in the same bank accounts this is just like an overlay on top of it it's a good point you know what's kind of interesting when i was thinking about when i read this david is you know facebook has had so much trouble launching libra and dm right here's the big brain uh play for mark zuckerberg go purchase circle right take usdc call it diem roll it out on facebook boom keep it done keep it used easy easy no that is that is a logical conclusion look this is also what i worry about though right is because this is why this cannot usdc as much as i love it it's great it cannot be the only stablecoin solution on top of ethereum because at the end of the day it is a banked coin it is not a self-sovereign unit of stable currency anyways for the bankless folk uh denominate an ether and also if you want more stability use rye there you go rai all right coinbase sponsoring an esports team they're joining the club too this is pretty cool what's happening yeah so coinbase kind of like following in the footsteps of sam bankman fred and ftx trying to slap uh ftx everywhere now coinbase is slapping coinbase on an esports team seems to be a very logical place to get your your advertisement you know e standing for electronic uh you know very proximate to the whole like digital finance world uh i think you know east the community behind esports will be much more inclined to become crypto people than any other population in the world uh so i think that's the right population to market to so nice job coinbase crypto is taking over guys that is the news for this week we are going to be right back with the takes of the week and of course you can't forget the meme of the week that's coming up next but before we get there we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the una swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the una swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless alright guys we are back with the takes for the week let's start with this one from chris dixon this is all about how networks are turning into economies he's talking about the web 3 world the world of crypto the world of bankless what do you think chris is saying in this twitter thread it will include the full tweet thread uh in the show notes for you guys to check out i think it's worth reading but what's the tl dr from your perspective david yeah i'm reminded of this conversation i had with chris burniske who talked about how ethereum and just all these tools on ethereum are providing uh financial foundations for more and more cultures to be built upon ethereum they're providing the economic foundations for more and more culture chris is using the word networks i i would like to replace that word with community it's all the same thing like social networks community networks networks networks like they're all kind of the same things and uh what uh chris dickson is talking about is that these financial primitives like unit swap the erc20 token nfts they all make it easier for networks and therefore communities to become bootstrapped and to be economically viable and so chris is talking about just how these all these financial tools are allowing more and more things to be created because they've done all the like the heavy lifting of like actually having a meaningful economic platform so when i hear this take from chris it's a very long thread chris has been doing some threads recently so go read the whole thing if you are interested but what i'm hearing uh out of chris is that uh communities are like the next frontier of financial like primitives right like with the communities are what's next when it comes to the world of finance yeah he's basically talking about like take your your social network a community that you have and then turn that into an economy and like see what you can unlock and he goes in and he takes the example of a band who spent years building a following but only gets pennies from its streaming service and he says use tokens and nfts the band can upgrade their networks which is their community into an entire economy so you take an example like the goods that flow through the band's economy could be social tokens digital art collectible tickets game objects all of these things could be primitives and then the band could get revenue from primary issuance cuts of resales maybe owning a chunk of these functionable tokens and the idea is all of these communities and economies will be composable so you create a base layer and then maybe like the fans of one band can build on top of the community that another uh band has built on all of these services and systems and economies become like lego blocks uh and um you know you don't have to fight these economies you could just trade with them and build other things on top of them so what i think is cool is it's what we're seeing right now david is it's just crypto natives picking up these tools and using them for crypto communities and crypto networks but what happens when um people outside of communities outside of crypto start to realize that these tools are here and build and transform their communities into economies that's going to be pretty exciting the bold case for this is that it actually becomes rational to turn your community in so into some sort of like financial network and because it's just better for everyone involved absolutely including the the fans um let's take this scott lewis take i really like this one so he's comparing three different i think seasons bull market seasons maybe in crypto and he says in 2017 the winners were in the bull market of the ico market were promoters primarily in 2020 the d5 bull market the winners were engineers and finance people and now in 2021 the nft bull market winners are who i don't know people who know what will be cool you know cultural aficionados he says the cool thing about nft summer is that it gives a different type of person a chance to have the most alpha really cool so um there are a lot of people i think who missed out on kind of what was going on with with uh icos and with ethereum during its early days okay well there's another bite at that apple with defy summer but in order to understand defy you get to really understand like financial geek stuff right um and like what are derivatives what are options like lending and borrowing stuff also like can you read the contract address because like if you can read the contract address you can ape way sooner than like people like me who just wait for their friends to go first yeah exactly so you had to have a different set of skills but now in 2021 with this nft bull market you have to have a different set of skills again you have to have like some cultural appreciation like david i have no i like i look at these nfts and i don't really know what i'm looking at to be honest like i have no i don't have the cultural sensibility my friend what's good art i don't know i mean you're a cultural outsider you just don't know what that's great but that's great because like um a new set a new cohort cohort has done very well in this market and it's different from the previous two cohorts so i think that is uh that is really cool we're seeing multiple different groups win in these different bull markets i think what we are seeing every single era of ethereum is marked by some sort of mania right the ico d5 summer now nfts and if i mean there's only three data points here but like the the who can actually access these games keeps on getting spread to more and more people with every single era right like you know even though i couldn't read contract addresses in defy summer like i could still like click approve on my yam token contract on unit swap and and then go from there right nfcs it's like even more people like you don't even have to understand like yield farming you just have to understand that that picture is kind of cool and hope that you think other people also think that picture is kind of cool uh and so like hopefully this trend continues of like the next mania after whatever this however long as nft mania goes for is also something that is even more like democratized and even more larger of a community because that would just be again more and more marketing of ethereum towards more and more people uh and so and so like every like you said like everyone gets a bite of the apple everyone gets a bite of the apple uh more and more people are getting a bite of the apple and the apples also growing larger every single time bigger apple more bites different cohorts with each bite what's really cool is that's true from a builder's perspective too so the artists have done really well right in the nft bull market which is really neat to see david why don't you take this take it's another take on the nft boom on a theater yeah so this is uh cyrus yunessi uh who is a i like to call him in certain moments this is definitely one of them based cyrus uh and so he goes uh massively underappreciated aspect of the nft boom on ethereum scam coin copy chains like tron bsc eos whatever the f can't clone our nfts on their chain no maker clones no venus or pangolin no pancake swap no vampire attacks no bridges no back room bribes nothing finance train tried to tried and failed with binance punks which was a huge favor soul punk's failure justin's son tried to steal every defy app even though he even failed at that but he'll never steal the nfts because you can't copy or clone culture like that the moat for ethereum is massive the only exception i think for is of ethereum friendly friendly projects like polygon so yeah cyrus is a little aggressive with like you know talking to mac about all the other non-ethereum chains so he definitely has his eth maxi hat on so trying to pull him back a little bit like all you have to do is understand that like all of the valuable nfts like crypto punks fidenzas all the art blocks the chromie squiggles they're all on ethereum and that is an inarguable fact and so as more and more like the mo around ethereum as like the place where valuable nfts become minted just grows even stronger because like imagine if you have a fantastic awesome art project like you need to mint it next to all the other valuable art projects you can't go over to some other chain and mint it there you need to to like ride in the the tailwinds of all the other nfts that are being printed on ethereum so like ethereum is pretty much establishing a monopoly on culture which is emote that like you cyber said you can't fork that you can't fork it and you can't fake it is what he's saying it's a really good take um let's talk about dc investors take i didn't see it a year ago but i could see it very clearly now nfts will cement each dominance that's it that's the tweet yep that's that's that's basically what cyrus said in like two sentences absolutely look uh eath being used as a store of value unit of account medium of exchange for nfts is super bullish eth as an asset class the fact that nfts have grown so so large is super bullish eth but you know the thing that sticks out to me so much is actually the first sentence in his tweet here david which is i didn't see it a year ago but i could see it very clearly now it's crazy how even when you were in this space day in and day out you can't necessarily predict when big trends will emerge and pop and you have to be ready for them but the timing is so so tricky uh hard to see how the space emerges now it's pretty obvious but it wasn't a year ago uh anyway good take by dc there another one from cyrus different different uh topic matter here uh but also kind of similar cyrus says quick investment thread one of the best investing abilities is to recognize trends ahead of time find talent etc like if you knew btc or ether or punks were really going to blow up awesome you made a bunch of money but that's really really hard i also think there's a second and equally valuable and maybe not often not talked about facet of investing and that's the notion of feeling like you've missed the boat when you actually haven't when i first found bitcoin in 2015 i thought i was already i was already too late and already and barely invested it had already bitcoin had already rallied a thousand x by then when he found eth in 2016 i thought if tyra says i thought i was too late and i barely invested it was already up 400 x when i found a yfi i thought maybe i'm not so late even the price had already gone up to 10x and so cyrus did a tiny bit more than he otherwise would have and then again when he found punks only this year everything was already up 100 to a thousand x but sarah says i've been training myself to think hey maybe i'm still early maybe if i'm spending 24 7 consuming in this space it's actually unlikely that i'm late to recent popular trends just because some absolute chad genius found it before me and has the extra 100x on his belt doesn't mean there isn't huge upside left for the rest of us i still didn't go mega hard but again a tiny bit more it's a slow process that i am training myself for cyrus's point is he doesn't feel like he has to jump on every hot trend from the start or discover things purely on his own sometimes being around and uh and keeping your eyes open can be enough to that end i aped into a bunch of degenerative art lately it feels bubbly it feels toppy he doesn't understand it all but it's clearly becoming extremely popular i'm just not convinced that i'm late to the game says cyrus i don't care that i'm lifting highs if it takes off in a few years i'll look back and realize i was actually pretty early so good perspective the thing i've always been saying uh about the world of crypto is the moment you come into crypto you are by definition like the latest one to the game right like you can't be early if you just came in but think about all the people that are yet to come in so it's more about the belief of do you think more people are going to enter this ecosystem and where do you where are you on the global scale of adoption because that's the frame of reference you need to enter not like oh literally everyone else has a crypto punk well everyone else who's inside of ethereum has a crypto punk or everyone who's inside of ethereum has a board ape or a penguin or insert your favorite nft thing here right by definition uh and so like this industry is built on scarcity and it's engineered to make you feel fomo and so if you feel fomo that not only is that just like par for the course but like if you weren't feeling fomo this industry wouldn't be so powerful yeah absolutely that that's always the question i think that's a huge impediment to people investing in this asset class in crypto is they feel like they're late right and they usually don't learn that they were actually early until a whole cycle goes by and they miss it and then they like buy somewhere near the top right and they foam oh and so it's such a trap if you're listening to bankless i i could just say this from an asset class perspective as a whole you are not late you are still early to the party people might say like well like i bought and now it's down and i'm like well when did you buy it's like three months ago it's like three days ago no like you're only late if you leave right yeah you're only ready to leave yep and so if you stay in if you zoom out you're not late look at this asset over years and uh decades rather than months and don't fall into the psychological trap this is cyrus is saying of feeling like you are too late for this asset class wise words all right last take here this is a headline from coindesk about only fans showing how the banking system is politicized only fans buckle maybe we can talk about that and then how does that show how the banking system is politicized i think this is an article from nick carter we're just reading the headline here right so this is the importance of ethereum being a politics-free politically neutral financial layer for the world because we have only fans who is going to ban like a sexually explicit content from their platforms because their payment providers were going to stop servicing payments because the payments world is very conservative it has political opinions about how money should be sent around and what can be purchased with money and so we now have like these payment providers like mastercard and visa and also the banking layer dictating what our values are when we pay for things they are saying no you are not allowed to purchase uh sexually explicit images because we are conservative and we don't like that which is a bunch of bs upon human rights and human and individual freedoms if humans want to ape into like sexy pictures let them do it let them do it don't restrict them at the payments layer and so this whole only fans debacle which is what nicaragua is writing about is showing how the traditional banking system is a political system it has political uh beliefs and it's imposing up those beliefs upon people against their will we didn't elect this we didn't elect for this to happen this is just like some centralized group of people determining what our human values are yeah absolutely i i think people don't realize that their banking system is political it has um some beliefs it's not a credibly neutral system that anyone gets access to and if you're not concerned about like only fans or the pop the the pot industry the marijuana industry or other marginalized industries because like you're not into those industries then just think about what if it happened to you and to your industry yeah what if exactly what if you had a politically controversial i um you know job or a set of ideas or organization and you were cut out from the economic network so you worked at planned parenthood exactly or like anywhere whatever your values are i think the base point of um this entire movement this crypto movement is to separate government from the money system right like so that we have a credibly neutral base layer humanity has one not the us not japan not china but all of humanity has a internet native credibly neutral communication layer for transmitting value that's really the bottom line that doesn't make uh any distinctions on your ideology your political belief you're like your sex um your race any of these things i think about like afghanistan right now and what's going on there where as the taliban is kind of reclaiming the entire country of of afghanistan is ruling back um women's rights uh no longer like they will know women will no longer have the ability to open bank accounts in that country right it's like that's not right you know every if you're a human being you have access to the internet you should have the you have the ability to open an ether dress and the protocol doesn't make any distinction about even your age like you can't you know dave you can't get a bank account unless you're over uh 18 or over in the u.s right well like why not a 12 year old can open an ether dress like ethereum doesn't care what you're doing with it and we need that kind of base layer for um for basic freedoms as we enter into the digital age that's why we're so passionate about this and we talk about it all the time because we really believe these freedoms are important to humanity's future now one of the stories that i always like like to recite uh for people that are more skeptical as to like the power of this industry is this the story a very very true story of a a muslim wife who had a very abusive husband and you as a muslim female in muslim countries you can't open a bank account it's against the law and so she started in her own time while her husband was away at work writing a blog blogs for a blog page and she was paid in bitcoin and she was able to save up enough bitcoin to take her kids and divorce her husband and run away like and the the muslim financial system wherever or whatever that correct word is was never going to be able to support her in that endeavor because it was a political financial system so this this individual this lady used an apolitical financial system to express her individual desires of not being abused by an abusive husband yeah absolutely there you go david what are you excited about this week i am excited about an article coming out on the bankless newsletter on wednesday i need to finish it by then but i got the weekend ahead of me and this also pairs with a take i have saying that everything in the metaverse is getting serialized by nfts on ethereum so uh that we will expand on this more in the article but uh as we all know i'm i'm super just like focused on the relationships or comparisons between ethereum and nation states and other previous like organizational structures that we've seen in humanity religion also and feudalism ethereum is a neo-nation state it's a nation in the cloud it's a digital nation and we are all a part of it and not only are we putting our monies there we're also putting our our identities there uh we are also putting a a like image on our identities that's kind of like the nfc avatar movement but we're also putting our art on ethereum right our fidenzas that are worth like three million dollars like ethereum knows ethereum knows who are who we are because of nfts and it knows what our value the items that we have valued it knows what they are and so nation states like to account for everything and it's a very imperfect science when it comes to the meat space nature of the world but in ethereum ethereum is all knowing and it also unlocks the existence of the metaverse by actually instantiating digital items on ethereum by serializing it right you actually get like a code to instantiate the value of your physical or digital art by putting it on ethereum so like the question you have to ask yourself is if it doesn't exist on ethereum does it even exist in the metaverse at all and so there's a bunch to unpack there and i hope everyone reads the article coming out on wednesday really cool man i'm looking forward to reading it ryan what are you excited about um so you know the podcast that we did with uh andy and and dz earlier this week about these nfts these well so i haven't really gone down the rabbit hole um of nfts as you kind of know right it's like i feel somewhat like look man life's just busy it's hard to keep track we keep track of crypto defy i've been monitoring nft space but i haven't really life is busy is that why you don't have a punk look man that's why okay sorry this is your day they also got really they also got really expensive you know it's like but here's the thing for for me with um crypto punks is because i don't think i took the time to understand it fully and like i i didn't grok it didn't get it it always like crypto punks always felt too expensive to me when they were trading for like a thousand i was like a thousand french no thank you that's crazy that's insane and like then two thousand and four thousand now they're like thousand three hundred thousand four hundred thousand right so um after that episode i figured like you know what i need to spend some more time and really understand nfts so i went on openc and i took the advice from our um our podcast and i like i tried to dabble and figure some stuff out and i bought some like you know smaller nfts that sort of thing um and now i decided to embark on a little like trading experiment so uh today i just posted this on twitter i am going to try to start with like the smallest crappiest nft possible on openc i found this like little turtle david it's like um it's got a santa claus hat and it's got a cigarette it's smoking and it costs .01 eth and i want to experiment to see if i can trade up this um nft this p this profile nft pfp nft as my avatar all the way to the highest possible echelon okay so like the highest possible echelon in the avatar space is a crypto puck do i think i'll get there probably not but like let's start with let's start by being ambitious and if you've ever um heard of that uh you know like that paper clip with a guy who starts with a paper clip and trades up and like a year later he's got like a car and all of these things there's a dow that launched that actually did it right and now they have like a token reward sort of thing that they're providing um as part of the the trading up program but i want to try this experiment and like i don't know how far i'll get or if anyone will actually care and trade with me right um but what's fun is it's going to be i think it's going to be an interesting experience it's going to get me into these various avatar communities and like actually figure out the nft space as i'm like trading and learning what's valuable and trying to make my way up so the idea is start with a turtle end up with what maybe a crypto punk probably not but like somewhere in between and see how far i can take this thing and just learn about the nft space the entire way so that's my little project it's gonna be fun i hope um you know we'll see where it goes yeah hopefully you score a high score i think the biggest uh hurdle you're gonna have to overcome is actually convincing someone to buy your turtle but like hey maybe that maybe there is like a generous individual who is interested in taking it though taking your your turtle off your hands yes this is the first time you've changed your profile picture in like four years but god damn is that a shitty turtle dude it really is it's a pretty bad i actually i tweeted out and i asked like uh show me them like the most garbage lowest your cheapest nft and i got a lot of answers and the turtle was one of them so i was like okay we'll start there anyway i think your best bet is somebody just wants this turtle just on the fact that like you bought it and now they kind of want it we're talking about it right now right now that's why sanjay more value into it yeah we'll see where it goes good luck on your journey my man yeah it's an interesting experience um so we'll see where it goes all right man you ready for me of the week uh no i am ready for the newest bankless nation member of the of the week who's that uh this girl luna apparently some guy in the bankless wells fargo t-shirt uh who also is donning a cool cat uh picture over his face gave birth to the newest member of the bankless nation luna who is also a cool cat and is also very cute so congratulations to teeshot for uh growing the nation one member at a time the the bankless nation is growing one way or another whether it's uh new community members or we're just like making our own yeah yeah making our own little uh members of the bankless nation really cool congrats uh to uh to luna and cool cat meme of the week you ready for it now yep all right describe it for us david okay so this is a 50s style photograph of a 50s housewife and her two kids and then there is ethereum the the dude coming home after apparently a long day at work and the mom is labeled bitcoin maximalist one of the kids is labeled eat killers and the smaller of the kid is labeled whatever cardano is and each one of them is having a knife waiting for ethereum the dad to come home i don't know why there's there's such a inclination of of kids and the mom trying to kill the the father but but the meme is that ethereum is like the the super hard-working bringing home the bacon father and he's gonna come home and get stabbed by his family but the other takeaway i have i generally think is that like for some reason all projects hate ethereum bitcoiners don't like ethereum cardano they don't like ethereum avalanche they don't like ethereum like all the east killers they don't like a theorem everyone doesn't like ethereum and there is something to that if every single thing is like trying to like oh yeah we're going to be the next ethereum or like bitcoin maxwell's saying oh ethereum is like trash why does everyone hate ethereum like is that like some sort of signal in of itself i think it is i don't know and what's interesting about this analogy is they're all in the same family aren't they like we're all in the crypto family right why are you trying to knife us right i mean it goes the other way too um i don't see as much from ethereum maximus but like any maximalism you're just like stabbing within your family stop it guys cut it out let's not let's not kill ethereum after a hard day work yeah all right guys risks and disclaimers for the week of course ethan's risky bitcoin is risky so it's all of crypto you could lose what you put in we are in sort of a bull market season at least it's an nft bull market you gotta remember what anakin and padme say in this meme anakin's saying crypto is mooning again padme says you're going to take profit right anakin looks at her you're taking profit right just silence guys to take profit when the market is up thanks so much we're glad you're on the bankless journey we'll see you later hey we
