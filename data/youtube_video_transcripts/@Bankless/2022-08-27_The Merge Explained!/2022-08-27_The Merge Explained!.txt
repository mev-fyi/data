how do you explain the merge to someone who doesn't know anything about crypto doesn't really care about crypto ethereum it's the number two blockchain behind bitcoin it's the thing that created d5 and allows us to do things like decentralized finance stuff borrowing and lending it's that blockchain it's proof of work which is that thing that consumes a lot of electricity which a lot of people in the outside world don't like but it's always wanted to go to this thing called proof of stake proof of work works by if you lie to the blockchain you basically burn electricity for no reason and proof of stake works that if you lie to the blockchain you lose your ether this is just a better more efficient way to secure a blockchain we don't have to consume electricity because there's no electricity consumption you don't have to issue as much ether to pay for that electricity consumption and these stakers don't have to sell their ether so it makes ether really bullish and how is that pretty good pretty good i think it's i think it's hard to explain honestly
