[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today sir i'm doing just fantastic ryan really excited about the future of the bankless nation and we brought on eric voorhees who is one of the earliest settlers of the bankless nation uh we we talk about the metaphor of going west a lot and we talked about it with eric and for those that don't know eric voorhees is one of the earliest pioneers of this space he's been through the entire bitcoin history and he's been upholding the bankless values before we even called them the bankless values and so we go through eric's history of being one of the first settlers of this new nation and what that experience is like and what lessons he has learned along the way he also talks a lot about the values i mean he started he's an og so he started in 2011 and he can i mean he was there when bitcoin was sort of instantiating its values and i feel like david this episode just like is a max a bitcoin maximalist slayer episode like just like knife in the heart man uh eric totally um i think brought out the core values that made bitcoin special in the very early days and um talked about how those values could be present in non-bitcoin crypto networks and it was super refreshing to hear him talk about that because i think that's what um that's what we've been talking about like eric seems to me like he is a um a member of the bankless nation perhaps without knowing it maybe he was an original founder of the bangladesh nation and we're just discovering this country a little bit later but you know what for some people eric is not maximalist enough so i anticipate some bitcoiners that are of the maximalist persuasion might not like this episode yeah the part of the episode where we talked about maximalism was absolutely deadly and i definitely agree that that is part of the bankless values is a commitment to non-maximalism bankless values are what enable banklessness and to whatever degree that some crypto economic protocol some new technology regardless of whether it's blockchain cryptocurrency or not allows for people to be bankless then that piece of technology is part of the bankless nation and allows people to settle there and uh eric voorhees doesn't use those words because you know these these terminologies is unique to the bankless nation but i think i think he resonates with them all the same yeah absolutely um we talked about other things too we talked about economic freedom we talked about um flag bucks as he calls them i you know called them boomer bucks but that's the idea of fiat money we talked about nation states and game theory creeping authoritarianism um you have to know that eric is a pretty hardcore libertarian um so going into the this episode we we got into some of his libertarian beliefs and how those intersect with crypto values and bankless nation values one of my big takeaways from what eric was talking about was his belief that the growing debt of nation states particularly of the us nation is just an insurmountable thing to overcome and regardless of bitcoin regardless of ethereum regardless of these bankless tools that insurmountable debt is going to bring in and in eric's opinion an end of the fiat money regime uh so i thought that was a really interesting perspective usually you hear from from bitcoiners or aetherians that like because of and this was was my opinion and now i agree more with eric because of the ability to exit the fiat bubble will be popped but eric thinks that that fiat bubble is going to be popped regardless and so that was one of my favorite parts of this conversation and he brings some credibility there because he's been talking this way since at least 2011 even before this is just a great episode for you to listen to before we begin we should talk about our sponsors the first sponsor i want to tell you about is ave ave is a defy protocol that you absolutely have to check out what can you do with it you can lend you can borrow banklessly all on ethereum so you could do things like lend dye to the protocol it will magically transform that die into an interest bearing diet account not just die all sorts of crypto assets on ethereum you can also borrow against it ave has been climbing up the leaderboard as well and they've recently released avonomics which is their token economics upgrade you can read more about it we will include a link in the show notes so avenomics grants key decision making to ave token holders it creates more safety and economic incentives to reward protocol growth one of the coolest things is it actually introduces a safety module so there is staked ave becomes a collateral of last resort you can find out about ave avonomics start using the protocol at ave.com that's aave dot com the last few months in ethereum and on d5 we've seen gas prices just scream through the roof i check the gas prices every single morning and it's always 60 70 80 sometimes a hundred way and it really starts to impact what i'm able to do in a cost effective manner on ethereum this is where loop ring comes in loopering is a zk roll up scaling protocol for ethereum exchanges and payments zk roll ups stands for zero knowledge roll ups it's cryptographic magic zk roll ups allow you to combine a bunch of different activity a bunch of different transactions all in one small bite size trunk which really reduces the amount of gas it takes in order to process massive amounts of transactions at loopering.io you can find a zk roll up decks and payment application where you can maintain the guarantees of the ethereum l1 blockchain but you can perform trades and transfers at thousands of transactions per second completely gas free it's pretty insane loopering has the loopering wallet a mobile smart contract wallet with zk roll ups tucked in natively and this isn't meant to onboard the general public to ethereum and mass giving them the ux and the ui experiences that they're used to in their centralized apps but with the decentralized guarantees of the ethereum blockchain so if you are a trader and you have been eaten alive by gas fees visit loopering.io and get onboarded to ethereum's most secure scaling solution all it requires is an ethereum address and you can trade on a high performance order book completely gas free zero percent maker fees and between point zero six percent and point two percent taker fees really low and then also transferring eth and erc20 tokens on the platform is completely free so visit loopering.org enter the code bank list when registering and you will receive the highest level vip tier for six months vip 4 which has the lowest taker fees 0.6 and we you will be able to find that link to sign up in the show notes all right guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with eric voorhees bankless nation we are so excited to bring on eric voorhees eric is a bitcoin og he is the current ceo of shapeshift which was the original dex he has a strong libertarian bent which i hope we get into and like us is a believer in the separation of money and state eric welcome to the bankless nation thank you for having me on eric we'd love to talk to you about your journey so we often talk about um going into crypto going bankless as we use the analogy of it's it's kind of like a journey west right so um you know in in in america it's sort of like the the oregon trail you know the east coasters don't quite understand it they're secure in their existing um lives and what they're doing a few people have died of dysentery along the way absolutely they have so for for many of us it's kind of a journey you know for fortune for opportunity for freedom for a better world what's the why crypto for you eric and has that answer always been the same is it same now as when you started yeah it's definitely the same as when i started the why is essentially because i see this as the the most powerful and potent tool for people to escape the grasp of government and to hopefully stem that tide to some degree um you know ever since i've gotten into this stuff i have felt detached in a nice way from the follies of governments and before crypto i felt very much trapped in that um i cared so much about what the federal reserve was doing or what the government was doing or or politics or politicians i cared a lot about it because i felt trapped inside of that case and post crypto i feel that i am you know not entirely but but to a large degree free from it my money is is not uh is not trapped or is not a tool of of that organization and it's so it's so empowering i love that analogy of of the west um i i very much uh that very much appeals to me you know i grew up in colorado and um there's always just been something about like that desire of of pioneering out into the unknown and just doing it on your own accord that has uh has appealed to me and so crypto is is all that and more and um i've just been so proud to see it grow and to see it achieving some of the potential that we all hoped it would so it's freedom for you then eric is is a big one um like what are the those values what are the values instantiated in the social contract of crypto the value is instantiated in code to you is it is it mostly freedom are there other values as well yeah if if i'm to reduce it to one word that word has to be permissionless with crypto you don't need to ask anyone to receive it or send it and any two people can trade value now across the world instantly and nobody can stop that you know the the most powerful government in the world can't stop a bitcoin transaction um they often won't even know that it's occurring and that's just that's just so cool and it's available to everyone it's not just something that is you know a tool for people in in the us or in one country or another it's not a tool for the rich it's a tool for every single human person on earth and they can they can learn about it in 30 minutes and be using it um immediately and that's just that's just incredible eric we like like we've been discussing it's a journey westward into the bankless world but i think even before you know ryan coined the term bankless or even before we uh developed the concept of a bankless nation that journey westward existed all the same right and i i see you as one of the people that paved the way westward almost before anyone else uh so how has this journey been for you going and hacking through the jungle before there was actually a trail to follow must have been difficult um can you kind of just describe what that journey has been like yeah uh well so so i got involved in bitcoin in may of 2011 and you know certainly back then the number of people that had even heard about it was fairly small the number of people that had ever used it was was smaller still and you know bitcoin was like five dollars back then the the whole market cap was you know 50 million dollars or something and for those of us who are involved way back then it the the potential was so clear to many of us that this could become you know a new financial system for the planet but it was so small a niche that any detractor really had the upper hand and the argument um because there just was no history of it really growing over any sustained period and so i think a lot of us had to just ignore the fact that we were probably delusional you know just trying to be objective about it we were probably delusional and probably wrong because something so something so extremely new and um and powerful probably will not succeed that's just kind of a statistical outcome there and and yet it has and so the potential that we we hoped um has has come to pass it's it's this you know hundreds of billions of dollars in value now it's lasted more than a decade um and as we you know at this point most people at least in the us have have heard of it for sure millions of people own it it's not this weird new thing anymore it's kind of just it's kind of just part of life for many people it's it's moved into movies and music it's moved into culture and even traditional finance has warmed up to it in a large way so it's nice to it's nice to feel like we're not as delusional as we might have been and it's just it's so exciting to actually see it become real whereas before it was so so much more theoretical and uncertain i don't know if you guys have ever seen that meme so there's this uh video meme of this guy like dancing in a crazy way at an outdoor music festival and he's just like dancing for like a full second you know what i'm talking about he's dancing alone in washington yeah oh really so were you in that crowd david were you that guy wow okay so anyway so that like for people who haven't seen it there's this guy and he's dancing on his own and it goes on for a full like 60 painful crazy dancing crazy dancing and he's just in it he's in it everyone else the entire crowd is looking at him like this dude is crazy and then something happens somebody else joins him and starts doing the dance kind of i don't know mocking the person i don't know maybe just having some fun uh and then a few more join and then pretty soon you get like two minutes into the video and an entire crowd the entire festival is like doing this crazy dance with this guy it reminds me you can you can see people running from every single direction because they saw everyone else joining yup yup they fomo in i guess and uh that that's what this that's what kind of the crypto story reminds me of like um it's still crazy now but it's less crazy than when you started it's still delusional now but it's less delusional than when you started in 2011. how have you seen crypto grow up eric um i one of the main ways is just that the the user base and those interested has gotten a lot more diverse so it was pretty fair to say back in 2011 that that almost every single person was a a radical libertarian slash crypto anarchist um and the vast majority of those people were also engineers um or cryptographers and it's expanded so far beyond that which is which is great it's certainly a double-edged sword because many of the ideals aren't shared by others but that's that's okay that's something that is inevitable if this thing actually grows um you know bitcoin is not going to turn the whole world into libertarians the reason it's so powerful is because it doesn't need to it is it is a libertarian technology regardless of regardless of the ideologies of the people using it so i've always been okay with that and i've seen that as a sign of its success and actually i think it's part of its camouflage if um if bitcoin was always only used and desired by you know radical end caps then i think it would be much harder for it to remain you know legal and permissible but when quote-unquote respectable normies are into it um then it is it's able to expand much much more into the society so i think that's a really important attribute that's been one big difference the other big difference of course is the diversity and decentralization of the project uh on the technical level so and i'm i'm talking here about all the different blockchains and all the different projects and tokens and concepts that have come out i see it very much as you know this this branching tree where bitcoin was this trunk that grew out of the ground and it was it was watered and nurtured and as it grew people started you know growing branches in other directions um and that's part of the same decentralization of bitcoin when it started it's all part of that same theme um and so at this point there's no way that i can keep up with all the projects um and i'm in this you know every day um so it's just it's just so much more diverse and it's people and in the in the technology and in the directions that it's trying to go it's it's not just a money anymore it's an entire financial system you know filling into every crevasse that people can pick up so the nice thing about all of this is that self-sovereignty is embedded in the core social contract and in the code this is an austrian money system and every time a new bank adopts it to issue a stable coin to do something with it to settle a transaction even those banks ultimately make the system stronger and i love how very practical you are about hey we should embrace the mainstreaming of traditional finance on krypto because it makes it gives us the ability to have a stronger more self-sovereign system can you can you talk a little bit about why you're so passionate about a self-sovereign money about why separation of money and state is is so important to you personally and to the world yeah um so i i think money is so fundamental to human life and activity that for it to be tied to a nation uh or to a government um is is just really dangerous you know imagine if like mathematics was controlled by the federal reserve or if or if language itself had some overseeing administer administrator that declared what rules of language existed and and what words could develop and what what couldn't um imagine if there was you know a ministry of thought that would you know make sure people only thought the right things and and would get in trouble if they thought the wrong things these are these are like fundamental cultural primitives and they they need to transcend national boundaries they need to transcend borders um and and for money that has never that's never really been the case i mean it's certainly back when when precious metals were primarily the money that was true to some degree but you couldn't transfer that stuff across distance and the markets were so fragmented and local back then that it didn't really matter that much but now that so much trade happens across the world uh bitcoin really allows um this concept of you know borderless communication in the realm of of money to exist um and i i think while people today might not see why that's important after they've gotten used to it they will recoil in horror at the thought that there was ever a period of time in which people's money was reliant on the boundaries of one nation so money is supposed to be this organic thing right and i think uh this is kind of a nebulous thought but the what is the free market is largely natural it is nature like a the free market is a manifestation of nature and when you say that the uh the nation-state or a government or the federal reserve has like this top-down coercive capturing of this thing that is supposed to be organic in my mind i see that there is a uh there's a timer on that there's a limited amount of time where you can control nature before nature will uh figure out a way to slip through the cracks and then end up controlling you right there's no controlling nature and this is why always bitcoiners chant the the name or chant the phrase you know the separation of money and state because state is something engineered and serves a purpose uh and so does money but something money is something organic and and this gets into the a conversation of like why organic money is so necessary is because you can't control nature and and money austrian money is basically a statement that money should be organic and if you don't allow or money to be organic it will blow up in your face in in the future uh and so i think this aligns with like why we want self-sovereignty when it comes to our money is because having self-sovereign money means that we are using money in its natural state in a way that we can depend on over the long term do you resonate with that thought totally the the metaphor of nature is really a good one i i think an important principle to convey in this point is that when you're engineering things the smaller and simpler the system the more feasible it is to engineer it and the larger more complicated the system the less feasible it is to engineer it and the the great problem of of strong centralized government is that they do not appreciate this fact and they try to engineer massively complex things like markets and societies and so you know certainly a a person or a group of people can engineer and design and control something that is relatively small you know certainly the the government could create a small park and decide where every plant and blade of grass goes and if it's small it could probably even look nice they could probably do a good job of that but imagine the government trying to design nature itself you know the complexity of the oceans and the atmospheres and the the meadows and the animals and the you know bacterias uh just the immense complexity can't be engineered because humans aren't able to to do that in any in any proper form money and economies are of that level of complexity and so you can't you can't have it be designed because you'll design something that will that will break it will become fragile it will not be able to adapt and um and bitcoin really just takes that power away from from central planners and allows a flourishing in an open and spontaneous market so the concept of the bankless nation uh and i know earlier you you hit on the fact that maybe a nation isn't uh the best organizational scheme but the bank what we refer to when we call the bankless nation is something a little different and i think the core values of the bankless nation does respect the role of nature in these systems right so the bankless nation is what we call uh kind of just the collection of of tools that the crypto world has provided bitcoin largely bitcoin and ethereum but then also mainly all the protocols on ethereum which also represent like sort of manifestations of nature like all the different protocols on ethereum are inside like the same free market environment and they represent their own little organisms their own little plants and so uh and it's so it's so messy what do you mean by that it's messy it's uh it's not there's so much noise in the in the industry in the ecosystem there's so much um waste there's so much failure and these are this is evidence of an organic system that is iterative and adaptive and so when you look into crypto and you see all these projects rising and falling and succeeding or scamming or doing something fully new and unique that that noise is a really good indication that you have something organic that is that is going to flourish over time but for some people that's really scary and they want to control that yeah that's that's a really interesting metaphor i think what you're saying is that you know the nature produces everything and not everything is meant to live and so the bad things will ultimately die and the good things will be be left behind is that where you were going with that yeah yeah it's it's similar to the concept of creative destruction and it's just so prevalent in in crypto and and to me that's a sign of its success and the the life that it has within it and to some people they they see that as this this horrifying situation in which they need to step in and regulate and control it um so it's a very different kind of viewpoint right and and and so like what i'm what gets me so excited about the growth of this bankless nation is is it is the first organic nation it is the first nation that kind of created itself bootstrapped itself through organic processes and so um i mean that's why i'm here and i think i think that's why right here well would you would you say the internet is is not that i would would say the internet is that yeah i would i would include that there so it's a crucial tool to well so when the internet first came about they there was this um i can't remember what it's called but it was that like declaration of independence of cyberspace i think i think that's the name and that was very similar to like a the declaration of independence of the united states but instead of a nation state opting out of like a monarchy it is the people of the world who have access to the internet which is now like almost everyone declaring independence into this self-sovereign realm which is cyberspace and i think now that the the crypto economic future has more or less arrived bitcoin and ethereum uh now we have this self-sovereignty of money and finance that also exists on the self-sovereign cyberspace domain yeah yeah unfortunately the people who who want to control behaviors do not they don't recognize it and they will not permit that power to be taken from them and so really the only way to do it is to create a system that can't be controlled it can't be uh usurped and and bitcoin did that you know you can argue that the certain encryption protocols have done that for communication as well so that's that's super powerful and it doesn't require the permission of anyone to use it i want to get back to the final boss which is the nation state in a minute but first i have a question for you eric just put on your libertarian cap for a minute i don't know if you ever remove your libertarian cap for someone no put it on i think it's pretty well stuck at this point okay so um so uh what we're talking about just now was that things like mathematics things like language things like money should be essentially public goods for the world they shouldn't be coercive and controlled by any single individual entity whether that's a nation state or something else right what is the libertarian um i guess bent towards public goods should some things like very base protocols like communication internet communication like um money like language should those things be public goods and everything else you know shouldn't be i'm just curious how um because i know like there's kind of a libertarianism really emphasizes um private goods and and property rights and those sorts of things so help help me understand that a little bit yeah a very good question um i i don't really love this term of public goods and i wouldn't ascribe it to something like money or language or mathematics i think implicit in this concept of public goods is some obligation to provide it for people so like if something's a public good there's almost an obligation that someone has a right to to some of it at the exclusion of of someone else i think when you're talking about language mathematics money it is it is a an explicitly private thing but what's different is that anyone has access to it but no one has an obligation to provide it right so no one has an obligation to teach you mathematics nobody has an obligation to teach you language no one has an obligation to give you money and yet you can use all these things and and they are um not non-exclusive as well when when you're when you're getting wealthy it does not mean that you're taking that from someone else when you're learning mathematics you aren't taking that knowledge from another person um so i i don't like this this public good concept the the broader question of like are public goods ever appropriate is a really good topic for debate i think there are some things like like air and and water especially ocean water that are really hard to privatize effectively um and and maybe are appropriately thought of as public goods um but that's a that's another topic i guess so eric would you prefer a term like um neutral goods or even you like the term permissionless these are permissionless goods yeah permissionless is great let's talk a little bit more about uh where we are today um i saw a tweet from you recently that said a capitalist system does not have central banks but i thought in america we were in a capitalist system maybe not let's talk about that also um yeah you've used this term which i really like uh flag bucks to describe i think all fiat systems right fiat monies like us dollars or euros that sort of thing i've um i've started calling them boomer bucks because uh they used to actually be backed by something and it feels like the boomers sort of switched things up on us um over the past you know 40 years or so but i also like the term flag bucks can we talk a little bit about what's happened to our money systems and um you know the central banks that are essentially the institutions in power of them yeah uh so something that i was pretty blind to you know and i've i've called myself a libertarian ever since early college but something i was pretty blind to was was that money you know in particular the the us dollar is not a result of capitalism or a feature of capitalism it's actually quite antithetical to capitalism i just never even thought of of the dollar being you know good or bad in that way and when i started learning about you know the austrian economists and started learning about the nature of money um i i realized that that was not only a problem but like that was one of the the biggest problems and was was one of the biggest blemishes on this notion that america is a capitalist economy i don't think you can call yourself a capitalist economy when the most important good in that whole economy is centrally planned that just seems that just seems kind of like a silly claim and and so many people in the western world they appreciate the folly of central planning and they think of like the soviet union not being able to produce enough shoes and they they feel in their own mind like yeah of course you don't centrally plan something so important as shoes and yet they tolerate the central planning of something even more important than shoes money is far more important than shoes and and yet it is centrally planned and money properly understood is just a good it is just one of the many goods that people are trading and bartering for it happens to be the good that people trade the most for and and for that reason it is the one that is most important to not be centrally planned um this is this is a fairly i think this is a point that almost no one in the us would agree with that that the us is not capitalist because of the dollar um but i think once you have a perspective of how money actually works and how it should and does emerge from an open market and that anything that is a form of money that's imposed on a market rather than from the market is antithetical to this concept of capitalism so i think my answer to the question why do we tolerate this uh in the u.s is that it benefits the rich and the rich are the people that care and i think there's a lot of la there's a lack of education in the us especially in like perhaps the 99 about how this works or why this is important and so i think the reason why we tolerate this is that the people that should care aren't educated about it and the people that uh that it benefits uh just leave it alone because it benefits them is that your impression as well no i actually disagree i i think most of the you know quote unquote elites or the the super wealthy are those who have positions of great political power i think most of them are uneducated about this i think most of them do not understand how markets work most of them do not understand how money emerges from the market and they they don't support the dollar because it benefits them as rich people maybe it does but i think they they support it primarily for the same reason that that poor people support it which is that they look to government to solve their problems and they look to government to administer important parts of their life and they think that you need this central entity to handle things that are important things that are important like health care or education or money these things are all so important that of course someone needs to be in charge of that i think that's why primarily they they support uh fiat dollars but but you know that's only those who have even thought about it for a moment whereas most people never think about the nature of money at all but eric so isn't that sort of inevitable like this is a very quick shortcut of how fiat became fiat but it's you know back to what you're saying um it was a combination of people like uh not wanting bank runs and being terrified of the volatility and the market crashes and this sort of risk so they turn to a centralized body to say you know come help us come save us right and so you know the bankers get together they they form a plan that evolves into the the federal reserve and now we have a central bank um isn't this just human nature like we panic we don't like volatility we're fearful so we look to a higher authority to come bail us out when things get tough yeah unfortunately it is human nature and i don't i don't know if that can change i i hope it can i hope we're living in a period of history where where sentiments and beliefs in what the appropriate role of government can change but maybe maybe it can't and you know thank goodness bitcoin is permissionless because i don't need people to vote on whether i can use it or not otherwise i would forever be in a minority that never won out so now we're living in a very bizarre time maybe since 2008 when it started i guess it's been bizarre but especially now we're getting ready to print another one trillion dollars um basically i'd add to the to the to the deficit yesterday goldman goldman sachs came out and said buy gold they said this is a quote we have real concerns around the longevity of the u.s dollar as a reserve currency those concerns have started to emerge uh and they think gold will appreciate 20 like for a for a major bank to say that is is this a is this a shakeup are the are the boomer bucks the flag bucks are they are they uh are they starting to collapse is this the beginning of the end um first i think it's important whenever there's a large organization to not assume that the organization is some kind of monolith so like goldman sachs is obviously this massive massive organization lots of people there probably many people with different opinions and so i i saw what you're talking about yesterday and it's certainly it's certainly meaningful that goldman sachs would put that out but they may also be putting out a message you know from some other analyst saying something quite different so i don't i don't know that we can read too much into it from goldman as an institution um but yeah it's it's definitely a big deal and a lot of people will will see that as a as a signal um one might ask why goldman wasn't saying people should buy gold you know two years ago when it was thirteen hundred dollars and why they wait until until it's at its all-time highs to recommend it um but but um still yeah i think it's i think it's important that the nature of money is becoming part of the public discourse increasingly which is really good you know the the term fiat currency like in in 2008 um was not ever used that like that term was something that you'd find in a in a textbook by rothbard but it was not something that you'd hear anyone on cnbc say and now that term comes up quite quite often sometimes in the context of people speaking about bitcoin but sometimes people will just refer to it as as fiat which is such a huge change because by categorizing it as fiat they're they're implicitly acknowledging that it's money of a certain type and when you think about money as having certain types it leads you to the thought process that maybe some types are better than others and you can get into that discussion which is really healthy so yeah it's it's good to see this stuff changing slowly um is it the beginning of the end for for fiat certainly anyone who reads zero hedge has thought that's true every day for the last 12 years yeah um so yeah i i'm one who who does believe that fiat will go away um i think it will definitely happen within 20 years and maybe within five or ten so i i think the writing is on the wall for this silly superstition of fiat but timing is pretty hard well i think you're right about sort of the uh the mental mindset shift and the awakening to this idea of like or the question awakening to the question among mainstream of okay hey wait a minute where does our money come from right um i i'm very sure you won't have a positive perception of uh ubi or that sort of thing right from the libertarian school of thought but one byproduct that aside one byproduct which i find is interesting is i have my uh normie friends so-called who um are starting to think about like how the money actually gets created because they're receiving 1200 checks from the u.s government right yeah and they're like okay wait wait how is that possible where do they where do they get this money and then you have the the money printer go bur right and and they're like oh okay so that's how it works so the government can just print money on demand wait a second and doesn't that start you talked about the superstition right but money is ultimately a social us contract a social structure it is a superstition it's a meme as we would call it are you seeing like the the foundation of the meme starting to get shaken up is that is that sort of why you're thinking over the next you know five to ten years uh people start scratching their heads and look towards self-sovereign money systems um i i think fiat is going to go away even if nobody was changing the discourse or talking about it it will go away just as a matter of economics because the debts of these nations are so large and growing so much they are funded through through either just straight out to basement you know printing of money or they're funded through uh debt and the debt grows and grows and so what you end up with is that that the debt is just going to be um monetized at some point which is just this nice euphemism for for printing money um that that process will unfold mathematically regardless of what anyone is talking about so um that's why i think fiat goes away is because the the debt destroys the illusion that it is worth something and you you mentioned that money is uh is a meme or a shared belief i i think proper money is not a meme and is not a shared belief proper money is based on the observation of what people are trading for so it's it's based on the observation that this person wants this item and so is trading for that this other person wants that same item and through iteration there come to be different goods that are traded very commonly by people and and ultimately something that is commonly traded by nearly everyone is just what we call money and it's not a social contract it's a it's a consequence of trade um but in a fiat world i think you're very right it's it's much more of a belief system much more of a uh religion and when you look at any fiat currency paper bills how can you look at that and not think that this is some kind of crazy cultish religion um you know it's it's so obviously just based on symbolism um that should give people pause but when you grow up accepting it it's just kind of normal one other thing i found interesting about the goldman report was that they mentioned gold right uh clearly non-sovereign store value bullish on gold right they didn't mention bitcoin they didn't mention ether you're bullish on all three why is crypto better than gold i don't want to rehash a whole peter schiff conversation but it's like is like crypto uh the gold for millennials so i'm yeah i am bullish on gold i own gold and i think that much of why i quickly understood the value of bitcoin was because i understood the value of gold i understood why it became money and why it was a good money and bitcoin had um many of the same attributes and some extra ones that gold didn't have so i think they're really good compliments you know uh bitcoin does not have 5 000 years of history and that's worth something um that doesn't make gold better but it it is something like that that stability over millennia is a huge value that that bitcoin is not going to usurp anytime soon um but certainly gold has a lot of disadvantages that bitcoin gets rid of entirely the ability to send it anywhere instantly at nearly zero cost is huge you try you you can't cross a border with 10 million dollars of gold you'll you'll you'll probably end up in jail and you can do that so easily with bitcoin you don't even have to bitcoin doesn't even have to be on you when you're crossing that border that that portability of it is so so powerful um so i think uh they have different enough attributes that it's good to have some of both um and certainly anyone as as i've told people since i got involved everyone needs to realize how experimental bitcoin and these other cryptos still are they they become more established every day but they're still experiments there could still be some horrible zero-day bug there could be some horrible thing that destroys the the encryption or the mining algorithms you know i don't think that will happen but it could people just need to realize that that is an ever-present risk with cryptosystems that is not at all a risk with gold so both both are good both emerge from from markets um and i think they have nice compliments to each other but i take it you're more bullish on the crypto aspect at least from a price appreciation perspective totally yeah i mean if you're gonna if you're gonna speculate on one one or another um you know no question that the the potential gains on crypto are just one or two orders of magnitude higher than in gold but that's true on the downside as well that volatility you know bitcoin can go down to a thousand dollars gold is not going to lose 90 percent of its value bitcoin bitcoin probably won't but it it's more likely than gold to do that hey guys going bankless is a journey and you don't have to do it alone so we're going to pause the episode with eric real quick and talk about some of our bankless sponsors that offer tools for you to help you go bankless as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks monolith coming soon to monolith is an on-ramp directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5 x 6 x 8 x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this that we'll include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off eric you talked about how that you think that the fiat world will will end in the next 20 years probably or hope perhaps even sooner than that uh and i think contained in that statement or contained in that belief is the ability to exit out of the system which we've never had before before now before crypto um like when bitcoin invented this is what ethereum invented uh you know even you can even still use like the us dollar and kind of exit out of the u.s financial system via your crypto dollars on ethereum which is really just like a stepping stone into you know it's a gateway drug if you will um do you do you think that that ability to exit is the core driver of the uh fiat the end of the fiat regime or are there other things that also impact the end of the fiat regime as well now the the core driver is just the mathematics of the debt that's the core driver you don't you need nothing else other than that for fiat to end um the ability for people to find workable alternatives certainly helps and it'll help a lot of people as fiat falls apart that there's already this other alternative financial system getting built um the biggest risk right now is that none of these crypto systems are scalable enough to handle a billion people but they don't need to handle a billion people yet so we need to keep working on it and keep growing this stuff and certainly the the diversity within crypto is going to help it absorb the refugees as they flee from fiat can you elaborate on why the debt of uh of a nation is so important to the ending of the the money and in a world without crypto but with like the amount of debt that we have uh what would uh people's options be yeah so the u.s government has something like 24 trillion dollars of of debt right now and that's you know 10 years ago uh that started going up by a trillion dollars a year which was crazy now it's going up by like a trillion dollars every couple months um there is no way for the government to pay that back or to even stop it from growing in fact the opposite is happening it is is growing exponentially whereas the the economy and the economic output of the country grows at a much lower lower rate because of this the mathematics of the interest compound the debt into the stratosphere at some point um and because of that there there comes a point at which the marginal bond holder the person who is owed money by the government we'll start seeing that and being like okay this is getting sillier and sillier how much longer will i feel comfortable lending to this clearly bankrupt organization right now everyone seems very comfortable lending money to an organization that can never pay the money back um it's a great example of the greater full theory that ends at some point or or more accurately it doesn't end at a certain point it ends gradually as people start demanding higher interest rates for that for those loans um and so once that happens the debt that that compounds the problem the interest rates on the debt rise the debt increases faster and there there comes a point at which the bond market will collapse and and what that means is that people start to get spooked that they will be the last ones holding the bags they will start selling their bonds and the interest rates on the bonds will rise and rise and the only way that that process is halted is by some kind of default either an explicit default where the government says we can't pay this back and these debts are are done or through implicit default which is debt monetization just printing money to pay people back that of course causes inflation or more accurately that is inflation and to the extent that that is done it compounds the problem as well because if if the prices arising from all the inflated money then again people will require higher interest on that debt so so that process does not get stopped in any way other than fiat currency collapse and it's impossible to figure out the timing of that but it's it's inevitable that that process will happen is that one of those things that's kind of like the berlin wall it's gradually then suddenly uh yeah probably um it's certainly not going to be like a a calm um a calm process over 20 years it's going to it's going to be you know something that starts building and then spikes and that that'll be when it's done just to link this concept back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this episode this is very much related to how you know you can coerce nature for a little bit but ultimately it's going to blow up in your face and i think this the what you're talking about the the um you know a debt monetization event would be you know the end of that metaphor right this is where nature blows up blows up in your face so how does the ability to exit and the existence of these of these alternative you know austrian money currencies how does that fit into the picture and and in the event of a debt monetization event um how do these things you know impact the world just their mere existence how do they impact that where do they fit yeah so in the early phase which is what we're in now some people at the margins will increasingly feel comfortable holding some amount of their savings in these alternatives so 10 years ago nobody felt comfortable holding some of their savings in bitcoin today many people feel comfortable holding some amount of savings and that might be a small amount but it's some as the system matures as people get comfortable with it as they can do more and more with it the degree to which they're comfortable holding a portion of their savings in this asset over dollars rises um this is true for individuals it'll be true for companies it'll be true for nations and so there's just this period where people become increasingly comfortable with the alternative and both things are are used like right now i use dollars every day i use bitcoin frequently i'm comfortable on both of those rails and as people learn about this stuff and they get over that initial skepticism and strangeness um it starts to just become part of their life and then that's before any kind of crisis in in fiat when the crisis in fiat starts happening all those people who are already comfortable with the alternatives are going to be fairly well positioned they'll be they'll be good what's going to be tragic is all the people who really have resisted this alternative entirely and have no idea how to use it own none of it um and when they start scrambling for any alternative that they can get their hands on the prices are gonna be so crazy and wild that they're gonna get totally destroyed and that's a horrible tragedy i you know there's no way to no way to stop that but that's why it's why you don't want to be the last person holding debt on an organization that is 24 trillion dollars uh in the hole so eric this this conversation about nation states and um that this move to non-sovereign currency does make an assumption though um let's maybe get into what that assumption is so recently there has been a i would say a creeping authoritarianism that has crept into our nation states and you'd probably argue that's been going on for a long time right um but we're seeing things in hong kong for instance uh i recently read an article that was talking about if you are in hong kong and in social media back in 2014 you said something about supporting pro-democracy hong kong then banks western banks credit suisse hsbc ubs are actively freezing accounts on behalf of the chinese government we've got the uyghurs in china we've got the patriot act in the u.s lest we think our western democracies are immune from this we've got china launching a nation-state digital currency how long until the u.s eliminates cash and implements its own digital currency giving them the power to freeze accounts reverse transactions right so the government yeah they they already have that power they the dollar is already a digital currency exactly right so so they could flex it i i i guess the question is this is a question that ben hunt from epsilon theory sort of brought brought up right when we were talking about this with him um is he doesn't think we can beat the final boss he thinks that's the hill that we're going to die on because money is so powerful for nation state actors that they won't give us an opportunity it's like fdr saying holding gold is illegal back in the 1930s is there a path to beating the final boss here eric are we sort of are we sort of doomed from the outset great question um this was something that we love to debate about in 2011 2012 on the bitcoin forums wow like what you know to what degree would the government try to ban all this and to what degree would they be effective in doing that um fortunately they have been much less hostile to crypto than i feared they would be um there are a number of reasons why i think that's occurred but so can we beat the final boss i mean beating the final boss in this case can be done by any person who simply stops or marginally avoids dollars over time if you move out of that asset and into crypto assets you you avoid that now the government does not have the resources nor the even the political willpower to go into everyone's house and you know torture them into giving over their keys they they cannot do that what they can do is apply substantial pressure to companies that are involved in this industry um both in the us and abroad and force them into compliance with whatever tots they want to throw at them you know they they already do this uh and if you get into that final boss stage if crypto is wholesale you know banned or made illegal um i think there would be a period of you know serious volatility crypto prices could drop by 90 who knows maybe they would go up i don't know um but they could never take the the crypto away from people and because one of the foundational tenets of this technology is the ability to build decentralized systems over time you're going to see much of this ecosystem exist outside of any company just people interacting with each other through these decentralized systems that's super that's super powerful and so the governments can put all the pressure they want on companies they can throw a number of people in jail but the systems can't get shut down and for that reason i don't think the not only do i not think the the final boss is beatable i think it's it's inevitable um and again just it's just it's just economics it's just math that fiat when debased like this cannot out-compete uh a form of money that can't be debased um it just it won't happen eric can we talk about a choke point that dave and i worry about a lot and that it's basically why uh we are united under this whole bankless you know meme if you will uh it's this so like walk through that what if all of the transactions on say a bitcoin or even ethereum are happening inside of crypto banks crypto banks become the custody agent crypto banks become the trading mechanism the bitcoin blockchain um gets so busy that the average user can't complete a peer-to-peer transaction so it all pools into these large crypto banks of course banks are centralized they eventually become the apparatus of the state how can they not how can they resist that it's a centralized choke point uh do you worry about that for bitcoin i'll tell you that's why we are uh excited about bitcoin but we're also very excited about these d5 protocols on ethereum because you have the ability to do more without banks you don't need them to trade anymore you could use uniswap and no one can stop uniswap do you worry about that for crypto for bitcoin yeah i i worry about it although i think it's a self-correcting phenomenon um i think there's always going to be people who use centralized services for some things and decentralized services for others and the more the better the user experience of one the more it'll win out over the other so so basically if if crypto banks let's call them um have a great user experience and are providing a service that customers like then they'll tend to to earn business over time if they start telling you where you can send your money and they start demanding too much personal private information and they start you know putting all sorts of restrictions on you then then that user experience is going down and you're going to be more inclined to try the alternatives that don't suffer from that problem so that's why i think it's it's self-correcting um and i also think it's inevitable that these centralized companies will become increasingly simply um you know unwilling unwitting agents of the surveillance apparatus all the centralized exchanges already are you know we as shapeshift have have dealt with that ourselves and it's it's horrible and it just keeps going uh as that happens i think the pressure on users of this stuff to move into more free systems that don't have those encumbrances will will only increase and the beauty of crypto is that that option is available it's not that everyone needs to use decentralized systems but they can whenever they wish that's that's incredibly powerful and i think the if the government was smart and that's debatable certainly there are smart people within the government if they realize that the more restrictions they put on these centralized services the more people will just flee into the open fields of the decentralized stuff maybe that will maybe that will cause them to be a little more lenient and not be quite as as draconian and totalitarian we'll see so what do you think of the decentralized finance stuff that's going on right now do you think it meets that criteria yeah i think it's cool with hell and i'm i'm dismayed by a lot of the maximalists who just all over it because it's the reason they all over it is because it's not built on bitcoin if it was built on bitcoin they would be loving it they would find all sorts of justifications for why it was great they would be the ones out there you know uh knocking down all the criticisms of it but because it's built um on the wrong tribe's coin they hate it and they find every flaw they can there are certainly many legitimate criticisms of where defy is today a lot of the projects are more decentralized than they appear or are more centralized than they appear that's a big problem but decentralization isn't a black and white thing and i think a lot of these projects are going to over time become increasingly decentralized so i'm not so concerned that that some of them aren't aren't perfectly decentralized today i think that's a that's a journey um and there's just so much innovation happening there like you can't look at that and not get inspired and excited about what's going on it has tons of risks i think there's going to be at least one horrible you know dow like catastrophe probably in the next year or two but that doesn't mean d5 failed that's that's part of the experimentation so as long as people realize that all this stuff is is volatile and experimental and they have that risk tolerance um i think it's it's cool to tell eric so like that's what the bankless nation is is basically like all about is can we do more stuff in a decentralized way with our money with our finance um it's not about maxwell's if you called us a maximalist i mean we'd say we're bankless maximalists if anything but can i ask like i i feel sometimes like bitcoin maximus has sort of lost the plot here right it's like why has that happened was it that way in 2011 was there always a contingent that was just like money go up our tribe price go up our tribe at all costs and every all the other decentralized tech and money systems are um or is this new it has emerged in proportion to the diversity of the ecosystem so in 2011 bitcoin was 99.9 of of all crypto um so the tendency toward maximalism was was basically non-existent as the ecosystem has diversified and other projects have been built and particularly other projects have succeeded like ethereum the maximalist tendency has has really gotten turned up um and i you know i say this often but i i used to be one of those people i was i was someone who who on other coins and other projects because um i thought at best they were a distraction from the you know quote unquote real project which was bitcoin um and at worst i thought they were just kind of scams or or that kind of thing um what i what came to change my mind is realizing that one of the most important attributes of what bitcoin is is this decentralization and you cannot argue for decentralization and at the same time argue that there should only be one monolithic blockchain that that is a degree of mental gymnastics that i i was not willing to make so um so i i switched i i started realizing that part of the promise of bitcoin is these other coins they again they are branches of the same same ethos um some of them compete with each other uh some of them are complementary to each other i think it needs to be observed that both bitcoin and ethereum have hit you know their their all-time high prices and market caps you know roughly together um empirically there is not evidence that the growth of one harms the growth of the other i think they are both very different systems that have different strengths and weaknesses um i i own both i'm bullish on both and i i'm i think bitcoin is stronger because ethereum exists and i think ethereum is stronger because bitcoin exists so i don't i don't really know how to solve the maximalist issue um and it's just such a it's such a waste of time and so tragic because there's a lot of a lot of bitcoiners who spend more time  on other crypto projects than they do building their own um and that's just really a waste of time yeah so like um i think we're really aligned with what you said you had this like legendary tweet that i think sums it up recently it you said in reality there are four categories number one there's bitcoin number two there's ethereum number three there's other valuable coins and number four yes there are coins that's number four um i i think some people take what you just said and what we think and they um they they say that because we're not bitcoin maximalists or or a single coin maximalist that somehow we're we're coin relativists and we think that like tron or xrp are suitable global financial systems for the world right like like how do we explain that like this is not binary thought here you just like there there are clearly some chains that embrace the bankless values the decentralization values the open financial system permissionless financial system value and there are others that don't and those that don't are coins like it seems really simple to me why don't they get well they they believe what you just said they just think that bitcoin is the only one that embodies any degree of decentralization uh one of the most silly things that they that they claim is that only bitcoin is decentralized and everything else is centralized that that binary thinking is just it's so obviously wrong because nothing is perfectly decentralized it's a degree thing right like ethereum today is is very likely more decentralized than bitcoin was several years ago these things change in their decentralization over time and um they they just uh i don't know i guess it's a sign of like a weak mind to not see the nuance of these of these projects and to not be able to hold two different projects in your head and analyze them on their own merits and their own flaws independently and i think what causes a lot of that to be honest is just people people who have a financial stake in a project and feel insecure about that project are going to put a lot of energy into on the other projects and i'll admit that i felt a little bit of that back when i was a maximalist i i you know i owned a bunch of bitcoin and i did not like the fact that other people were building these other chains and that they were they were growing in value and i but the difference was i recognized that flaw in my own thinking and that and that bias and i got rid of it um some people haven't been willing to do that you know the memes popping back up in my head eric of you you're back you're in the in the bitcoin tribe right in the crypto tribe but you're that guy at the music festival again that's dancing right and saying like not all of these other chains are are bad some of these systems embrace bitcoin or values too um i am optimistic that more bitcoiners will kind of come around uh and get back to the like some of it's just i think education and time and defy has to prove itself and it's it's still early and young i'm optimistic about that yeah i yeah it just it's so tragic because the if the tribes were united the whole the whole ecosystem would just be so much healthier and so much stronger and ethereum is not bitcoin's enemy you know who bitcoin's enemy is it's it's the nsa it's the irs it's it's fincen it's these government agencies that are trying to surveil that chain and and see everything that the people using it are doing those are actual enemies um but instead of like trying to tackle those entities because you know admittedly that's very difficult um they spend all day on twitter just  on ethereum so in defense of of what bitcoiners often say uh largely of ethereum is is that they hold the concept of sound unprintable money like in the highest degree like that is the whole point of these systems and to some degree ethereum is centralized because we hard fork both uh l1 or i mean both ethereum one we hard fork every now and then which implies that there's some amount of centralization and also ethereum two is essentially pl well it's not essentially planning because there's roughly seven or eight different client teams all um operating in parallel but centralization around those seven to eight client teams and we've also changed the monetary policy of ethereum and there is a monetary policy of ethereum and so so to some degree there is some centralization of ethereum that is present and and largely i do i think that there is some weight to you know the sound money uh meme where unprintable sound money is is like you know the the future what we really want the gold the the gold standard not actually talking about like the gold the element but just like the top tier standard that we're looking for so how much weight do you give that criticism of ethereum as you know it's monetary policies kind of undefined and nebulous and centrally coordinated so first of all again all of these projects have some degree of centralization it's a it's a question of degree and anyone who wants to start debating about the points of these degrees that's a fair fair topic of discussion to say you know where are the areas in which ethereum is is too centralized or how can we how can we make it more decentralized in these areas that's a that's a great discussion that same discussion is relevant to bitcoin there are things about bitcoin that are more decentralized than would be ideal you know every time every every time a miner drops off the network it just became a little bit more centralized every time a node drops off the network it became a little more decentralized the the core development itself is relatively centralized that doesn't mean it is centralized it means relatively so and if you had twice as many core developers it would become more decentralized so these are all fair fair points to debate and discuss the problem with the maximalist is they don't debate and discuss them with genuine curiosity they just say ethereum is centralized so it sucks bitcoin is decentralized so it's great and that's the extent of their thinking so eric what's your take on this we we we talk a lot about eth being money right using the hayak term right like is eath money in your opinion could it be a sound money it's different than bitcoin but is it a sound money yeah so much much like um much like decentralization money is a is an emergence it's something that things become they head toward the properties of money um you know and this the same debate was so common in like 2011 or 2012 about like is bitcoin money or not and again it's not a binary thing if you're using it as money if you're using it as a medium of exchange then it's money for you you're using it as money and the people you're trading with are using it as money many people don't use bitcoin for money many people don't use ethereum for money but both of them have um both of them have the attributes that make them good money ethereum is better in some ways bitcoin is better in some ways they're both they're both strong and i think as they grow people will find them useful and for for different things eric i don't know if you have a take on this but i'd be interested in what you think just you know off the cuff so um ray dalio talks a lot about um empires right um i think eop presents some compelling interesting evidence that china is rising american dominance is declining at least relative to china um like fiat's never lived in a world that has bilateral power structures like large nation states that um are equal that's not true the cult cold war was very much a time of fiat fair enough fair enough i guess the the the question is do you see a you know china versus america cold war on the horizon and how does that impact kind of the shaping of everything we've been talking about with crypto um yeah good question so i think the the best attribute of the world is how much countries trade with each other today countries that tend to trade with each other become reliant on each other in a mutually beneficial way that gets destroyed very quickly if they if they go to war or if they start isolating from each other so both china and the us and i should clarify both both the chinese people and the american people have a very strong interest and benefit from those countries trading with each other what politicians will do is sort of a separate question and is always a scary thing um certainly china will become larger than the united states in the size of its economy you know over the next couple decades uh will that change how the world works maybe maybe maybe not i don't know but i think a more important issue than the china-us relationship is is the debt of of the united states in particular um and i i guess if i the thing i would worry most about is if there is an economic catastrophe from a bond market collapse the the leaders of many countries will be very reluctant to blame themselves for their spending which is what caused the actual collapse they will be very eager to blame the other the other tribe you know for the americans it'll be china for china it'll be the americans and um that's that's really dangerous because so many people will believe the politicians and they will want to blame that other person across the ocean rather than their own spending that they've done as a nation um so i'm that's what i'm really worried about i love that distinction that you made and i'm not sure if people caught it but um you made the distinction between the chinese people and china um why'd you make that distinction yeah so i hate collectivism i hate defining people by groups um admittedly i still do it sometimes you know everyone does but um when people talk about like the us versus china that's just such an such a narrow frame of reference i i try to treat people as individuals and so when people say like china is stealing ip you know like what is what does that mean does that mean every chinese person is actively stealing ip no it it first of all maybe it's true maybe it's not but if it is true it's probably uh either a particular company who is stealing ip meaning particular individuals who are who are doing that or uh or the government organization itself and again particular people within that um and i think that's some that's important because when you collectivize an entire country of hundreds of millions of people uh you just you lead into the tribalism that is that is so dangerous when you treat people as individuals uh it's hard to start it's hard to start wars it's hard to cause the atrocities that many governments have caused in the past if people realize that everyone's just an individual well i think this is a little bit of a semantics argument because i think when we ask the question you know the the coming uh china america cold war i think what we're really trying to get at is like the actions of the leadership the government of each respective nation state and their stance towards each other and then how and what i'm concerned about is how the government of america and its stance towards china and vice versa the stance of the chinese government and it stands towards the american government how that impacts the people both of the the separate countries and and where you separated you know the chinese people from the chinese government and also the american people from the american government i definitely do see alignment between the americans and the chinese in their uh opposition to what i'm worried about which is a cold war between the american government and the chinese government does does this framing resonate with you a little bit better yeah it's just it's just too easy to collectivize people into a whole group like a billion chinese people are all individuals they disagree with each other on things there are you know there are people ranging from you know the best people in the world to the worst scum in the world and same in the united states and to to get into the habit of treating people as individuals and to tr and trying to not group them together is i think a good just mental process that people should be trying to achieve you know like even earlier um you mentioned you said we we are printing another trillion dollars you know you just kind of said that naturally like none of us on this call are printing dollars and yet you use this term we as if if we're actually doing that this i think is is an intentional rhetorical strategy of those in government to to convey their policies as if it is all of us doing it uh and clearly we're we're not i have no responsibility for the printing of that money i have no responsibility for that debt i have no responsibility for the the bombs that the united states politicians drop on other countries and kill children none of that is me uh so i i do not like when people say we or or collectivize a whole country like that can i can i ask you eric to put on your libertarian cap or you didn't remove it never mind well but let me ask you another libertarian question um so okay so it's been said or i've thought i don't know if anyone said that but i've often thought that um violence is the final foundation settlement layer for transactions for things right so even if you know let's say david has private keys that i want i can go wrench attack him with with um violence and basically he doesn't have those private keys anymore if i'm more powerful so government is kind of the process of hiring somebody with a big stick to protect us from violent individuals right so take that thought park it somewhere what happens if you've got two governments politicians at war and one group of governments or politicians has a set of classical liberal values they embody uh you know classical liberal libertarianism freedoms the sorts of things that are supposed to be preserved in our in the american constitution yet the other one does not do we not need to hire a government a group with a big stick to protect us against the opposing set of politicians from another powerful country who uh would seek to take those liberties away from us does that question make sense yeah certainly that's the justification for much of why government exists is because you need a strong protector and if if all that government ever did was protect people from violence then i i don't think i'd be a libertarian i think i'm that that sounds fine to me that would be such a smaller government such a more narrow government than than what actually goes on where i don't think many people actually believe the government will protect them from violence you know i i think the government will often clean up the mess if if there is a violent act they they'll file the the paperwork uh some of the people they might throw in jail if they're being violent some of that goes on very rarely do they prevent violence and much more often they are actually the instigators of the violence so throughout the 20th century tens of millions of people were killed by governments tens of millions and that like those numbers are so big that people people just don't comprehend it and yet they they see like a shooting where some where someone kills like three other people on the street they look at that in horror and they're like uh government needs more more power to uh to make guns illegal for example um because they have no no sense of proportionality of the damage and the mass murder and destruction the government's um way down i think the the absolute power corrupting absolutely concept is really important here and there's no no libertarian has any perfect solution to anything but perfection is not the standard that we should be striving for we should simply realize that violence and coercion are really dangerous and bad and we should do what we can to structure society in a way that will minimize how much violence and coercion gets used and centralizing it all in these massive organizations that can buy nuclear weapons and battleships and cause the most crazy destruction that anyone could ever imagine is maybe not the right way to do that so that's i think unfortunately a minority viewpoint most most people really desire a big strong government to protect them and i don't know how to solve that so i i resonate with so much of what you're saying about uh libertarian you know thinking personally but but i do have this this one kind of you know struggle i think with it uh others but one of them is the defense argument so you said if governments just were providing defense and nothing else you wouldn't have a problem with it but what if one government uh realizes that certain other things uh increase their ability to defend their country for example one might argue uh fiat money printing basically gives a nation the ability to go to total war so one more libertarian government says we're not going to do that like power to the people we're going to embrace crypto we're going to embrace gold we're gonna set a gold standard another government says no we're gonna go full uh surveillance system on our population we're going to uh use fiat you know money printing and the power that it gives us and then become so powerful through these mechanisms that they then that the the more libertarian government is unable to defend them i you know i know we're verging into like a little off topic but i've always wondered that about the libertarian defense uh kind of philosophy yeah i think this is really where this concept of of like gun ownership is important um i think and and i would be curious if there's a counterexample of this but i do not believe there's ever been an example in history where one country has successfully invaded another country where that other country was both highly open market so strong open economy with markets uh left to flourish and is is heavily armed where the where the citizenry themselves is heavily armed because the the energy and resources required to conquer such a place um just becomes impossible the the defense is so distributed there's no there's no place to bomb to win it just becomes a perpetual guerrilla war that can never be won and um so probably would not be or not be attempted and the other important point is that why would that country ever even try to invade them because they could get far wealthier by simply trading with that right you would destroy the whole purpose of the incentive to invade them in the first place if you did that the the economy the existence of the economy and the existence of the free market is the is the thing that you want and you don't get you don't get that by invading that with the military exactly you would destroy much of the productive capacity and you'd end up just spending tons of money um fighting a never-ending guerrilla war to what to what end to get what you know it's it's silly so eric i want to turn into something a little bit more concrete from instead of our very high level conversations tell us about what's going on at shapeshift um and for those that that don't know about the products maybe give us give us the uh the pitch what is what is the shapeshift product and can you tell us about the innovation and development that's going on there yeah so most people that have heard of shapeshift know of you know what it what it was when we started which was a simple tool to convert one digital asset into another and um today we're quite different so today it's much more appropriate to think of us as basically like a self-custody alternative to a coin base basically we are a place where people can buy crypto from fiat they can store it safely they can trade it between different coins um you know they can they can track the performance of that value they can send and receive as a wallet kind of all those base functionality things you can get with coinbase uh shapeshift has but in a self-custody model where you always control your keys um we think that that's that's super important and it's harder to do a ux in a good way like that but we think that's an important challenge and so that's what shapeshift does so um yeah if anyone hasn't tried shapeshift in the last couple years i'd recommend just trying it out uh we just released our app last week our mobile app um it's beautiful by the way thanks yeah thanks yeah i i love it it's been really fun to build it and uh we have some pretty cool plans with it in the future but yeah it's it's really a great way to get started um it can be your normal you know crypto spending wallet it supports multiple chains um integrated trading at extremely good exchange rates within that within that app um and very soon it's integrated into the shapeshift.com platform as well uh we also acquired portis back in march and for those of you in the ethereum world portis is a pretty big deal it's essentially a web3 provider it's basically a way to log into dapps with the same funds using just an email and a password and so you can access your money you know at various different apps and interact with them um so we are continuing to integrate portus into our system so in the very near future you'll be able to use the same you know the app that you log in on your mobile phone will have the same money that you can use with with dapps throughout the ecosystem they'll all be under one self-custody account unlike many other competitors uh shapeshift is not ethereum and erc20 only so you can get you can have bitcoin you can have other popular blockchains in there and so that's really what we're what we're working on is really making that user experience great and always maintaining a fidelity to the self-custody model one thing about the crypto world i'm really bullish on is just the removal of email and password uh so this uh this acquisition of portus makes me particularly bullish can you kind of go into the details about how portis removes email and password from the equation supportist does not remove email and password from the equation okay pardon me it is an email and password login so so in other words like when people are comfortable with coinbase it's because you have the simple you know email and password concept that everyone's familiar with and you log in and all your stuff's in there and you can use it and portis allows that to be done in a self-custody way so that's what we're that's what we're making happen so my impression is with portis you can basically use like your gmail email address and it can be one click access basically you don't have to worry about a you know 12 to 24 word recovery phrase it sort of takes care of that for you still in a self-custody type way yeah and to use that across different different applications so one email and password is the same funds on your phone on a web browser to the sheepshift.com platform and on all these different dapps and to be able to go from like fiat into bitcoin seamlessly and then seamlessly into ethereum or die and then into these different apps all all just in one place that's the that's the vision that's great and would you use the term dex for this or do you think like decentralized exchange means something else so people have often called shape-shifted dex and it's sort it has some of the attributes of a deck so it's it's self-custody like a dex is um but shapeshift is a centralized company so we're not we're not decentralized but people are holding their own funds so when someone's doing a trade through shapeshift what's happening is their asset called ethereum is sent to us and we send them another asset like bitcoin uh from our own wallet you know kind of right away so they're they're trading directly with shapeshift and shapeshift behind the scenes is aggregating all the liquidity of these various things at different exchanges so so a user can just go from one asset to another seamlessly with a high degree of liquidity and a really good price yeah so the bankless thing about this of course is it's non-custodial um you guys don't hold the private keys right we were talking so much about decentralization being a spectrum this is a nice place on that spectrum where you get a lot of the user experience of what we're used to on the web with you know single click email access to sign on plus you know you're not giving up custody of your funds you're keeping that entirely bankless you you own the private keys yeah yeah we we we want to make self-custody as easy and friendly as custody services because i think that's really when you get you know popular adoption they they won't they won't take a self-custody position on their own even if they understand why it's valuable because they just want things to be easy so we have to make self-custody as easy for these people as as a normal custodial model and we're we're getting there i think i think once the the portis login is unified across our services people are going to see what what we've really been working on and they're going to realize like how powerful that is eric it's been such a pleasure to have you final question for you just because it feels like we're entering a new era possibly do you think we are entering the next bull cycle for crypto right now hell yeah i definitely do that absolutely i definitely do what's it gonna be like i mean you've been through all of the cycles i think it's 2011. what's this one gonna be like three yeah three or four of them um i don't know each one's crazier than the last um and so you know i i think just because price predictions are always fun because i'm almost always wrong um i think f is over a thousand by christmas uh i think bitcoin is over 20 000 by christmas and where these rallies take both of those coins i don't know but but probably five to 10x the prior peaks kind of thing um and this cycle will repeat it's a it's a speculative mania um and you have to be careful with it you can't lose your head in the up or the down or the volatility in between and ultimately it's much better to just hold hold long term and try not to worry about it too much but certainly these huge bubbles bring in an immense amount of interest and new people that want to build things and for for every for every speculator that just wants to make a quick buck there's often someone who might start that way and then they figure out that oh there's an entire revolution going on and i'm going to stick around and see what this does that's how many people get involved so i think they are uh these cycles are healthy for the industry and um they're always they're always fun people just need to keep their heads about them eric fantastic david i think we've got our sound clip to yeah and advertise this episode right there uh eric thank you for being bold with all of your statements today uh even even making uh price predictions just for just for the hell of it yeah and i i guarantee they'll be wrong of course but you know what order of magnitude report of magnitude right yeah we give some grace there um it's okay to be wrong absolutely uh thank you on behalf of the bankless nation eric some action items for you guys one thing you need to do is try out the shapeshift try out shapeshift on mobile it's non-custodial it's the original non-custodial crypto exchange the ux on mobile is absolutely awesome you can do more than erc 20s on it it's fantastic we'll include a link in our show notes um also david we are at 79 on five star reviews man are we gonna make it to 100 like i have this goal of like a hundred five star reviews by the end of august what do you think yeah and and everyone knows that the five-star reviews on the bankless podcast is directly correlated to the crypto prices so if you really want eric's predictions of of uh bitcoin and ether to come true you gotta you gotta give those five star reviews that's how we get the bankless gospel into the ears of more people and so if you are trying to build the bankless nation alongside us the easiest and most simple thing you can do right now is pull out your phone or wherever you listen to your podcast and give us those five star reviews absolutely guys uh risks and disclaimers bitcoin is risky e is risky crypto is risky so is d5 this is not financial advice you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us this has been bankless episode 24.
