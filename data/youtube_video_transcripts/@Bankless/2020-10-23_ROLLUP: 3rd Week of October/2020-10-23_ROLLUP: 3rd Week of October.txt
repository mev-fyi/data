whenever you're ready all right welcome everyone to the weekly roll up this is our second weekly roll up david i'm super excited this is the third roll up of october happy friday morning to you guys who are looking on youtube watching us on youtube and also on the live stream david how are you doing this morning absolutely fantastic ready to run through some of the news that's happened in the last week injecting it straight into your brain in a nice little package all rolled up for you perfect yeah that's exactly what we're doing in this segment comes out friday morning hot and what we do is we dedicate five minutes to five topics we cover the market number one releases news takes and then we end with what we are excited about and what's happening in general so five topics five minutes each we get it in your head in 25 minutes the schedules every friday so every friday morning both on youtube where you can see the visuals that accompany this and also the podcast david you ready to get started man let's let's round them up we're rolling it up all right we're doing it round them up and roll them up we are starting with the market what is the market saying i feel like it might be good things david shall we start with bitcoin we have five minutes yeah the market is saying we're going up and to the right at the time of speaking bitcoin is thirteen hundred to thirteen thousand two hundred dollars which you know is a higher number than what it was last week uh and this has just been on the heels of a bunch of bullish news some of which we will talk about and some of which is just like a lot of people in the legacy world really seem to be figuring out bitcoin right this is a hammer i've been beating or a drum i've been beating for a while people are learning how to resonate with bitcoin's value proposition and understanding bitcoin as a whole is bullish for bitcoin yeah this is a move that is actually highest year to date as well so we're highest year to date uh for bitcoin pretty impressive and it felt like you know sometimes people ask about price move like why why did it happen and often when i'm asked that i'm just like i have no idea it's it's crypto it's sort of a random rock but well random walk but this uh felt like it was um maybe precipitated by some news particularly the paypal news which i know we're going to get to in a moment is that your take as well yeah it is but also no um paypal is the news of the week but bitcoin's bullish for for news other than that right there's plenty of other reasons to be bullish uh and i i think that paypal is you know is there's a lot of attention in the media it's it's extremely validating and it's definitely relevant but you know we were going to get to this point you know at some point sooner or later it's just paige with the paypal news just made that happen sooner yeah got it okay let's talk about eath chart too so ethe is also having a fairly good week we're at 4 17. what's your take on eath price yeah the the twitter and market commentaries from people have been really interesting as defy assets and yield farming has kind of deflated uh the narrative was that you know defy assets are rotating into bitcoin and as defy assets went down bitcoin was going up and this and this recent move by ether from like just 390 to 417 where it is today is a really strong uh return punch to bitcoin if we are thinking about things in an adversarial way which we don't necessarily have to however when it comes to leading the market it looks like people were getting ready for bitcoin to lead the market but ether is hot on its heels if not keeping up or and even going faster all right so 417 of course this is as of thursday things could change by friday morning when you are listening to this a little bit but let's talk about some other metrics that are a bit more i guess constant less fleeting and that is ethereum is actually seeing an all-time high in active addresses so we've talked about before david each active address roughly corresponds to not necessarily a user but to like a bank account an ether address is you know similar to a bank account so it could represent a large a large number of users large number of capital pools um what does this mean total uh active address is at all-time high for ethereum higher than 2017 yeah this is a really timely a piece of news to come out right on the heels of metamasks one million monthly active users that they that they uh registered uh check out the state of the nation that we did with jacob cantel earlier this week for more news on that but it just seems to be that like people are learning to use ethereum there are reasons to get onto ethereum and you know like you said one act one active address is not necessarily like you know it could be uh the same owner as another active address but it does at the end of the day it doesn't really matter like all-time high and active addresses is all-time high in active addresses when we look at ethereum and when we look at its fundamentals we look at its economic activity and active addresses are economic activity another indicator of economic activity is the amount of value that the network settles so these are financial networks bitcoin is a financial network it primarily just settles uh bitcoin so value denominating bitcoin ethereum can settle value denominated in ether but also value denominated in other assets as well and if you convert all the settlement value to dollars what you get is a pretty impressive pace for ethereum so ethereum is on pace to settle over one trillion dollars worth of value in 2020. that's pretty phenomenal and it's overtaken bitcoin in this by a lot um so like its run rate is beating bitcoin what does that mean yeah that that's exactly what ethereum is supposed to do it's supposed to be a host of generalized economic activity where bitcoin is really good at settling bitcoins ethereum is really good at settling everything else and i'm not really sure that like you know there's a lot of news about crypto but it's mainly bitcoin and mainstream uh i'm i'm not sure that like people are learning about ethereum's capabilities quite yet and when that that wave of people comes when paypal leverages stable coins or crypto dollars not just bitcoin and eth in on their platforms as like remittance payments and cash app also integrate stable coins like we there's so much more adoption to be had with like leveraging ethereum's economic activity as a platform that and the fact that we're already ahead of bitcoin is insane i can't imagine where we're going to be when all these companies integrate stable coins yeah bitcoin is in second place in terms of the value it settles on its network pretty impressive for ethereum total value locked we'll just look at this briefly because we've got to move on um it's up 12.4 billion locked in d5 protocols the amount of eth locked it's a little bit down but still we're tracking at about 9 million ether supply locked in d5 so super impressive david let's jump to um releases section yeah section two so we got five minutes for this what got released last week well obviously the big news is that paypal is now open to cryptocurrencies which there's a there's a lot of takes to be had here first off there's a very obvious take that this is awesome and bullish and adoption and that's exactly what the markets are saying uh you can now if you are a merchant that uses paypal your customers can pay you in bitcoin or in ether right we just had a comment from a bank list nation member in the bankless discord that talked about how grateful he was that he was able to purchase like the bankless uh newsletter with crypto right because if he didn't have that option he wouldn't have any other option to purchase it right and what paypal is doing with crypto is it's allowing and you know unbanked people to use their ethereum bank account to use their uh bitcoin bank account to pay for things inside of the paypal network which is that i mean that's what's really exciting and it's also extremely legitimizing of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large i think you're about to give maybe a a downside take as well because that exists as well so we get adoption that's a plus also i saw 2021 they're talking about rolling it out in venmo everybody i knew i know at least my area they like they use venmo all of the time so this is definitely adoption of it's not just bitcoin it's bitcoin ether and some other uh crypto assets as well like bitcoin cash who cares but um that's pretty bullish but there is a flip side to this in that what it's not bankless right yeah it's a walled garden right and so there's also a philosophical question to have here because like you you you can't purchase uh bitcoin or ether with paypal yet but like even if they can they don't let you re send your received crypto as a merchant or as a customer they don't let you send your received crypto to your own external wallet right and this is exactly what jake schravinski was talking about forever ago when he was on the bankless state of the nation is that what he is worried about is that regulation is going to put up walled gardens around these entities that can leverage crypto leverage bitcoin leverage ethereum in their own like centralized way right and so they have their own internal ledgers just like coinbase has their own internal ledgers but think about coinbase except it doesn't let you withdraw your crypto right and so you can only send bitcoin to other paypal accounts which is just like the same system that we already have right and so you know tip of the hat for paypal for getting this out the door and i hope they continue to break down those wall gardens i know that they need to be careful when they put their foot their foot out into some into the unknown with something like this but if we want to do to like enable a bankless world we need them to break down those walled gardens and allow us to send bitcoin and ether out of their platform all right well i i have a spicy take on this but we'll save that for later let's talk about other releases the next is a barn bridge so what is barnbridge barnbridge is a really interesting protocol that is allowing the stratification of risk across different tranches right and so the way this basically works is that there are two or more parties that have different claims on yield from d5 protocols specifically with stable coins right and so very very simply the way that this works is you can buy into the senior tranche and get locked in at like five percent uh interest rate and then you can get into the junior tranche which is is the tranche that fluctuates right so maybe the interest rate in a d5 protocol fluctuates from four percent all the way to nine percent well if that if that uh interest rate fluctuation goes up to nine percent the senior tranche gets the the bottom five percent and then the junior tranche gets like what's left right but it also pays in in the instance where the interest rate got under under the senior tranch rate at five percent maybe it averaged out at four percent the junior tron trade actually pays one percent interest rate to the senior tranche the important point is is that it stratifies risk and it tokenizes it and separates it and this is a very legacy money lego that we now have available on ethereum very cool and i know d5 has a tactic a tutorial you can use on the bankless youtube to try that out so check that out if you're looking to learn more david we're running a little short on time on releases but i want to get to the circle ubi concept so uh what is that that launched this week as well actually last late last week and uh people been going crazy at least in the d5 sector lots of dms like verify neon circle uh universal basic income of is of course what ubi stands for what is that yeah so it's a combination of a decentralized identity system like a bright id and a token that uh it has credit uh as a credit system as well i'm actually less familiar with the tokenomics but it it it starts off as a a decentralized identity system which is why you saw people on twitter saying hey will you verify me hey will you verify me because the only way that decentralized identity works is by a network of interrelated people that can vouch for each other and then you get when you get your three people to vouch for you you get your first initial distribution of circle coin but it's not like these things aren't fungible because your circles are different from other people's circles and i don't know much more about it other than that but your circles are valued depending on your network of people and they're not exactly the same value as what other people's circles are i know the coin itself inflates at about a seven percent issuance rate per year too so the idea is to have some sort of community based money and the cool thing about this is it was launched on xdi not on the main chain which i hope we'll get back to david uh we could also talk about yield protocol which which had a cool launch this week metamask swaps of course we'll include links to those in the show notes lots of cool releases to keep up with but let's get to uh the news what's happening in the news this week do you want to start with fincen yeah fincen went after a bitcoin mixing service this was a centralized mixing service that allowed people to mix up their bitcoins for privacy right uh this is very similar to tornado cash except for the fact that it was done by a centralized company not a protocol right and so this is exactly the same reason why uh uh bitmex uh was such a big deal right the same charge of violating the bank's secrecy act like allowing and enabling a centralized entity enabling people to launder money this is what the regulators really don't want uh and this is also why we defy because this is exactly what tornado cash does but tornado cash is a protocol that you can't stop and coin and ninja or whoever these people are that got snagged uh you know we're a centralized company yeah so uh it's a 60 million dollar penalty against the developer and owner of uh coin ninja larry dean harmon but i have to wonder like are they going to be coming um are they if they're going to be coming after the protocol devs or something like tornado soon or do you think we're immune from that i suppose that requires somebody like jake to weigh in it is concerning though it does feel like the uh the nation state the final boss as we call it is kind of peering its eye over to what's happening in crypto um i guess we'll have to see how that emerges um maybe let's jump to something good on the privacy front which is shielded uh z cash transactions that hit a high recently right yes yeah an all-time high and that's really important for privacy on z cash because if you if you have the way the z cast works is there are two types of transactions one is just a simple send just like a bitcoin transaction and one is a shielded transaction which has certain components of the transaction uh hidden and privacy with the way zcash works is these private transactions only work when there are other private transactions to hide amongst right you need to hide inside of a crowd of transactions and what we are seeing with this all-time high in shielded z-cash transactions is we are seeing high liquidity of privacy on zcash so zcash is finally getting to the point where his product is maturing in a way that allows people to use it in a private manner yeah i love zcash god bless cash it does feel at some level that there's sort of a test net for tech that can be built in ethereum and even bitcoin at some level like i feel like this on a side chain or this incorporated into aztec could be super bullish on the ethereum main chain or in a layer two um either way really cool that people are valuing shielded transactions um let's talk about central bank digital currencies too raoul paul um for real vision put out a really important thread on this and really essential threat on this basically saying if you don't think central digital currencies are coming you're totally missing the boat here they are coming they're maybe starting in china uh what what's your take on this news yeah this thread came hot on the heels of the imf calling for a second bretton woods moment which maybe just signals kind of what kind of situation the world economic status is in when we are calling for a revisitation of bretton woods and for those that don't know bretton woods was when the world got together and decided to reorganize the entire monetary and financial system so like big words uh and they basically in that in that meeting made uh us dollars king at that that's where that's where us dollar became king right exactly that's exactly right uh and so what raul paul is saying is is that you know what's going on behind the scenes with the world macro environment whatever it is it's pointing towards central bank digital currencies and you know there there's an important nuance where you know central bank digital currencies are not crypto they're not crypto currencies they are a centralized ledger on a with a digital format maybe it's a blockchain but it's not a cryptocurrency but what did what it does is it opens up people's acceptance and understanding of the real thing right it's a gateway drug yeah so it's kind of like a paypal case a little bit good and a little bit bad maybe a little bit good for usage raul paul makes the point where in the end this could cost the us dollar not in the short run he's very bullish on that but it could cost the us dollar to reserve currency status um david we're getting close on time for news do you want to maybe end with a coinbase report on what we're talking about the nation state coinbase released a transparency report that actually made made clear which government agencies have been asking for further information about individuals or about transactions and what were some of your takeaways from that transparency report yeah first and foremost i would say that this is while this is in the news cycle this happened last week this isn't that big of a deal it's just something i think that people should keep an eye on like this is a thing that is a reality uh coinbase is a centralized company inside the us and if they need to give up information to authorities they will do that right and so tip of the hat for coinbase for being transparent about it and telling us how what information requests are coming in so you know just as a user if you use coinbase just know that these requests happen uh and it's one of those it's definitely one of those things that you know if you're not doing anything wrong then this really isn't relevant to you but just know that your information could be requested 58 of all requests coming from the us the majority of those from the fbi the fbi is definitely watching what goes on in coinbase all right um david that's been the news thanks what's on your mind and if people have been following me on twitter and on the bangla show they they've no they know what's been on my mind or crypto and bitcoin specifically have been falling faster and faster and faster and this paypal domino the most recent one is is just the most recent one and i bet you this is going to i don't know what's going to happen next week but i bet you it's going to be something we have the election debate tonight maybe we're going to talk about relief there's a stimulus coming along the way it just seems like and what the thing that's on my mind is that there's there always seems to be like this elegant relationship between like the price chart of an asset the the market uh the the news and summary around that and just the overall sentiment and all these things kind of just resonate with each other and to me what i'm seeing is a complete resonance between the narrative behind bitcoin uh the news behind bitcoin and the fundamentals behind bitcoin all these things really seem to be resonating and that's why we're going up into the right yeah absolutely um so what i've been thinking about right so on on on county takes is uh maybe dovetails with what you're saying i totally uh get what you're saying with bitcoin and that is super bullish on the space and on bitcoin particularly in the short term but i want to give maybe a a spicy take here and people who you know know um i guess my twitter account too uh this shouldn't come as a surprise but i think that bitcoin is really preparing the way for ethereum and specifically ether the assets we talked about earlier second place in uh settlement fees that's now that's now bitcoin it's already second place in transaction fees that means ethereum is is doing more in transaction fees than bitcoin um and it's second place now in a transaction volume as well so like there's a trend here second place second place second place second place but bitcoin is far and away first place in market cap i don't think that'll last long term and when i say long term i'm not saying hey david flipping is imminent right it's happening 12 months you know 24 months i'm not sure the time range on this i think it'll take eth too ship i think it'll take um realization as to what ethereum's monetary policy actually is and realization of eth the asset but my spicy take here is that um bitcoin is doing awesome and i'm super excited about bitcoin but it's really just like a profit preparing the way for the messiah it's really preparing the way for for ether um i guess another take you know like that that uh is is sort of a a side quest on that is i i hear so much misinformation uh from bitcoiners and like not understanding what i would say is like the rest of crypto so even this term that is constantly used that's sort of embedded in crypto psyche this term of alt coin right so there's bitcoin and then there's alt coins implying there's like bitcoin in the coins um but like i don't think there's any such thing as an altcoin that was like a paradigm from 2015 yeah that i feel like is no longer relevant what we have now are asset super classes like at just like traditional finance yeah as we've known as we've talked about for 100 for hundreds of years and those asset super classes in crypto are capital assets with crypto capital assets crypto commodities crypto monies these are not all coins these are entirely different than altcoins it's like saying like apple stock is an alt coin of us dollars like it's an alt coin of gold no it's a stock it's a capital asset you're comparing a money to a capital asset it's just such a backward way of thinking and i feel like those with the wrong paradigm and wrong mentality are going to get left behind in the next bull cycle yeah that's it spicy take that that is a spicy take and the altcoin uh perspective was extremely appropriate when bitcoin was getting forked with like menial changes like change up the block speed and like sure that's that's an old litecoin yeah that's an awful light litecoin like bitcoin like diamond whatever that's all uh if it's if it's an alternative to bitcoin yes but ethereum and tokens on ethereum are not alternatives to bitcoin so kind of going back to what you were saying about uh you know second place in transaction fees bitcoin is second place in transaction volume bitcoin second place in settlement value it is worthwhile to note that like the whole point about bitcoin though is being first place in market cap that's true that is its job which is currently in first place uh and i think it is it's going to it's going to be a story for the ages whether or not ethereum as the leader in all the other categories literally every other category other than market cap does that mean that if the ether becomes number one in market cap or does bitcoin fulfill its job as all it needs to do is be number one in market that's bitcoin wins yeah if bitcoin wins that two horse race it'll be because of the strength of its scarcity meme we will we will be sure um to be clear we are bullish on both of these assets david let's get to the last portion what are you excited about man so third week of october year of our lord 2020 what is exciting crypto right now well we just came out of the ama with danny ryan where we got some of the questions about eth2 that we really wanted to hear about out of the way go listen to that ama it was fantastic but it just made me really excited about the deposit contract every time i pull up twitter and i hit refresh i'm like is it here like this is the staking contract right same day yes seem different yeah this is where phase one goes live this is where eath staking is a thing where staking becomes one of the core pillars of ether value accrual uh and every time i check my my my email my twitter whatever i'm like i'm waiting for that announcement like deposit contract announced uh all right what what's your gut like given we talked to danny this week who's like he knows right more than anybody um and vitalik this week what's your gut on when staking contract ships will be able to stake ethan i'm i'm going to be very specific and i'm going to say a week from monday a week from monday wait what date is that that is going to be november 2nd you think november 2nd announced and it will be announced announced okay perfect the day the day will be announced on november 2nd and you think the actual like date that it happens still this year november december november yeah okay i'm gonna guess before christmas early december is my guess guys both pretty bullish guesses two weeks different i guess i'm the bear now youth tool never shipped not until christmas yeah christmas 2020 to be clear not 2021 guys all right cool well all right so here's here's kind of what i'm excited about and maybe this dovetails is another sort of ethereum thing but what i started seeing this week for the first time is projects launching directly not on ethereum mainnet but on ethereum layer two like so generally through throughout the history of ethereum the place you you launch a d5 project or some new initiative is definitely going to be main chain right that's where you launch but we saw three different projects this week launched on xdi which is actually like a a side chain of ethereum so it's proof of authority so it's not quite an optimistic roll-up we don't it's not based on the security of the ethereum altogether but it's similar it runs the evm it's like a copy of mainnet and we saw a honey swap launch there so if you haven't heard of honeyswap i've barely heard of it either but it is a uniswap clone right so they just launched the uniswap they forked a uniswap and they put it on xdi and it's a new project that's launching not on mainnet but on the sidechain circle ubi the project we were talking about earlier david that launched directly on xdi um also the poap the pope tokens these are the bankless bankless uses this as well now when you mint a poap that's an nft token you mint that on xdi and then you can bridge it over to mainnet i think this is the future scalability for ethereum if you don't need mainnet you just launch on a layer two that's some sort of a roll-up that's some sort of an x-style like um side chain and then to the extent you need layer two or if it gets popular or if you're a user and you wanna migrate to back to the main chain you can at any time so that to me is how ethereum scales and that's kind of bullish and it goes off maybe what we were talking about on the podcast with vitalik in in terms of how ethereum is going to take shape in the future there's going to be a main chain and there's going to be all of these layer twos where you might you might not touch me jane right for like months or years you might do all of your activity in a roll-up a few roll-ups maybe in the future so excited about that it's coming to fruition feels like ethereum has a scalability strategy that is not just pie in the sky it's actually starting to happen yeah anthony cesano uh illustrates it as an ethereum as a nexus right where it's just like traffic controlling you know value from different uh rollups right and you know this is part of ethereum's value proposition where ethereum you like people don't even know need to know what ethereum is or understand it as a protocol in the same ways that we don't really need to know what tcpip or sms or those protocols like we just use them right and they're just in the background and you know ethereum being the l1 and uh l2s being the place that people actually engage in you have activity in is just high putting ethereum in the background and letting it do its job absolutely very cool david we kept our commitment this is about 25 minutes we got through five topics uh five minutes each we talked about market we talked about releases news some hot takes and what we're excited about guys hope you enjoyed this episode hopefully it was a good end to your week uh from david and ryan enjoy your weekend and thanks a lot for joining us
