uh man what would it be like if society like totally broke down right and we lost electricity lost internet like how long could i last right and that in that sort of a situation the truth is like not very damn long good morning bankless nation david what time is it oh ryan it's the friday weekly roll-up time where we roll up the entire week in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we do it anyways nonetheless because it's always the best show of the week at least in my opinion happy uh happy new year man this is our first show of 2022. how are you feeling about this year so far god already a very bumpy wild week for the first week of 2022. uh i'm kind of uh kind of thinking that 2022 is going to be way crazier uh and i think we're yeah crazier all around and yeah yeah i i started it started off that way okay like market volatility by the way man like my power was off for like two days okay 48 hours you're right uh the ai was down here yeah see i totally down man everything about me was down and um yeah so there was that and then yesterday so i um my internet turned off again midday i ran downstairs to go check my router i slipped and fell on my staircase and like fell straight on my back got the wind knocked out of me and then i remember just like in between my breasts being like oh my god is this what 20 22 is gonna be like flat on my back not able to breathe yeah gosh yeah it has felt like that in so many different respects yeah or maybe this is the worst week of 2022 and it's all up only only from here i'm only i don't know we'll see but guys we are going to get into it a few things on the agenda for today we're going to talk about the fed meeting okay jerome powell strikes again this time it's hitting crypto markets we'll talk about that that is the reason the markets are down in the drums all uh dumps also open c lots of stuff to talk about an open c a 13 billion evaluation but like one token right uh also there's some drama about open c maybe freezing nfts we're gonna dig into that and openc also had a comeback month in december we'll talk about that a little bit too so tons of stuff to discuss today on the roll-up uh david before we get in we gotta talk a little bit about our friends at on juno they wanted us to get the word out about these magical checking accounts these checking accounts for crypto natives you got to check this out so um david i i know you're like me right it's like you have your coinbase accounts you have your ethereum address you do all your bankless things but you still got your old-fashioned wells fargo account you got to pay and you have to we're not fully bank-less right and so you have to maintain a traditional bank account if you want to do things in the in the real world but the problem with your traditional bank account is it sucks it sucks in particular for crypto natives like there's no way in wells fargo for me to purchase uh ethereum or there's no way for me to receive a paycheck in bitcoin or eth or get any yield at all yeah it's totally disconnected so on juno is this cool i guess neo bank that is very much connected to the crypto world it's a bank account a checking account for crypto natives and there's lots of cool things you can do with it um the first is you could start to receive your paychecks in crypto which that's a huge unlock so you can earn paycheck with your paycheck in crypto you can also save get four percent yields using usdc you can also invest you can buy crypto at zero fees this is my account i recently created one uh and look i mean it has a uh a portfolio tab here you can check out you also get a card with this too like a virtual card with a debit card so it's like this crypto native bank account that um straddles both worlds i think it's going to be a nice hybrid solution for me moving forward there's some good news too for bankless listeners i think there's a 50 um incentive to open up an onjuno account you want to talk about that david yeah 50 if you use the code bank list to sign up with on juno in your preferred crypto asset and overall like the ui on this on this uh on juno is just exactly the ui i wish i had with my wells fargo account yeah uh so pretty awesome guys go create that account you guys can get started there's a link in the show notes to that and remember to use the code bank list to get that 50 off also david another psa the ethereum research team is doing an ama on reddit tomorrow i love those amas man there's so much learning that's that's dropped uh where's that gonna be is there a link in the show notes or something yeah that'll uh people have to go to the r ethereum subreddit in order to get that done uh there's not a link yet i do not believe um but it is happening at p.m utc time which i believe is i think it's probably just going to be going on all day uh today the day of uh the listeners listening to this if you are listening to this on friday but yeah this will be in the r ethereum reddit um i believe people are already asking questions so in our ethereum yeah there is already a link and we will we will have a link in the show notes uh people already are asking questions there uh so i will probably also pick out some of these responses questions and responses uh and cover some of the best ones in the roll up next week probably um but if you want to get your question asked or just read all of them go ahead and go to the link in the show notes to check out the ama all right let's get to markets david bitcoin bitcoin time the tumble the sad music is playing bitcoin falls below 43k it's even lower at the time of recording leads to 800 million in crypto liquidations this is the headline what's going on in bitcoin world yeah we had one of those big oof candles where we uh fell from the high high price of 46 000 down to 42 and a half thousand dollars currently at 43 000 overall down 7.5 percent on the week uh kind of uh i'm not a trader we're not traders here but there was a trend line that bitcoin broke through you can see it here on the youtube here as well uh we were really hoping to not break below forty six thousand dollars yet we did it anyways um so here we are uh traders are fearful uh state of fear in the crypto markets right now flat on your back in 2022 and how about eve uh what's going on with eath prices looks like it went the way of bitcoin as well yeah same same deal started the week at 3 800 it fell down to the low price of three thousand three hundred and thirty dollars has currently climbed and reclaimed three thousand four hundred dollars but overall down seven percent on the week so an oof week in the crypto markets well let's go through a few other metrics and let's just talk about what that what what this means after that but uh let's take a look at the ratio so the eath the bitcoin ratio what's that looking like right now yeah last week uh it started the week at point zero eight we are at point zero seven nine so fell down below that point zero eight meme line um nothing really much to report there oh we're also looking okay still looking i'm pretty good not not we'll have to monitor it how about the bed index so that's a a third defy a third uh bitcoin and a third eth what are we looking at on the week started the week at 144 dollars currently at a hundred and twenty seven dollars down ten percent ten point five percent on the week uh which means that the dpi tokens took an even bigger hit than bitcoin and ether okay so what's going on man what's happening in 2022 should we talk about um some of the fed minutes because i think this is you know you can't always attribute uh crypto market movements or even general marketing you usually cannot do stories you usually cannot but in this case i think you definitely can so jerome powell and the fed had a meeting they talked about shrinking the balance sheet they talked about getting a bit more hawkish including readering that they intended to raise the rates this year i think the shrinking the balance sheet statement was the the one that caught the market most off guard and stocks tumbled crypto tumbled along with it all the risk-on assets really went down as a result of this do you think this was the primary catalyst for the uh the wreckage that we saw over the last couple days i think the timing is pretty hard to ignore uh it happened right at the release of the minutes it happened at the same time as traditional equities markets also took a tumble so this happened across the board this was correlated in all assets ever and so just because of the nature of the money printer all assets are kind of risk on assets at this moment and so when the fed says they're going to be raising interest rates all assets take a tumble so that's that's uh i think it's a pretty clear connection there are other um possible explanations we're gonna get into this later in the show uh kazakhstan had a massive power outage which caused bitcoin to lose i think 13 of its hash power which is pretty significant uh and that can stoke some selling pressure from miners if 13 of hash power disappears uh miners can go risk off themselves and that can also create uh downward pressures for the whole rest of the market if if bitcoin gets sold off in mass so it could could be other things as well but i think this one is definitely the the hawkishness from the fed the the possibility of raising interest rates beyond what the market expected has got to be got to be in the lead for the biggest um reason why the markets took the tumble that they did it's interesting i think this is going to be a story to track all year david so talk about a theme of 2022 it's going to be what is the fed doing right it's like last year what were they doing they were continuing to print money it was kind of stasis but this year there's some inflation pressures the type of inflation the fed cares about is cpi that's what everyone notices that's what politicians notice and it's been seven percent here recently uh in the u.s it's like five percent in in uh the euro the ecb um i i read recently so it's like inflation fears are causing central bankers to take a more hawkish stance but they can only like they can only do that uh so much because when the markets tumble like this in this way that's also bad for the optics and you know also kind of um against the the principles that the fed has of making sure that the the economy continues to function so it's kind of a rock and a hard place and i think that'll be a major theme for 2022 is like how does the fed navigate this how do they you string that line through the eye of the needle 100 100 it's going to be well yeah you're totally right watching them nav and like thread that needle is going to be it's probably i i kind of think it's an impossible needle to thread and so seeing how they do it is always going to be interesting no matter what because it kind of maybe can't be done uh so the fallout from that is going to be interesting absolutely all right let's talk about this uh something that was up and everything else was down is metamask users active users been up so 21 million monthly active users since april and what's interesting about this from lee oh lee jin so she's coming on the podcast as well we're going to talk about a number of things we could bring this up if you compare this to monthly active users of facebook it's close to one percent it's point it's 0.7 percent right now metamask has versus facebook it's about six percent of twitter's monthly active users and it's about the rate of the number of internet users in 1996. feels about right what year is crypto in maybe it's 1996. well hang on we gotta control for population inflation so it's actually gotta be like 94.93 okay 94.93 and this is like monthly active users is only one measure of course of the usage of this thing i i think because this is a an internet of value also market cap and and the value and you know the fact that we're at two trillion dollars is another fantastic measure of this whole thing but what do you make of this monthly active users on metamask monthly active metamask is a it's a great signal because everyone uses metamask except for the solana ecosystem even uh if you're getting onboarded into polygon if you're getting onboarded to avalanche you're using metamask uh pick your l2 you're using metamask uh and so it's a pretty high signal of just very general rate of adoption uh granted like i have two computers and so i have metamask on there twice i also have metamask on my phone do i count as three probably but it's directionally always a pretty good signal it's kind of like the uh the netscape of the internet if you will that's that's really what metamask is in a lot of ways let's talk about this too david there's this fantastic report from electric capital and they do this every year i feel like it gets better every year more detailed in a lot of ways and what they try to do is they go through the developer metrics from each of the ecosystems and track that over time and so there are a few highlights from this that maybe we want to get into i'll start with the first one that i saw and that is this web 3 developers are at all-time highs right now okay 18 400 developers that's up it's almost double from the start of 2021 so we kind of doubled the amount of developers in the web 3 in 2021 which is pretty crazy um david i want you to talk about this one because this is super interesting why do the developers come in here is it like because they're excited why is it well i think the the line of show me the incentives and i'll show you the outcome is really true here uh when price goes up when number goes up it it tracks everything everything always gets attracted to capital and that includes developers and so when price goes up developers also goes up the interesting thing here is that and this is why we always know in crypto crypto's a one-way street people don't come into crypto and then they're like nah i'm gonna leave now when you come into crypto you tend to stay and so when prices go down developers stay flat and so like bad prices means that we just don't get any new developers we don't lose any developers we just don't get any new ones and so when price goes up we get new developers when price goes down we don't lose any developers uh and so it's this is kind of why crypto is always a waiting game like you can zoom in on the markets and be like oh it's up five percent oh it's up down percent down five percent but like it's just awaiting it you can just wait out the markets until the developers build out crypto into the vision of the future that we have for it and then prices will be up like it's just how it works you can just wait it out the developers aren't going anywhere yeah i totally agree and it's really interesting how that floor gets painted at like the peak of the last cycle becomes kind of the floor for for the next cycle um you know chris dixon in our podcast with him he's like ah i don't pay attention to prices so much i'm sure he does a little bit but he's like i pay attention to the talent inflows in the space and that's what i track this is an interesting way to track that it's interesting uh too if you chart it by ecosystem as well so you can compare some of the layer one ecosystems ethereum polka dot cosmos solana bitcoin those are the five largest ethereum really far in a way in the lead in terms of its mindshare and developer account this is not just protocol development but this is the entire ecosystem now keep in mind development application layer two keep in mind these metrics aren't like full proof so they're tracking github they're tracking open source open source projects primarily uh you know they're directionally correct but the data doesn't always like reflect the the entire truth here but ethereum definitely cemented in the number one slot number two is actually polka dot according to this which i found surprising then you've got um bitcoin cosmos and and solana right behind it here's another graph of the of the same thing this is if you compare the developer ecosystems from day zero and you do sort of an apples to apples comparison of of where they are and you kind of track the numbers here um what are some of your takeaways from this yeah actually if you go up to the very first graph i really want to pay attention to um especially on graphs like this uh the very first graph the area under the curve is really really important uh and so like we we have this blue line here of all of the developers and it just now just recently hit new highs right but it's so recent it's it's it's the area under the code this is extremely rough science it's the area under the curve that is the rate of a rate of development because these so many new web3 developers just came in they haven't built anything yet but now that this area under the curve is so large that every single day means so much more in terms of development than it did in july of 2017 for example i mean look at look at how much area under the curve there is in july of 2017 versus how much area there is under the curve in july of 2021. we are making like as an industry we are developing like three to four times faster than we were in july of 2017 and that's just what happens when developers come into the ecosystem uh and so while there's a lot of developers here right now they just onboarded them a lot of them are just you know experiencing their first apps like building their first stuff uh and so it's gonna take six months for that the area under the curve here to actually build out in order to into the thing where we actually get a bunch of new cool new stuff but the point is we are accelerating uh development here uh which is just super bullish totally it's all happening faster it's interesting here again this is a this is chart ethereum of course uh far in the lead with um 4 000 monthly active developers um you see kind of bitcoin down at the bottom and bitcoin just hasn't really grown that much and this sort of makes sense for the type in developer account that sort of makes sense for the type of network that that bitcoin is um but some of these other networks are like growing just as fast if not faster than ethereum in its early days and i think some of them benefit from the infrastructure that ethereum has really built out already so that's interesting to see as well um yeah let's talk about this too david so uh nft market it feels like nfts are back all right so after a lull maybe for the last couple of months kind of a minor bear market-ish uh corrections signs of life yeah you're showing some signs of life and this doesn't necessarily mean they'll return to all-time highs or not but what do you think this means yeah well we had open c just you know an nft volume at large just grew so fast so quickly we would it's totally expected to see a retracement and that's what we saw we saw about four months of decreasing volumes uh but december and also the first week of 2022 saw a resurgence in volume away from the decreasing downtrend that we saw in the last four or five months so board 8 yacht clubs have really performed well both in terms of floor price and also volume and also just like celebrity adoption so many celebrities have board apes now uh and then there were some other winners as well doodles are on the mind uh x copies have gotten a ton of volume so yeah there's always a bull market somewhere uh it's just a matter of finding out where it is this is uh some nft stats for 2021 just a year in review this is put out by um andrew chang i believe in the one confirmation team uh andrew chan that is um some interesting stats of note this is from mediversal newsletter ethereum is still king so 90 plus of all nft volume was on ethereum this year um and that includes also kind of axi infinity its ecosystem that as a side chain there were total market cap of nfts past 31 billion in 2021. 31 billion uh which is crazy but it's still only 100 uh just adding up all the nft i guess um i yeah some of them you know maybe on openc i'm not sure you could dig into the data here but it's interesting this is only 1.3 of crypto's total market cap right so remember all of the predictions that nfts were eventually going to be larger than crypto if that's the case they're a long way to go yeah there's a lot of upside here if that's the case um active nft users on ethereum hit 2 million it's pretty crazy trading volume on nfts past 20 billion in 2021 some pretty big stats here and then it goes through different um segments of the nft market like you know crypto art gaming marketplaces collectibles uh and then some highlights and other things uh yeah what are your what are your thoughts on the year that of 2021 that nfts had do you think we're going to repeat something like that this year yeah i'm reminded of a tweet thread that kane warwick put out forever ago about the difference between technologies that fundamentally change the world but then are just not very loud technologies and i think that's defy uh very very just paradigm shift in what it means to do finance uh nfc is also a paradigm shift but when it's only a 32 billion dollar market cap versus how much exposure and like social and cultural uh acknowledgement there are around punching above its weight class it's it's it's it's making bigger cultural impact than defy is at like one one thousand one one thousands of the market cap like absolutely insane uh and it kind of just shows like how small the nft industry actually is thirty one two billion dollars is is i mean it's a lot of more money than i have certainly but like it's not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things yeah it's it's still small so i i guess one takeaways nfts are early but what do you think though do you think they're gonna have a crazy year in 2022 oh i think they have to yeah i mean crazy such an open word uh do you do i think prices are going to go up in 2022 uh for some uh and i i i think 2022 will be another crazy year in the world of nfts and it's going to be crazy in a way that we can't expect right now that's it that's the key it was crazy in 2021 in a way we couldn't expect and it's going to be crazy in 2022 in a way we can't expect either so i expect to be surprised uh and that is crypto for you there's also another almost companion report it's a separate report but i call it companion report chain analysis put this nft report together and it took a different lens on things it was basically like um who's winning who won in 2021 so of that 30 billion or so in value who made the money a few takeaways at least uh from from my mind were openc data actually suggests it's really difficult to achieve outsized returns without being whitelisted on openc so you kind of had to be on openc in order to get these returns another takeaway was if you want to flip nfts don't buy the cheap stuff buy the blue chips which is interesting the top 500 nft collections account for 94 of all the flips the top 100 accounts for 50 of the flips on openc so if you're kind of scouring the the bottom tier of the market just buying the cheap stuff that's actually not the way according to this report that you're making real money on nfts and most people next lose this next chart i think is is really really insightful and this is everything everyone should listen up about this uh this tweet says you're probably not making money flipping nfts 20 of user addresses on openc account for 80 of a secondary nft sales well just five percent of all addresses account for eighty percent of profits made on secondary sales uh and so yeah yeah like this is this reminds me of uh hazu made this comment i think in the podcast a while ago where uh there was this uh big big boom in online poker for a while yeah and everyone everyone and their mother started playing online poker and then the really really good poker players just milked all the noobs for all of their money and then the and they made a living on it they made a living on it they got extremely wealthy and then all of the you know the retail poker players put their tail between their legs and went elsewhere and did something else with their lives because they got worked and then the world of online poker just hit like a quote-unquote bear market because there weren't any players left because all the good ones took all the money from the bad ones uh i i definitely kind of think that's what's going on with nft flipping and that's definitely why the best advice you can ever get about nfts is you only buy something that you like rather than trying to get rich on it uh because like if you're trying to flip nfts that's a like you got to know what you're doing uh and one of these uh one of these charts illustrates that uh in order to uh optimized for the best flipping potential it says the tweet a couple tweets down says uh arguably the most important stat in the entire report for nft flippers is that the top five percent of nft flippers on average is paying 2.2 eth more for their nft so they're not playing four floor nfts they are sifting through trying to find the rare ones doing their homework doing their due diligence uh and then flipping that and so they're paying premium they're paying the premium they're targeting their their selections they're they're doing their homework uh and if you're just buying a floor hoping to flip it like you might get you might get worked you might get worked you might get worked i mean i think the takeaway here and by the way this in my opinion this goes for all trading not just nft trading it's 95 of you listening to this should not be trading yes you're you're trading and flipping exactly 95 of you probably shouldn't be doing that and that goes for nfts too according to the stats um guys we will be right back with some of the releases and raises and the rest of the roll-ups but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitram and arbitrom's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitrome if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nft projects building on arbitrary many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrum.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitram using bridge.arbitrum.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswap grants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back with the releases of the week the first is this maybe some alpha here from zapper what are we looking at yeah zapper is uh introducing what looks like notifications for nfts uh so if you do decide to flip nfts you might want to use zapper because you can get notified about when your friends buy nft stuff uh you can actually see my profile picture will come up there there i am uh my notification is that i bought a pouchy penguin uh there's a bunch of drama with the penguins right now i see me in this what did i do yeah what did we do uh no it's not real it's just it's all the crypto twitter are they saying i did yeah what what nft did you oh i received a poe oh you've received a bankless doubt lovely yeah so you can just uh follow get push notifications for what you and your friends are up to with regards to nfts through zapper kind of what did you do kind of cool i bought a pudgy penguin allegedly oh you bought a punch of paint and that's your patchwagon all right cool yeah that's great i love that functionality um it's more functionality from ave too looks like they're building a mobile wallet that coming from stani is the tweet what do you think their mobile wallet might contain david well gotta contain borrowing and lending it's also gotta be on layer two so hint more on this later in the show uh because there's no way that people are gonna be like the only people that are willing to pay uh l1 gas prices are also going to be the desktop power users so any mobile wallet i think it's got to be a l2 wallet so arjun just deployed on zk sync right um ave you think they'll do zk sync do you think they'll do an optimistic roll up do you think they'll do starkware or something like this well i think we have an announcement later in the show ryan to talk about so we will oh really then yeah how do you remember okay we'll get to that soon guys to be continued in the back after the show uh let's talk about this too this is big release bitco they're now supporting index co-op cool assets very cool this is the mvi data the bed index as well in bitco bitco of course is a qualified custodian so it's kind of like fire blocks this is where the institutions store their money so this is a gateway for institutions to buy index co-op products and of course these are all indices of other assets kind of think of them as defies answer to etfs really cool that bitco is doing this now and that was just announced you can learn more with the link in the show notes any thoughts on that big d5 mullet yeah centralized custody provider in the front a bunch of d5 tokens from a d5 uh dow in the back pretty cool big greasy d5 that's what we got going on multi-dimensional eip1559 that's the title of this eth research post david i haven't gone through this yet but you have what can you tell us about this yeah this is a research post out of vitalik buterin himself talking about how we can use an eip1559 type mechanism to control for other network resources mainly how we compute gas uh so right now there are hard-coded values for all the different types of functions that go into a gas computation uh so like is are you multiplying a number are you dividing a number like what are you doing to a number uh and all these have arbitrary values and that's how we manage the resources of the the ecosystem this is when we were talking about like increasing the gas cost of call data that we're talking about this number um but and they change in hard forks right like basically manually rough consensus we should change this thing and then they get updated and change developers are like hey this resource needs to get up regulated or down regulated so let's increase or decrease the price because we think that some resource is this is a risk or this resource is underpriced et cetera so it's manual changes vitalik buterin is talking about taking every single thing that goes into the calculation for how gas is calculated and making uh giving a like a control theory type mechanism to manage it right so no way yeah that's awesome right so algo managed rather than people managed yeah exactly so if resources are underutilized they will become cheaper if resources are over utilized they will become more expensive and this goes back to one of the first big statements that i heard out of any developer in ethereum came out of mean solomoni's mouth when he talks about no magic numbers belong in blockchain design what's a magic number a magic number is a number that's just arbitrarily determined by humans uh because human we're trying to get away from human controlled governance uh and so we need to have these uh control theory these equilibrium uh these numbers that that uh converge on an equilibrium organically naturally in order to have a sustainable long-term uh equilibrium uh so well because what you're trying to do is you're trying to remove the dials from human intervention you're trying to like so the whole the start of this podcast me the start of the year was a magic number that jerome powell was talking about he's got maybe two magic numbers one is the interest rate yep and the other is how much is on the fed balance sheet how much are they and they dial those up manually there's like 12 people in a room who make these big decisions right totally and so this is exactly in the crypto economic ethos uh where we are trying to use crypto economic economics to manage our public goods resources uh and so uh pretty interesting in-depth blog post there's a lot of uh you know vitalik language in here uh but overall the comments from the other developers are like hey this is really really cool big big engineering lift kind of scary kind of scary engineering lift yeah and so we will see if how well this gets received by the rest of the ethereum researchers over time it could be a long-term goal it's really cool that the that's being thought of right now um let's talk about this from a raises perspective moving on to raises open c is raising 300 million dollars they just announced that and that's an evaluation of 13.3 billion wow okay 13x unicorn now they just became a unicorn last year and now they're like a unicorn with 13 horns that's crazy man i guess it's not a unicorn then it has 13 horns that's something else okay but so what's going on with openc is this just the valuation how's it like what what do you think here dude you might as well just call right now you might as well just call openc like the nft store like it's the nft store of crypto uh it's it's the apple you know store of crypto i guess right it's it's managed to strike a very interesting balance between a centralized web 2 company and a decentralized web 3 protocol that i think positions it pretty well uh and it's they've captured basically all the volume in 2021. is it is it like an nfc bank is that what you'd say no i would consider i would say consider coinbase's future nfpd platform to be an nft bank because this is still self-custody um right opencv still stuff custody but you still need to ask permission to sell stuff on open c so it's definitely we're going to get more into this in the show but you know what this valuation is based on though it's like openc is literally printing money right now yes yeah there's right for a 90-person team the amount of revenue that they have like they are so incredibly lightweight for just the amount of ether just flowing into their coffers totally there's some rumors floating around too i don't know how substantiated this is neither david nor myself have any insider knowledge about this but there's some talk that openc maybe plans to buy a wallet like a dharma labs wallet uh that could be in the works i'm not sure well to see how that develops but like what do you do with 300 million dollars you're not gonna hire that many people are you you have to make some like acquisitions at least and execute on a growth strategy i would think uh you think we're gonna see super bowl ads for nfts david oh gosh uh i mean i kind of think all ads are gonna start to become crypto ads in the future okay so i went and i i saw um uh the new spider-man right and there was the first crypto ad played as a trailer wow it was a crypto.com ad yes did you see that i saw i saw it on when i was watching dune yep yeah okay so like yeah first time it's starting to invade it's starting to feel normal and i you know i think we'll see more of this i mean they're going to spend that 300 million dollars on something open c super bowl ad would be hot pretty awesome it's a lot of fodder there for uh for graphics and such um but speaking of massive raises of course all of that money is going somewhere it's going to jobs as well these crypto companies crypto protocols are looking for talented people you can check out what jobs are available on the bank list job boards and crypto 2022 could be should be the year you get a job in crypto make it make that your new year's resolution resolve to get a job in crypto yeah at least by the end of the year you got 12 months uh clock is ticking here are some jobs senior full stack engineer cynica a senior software engineer from gilded a founding full stack engineer from utopia labs senior ios engineer smart defy community ecosystem lead dydx crypto research analyst nft specialist from bitwise uh smart contracts research analyst bitwise again and a governance specialized specialist from bitwise a blockchain developer you've got to be specialized in rust at solitics a senior blockchain engineering manager as well there's a ton more on the bankless job boards go check that out also subscribe so you get these sent directly to your inbox and make 2022 the year you get a job in crypto absolutely it's the best best friend just trying to get a job in certainly yeah let's get into this totally yeah it's always exciting news uh let's start here so the podcast that we did with vitalik and we put that out on monday that made some news this week in crypto cycles particularly this headline here's a article from cointelegraph we are 50 of the way there says vitalik on ethereum development he said that in a two-hour bankless podcast episode and that was a fantastic episode man this is all about ethereum's roadmap fifty percent of the way there uh what are your thoughts on this yeah vitalik buterin once again reclaiming the number one most download episode in 24 hours uh oh really he's had that title before but he lost it a number of times to others chris dixon was the previous holder but now it's vitalik buter and once again uh yeah it really uh did a great job illustrating the rest of the ethereum roadmap uh and we talked about this in the debrief which uh was one of the few debriefs that we actually gave out for free subscribers uh we we do a 30 minute debrief for those that don't know we do a 30 minute debrief every single podcast goes out to the premium subscribers rss feed uh but because this podcast was so good and i thought the debrief was particularly helpful we decided to release it for free um uh and uh we were talking about how the clarity behind the ethereum roadmap is something that we've never had before that we have now um we can actually clearly see through what we call the crypto fog of war the the the unknown r d's of cryptography and consensus and all that stuff for the first time we actually have a very distant vision of the future uh which we had something we've not had before in ethereum so that's what i really enjoyed out of this um on this podcast we also talked about the rise of the alternative layer ones and what vitalik's taka is on that because he thinks that all cryptosystems will ultimately converge upon the same future so regardless of what point on the blockchain scalability trilemma that your blockchain has decided to compromise on it doesn't matter because we're all handed to the same state anyways and so we unpack what that means and why that's true um so just really educational episode yeah i listened to it again this morning actually david well actually my first time this morning and it just held up it it's exciting i want to bring it back on the podcast [Laughter] more questions sir uh let's talk about this too uh ave they have just released ave arc we talked about that before that's kind of their institutional product um they white listed it with it's been whitelisted now with with fire blocks which is kind of like a bitco a institutional custodian what's the story behind this product david yeah we we just now have a kind of a siloed quarantined version of ave specifically for kyc'd institutions uh and so i think a lot of listeners and stani actually addresses this here in the article people ask like well is that and just antithetical to what defy is and stani just goes well yeah it is totally antithetical uh but it's what we can do now to in order to get retail and institutions closer to the same to the same place so it's a necessary evil but i have a different take and i i think this is actually the better take and my my take is that in the current financial world we have all the retails that are retail individuals the normal people that just have their banking accounts where they're getting point zero zero zero zero one percent apy uh and those people are quarantined away from actual finance but in d5 it's the inverse because the d5 has no limitations on on the basic ethereum address it's the regulations of the nation state that are forcing or compelling people like ave and compound to create a siloed version of defy and so where in the traditional finance world the individual is cut out in defy it's the institution that's cut out because they have this gated like neutered siloed version of defy when the rest of us get to go and do anything that we want and so it's actually completely the inverse and so this is actually retail taking the big w here because ave and compound and fire blocks have to build out all this special stuff in order to allow for uh big institutions to become compliant and so yeah like it's the institutions that are taking the l this time yeah i think that's a great take and i i do think istani believes that too right so he says at the end i think defy will forever be permissionless and accessible to everyone as long as these networks like ethereum are decentralized right and so what what he's basically saying is like the ave arc product was built on top of ave it doesn't take anything away from the permissionless protocol that exists already with ave so defy users who aren't institutions continue to use ave the way they always have but i think you're totally right in that in the traditional finance financial system it's a two-class account there's like first-class citizens and second-class citizens and retail are definitely second-class citizens okay the first-class citizens are the bankers the institutions those in power and you're totally right that defy completely inverts that and institutions become the second class citizens we have better more permissionless access if we're just using ave with our metamask wallet and our ethereum address then through this permissioned you know pool via fire blocks but all that to say um this liquidity is going to be good for the ecosystem one of my observations coming to this 2022 david is i don't think crypto has yet seen what institutional fomo actually looks like okay the first decade of crypto was i mean institutions came toward the end of that but was primarily retail driven right the institutions were still stuck on yeah oh crypto that drug dealer money yeah it's like terrorist money okay we're not touching that stuff we haven't yet seen institutions fomo in to this asset class and i think over the next decade we will in all areas i'm talking like web 2 companies coming to web 3 i'm talking about institutional banks uh coming to you to defy that is totally going to happen and we're just starting like we haven't seen the fomo yet and i think it's going to be a big space to watch over the next decade i'm not sure how much happens this year versus in future years but it's definitely a massive trend that i see 100 100 all right let's talk about this uh oh okay was this what you're referring to earlier what's the headline here yeah so ave is trying to deploy on starknet uh and so this is a proposal in the ave governance forums about deploying ave on starknight so a proposal for progressive bootstrapping of the arc ave ecosystem over stark net stark ray's permissionless and decentralized zk roll up uh and so with this would pair nicely with an ave mobile app because stark net is it's even cheaper than an optimistic roll up it's super super cheap like less than a penny and so a less than a penny type transactions that are also instantaneous are kind of what it takes to satisfy people that are used to web too and so without without sacrificing decentralization it's an important point uh and so that's really that makes sense i think these things have to come in tandem if ave wants a mobile wallet it's got to be on something like a zk roll up so maybe we're putting some pieces together and uh and we're seeing this tape shape uh take shape an ave mobile wallet on a stark net question mark maybe that happens we'll see um what's happening with polygon though so some issues some hiccups along the way with polygon there's this game called sunflower throwing a wrench in polygons gears that is the title here of the article what's what's happening i think uh polygon is having its cryptokitties moment where it had this first big uh successful game uh and because of the just transactional capacity of this game this game just involves a lot of transactions uh it really just like crippled the uh polygon network so it polygon gas prices spiked to 410 gwei uh that's not that's not guay in ether terms that's gway in matic terms but still pretty high in terms of gas consumption uh and but uh this is this is what kind of what happens when you allow a network to have really really cheap transactions people fill them uh and so this has actually already been a problem for polygon previously they've already started to tackle some of this stuff they raise the gray limit from zero to 30 previously to start to mitigate some of the spam transactions um and so that that really that eliminated some of the the transactions that were just trying to get a penny of mev out uh but now when there's a game people are like playing this game like oh they'll pay like five cents a transaction 10 cents a transaction and apparently that was still enough to completely congest the polygon network and so this is kind of what happens when you have a chain that has really cheap transactions if you get if you optimize for cheap transactions guess what you get a lot of transactions like that's that's what happens um so this is this is something that not just polygon but all all chains that have cheap transactions have to deal with and i am less worried about it at the later two than i would be at the layer one and what's interesting here is um the same sort of thing seems to be playing out and has played out multiple times with solana so uh this is just i i don't know if this is the second time this has happened this week but the solana network is also experiencing degraded performance due to high uh transaction throughput and this is because as i've understood in the past there's been a lot of ddos attacks right a lot of spam type transactions that have brought the solana network to its knees and even more than that actually caused it to go offline for periods of time uh is this i mean are these two things related is this the basically the same effect you got cheap transactions so you get lots of spam you get open security vectors for dos attacks yeah it's it's a pretty like direct relationship when you have fast chains you you compromise on stability uh and so slow slow chains are stable chains fast chains are unstable chains uh and so this this is why why you were talking about the difference between an l1 that's fast versus an l2 that's fast because if your l2 is unstable you can go back to the l1 uh but if your l1 is unstable you don't got anywhere to go it's uh interesting that uh paulina wrote an article about this um recently about um the transaction quality trilemma uh what is this uh this trilemma that we're seeing because i think we're observing it both in polygon and also solana and every other network that has very low gas fees yeah so uh crypto loves his trilemmas so polynya's transaction quality trilemma puts the trilemma between spam censorship resistance and low fees you can only have two uh because if you have low fees but you don't have censorship resistance well then people are just gonna spam your network in order to get rid of spam you can censor the spam transactions and keep your low fees but then you then you you know lost censorship resistance like now now you're a sensory trained et cetera uh and so paulie and i unpack some of the trade-offs here uh and some of the trade-offs aren't so bad they talk about how immutablex has used uh censorship to keep spam off of the chain while still keeping low fees and so they just they are they have a centralized block producer and they just you know filter out all the spam transactions in order to keep all of the real transactions good uh and i i think this is an okay trade-off right like i know we like censorship resistance but again it's more everything about these things are more important on the layer one and uh when immutable correctly censors the bad transactions however society deems bad to be bad and enable and continues to allow the good transactions however society enables considers good to be good well then that is in my mind a successful l2 because the l2 is serving the desires and the needs of the people while also preserving low fees and fees on immutable x are like they're free because they're so incredibly low that the block producers just they just eat the costs uh and and he also talks about how the ability to exit out of the layer two is also really really really important because if you think that immutable x is doing a bad job of censoring transactions and perhaps they're censoring your transactions but letting in other bad transactions well then you don't like that so you leave and the ability to exit out of a now to a permissionless exit out of l2 is a check on the centralization that enables the censoring of spam transactions really good article really good education we won't unpack it too much more here but there's a link in the show notes if you want to learn more and you know what i think all this means is that um it's such a false choice to to say that a layer one long term will have cheap transaction fees because it can't okay not while being a settlement layer right and if it does have very cheap transactions you know fees in the in the short run those will just get spammed out of existence what's interesting about spam is that spam actually uh um accrues a cost to the entire network because people have to nodes in the network have to maintain that state um you know forever after basically so there is this this cost impose that's distributed over all of the nodes for this spam too and that's not good so layer ones long term they have to have expensive relatively expensive block fees right it's like layer twos they can be much much cheaper when it comes to gas fees but layer ones i don't see a way out of long-term uh layer one settlement transaction fees going up um i think that's a reality that that too few are like accepting right now in this market 100 and also consider this right like say like solana avalanche polygon all of these low transaction fees high throughput chains uh if they if they continue to allow for spam well the spam just increases the fees to be until they're expensive exactly and so like it just raises the water mark because the because the spam is there uh and so like it ultimately converges upon the same reality at the end of the day there you go here's the take maybe to finish this off from dan elliser why don't you read it out dan elliser says perfect example of why monolithic l1s with low fees are not sustainable long term if you make global state and computation free people will do stupid until it breaks or the price increases enough to make them stop there is no tps high enough for this because like again if you only if you just increase the tps of your chain then you people are just going to use more of it exactly well said dan that about sums it up uh let's talk nft world so you got a story for us david what's the story this is again related to open c i feel like this is our open sea roll up episode david all right so this is a story of a guy that unfortunately act bought an nft that was previously stolen so an nft was stolen from some other guy's wallet uh and then that this dealer the hacker who managed to exploit i don't know with a seed phrase attack put the put the nft up for sale on open c and then some individual bought that stolen nft for 1.5 ether and then it was reported that that nft was stolen and then the nft was frozen by open c inside the new owner's wallet so the new owner had no idea that it was stolen just bought an nft doing normal nft buying stuff uh buy such new nft this elicit you know previously stolen nft and then open c freezes it because apparently it's open c's policy to freeze all stolen nfts no matter what uh okay so let me just pause and recap here so a guy buys okay so person steals an nft and he steals it and sells it yeah trying to sell it in open c some some person buys it right so this is like the um the dude selling open his trench coat and selling like fake rolexes right like stolen rolexes okay and sells the nft to this buyer and now the buyer has it and then what what happens to the buyer clarify that for me so the buyer's got this new nft this rolex doesn't know it's like it's hot it's been stolen right uh it gets frozen did you say yeah so openc froze the nft because it was stolen and apparently that is their policy that they freeze nfts that are stolen i think it's a legal restraint that they have they have to freeze these things if they are stolen just to become just to stay squeaky clean on compliance and legal and so it's a kind of and what do you mean frozen i thought these things were on ethereum right they cannot be frozen right if they're it's an erc721 right they so they are frozen on open sea not on ethereum because you can't you're totally right can't freeze anything on ethereum but the openc can choose to not accept any ethereum assets through their contracts uh and so uh and so yeah you know you can still take your nft out and sell it on any other platform but then the counter argument is like well all the liquidity is on open c so like if you don't let me sell on open c well like i can't access any of the liquidity so they basically like blacklist it and they just freeze it like on the openc platform and that's kind of enough to make it worthless or close to worthless right now because open season at the very least yeah okay yeah uh and this is even even though they know that the current owner of the current of the nft didn't do anything bad they still have to freeze it because it's stolen uh and so it's kind of just an unfortunate outcome where like the guy who had his nft stolen takes the l the guy that bought the nft takes the l uh open c takes the l because they don't want to do this anyways um like and and the the the scammer the victor the the hacker exporter takes the w by getting the 1.5 free ether by you know selling this this uh seems like a bad incentive set up because like rewarding thieves and thieves getting away with it and um you know basically the the second party uh the third-party buyers who purchase these things they're the ones taking the hit it seems like a bad precedent to set in general because what you might do is entice more more thieves and more stolen nfts but like what are the lessons learned here what are the takeaways from your perspective because because people think like oh web3 web 3 nfts i'll go to openc this web 3 platform and buy my nfts and then realize that like oh nft openc's not actually fully web3 it's also not fully web2 it's somewhere in the middle right because it's uh non-custodial you own your nfts you can upload and your nfts into openc uh and but also in order to sell your nfts it's permission like that you have to ask an openc for permission i mean they give you permission by default but then they can revoke it because they have that power so like openc kind of web 2.5 uh so openc is gonna find themselves i think in an interesting spot in 2022 we definitely need alternatives to openc there's no reason why we can have to have all of the nft markets all the nft volume consolidated onto just one exchange um and nfc's and openc's gonna face a lot of competition and i think in 2022 we have on the more centralized end of the spectrum a completely custodial nft uh coinbase nft marketplace coming online and then there's just the massive fight for a completely decentralized web 3 dow focused uh nft platform uh and so i think we're going to go like go the full gamut of you know the the full full full centralized full custodial to the fully decentralized fully non-custodial and and then have open c in the middle but people i i think are just learning the limitations of a semi centralized system like open sea and kind of being bummed about it bring it on let a thousand flowers bloom right we're seeing some of the cracks in centralization and i'm sure either open openc or some competitor will uh will try to bridge those cracks um what's going on with board board apes though they just crossed the one billion mark in total sales totally crushing it coming to the year pretty strong that's one headline here but there's also been some uh freezing of board apes as well uh again is this a case of stolen board apes similar to the story that you just told stolen board apes yeah so if you've been on on crypto twitter and especially on nft twitter you definitely have noticed the memes about how board ape owners tend to get their board apes stolen from them uh how does this happen okay so how does this happen by the way this is not like somebody you know physically meeting someone in person and like you know wrench attacking them and taking their their nfts right this is all happening in you know discord channels and these are called dms and people social ending yeah people are like hey like oh are you having trouble with your wallet like give me your submit your private key here and i can help you with it and then they do that and then they get their board apes stolen or like they totally they get to they get somebody to like hey they're just new to crypto they're new to crypto they don't know right like they think people are helping them and then they they don't like that and then they they were there these are these are very ironic kind of unfortunate tweets from very early board ape holders saying like hey i just had my board ape removed from my wallet how do i contact like the ethereum customer support to get it back like like like stuff like that they just don't know they just don't know and so like it's become a meme that like bored a like uh there there was a meme that i saw i was like name a better duo board ape yacht club holders and get like giving away their private keys towards that yeah it's happened like a number of times very sad yeah so what happened in this case yeah so 2.2 million dollars worth of board apes had to get frozen by open c okay based off of the same things that we're just talking about like you know scammers managed to get their hands on board apes openc's like okay well we're not going to let you sell your stolen apes on our platforms uh and yeah i mean unfortunately openc doesn't have the power unfortunately and also fortunately depending on how you look at it openc doesn't have the power to give those board apes back um but they can at least just restrict these uh sellers from selling them on their platform what what what's this this is uh maybe not a related headline yeah this is completely unrelated to openstack unrelated but it's still still important to board apes i think this headline is absolutely hilarious and i think we read it then yeah two nft copycats are fighting over which one is the real fake board ape yacht club what the real fake right yeah so so there are these funks out there which are just crypto pockets but mirror images of each other and now somebody has made like the the board ape yacht club version of those uh so mirror images of board apes except there's two of them and so like these these both of them are bored ape clones and they're like no we're the real clone like we're the real fake board apes which is just well don't think hilarious okay but so don't they ha when it's talking i haven't read anything past the headline of course right so but um aren't they fighting for this in the the public square aren't they fighting for social consensus of what the true fake board ape really is like or is this getting into like legal territory or something like this i think this is getting into out illegal territory yeah because because i i think board ace job club has like copyright rights over their board apes and so when someone like yoinks all of their jpegs and does a mirror image of them and then makes a new nft set like that that is a copyright infringement and so and and i don't think that like really the board apes team can really do anything there's not much power they have but the nft marketplaces have to answer to copyright uh and so like they have to tussle with this which is even more insane so okay what's going on here then uh there's a wearable variable yeah so like this is the fake board apes page on wearable and it's banned it says this user or item has been temporarily blocked from public access this is wearable doing it too yeah wearable is also a hybrid uh web 2.5 type company exactly web 2 and web 3. um and uh so so what's going on here with his djinn spartan tweet yeah djinn spartan if you guys don't know who djent spartan is he's just a kind of a dj a g-gen who's also a lone ranger kind of chad type crypto twitter character uh and he goes i minted five fake apes i sold three booked back my entire capital plus 100 profit and i kept two because i am my ape and my ape is me he's kind of just making making fun of board apes and i give it an 80 percent chance that wearable shuts down the uh fake apes yacht club i don't know what p h ayc stands for marketplace tomorrow 95 by the end of the week and yes indeed wearable did indeed shut down the fake fake board apes nft craziness uh eminem sporting a again unrelated but related eminem marshall mathers he's got a pretty sick 480 yeah that's awesome yeah that's the that's the slim shady cap right there that's the happy trading cap is that customer did they come with that no that's i'm that's it the normal normal ape wow that's cool that's a big move uh good for board apes getting celebrities in there um he also on that on that train again we don't know whether it's eminem or whether it's like one of the eminem people you know the people behind marshall mathers but eminem.eth was just purchased uh are we assuming by eminem this was purchased or do we do we know about this i don't think we know for sure but i mean it's at the same time that he got buys his board ape so it would make 56k yeah uh 15 eth for that for that purchase um dot eth names i feel like as the original nfts or one of the original nfts celebrities are starting to support those more and more right and you know i think that's um it's gonna be interesting for a lot of the people who've been sitting on nice.eth names uh when when that tidal wave hits uh let's talk about this samsung is introducing an nft platform with its new smart tvs so what is this you get to display nfts on your samsung tv does this only come with some tvs uh what are they doing here yeah so there are certain samsung products that are designed for art i actually have there's a samsung frame tv and these are the that's the tv that i got to display my uh nfcs that i got from uh nate mohler shout out uh and so yeah samsung's leaning into nfts what it actually means to actually have an nft like platform uh integrated into a tv i don't know uh but is it kind of like you know how smart tv like samsung has like smart tv type functionalities other tvs have this where they'll embed apps like netflix or something inside of it are they embedding like an open c and nft marketplace some sort of tbt display inside i don't i don't think we know but we do know that samsung is leaning into nfts and just crypto at large so more to more in the future related samsung is entering the metaverse entering its uh flagship store uh 837 store in decenterland so yeah big consumer electronics companies coming to the metaverse too coming to crypto by way of nfts not d5 yeah it says the virtual samsung 837 store will be open and decentralized in decentralian for a limited time time what do you think you can do there like do you go there to buy a tv because like what how does that work i don't know i don't know it feels like they're just experimenting with it but what's interesting to hear is you remember there was a lot of talk about uh samsung back a couple of years ago maybe creating a crypto wallet to roll out on all of the samsung phones not much really happened with that right like do you like i didn't hear much about that but yeah they're coming back with nfts right so it's it's kind of again the um the conversation we've been having so much recently about nfts creating additional surface area to onboard people into crypto and that includes companies into crypto as well it's kind of uh you know doing what defy could not uh let's talk a little bit about bitcoin though david some news from congress that they are preparing an oversight hearing committee on bitcoin mining's environmental impact i feel like david uh bitcoin is taking a full frontal assault from a proof-of-work perspective right basically every other layer one crypto network is migrating or has started with with proof of stake and it's going to be basically bitcoin versus the world in terms of justifying why uh proof-of-work mining is actually worth it and i mean you and i might agree and might say yes it's worth it right um but like bitcoiners don't have to convince us they have to convince congress and the rest of society that the money spent on what society sees as environmental waste is is well spent funds and this looks like it's it's kind of a committee in congress that will shed some more light on this and probably amplify the topic what are your thoughts here yeah this is going to be a big litmus test for so many different things uh first off the big the bitcoiner narrative is that bitcoin is good for the environment because it creates more energy and specifically leans in towards green energy so the more energy the big that proof of work consumes for bitcoin the faster we can have a green society a lot of people do not buy that argument i kind of am compelled by it but also at the same time i think there's a very strong counter argument to say that like well it's even more green just to consume less energy than to consume more of it uh but that's that's a different story this the what i'm interested in hearing about the fallout of this is does so congress is you know supposed to do their research so when they do do their research and they sift through the fud of just you know sometimes just blatantly misinformation about the negative externalities of bitcoin mining they're do they do exist but sometimes they're just way overblown what is congress's opinion about bitcoin mining after they actually do homework like what is on the other side of that do they actually find that bitcoin does incentivize green energy production uh to to what degree do they find that that's true um do you think they're actually going to do their homework though david or do you think they're just going to get to another committee for like right score some political points which totally the entire purpose of this committee is right it's just it's popular to hate on bitcoin and so i could totally see an outcome as like oh we did our homework bitcoin energy mining bad it's bad uh that's our that's our reports it's bad uh and then and then we should do something about it and we should do something about it yeah and then congress everyone in congress like oh yeah totally it's bad we should do something about it i can totally see that happening well one thing i'm glad about right now is and this wasn't the case going into 2021 but it is the case going into 2022 which is um i think mainstream and even in congress the world of crypto is now larger than bitcoin there was a time where crypto and bitcoin was kind of synonymous for a lot of people like bitcoin kind of eclipsed the rest of crypto that's no longer the case like i think even going into 2022 we used to say bitcoin is the gateway drug teaching people digital scarcity is the gateway drug to crypto i don't know if that's true anymore yeah i think like nfts are becoming the gateway drug right so and again that's just teaching people digital scarcity as well digital scarcity of a jpeg which is interesting that leads them down possibly a path to start to understand some of the other crypto money type topics but that is a sea change and i'm glad that's the case or else the rest of crypto would also be lumped into this argument not that i'm not sympathetic about um you know the counter arguments that the the crypto the bitcoin community would have to support proof of work i am i just am glad that's a fight that not all of crypto has to fight yep yep having options is important let's talk about this you uh alluded to it earlier in the in the show uh kazakhstan internet shutdown okay so there was like a i believe the i haven't followed this very closely but the government in kazakhstan has um just walked basically walked away there's lots of protests um you know concern about the prices gas prices the prices of everything it's kind of a you know a revolt a minor revolution i guess i would say the protests in the street and the government completely walked away and this has caused downstream effects with there's apparently a bunch of bitcoin mining in kazakhstan right now uh they shut down the internet so the internet's been shut down and now hash rate bitcoin hash rate has fallen what's uh what's the story here 18 bitcoin hash rate fallen so like it's a lot that's a lot i didn't know i didn't know kazakhstan had so much bitcoin uh mining capacity inside of it and you know it kind of just makes sense kazakhstan's like right next to china uh and so when a lot of uh when china pushed out its bitcoin miners it went all over the world but like a lot of them just went to kazakhstan this one right next door uh and so okay this is well now now they're probably going to be moving out of kazakhstan if this continues um and this actually just might be kind of like another microcosm of china it's just like well we're just pushing out uh bitcoin mining hash power further and further probably west probably into europe probably into america where bitcoin mining is just more dependable more stable uh in the inside of less volatile foundations uh and so it might be a long-term good just for the narrative of getting more and more hash power domiciled in countries that regulators with power like uh and yeah and and this is also kind of some sort of speculation going on with this uh decreasing bitcoin price because you know guess who has a lot of uh bitcoins miners do they they are the kind of the source of bitcoins uh and so if they have elected the la the big big drop in may when ether went from 4 300 down to 1800 and i don't know what the bitcoin price does because that didn't because i didn't pay attention to it as much that was on the heels of china pushing out bitcoin miners uh and so we just saw another big uh oof candle big oof candle i'm gonna just keep on saying that until it becomes in the dictionary or something big oof candle followed by the news of a bunch of hashing power that got it got um axed uh and so uh miners they are very uh conservative with their risks miners are generally pretty risk-averse and so maybe they sold a bunch of bitcoin to fund an actual migration of hash power or just cover their costs or whatever uh i think that's a pretty reasonable thing to speculate on it could be that could be what's going on for sure it's definitely interesting news also as we look west let's talk about some of the the regulation coming in the u.s market so the cftc just fined poly market 1.4 million dollars and asked it to wind down some of its prediction markets the story is after a cftc investigation found that poly market was offering illicit option contracts in the u.s it's very interesting story here because the question is is this the beginning of other cftc types of enforcement actions in u.s markets um what happened here and what's what's kind of your takeaway yeah my big takeaway is that this is the perils of a web 2.5 company a company that didn't make it all the way towards fully decentralized this is what they have to deal with i think polymark has definitely been able to have a ton of success based off of the trade-offs that they've made on the centralization to decentralization spectrum but like when you have any amount of centralization like you get the ire of nation state regulators this 1.4 million fine extremely reasonable this this whole thing in my mind is is reasonable this is the cftc doing normal cftc stuff this isn't the sec being just hard-handed and kind of just overall a dick to our industry uh and i i but and i think poly market more or less perhaps saw this coming they already had um pretty decent limitations on their markets um and now i think what's as a result of this is that they are just going to um uh probably do something like dydx which is uh not allow us ip addresses um not allow us people to participate in poly market and just kind of move offshore and uh be serving customers that aren't inside the united states so you know who loses us people in the u.s people p u.s users we don't get to use poly market because of the cftc because of nation state regulators so is what it is yeah it's kind of painful i i think it also so like i i do agree with you this is not necessarily the cftc being heavy-handed in terms of their their touch uh it doesn't appear like that is the case to me as the sec has been in the past but it's also like there's a problem with our regulations in the us from a commodities perspective and brian quintenz who is a former cftc uh commissioner actually came in the podcast and said this like if you ultimately want change that has to happen in congress like the legislative body has to change from the rules about what consumers retail consumers can have access to in the u.s i mean at some level the cftc is unfortunately kind of trying to enforce the rules on the books but the question is what happens if the rules in the books don't make sense anymore right what if they're wrong what if they're old what if they no longer apply and i think that's definitely the case uh for for poly market um these are like prediction markets right so what are the chances that that um you know democrats lose the next election cycle that biden gets reelected all of these sorts of things things that like consumers should have access to uh and it's a shame what harm can that really do i mean like we're trading nfts in the same way like i mean we're trading all of these different things uh it's just that the letter of the law says a certain thing and this causes a stifling of the market in the u.s and what's going to happen for polymark it's going to be just fine i think they'll continue operating they might have to geofence as you said they'll probably move some of their operations outside of the u.s and move it internationally and who loses to your point david the u.s loses right so it's a shame that this is happening but if we want change that's why in the u.s we have to be involved in our political system as well or we'll see more of this in the future uh david speaking of things that we've we're seeing more of tether just froze one million dollars worth of usct i think that's just a psa like a reminder that tether can freeze usdt that's the full story we don't know why or who it is but there's a million dollars in an ethereum address i think it's on ethereum uh that got frozen uh and so that to what happens don't do illegal things with tether don't do illegal things don't do illegal things uh but if you want to get away with illegal things don't use tether well but like yeah and then and then like tether is not a censorship resistant staple coin right uh that that's also the takeaway some people treat it as if it is uh neither is china china's digital one uh and that wallet goes live on the app store it's going live in in app stores in china in pilot mode now and what's interesting to me is like all of this development has gone on with the digital one and the us has like basically done nothing they have this entire time they have no yeah we we've watched it from the last like you know three or four years being like oh china's doing this it's coming they're investing in blockchain they're like and the fed's like yeah we'll believe it when i when we see it we don't have to do anything we'll have a meeting to discuss we'll have a meeting to discuss the implications we'll create a you know a paper and we'll have a congressional hearing maybe in the future right and then china is just like building it right and now they're now they're in pilot mode it's like the difference between peer review and actually doing it on in live production totally yeah like or like the difference between a startup and a large corporation who just talks about doing things right and the startup's just hustling and building it out right and um i do think that the us is going to get caught very flat-footed on this china digital wallet thing and digital blockchain thing and uh another thing that's going to cost the us uh anyway that's that's the take here we've done a lot on china by the way we did that episode on um with richard turin called cashless if you want to hear about the china digital currency story go tune in to that episode as well guys we will be back with the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

bankless and click the wallet icon to get started all right guys we're back with the takes of the week here's uh jay with a really interesting take on protocol mafias what's the uh prediction here david yeah jay of uh jfrary capital which uh we just did a show uh state of the nation with rory capital and tribe trey slash tribe joey and jay about the merger between faye and ryan capital there's a lot of synergies these teams have been working together and so they have decided to merge uh so the two tokens the the uh rgt token ferrari and the tribe token for faye are merging into the same token which is going to be tribe uh and so jay continues this thought and extrapolates it to the rest of d5 and talks about one of his predictions for 2022 is that protocol mafias are coming to life ma and he thinks that there are already some like different defy apps that kind of have banded together so you have the uh magic internet money spell ice is one mafia one group of people uh we also have the eff the frac stable coin olympus and sushi tribe uh excuse me mafia and then now we have the tribe which is also uh already a part of uh rari so three tribes uh three mafias if you will and i think there's just there's a lot of like redundant overlapping apps in d5 and so jay's just predicting that these are going to consolidate and merge into the same organization you know we can be more powerful together there's a bunch of competition out there d5 is kind of ruthless these days uh and so jay is just basically just predicting that this ruthlessness naturally collapses into mergers and we have seen this before this is what happens in normal businesses businesses merge when it makes sense uh and dallas should be considered the same and so this is a big prediction that i'm kind of on board with if you want to hear more about this we talked about this concept in our state of the nation that show came out on tuesday or wednesday depending on uh youtube or the podcast so you can check that out as well that's a really good prediction i you know i i think he's right on with that we'll have to see what happens in 2022 it might be the year of mergers d5 mergers all right here's a take from bellagi uh lawyer fees are the equivalent of gas costs for traditional finance every contract update requires transaction fees from jd's lawyer fees being like gas costs what do you think of this yeah and there was another tweet as well that talked about layer two is where layer twos are like the paralegals so like you know layer twos prep everything and then they bundle it all up and they settle that transactions down to the l1 which are the actual lawyers that actually execute the transactions and this has always been in my mind the correct framing for what a blockchain is a blockchain is just a system of courts a courts and appeals but instead of subjective judges we have the evm and so the if you have a contract that your lawyer drafted up and you want to change it you got to pay the gas costs to make the the transaction the the contract update uh and so uh and this is this is why like i know i know fees on ethereum are high but in stark contrast the 500 like transaction fee on ethereum is orders of magnitude and the 500 bajillion dollars that you would have paid a lawyer to do the same and and then if that ends up going to court you're paying 10 times even more than that right uh and so yes gas costs on ethereum are high um cash costs on other chains are low uh but the the point is that we are disintermediating an entire industry of extremely expensive lawyers and litigation and court we have to remember what we are actually improving upon and it's not it's not it's about the court system the court of appeals which is extremely slow extremely laborious and way slower than ethereum by the way i i so i i i totally vibe with the sake i i have maybe like um a subtle change i feel like um coders are the actual lawyers yes in this case yeah right so like you still have to pay coders to create the contracts the smart contracts uh and the the transaction fees are actually like taxes right so like that whole uh court apparatus that you're talking about and that is maintained by federal and state taxes for example in the u.s right and like that is the court system uh so yeah i i i totally agree with the takes of like um we're automating a ton of that away and it's becoming much more efficient in fact what are the costs to maintain the us legal system from like circuit courts all the way to like the supreme court's on up right well it's like military budget right the entire government infrastructure bureaucracy is required to maintain that system and we're not only automating the lawyers out of the mix we're also automating the entire like government system out of the mix and how much more efficient is that so i'd even take it a step further than blaji's tweet but yeah he's right on that's essentially what we're doing smart contracts are um the new the new legal system it's you know code is law in a way um let's go to the next take here david so this is um a take from suzu maybe i'll read this originally and then you can read the reply which is that which is the meat of it so suzu says i'm bullish on nearly all quality l1s but if you think that selena of x that's seluna uh solana luna and uh avalanche together are boomer coins if you think they're boomer coins you literally have the memory of the goldfish and here's this reply which is the real take here we want to get into that's all the current market is goldfish running from one side of the tank to the others crypto influencers furiously tapping the tank to attract them to the other side with their bags to dump well that's a bleak outlook on the market as it stands today do you think that's right yeah i saw this reply get passed around in numerous different circles where everyone's like oh yeah this is a really good analogy so like all that all the influencers are like hey pay attention to my bags hey pay attention to my back tap tap tap pay attention to my backs and we saw this in in kobe's fantastic uh sub stack uh about how like uh crypto is a fight for attention uh if you can't get attention on your bags your bags will not pump uh and so like and i'm just gonna self show us here this is why some influencers that have not changed their tune for forever are perhaps worth listening to when they are only saying the same things year in year out about the same principles maybe those guys are people that you know you they're saying they're not tapping different spots in the tank they're saying hey this is worth listening to and it was worth listening to last year and it'll still be worth listening to next year so i'm just gonna just throw that out there i just think look man i think fundamentals um last if fundamentals are stronger than the market's short-term attention cycles as well like that's why we talk about them so much on bank list is because like if you're narrative investing you care a lot about what kobe was saying in his sub stack about you know the tension and whether the attentions on this narrative or whether this narrative but if you don't care about narratives if you're not narrative chasing if you're investing in fundamentals then all that kind of becomes noise and you can make longer term plays and back to what we said at the very beginning right it's like 95 of you shouldn't be trading anyway 95 of you shouldn't be following the influencers like a goldfish uh because you're going to get wrecked on the other side of that um the game so that's why you emphasize fundamentals the game is to find the spot on the goldfish tank that you think all the taps will converge to over the very very long term yeah and just wait there until the all the taps start to show up and hopefully you place your bets accordingly exactly exactly uh all right let's go on uh this is a related take actually from anthony cesano either diet you either die a degen or live long enough to see yourself become a crypto boomer it's the take i think you wrote a uh a blog post about this and i the the take in the blog post post is basically like everyone starts as a dj right when you get into crypto you're kind of just here to make money right i don't know if that's that's true for everyone but like generally a lot of people in crypto for number go up and then when the number does go up you kind of lose touch with everything else and you no longer care about the like early you know djn style games but in these dgen games that's where a lot of the innovation is actually happening so you kind of grow out of touch and become like a crypto boomer according to anthony um yeah what's your what's your thought on this take yeah there's just always generations about crypto and when people are coming in they're looking for they're coming in with their uh limited amounts of capital wherever they came from and they are trying to get that 10x that's what that's what people know the crypto world to offer 10x is 100 x's and like you're not going to find a 10x 100x uh in in the high caps like you're not going to get your 100x with bitcoin or ethereum anytime soon it's going to take a real long time to get 100x on ether it'll happen but it'll happen over decades uh and so if you want that 100x you got to go down the d gen rabbit hole and start doing your doing your investigations doing a super insane amount of research like following all the discourse doing all that stuff and that that's what like that you are living on the periphery you are living on the edges uh and once you actually survive that part of your cryptocycle then you kind of graduate into something a little bit more stable you kind of have developed what you are familiar with you've gotten your feet under you uh and and then the crypto world moves on and starts to innovate and in different directions than what you're used to and either you can choose to follow that in for an innovation and which is what sazel is saying you either die a degen as in you stay a dgen forever and you're just following the narrative trades over and over and over again or you just like kind of call it quits and settle and it's like well you know i'm actually familiar with this part of crypto and i'm gonna stay right here uh and so that's what anthony's calling a crypto boomer uh and so the this juxtaposition i think is pretty compelling yeah i do do you think that's totally right though like do you think you either have to be a d-gen or you you you become a crypto boomer and those are the only two choices like i feel like there's a there's another choice here which is like um i don't know it's kind of the like buy what you use sort of warren buffett like evaluate this based on its fundamentals wait for narratives to prove themselves with some raw fundamentals and then invest in them like but be open to new narratives i feel like a total crypto boomer would just be like yup i bought my thing and like this is how it is and i'm never going to change my thesis or my opinion it's always this one particular way but like i think there's some space in between being a full d-gen and being a crypto boomer what are your thoughts on that i think it's funny that you referenced uh warren buffett in your explanation as what's not a crypto boomers like oh yeah warren buffett long-term behavior no like it's it does it's the juxtaposition between the d gens and in the non-degens like if you're not a dj you're there for a crypto boomer um although like i do accept your nuance yeah yeah i do think there's some nuance there but i i totally understand the point he's making so here's a take out of reddit and this take is really just the headline and this is coming off the heels of all of the gamers rejecting nfts in their games and the take here is that nfts won't ruin computer games greedy game companies will ruin computer games using nfts i think that's a really good take technology is just neutral it's really about the incentives of the game developers that can choose to actually have helpful or harmful nfts in the games and so that's kind of what i would ask uh the gamers that don't like nfts to consider is that well maybe it's actually the studio that you don't like not nfts yeah i think that's totally the case nfts are neutral technology uh why don't you take this take yeah this cup from altcoin psycho twitter account he says so many poorly designed unlocks are all happening this year in 2022 a lot of popular alts will likely get hammered unlocks is referring to angel investors seed investors getting their tokens and then their vesting periods ending so that they can finally sell their tokens he continues 2022 will be will be the year that humbles everyone who said fully diluted value or tokenomics are a meme ta technical analysis won't save you from a shitty emission curve crushing your project so basically he's saying that like yo beware of the tokenomics like or excuse me beware of the vesting schedules because when when vcs have their tokens unlocked they need to cash in and lock in some profits and they got in on those tokens cheaper than you did so you got to be aware all right david so what are you excited about this week then uh tomorrow we record with uh kobe with crypto cobain uh and so that i i think that's gonna be pretty interesting um there's been some twitter spats friendly friendly-ish twitter spots between us and kobe beforehand uh before this uh but he was amicable enough to come on the show and so we were recording with him tomorrow and that episode comes out on monday i've already shared the agenda with him and he was like oh it's pretty good and there are some hot questions in there uh so it's gonna be a fun show you know i actually think there's a lot of shared values between bank lists and kobe but um yeah kobe definitely takes more of the i'm a narrative investor i'm a trader side of the spectrum where we we take the more fundamentals long-term approach so um i don't i don't think we disagree on as much we just are different our dispositions are style slightly different yeah our styles are very very different and maybe that's where where and why we butt heads but overall yeah part of the conversation yeah i do have a lot of respect for them too so that'll be fun ryan what are you excited about uh dude i'm i'm just excited to have my electricity back and my internet back uh it was it was a mess like you mean if you yourself be back online yeah totally yes yes that's what i mean but like also just like i i realize this is a first world problem right it's like um being without the internet for 48 hours okay well you'll survive ryan like and that's totally true but like it also always makes me think uh man what would it be like if society like totally broke down right and we lost electricity lost internet like how long could i last right and that in that sort of a situation the truth is like not very damn long like uh and you know i i i thought about other things too is like from a crypto perspective um you know crypto really doesn't work when the electricity's off of course but the interesting thing about that is um neither neither do gold etfs right that's your bank account like just like nothing works i know that's been an early critique over things like cryptos like well what happens if the internet powers down or electricity turns off you don't have crypto well the truth is you really don't have anything right when those two things happen and in fact if the internet turns off like parts of the internet can turn off and completely  the banking system and if three parts of the internet turns off bitcoin and ethereum still are online exactly next time there's some internet connectivity established you can kind of do so i sort of asked myself like what would i do if this was sort of a you know persistent scenario this was a real disaster and this spanned like weeks or months or something like this what would i want to hold and it's not going to be gold etfs right because what use are those it's like family it's friends and it's food yeah that's what you're doing and it's a real crisis a nice house yeah shelter right and a nice house ideally um so i i guess it just impressed upon me that society is built on you know crypto is built on many different technologies but like all of society's also built on top of these technologies and i think crypto is much more resilient than it first appears it's at least resilient as just about everything else in society right um well it's supposed to be the most resilient thing on the internet after like smt smtip or whatever yeah yeah after after like the tcp core internet protocols you know there's crypto and that will persist so uh anyway it's uh i'm fine internet's back up i'm connected electricity's here uh but i'm back online yeah ai back online but it's good good to go through that experience i think once in a while right it's like uh makes you think about things like this mm-hmm absolutely uh are you ready for me in the week man of the week yeah absolutely this was uh this is my meme this week which i'm very very stoked that i had this is for first though this is a meme that we talked about in the last show and this was a jack dorsey anti-web 3 meme maybe we should talk about that one first yeah so i wrote in market monday this week uh what jack doesn't get about web 3 which i i some tried to summarize all the arguments that i could about why jack is just basically completely backwards about web three incentives jack jack dorsey yes the founder co-founder of twitter and also uh ceo of square yeah jack thinks that web3 is just this silicon valley vc marketing term because it's really really hot and they can make a lot of money off of it and so all these web 3 companies are just pouring capital into silicon valley vcs because all these vcs are giving them all their money leaving very very little for retail so web 3 is a vc led endeavor is what jack's critique of and in my opinion it's the exact opposite and i know it's not perfect but like hey let's think about web 2 and here's where the meme comes in so it's the same meme that i need to explain to me the first meme for the listeners uh so the meme is that there's this water pipe and it's being coming out of ethereum and the water pipe is labeled web 3 and this water pipe is just flowing water into the mouths of very fat and happy silicon valley pcs while this extremely famous retail individual is just opening his mouth for these mere droplets that are just accidentally leaking out of the pipe and so that's that's jack's claim on on web3 is retail is just left in the sidelines uh and so again i think this is completely backwards from reality so i made this alternative version of the meme where instead of small little droplets being dropped off and going into the mouths of retail it's actually just hearts and likes coming out of the web and so the web 2 pipe is flowing money into silicon valley vcs as jack says it was for web 3 but instead of retail getting droplets in web 2 world you just get hearts and likes like here's here's what you get out of the web too you get a like i get to like your thing dopamine hits yeah so no money and jack completely ignores and i write about this in the article jack completely ignores how air drops are a fundamental component of web3 and people have gotten over a million dollars worth of airdrops from web3 endeavors and how also i make the claim that like jack says that like vcs you web3 will never be able to escape vc incentives i make the claim that web3 platforms that put more and more capital into the hands of retail do better think about ans and how beloved ens is all zero vcs all retail and so i think that jack just has this completely backwards and so this is the new meme that i think is far more accurate of reality yeah it's a good take look so you know silicon valley vcs got very fat and happy off of web 2. but i think the the true genius of this meme is like what did retail get out of the whole web 2 movement right uh like likes and hearts and their attention kind of stolen right and like dopamine addictions that's kind of what where we are in the cycle certainly didn't get any equity didn't get any token drops so that's the meme of the week that is the meme of the week all right guys this has been the
