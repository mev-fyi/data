[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david awesome conversation today what were some of your highlights and who did we talk to yeah we talked to ariana simpson of a16z crypto who has had a particular focus and emphasis lately on the crypto gaming side of things which is what we talked about today and i think crypto gaming has an extreme amount of product market fit with i think the current crypto community if for some reason diablo 2 is like a shared cultural pastime of almost all of us in the crypto world and i think we're all very very stoked to see what comes out of a crypto gaming world because i think we all believe that the games that come out of an asset powered game is going to be fundamentally different and i think much more rich and much more fun to play when there's uh you know economic assets that are part of the game itself and so that is the topic of today's show absolutely um crypto gaming is going to be massive uh if you think about this just in regular gaming 60 of all americans play some form of a game video game streaming reaches 1.2 billion viewers every year fortnite generates 5.1 billion in revenue the whole industry is expected to surpass 300 billion but you know what just happened this year is axi infinity jumped on uh the radar now it has like 1.5 million players it's reached a fully diluted market cap of 18 billion dollars right so like crypto gaming is here i think uh some some of these early games have sort of proved this and what we really wanted to go through with uh ariana is like why like why is this suddenly happening now in crypto and how does an investor see this what's the lens so we talk a lot about owning games or owning items in a game in these asset powered games and how important that is we talked about the transition to this play to earn movement that we're seeing we talked about employment via gaming and how that's going to shape culture and finally we talked about how this all ties into the metaverse and ultimately ethereum and ethi asset and she had some really great takes all along the way so if you are trying to figure out what the next big thing is in crypto gaming this is an episode you're going to want to pay full attention to before we get to the conversation with ariana we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrom comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrome arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarium so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest ariana simpson is a general partner at a16z and jason horowitz where she invests in crypto particularly and this is going to be important this episode on the gaming side of things all about crypto gaming prior to in joining andreessen ariana founded autonomous partners which was an investment fund that focused on cryptocurrencies and digital assets and she was recently just named to fortune's 40 under 40 ariana congrats on that and welcome to bankless it's great to have you thank you so much super excited to be here all right guys this is our crypto gaming episode and i know your focus your specialty is all about um gaming more recently in crypto that you've had extensive experience in in the other sectors within crypto and i want to set some context for bank list listeners in in terms of why we're talking about this um i think it's really because crypto gaming became a major force this year right axi 18 billion in fully diluted valuation 18 billion with a b three billion annualized revenue at one point in time people are living off of video games people are living off of axi um at its peak the game that was axi was generating over 15 million in revenue per day 1.5 million daily active users so uh axi has just like blasted the door off of this thing now everyone sees what's possible we've got guilds and dowels like ygg creating entire economies for employees we have loot which is absolutely blasting off now we have the advent of layer two guys it feels like time to do a bankless podcast on crypto gaming so i want to start ariana with this question to t us up why are you so excited about crypto gaming and also why now yeah absolutely i think um you know if you look at the history of crypto we've really spent the last few years building the core infrastructure that was necessary in order to start um enabling some of the more consumer facing and application layer experiences including games and in order to support those games first we had to build some core infrastructure whether that was layer one blockchains or scalability solutions or a number of other things and so while that's certainly all still in progress and we're never really going to be done building things like that we've now reached a level of kind of functionality where we can build things on top and so i think the fact that um you know that's the point that we're at now is what's enabling a lot of these gaming and entertainment experiences obviously first and foremost axi but the whole ecosystem around it too to really start to flourish um and if you think about you know why this matters i think the critical piece is crypto has always had a very high barrier to entry it can be a little bit daunting you have to be fairly technical um and gaming i think occupies a really unique space in the sense that it's allowing people who might otherwise say i don't know how i would get into this you know what's a transaction what's the hash what's either scan you know all these things to start playing around with it in a way that's a lot more approachable and fun frankly and so what we're seeing is that it's really opening the floodgates for a whole universe of new crypto users um and that to me is incredibly powerful because at the end of the day if crypto is to realize the vision that we've all kind of hoped for and been working towards over the last few years it really needs to have mainstream appeal and so games i think have opened that door and are bringing in users who were not sort of they're net new users to crypto i guess and so once people come in start playing games see you know the fun the potential economic upside um you know the communities like there's just so many positive things that can be found in these experiences as people play around with it um you know then they start to percolate out into other parts of the crypto ecosystem and to me that's you know that's the most exciting thing because as a builder in the crypto space what you really want is people to use your products and services that you're spending all this time building um and so you know games are a really powerful engine for increasing the number of those users ariana when you said that we've kind of already figured out this core infrastructure and we can now open up to more commercial applications that actually like starts to get my hair to stand up because it's been so long in crypto where we've been at this like infrastructure level and opening up the world towards the commercial layer uh is like something we've always been like saying like hopefully this time will actually come where like crypto people will just become normal people so with this with this like new era in crypto where we are now in like getting into like the broad commercial applications especially with gaming how big of an unlock have we just uh met like with the unlock of crypto gaming like how big is this i guess i guess it's a question of total addressable market but with the current size of crypto as at least with population versus what could be unlocked with gaming what's like the the comparative magnitude of these two different things i mean i think that tam is nearly all people on the planet which i know sounds crazy but is actually very realistic in the sense that we're increasingly all online all the time across the world internet penetration obviously is continuing to rise like the the the universe of people whose lives will be touched by crypto in some way shape or form um i think is pretty much all people on the planet obviously that's not you know yet today but it's happening over time um and i think when you start to think about um you know enabling that obviously some of the issues we've seen on the infrastructure side are kind of a key gating factor the demand for throughput on blockchains has been rising at an incredibly fast clip and i think if you look at um you know how full our blocks on ethereum as a proxy for that obviously uh you know we have a real issue there gas prices have been out of control et cetera and i think one very clear data point about the fact that demand is really actually very hard to forecast until you lower those transaction fees is what happened with axi as you mentioned and moving over to the ronin side chain so um you know axi had been doing fine decent growth whatever um they they switched over to ronan and the graph goes vertical and i think um you know that's a really interesting phenomenon because you can't you don't necessarily have a good measure for the demand that exists but isn't being captured until you lower those barriers to entry bring down transaction costs and just enable um enable people to play a game or transact in a way that's costless or close to it um and so you know i think what we're seeing is that there's so much interest in you know interacting with crypto um in a variety of ways and so as the barriers to entry from an infrastructure perspective continue to fall um we just expect that the number of experiences that people are are able to have in crypto is going to continue to to grow at a super super fast pace i think this is a really like important point right and so like i remember the the the axi circumstance that you're you're talking about very well like in 2019 and 2020 uh we were writing about axi on on bank list but it was like this niche game super like esoteric it was not mainstream at all it was very sort of you know crypto uh gaming in the in this very small niche and um when they did launch the ronin sidechain as you said like that's when they were able to scale up to one million plus users and more now they have the largest discord server larger even than fortnight and that kind of surprised me but like i think people missed the point um they look it's kind of like cell phone adoption you know like 1980s you had these brick cell phones only a few people had them they'd have them in their car they'd be traveling it's like nice exactly it's like like no one's going to have like cell phones uh was the thought at the time if they look like that but when you when you like bring down the costs and when you make them more compact and you you create a you know mainstream access for these things now they're everywhere everyone has a phone i mean internet bandwidth is the same way so it does really seem like layer 2 and side chains and cheaper block space is a massive unlock for crypto gaming and it feels like um i i gotta say even being in crypto i don't know about you ariana but like the axi thing took caught me by surprise you know i was just like i was expecting slow incremental growth of the type we've seen over the last couple years then as you said when they released you know their side chain i don't know earlier this year's like february march just absolutely insane level of adoption that caught me by surprise did he were you surprised at all i think he caught everybody by surprise really yeah uh including the team um you know uh you you can never it's one of those things where you know 10-year overnight success kind of situation where um you know i have a lot of respect for the team at axey the team at ygg some of these teams that have been really grinding for years and years um building their vision of you know a crypto game ecosystem and the metaverse um and for a long time it was very unpopular um you know nobody crypto was down um it wasn't obvious that any of these things were really gonna take off but um you know kudos to the folks in that ecosystem who i think really helped each other get through the crypto winters and um continued to build their vision despite the fact that for a long time there wasn't really much in the way of external validation by the way i think that's that's like a key story throughout the history of crypto it's like you know we were myself included honestly everyone thought i was a lunatic to move into the space in 2013 when i did but um you know i think there's what inspires me about the space is really the fact that people have had such interesting and creative visions for how the tech can be applied and just continued to work and build against those ideas even when it wasn't obvious or there wasn't really at least in the short term any kind of obvious financial upside in doing so um and so i'm always delighted when you know when folks end up doing very well financially because i i feel they've been slogging you know for many years to to build and i think that's at the end of the day kind of what what this is all about before we dive into the more intricate integra uh details about asset powered gaming is there any other conversations around like the infrastructure improvements that have allowed this crypto gaming world to to involve evolved not just like scalability is there anything else that uh is like really important infrastructure to allow this sector of the crypto world to blossom well you know i think um i think there have been a few different approaches to tackling some of these problems obviously i think what um the dapper flow team has done in building a blockchain that was really designed and optimized around gaming and entertainment use cases has been really powerful and i've been very excited to see kind of what's happening in that ecosystem as well obviously polygon has also really taken off and is enabling a number of games that run runs on that a number of others so um you know i think there's this problem is being tackled both um as a layer one issue as a layer two issue and in a few different ways um i do think a massive part of the story is about scalability so you know you said beyond scalability but i kind of always end up circling back to that because i think games are are interesting in the sense that um although some of the in-game assets are now becoming very valuable so security remains kind of a an important consideration um you know speed is paramount and cost being low is also paramount because you can't have to spend fifty dollars every time you do something in the game that's outrageous you know and i think um a lot of the people who accumulated east uh or other crypto assets early um you know have quite a lot and so they're more willing to pay what would be an absolutely outrageous amount of money to to do something in that context than you would be in normal life like for example when i minted my ygg guild badge i think i ended up paying nearly a hundred dollars and if you think about that that's like kind of outrageous um and you know i i would certainly not be willing to spend that much as a transaction cost for most things but um you know you're like oh it's for the development of the ecosystem and so you just kind of go along with it but um you know if we really want to make this a mainstream thing obviously that's not sustainable and so i think i think we're definitely moving in the right direction with all of this it's just a matter of um it takes a little bit of time these are really hard problems that are being solved for the first time and so it's obvious that it's it's not going to be solved overnight well so now we have one of our first like success cases of crypto you know in axi and that that growth is undeniable and i think it's kind of like it's it's hard for people to say as uh they said many times during the bear market like crypto gaming is not a thing it'll never take off there's no like um business model behind this none of it makes sense right so now i think we want to shift the conversation to like why crypto gaming the super powers of crypto gaming so i think many um bankless listeners have played their fair share of video games like david myself included and one of the things i think all of us will know about the video game is um you can't own your own items in the game you don't have sovereignty so the centralized game maker essentially has license and access and uh they own all of the actual items in the games you can't lend them you can't borrow against them you can't um like rent them out you can't really do anything you can't sell or trade them very much unless it's exclusive to this like permissioned in-game economy so let's talk about that as kind of a killer app for crypto gaming number one and maybe it's the most important one i don't know what you'd say about that but the ability to have asset powered games where players own their items what what do you think it means to be an asset powered games and a game in and for players to own their item their own items ariana how important is that oh i think that's critical and i think it's it applies to games but it also applies to crypto as a whole if we zoom out a little bit in the sense that the whole idea of what we're trying to do here in the space in my mind is to reclaim power wealth etc from some of the platforms that have historically um been rather extractive and distribute it back to the community the people who are actually participating in these ecosystems and i think the incredibly powerful thing about what's happening with this in crypto is this is the first time that we have a way to make the economics of it work historically there was not an obvious way to incentivize people and so you were kind of missing this critical component of how this might actually be operationalized so the interesting thing in my mind is in games um you know generally speaking as you said the the financial upside went not at all to the user so you would spend you know hours and hours and hours of your life building up um you know your your in-game persona or acquiring assets or you know doing all kinds of things and you would really have nothing to show for it other than the fact that you had a great time um so what's happening here is you have the ability to also have a great time but actually have some uh participate in the upside of the community and so i think that's super powerful because all of a sudden you know playing games doesn't just fun but it also becomes work and i think that's a really interesting construct where if you look at for example what ygg is enabling in the context of axi and also other games you know people are now beginning to work in the metaverse and so the fun is there but there's also a kind of uh broader financial and and work driven narrative and i think that's that's you know only enabled because crypto has become part of the experience this wouldn't have been possible before um and if you look at some of the games that are becoming popular now the fascinating part is they're not trying to keep their players captive you can cash out and that has historically not been the case um and i think the thinking was primarily that well if we let people cash out then they'll you know leave the game without um you know they'll cash out and then that'll be the end of it they won't continue to play will lose value there'll be value leakage whereas in reality what we're seeing now is that sure some value does leave but the loyalty that is bred by allowing people to be you know uh willing participants but not captively held in the ecosystem is actually much greater so while their take rate might be much smaller um their overall growth can be so much larger that they end up you know netting out ahead financially as well so it's just a really interesting construct that i think um you know it's almost like the new generation of games are not operating from a place of fear where oh we need to keep our players or else like you know everything the feel the wheels will fly off everything but rather saying okay this is an open free market economy you can participate if you would like if you don't you can leave and maybe you leave and then come back later whatever it's up to you um and you know again i think i think this idea that players would only stay if they were held hostage effectively as being proven not to be correct um and i think over time traditional gaming companies will have to and i think by the way this is happening a lot more quickly than anyone would have suspected uh i remember saying about six months that i said six months ago that i thought uh within two to three years like 90 plus percent of gaming companies would be crypto gaming companies i think we're now talking on the order of months um you know if i yeah i mean it's crazy we we obviously have a traditional games practice at the firm and we also have a crypto native fund and so um you know we have a good lens on what's happening in both of those ecosystems and the percentage of um companies or new game studio studios or what have you that are coming in with crypto as a significant part of their strategy has gone from like zero a year ago to like okay not zero but like very few to almost all um so it's it's really interesting to see that transition um and by the way i think some of the you know the aaa studios etc some of the more entrenched entities in the gaming world are not going to move that quickly um but you can't ignore the speed at which some of these things are growing and the passion of their communities and so you know if i were there i think i would be very much thinking about okay do we do we buy a team do we how do we reconfigure but i think honestly it's it's very politically challenging inside some of these bigger organizations like how do you transition your whole business model you know it's it's terrifying but i think if you zoom out and look at what's happening in the ecosystem it's going to become table stakes that people want more ownership in the games that they're playing they want to participate in the upside and feel like you're a part of the has historically not been the case but it's becoming more and more the de facto common situation in crypto and so i think that's what's what's very exciting i mean just a quick side comment on what you said i find it hilarious you know andreason's whole thing is like uh you know software eats the world right and it's really it's like crypto is starting to eat entire other industries right so like you talk about the crypto fund maybe starting to chew off some of the the gaming fund within a16z right or you know at least melding the two ideas together the same thing is happening with fintech we were just talking to kathy wood from arc invest and she said hey there's more and more you know cross-pollination between like what we're trying to do in the fintech side and crypto because now crypto is defined so does fintech just become kind of defy so it's like crypto is starting to eat the world um just a little side quest there yeah oh no i think about this every day you know we um i think as a firm are constantly re-evaluating what steps should we take to best serve the entrepreneurs um in the community and so for us you know the whole firm transition to being an ria in order to at least in part um invest more freely in the crypto ecosystem you know we've we've taken a number of steps in um that frankly are um i think unusual or at least as far as i know have never been done before in order to kind of stay current and be able to as i said serve the entrepreneurs as best as we can and i think what we're seeing is exactly what you said which is you know there used to be internet funds right if you look back at the dot com or whatever i'm starting an internet fund there's no such thing as an internet fund now it's just called the fun okay yeah that's everything exactly and so i think of crypto as very much the same in the sense that eventually it just becomes a piece of everything it's it's a part of the stack it's a way of um enabling certain things powering certain things um it's it's not its own category um and so yeah over time i think obviously that a lot of things will need to be reconfigured um but by the way that is an incredible success case for crypto like this is what we've all been hoping for and working towards for the last however many years because at the end of the day like what could be considered more successful than becoming a part of everything um so to me that's that's definitely a a big success case over time every fund becomes a crypto fund that's the prediction we're making last year oh yeah no 100 i yeah absolutely stand by that brian and i definitely both got shocked when you uh updated your timeline from years to months with regards to crypto or gaming companies becoming asset powered gaming companies but i think upon further reflection it kind of makes a lot of sense because the world of gaming is very very community driven like people the the game studios make games for their communities and when they make design choices that the communities don't like the communities let them know and then let them know like you don't want to piss off your gaming community you want to make them very very happy uh and so like with regards to like the game theory of all these crypto or gaming companies turning their games into asset-powered games it makes a lot of sense because of like you know if if we don't the community will might go elsewhere to where the assets actually are and so i kind of want to zoom out and and take a a long-term uh historical perspective as to like sort of the models behind uh care player acquisition with the worlds of gaming way back when uh when uh you were playing a game you and they they would come in like the cds with the crystal cassette cases you had to spend like 20 to 30 dollars to buy the game and then you get to play the game and then that evolved into more of a freemium model where the game was free it was something like a massive multiplayer online game and you would join the game for free and then like and then you could buy your way into items by your way into skins uh and but the cost of player acquisition dropped so that the company could make more selling them uh in-game items in-game assets which again are not crypto assets and now we've kind of gone even further where like the cost of a player joining the game went from 30 to 30 to 60 dollars down to zero and now it's going even negative with asset with crypto asset powered games where like now the game is pla paying you right you are earning real assets in the game can you talk about that progression uh and kind of how uh that relates to like the game theory behind all these uh gaming companies turning into crypto gaming companies and how that relates to the dynamics of player acquisition yeah i mean i think the history that you just described is super fascinating i remember reading a few years ago for the first time i think it was in masters of doom which by the way i highly recommend it's a great book um about kind of in in the early days how you would have you know you would have a program that was written in the back of a magazine and you would literally have to type in the entire thing um to download something or you eventually could get a cd mailed to you and you would separately mail them a check and it was kind of the honor system where uh you would you would either mail cash or a check and then you would get a game in the mail and i was just like oh my god people used to be so good i see it's wait people are good is masters of doom is that about like doom you know the first person she is the original okay yeah exactly it's uh john carmack and uh oh um he's just the the the other co-founders name is escaping me but yeah anyways it's a great book and um and it really describes kind of the early history of the development of video games um and yeah it's just a fascinating read i remember i basically read the whole thing in 24 hours i couldn't put it down um but yeah i mean i think if you look at the uh the history of um games you know more recently it's been very driven by if you look at like mobile games or games in in facebook even you know you really were dependent uh to a large extent on your ability to successfully monetize via well not monetize but really get downloads via ads and so if you lost the ability to do that in a cost effective way because facebook changed their ad rules or something else happened um it became more competitive et cetera then that was you know that was a real issue for driving continued user growth um and i think what's fascinating about some of the play to earn games if you look at you know axi for example the majority something like 90 plus percent of their players successfully refer other people to the game and so all of a sudden you know that is no longer and that's organic by the way because if you look at um what that game and then you know on top of that things like ygg and some of these um sort of guild communities around providing scholarships uh for playing this game empower um you want to tell people about it because all of a sudden it's improving your life in a meaningful way and so you want your friends and your neighbors to also be able to do the same and so i think that's really um turned things around games are no longer like something that you try to get your kid to stop doing but it's actually um you know a really positive force and so that to me is what's driving a lot of the organic growth um now obviously you know the the the rate of that growth will fluctuate over time and you know if it were to continue at the pace it's going all all people in the world will be uh playing crypto games in very short order but in general like the underlying um power of this new system is the fact that you know the users are able to participate in it and i think the the wonderful thing about some of the guilds ygg in particular as kind of the leader in this um is that they're bringing down the financial barrier to entry so that players who are willing to invest the time in a game are able to to begin and um you know they're they're taking down whatever walled garden might otherwise exist um and so i think they're providing a really valuable service for some of these game economies not to mention for the players i want to get into the economic side of crypto gaming because where there is crypto there is economics um but before we get there and you've talked about this a couple of times but i want to just make this uh explicit here and talk about it more directly uh how does the play to earn model which is the crypto gaming model change the structure of who actually captures the value in this new ecosystem sure well you know i think the best way to think about it is that it's similar to a regular world economy in some sense in that there are different types of participants who perform different roles in this economy and um you know are willing to contribute different things in some cases you know if i am uh someone who doesn't have a lot of money but i have a lot of time then i'll be willing to play a game earn the token rewards and then sell them in the open marketplace to somebody else now i might sell them to i'll just use axia as an example i might sell them to a breeder you know if i've earned slp i might sell it to a breeder who will then use it to generate upside by you know breeding their axes or um you know i might uh be a participant who is just willing to come in and pay to get started because you know i come from a wealthier place or whatnot so you know different people are willing to contribute money or time or whatever and so in that sense it's very similar to a real economy um if i have a lot of money and not a lot of time i'll probably hire somebody to do things for me um and you know i think i think that's perfectly normal and and very reasonable and actually allows um it's no different than you know say a mechanical turk or something like that where you're hiring people to perform work for you um in some sense and so yeah i think it's interesting because we generally don't think about game economies as parallels to real economies but in reality they very much are and so um as more and more of our lives become digital we're spending more and more time in various sorts of digital worlds there's no reason why work shouldn't also increasingly transition into the metaverse um and i think that's what we're seeing yeah this is so fascinating we've got a lot of questions to talk about kind of the new workforce as you were talking i was thinking about you know so many people in the philippines are actually like playing axi as um their job and earning living wage earning better wages than they could through other means of employment in their in their local economy in the philippines which is absolutely amazing you know kryptos always been talking about like um banking the unbanked right well who knew it would actually come about through working inside of these metaverse these gaming type economies um i think that the lens that you just shared ariana is like so crucial for us to understand this because every game that's been created before crypto has been a closed economy right what crypto enables is an open economy and so like games have to think totally different it's not really about revenue is it it's about gdp which is an economic measure an economic metric rather than kind of a business metric of um of revenue and like the the gdp that some of these open economies can throw out is absolutely amazing but i i still want to address maybe a a criticism that uh some some might make on this uh economic model it's basically that it's like maybe a common criticism of crypto isn't this whole thing a ponzi scheme is this a ponzi game that we're playing here right like what are you talking about where's the actual value being created right we create this game and then the players themselves value it and then the asset prices go up but all we're creating are these assets and the the way the the economy i guess achieves um any any form of gdp or revenue is through asset inflation right so like where is the actual value that's being created here is this kind of just a ponzi game all the way down no it's definitely not and i mean i think the the key part of the equation is that it needs to remain fun to play these games because the success of the system is to some extent predicated on the willingness of some percentage of the members of the game community to put money in to buy new things and by the way this is not dissimilar to any other game where it's like oh i'm buying skins i'm doing this that and the other thing the way fortnite continues to exist is that people are willing to put money in otherwise it too would collapse so you know it's not that this is uh in any way a ponzi scheme it's that you need to make sure that over time there's enough desire to continue to play the game for fun reasons that people are willing to invest into it now i think how that happens is continuing to build out interesting creative game experiences and i think the cool thing about some of these worlds digital metaverses is that you can have all different kinds of things that you can do in them and so it's an infinitely rich canvas for building new games new experiences new whatever um in a way that you know continues to bring people in and you know i would argue that frankly some of these economies are are just as reasonable if not more reasonable than you know the us economy in the sense that how do we have dollars well we print more and so how is that any different than you know having um inflation in some of the game economies it's really not you have a lot of the same principles at work which is what i just described where some people are willing to put in money some people are willing to put in labor um et cetera and so i think you know obviously the the rate of growth is not going to always stay consistent like there will be periods of sort of stabilization but again like look at the real economy sometimes there's periods of crazy growth and sometimes it sort of you know muddles along for a little bit so um you know in in my mind this is definitely not um not a an unreasonable paradigm for an economy um now granted i certainly think that the failure mode for a lot of these worlds is screwing up the economic mechanics and so i think that um that's gonna be one of the biggest challenges for axi and some of the other metaverse type um games or even just games in general because you know there is real risk that if you fiddle with some of the uh economic principles you could end up causing some unanticipated um and maybe adverse economic effects in the game economies which by the way is also the same as the real economy um so you know it's it's a challenge but it's definitely not insurmountable and so i think the teams that are are building the most in this space are really um pushing forward the thinking and um what we know about how some of these economies work and by the way if you look at who many of these teams hire they're literally real economists like um no i'm serious like yeah a lot of a lot of um sort of game economy people studied economics um and it makes sense right some of these economies are so complex that you really have a very close mapping to what you would see in kind of the real world economics so it's got to be way more fun it's gotta be way more fun than going and becoming a central banker right with your economics degree totally exactly it's like the fun ones go become game economists yeah no offense to anyone who's a real economist but yeah yeah absolutely well they're all real economists right yeah per what you're just saying real world economists let's call it that yeah when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so so we were talking about kind of the the superpowers of cryptogaming and we've established two you know the first is players own the items asset-powered games you can have now second this this play-to-earn movement and uh you just went through the history of we've seen pla play to buy and play to win in gaming and now we're at kind of play to earn so let's dig more into this i guess uh third superpower that we're kind of unlocking which is employment via crypto gaming um you've mentioned ygg a few times which as i understand is kind of a an employment guild for crypto gaming maybe we could talk a little bit about that but just like high level so ariana not a day goes by where i don't receive because we did a po we've done podcasts on axi we've done like written stuff on axi um and so i get a dm from people saying hey take a look at my axi resume i'd love to go work for you right scholarship me is kind of i think a term that's used and um i'm not deep in the axi world myself so i don't know what exactly they're talking about but i can see there's a ton of these are essentially job applications right um to come work for the axi economy and for uh an individual to to sponsor these scholarships and these workers in the axi economy right so can we talk about this move to employment in crypto gaming like for people who aren't in to this right now don't know what's going on what is actually going on with crypto gaming what is ygg doing in this space yeah maybe it'd be helpful for me to kind of take a step back and describe a little bit of the history of how we got here so um in terms of the the ygg story um a gaming entrepreneur in the philippines gabby deson um who has been kind of a leader in the games community in southeast asia for a number of years saw that during the pandemic so many people had lost their jobs and he realized that given axey's model he could loan out his axes to other people who could then play play them and earn slp tokens which could then be converted into local currency and so he started doing this then teamed up with beryl lee who is his co-founder um together with their third co-founder who is anonymous owl of moistness um let me tell you that that was an exciting background check when we ran that um oh i know i love it the the best i i encourage everyone to go check out on our blog the ygg funding announcement because it is literally my favorite photo that we've ever posted of a team because it's barrel and gabby and a stuffed animal of an owl very cute um anyways and ariana i don't i'm just i think we haven't actually named ygg which is yield guild games uh and like yeah we all know what ygg on the call but like it might be useful to actually imply what this thing actually is yes exactly so um yeah so basically ygg as i was saying emerged out of this um lending of in-game assets to other people motion so gabby would basically um you know gabby and then later the ygg team would evaluate a person on their ability to kind of play the game successfully and then loan out these assets so that the person could play the game with them because for example in the case of axi which is kind of where they started you need to have a team of three axes at least in order to start playing um and the cost can actually be fairly prohibitive like now you'd have to spend this was not the case at the time but even then you know it was it was a substantial amount of money for many people um now you'd have to spend well over a thousand dollars to put together like a starting team kind of situation um and so you know by doing so by lending out these in-game assets they enabled a whole class of people who would not otherwise have been able to start to play the game to do so um and so they take a small cut of the earnings of their scholars and the rest is kept by the scholars and the cool thing is that this has been so successful that now many of the people who started out as scholars are actually now also participating and giving their own scholarships to other people because they've been able to buy their own assets and and continue to play the game with their axes so um it's super cool um the exciting thing is you know it's enabled people to in many cases make it through the pandemic i mean there are literally wow yeah i mean so many people who'd lost their jobs um literally credit ygg with getting them through and even more broadly you know many of the folks who have started playing are now making many multiples of what they were in their jobs previously so it's it's really i mean the stories are just so heartwarming um they're doing such incredible things for their communities and you know i think they're they're just at the beginning of their stories i mean right now a lot of the activity is concentrated in the philippines but they've really started a movement that is spreading kind of across the world and so i'm super excited about where they're heading and it's it's just such a clear tangible way in which crypto is improving people's lives you know we've been talking about oh crypto's going to make everyone's lives better uh and i think a lot of the the the pushback from people outside of crypto is like okay like give me an example and in my mind there are really no better examples than what's happening in this in this area um you know so we're thrilled to be involved and and i'm super excited to kind of see how they expand at this point they're you know they're getting um they're really hitting their stride in terms of being able to scale the model and i think the other piece that's very important is that a lot of what's happening here is becoming a beachhead for providing access to other kinds of financial services from people who have not historically been served in the sense that in many cases a person's crypto wallet that they're using you know to earn their tokens as they play these games is the first financial service contact that they've ever had it's their first bank exactly and so it's incredibly cool because then you have the ability for other kinds of financial products to become relevant and and to you know give access to folks who haven't really had access to other kinds of financial services and so um you know it starts with a game but then it becomes way more than that and i think that's what's really cool ariana i think i found the picture you're referencing is this it there it is is this them how good is that picture so we got the the three founders including the owl of moist this year did i get there right the voice out you got it right this is an official a16 post i think you guys put this in so that had to be a lot of fun to explain to uh the compliance team and investors and everybody else oh yeah oh yeah it's funny um you just kind of have to roll with the punches in crypto i love it i mean i i think this kind of stuff to me is just like the essence of the space and um why i say that i'll never be able to do anything else in my life because what am i going to do like sell bonds after this come on no everything else is boring after crypto definitely so yeah yeah i love the space i think it's just there's so much creativity and and so much i think one thing i love is that crypto tends not to take itself too seriously in some respects and i think that allows for a lot of creativity and innovation that would be difficult in other spaces where people are more concerned about being wrong and stuff and i think the fact that everything is open and composable and you can just kind of start building stuff without needing to make a grand production about it or get a lot of uh you know get some sort of um access or permissions or whatever from a centralized gatekeeper is one of the things that allows people to be so original and just to build things in a way that's um that's fast and iterative um and i think that ends up being a really positive driver for the speed of innovation in the space ariana one concern i have with this whole um if there is the viability of employment by these individuals that means there's opportunity that's why these individuals are there um and i'm worried that we might watch the same path of um like working for an in-game economy working for something like yield girl guild as we saw with the whole yield farming phenomenon in 2020 where it started off very democratized and everyone had more or less equal opportunity and then over time it could became more and more consolidated into the hands of a few like well well capitalized uh yield farmers who we kind of labeled as liquidity locus as they had no alignment they just went from farm to farm you know sucked it dry and moved on and we know that there's this world of bots in the world of web 2 for engagement on platforms like instagram twitter facebook and i'm worried that like we might be able to see that same bot farming operations might be applied to any sort of in-game economy that comes out of the cryptosphere is this a worry that you have as well well i think it's definitely top of mind for the folks who are building these games and these experiences to make sure that they're very difficult to game um and so i think part of that will just be solved through technology by continuing to make changes and and add enough complexity whereby it's very difficult to actually sort of be extractive only and and not be a solid participant in the community i think the other piece of it is that now that some of these models have been shown to work people will be more willing to rebuild something similar that is not problematic or that allows some of these um issues to be solved so if a particular game economy is no longer serving its users they'll just leave and that's the whole point of what i was saying earlier you know these are at will participation economies and so um you know i think the community will be very willing to say hey you know this isn't working for us we're going to go somewhere else um and so i think there's a pretty strong incentive to make sure that um things are are kept in a state whereby everyone is benefiting um and granted you know over time some folks might benefit more or some classes of folks might benefit more or less and the game teams i think will will tweak their models in order to make sure that things continue to work so yeah i agree it's it's definitely something to be mindful of but um i think it's a very solvable problem and and we'll continue to work on it over the next few years but i don't think it's any reason to stay away from the space or anything like that i think one reason why it's easy to have such strong conviction about this coming world of crypto gaming is that we've seen early premonitions of it before um uh guilds in world of warcraft were people in chat rooms that would go on raids together uh so that they could you know defeat the boss and come out with a cool shiny new in-game object and now guilds yield guild literally calls itself a guild but we also might call these things daos uh so how do you see the intersection of daos and crypto gaming blossoming as this world expands oh boy um the the structure gets really complicated really fast because if you look at ygg it's it's a dao of taos which like even for me who spends a lot of my time thinking about both dials and games starts to sort of bend your mind um so maybe it would be helpful to take a step back and and um frame dows first in the sense that dows in my mind are really organizational units similar to the llc or the c corp which people tend to be a lot more familiar with and there are organizational units that generally have a financial component so there's a wallet or or something and then a community that organizes around that to make shared decisions about what to do and that might be by an nft or it might be you know make a different take a different action of some kind but in general it's a way for people to organize around a shared objective um and generally have some shared control over assets of some sort which might be eth or it might be um you know in-game assets or might be nfts or might be whatever else um and so it seems very natural to me that daos would map very well as you said to kind of these communities of people in gaming because sometimes especially by the way as costs have risen dramatically around some of these um in-game items you know you might want to own a mystic axi but you don't necessarily want to own it on your own and so you might pull together your assets with other gamers and and purchase one for example um in the case of ygg you know they really have a broad base of participation from members of their community and so i think a dow is a very natural fit for what they want to do so i think eventually most organization that happens on the internet will happen through daos it's kind of i think of it as like a crypto native uh llc structure kind of thing and so it's interesting now because we're seeing dows crop up in all different uh areas and people say oh well you know daos are x and it's really like you can't i mean it's like saying companies are x it's really broad you you know it's more of a tool and a structure that allows you to do something rather than a category unto itself um and you know we're just seeing that flourish now things are being um developed that use dowse at their core in a whole host of different categories so um you know games is one such category and i think it's a very natural fit but i think we're going to continue to see much more expansion from there let's talk about broader cultural issues because if if you're right on this ariana i think this this could have a significant well there you go um so we know this is going to happen then i shouldn't even uh you know phrase that is if you're right when you're right ariana about crypto changing things um it's going to have an impact on culture right a major impact on culture so when i was a kid i played a lot of video games um my mom didn't like it so much you know if i was grounded i'd get grounded from video games dave was sharing a story with me before this podcast as we were talking about it and uh david your mom used to hide the power cord from you right yeah young my power cord my computer yeah and there there's like this surely you must have had a backup i would have that's literally the next step in the story she didn't know i had a backup does mom know this is the story yeah all right now hopefully you're old enough that you can manage your own power um so but but like there's this impression that um if if people are immersed in video games all day right like um it's not real work i mean how do you get paid real work for dignity games video games are sort of a waste of time is the impression in fact just in the recent news super fascinating to me um china has cracked down on video games um they did this in 2019 now they're they're upping the crackdown and so china has now barred online games for anyone under the age of 18 if if you're a chinese citizen from playing on weekends and limited their play to just three hours on most weekends you can't play during weekdays you only get three hours on the weekend um what's interesting to me is like i feel like i learned so much about crypto just from playing video games in my like in my childhood right whether it's just like something simple like mario collecting coins right that's like what is crypto we're just collecting coins aren't we um or whether it's something like you know a diablo where you're leveling up and you know you've got characters there's something like civilization all of these things taught me how to prepare myself for a more virtual future so i i guess my question is do you think that um like even china's action for example in barring uh you know people under 18 from playing games is this essentially like barring people from a super important component of the future economy are there more benefits that we realize from uh gaming in general than the critics realized what's your take here oh i definitely think if i were to sit down and you know i just know this anecdotally but if i were to actually sit down and you know ask all the smartest people i know um and by the way most successful people i know whether they played games the answer would almost unquestionably be yes in nearly all cases and i think i know this because i've had many conversations to this effect that almost all of them would say that they learned so much about strategy about collaboration about how to um achieve a given objective given some set of constraints um you know from games so i actually think it's a super important tool for development um so i definitely don't agree with with china's decision to do that um i also think it's incredibly difficult to enforce so very curious to see how that goes um there's a lot of things china does i don't agree with but anyways um i think the uh the main issue is just that um well one interesting thing to note is that now it's no longer you actually can have your work be a game so that's a fascinating development because you know i think many parents if they had seen their kid actually like bringing home real money um from playing a game would have had a different perspective um and i think it's quite possible that you know down the road there becomes a larger universe of people who play games professionally um and then you know maybe that's 20 of the population or 20 of the the game population and then 80 percent of players are just sort of more amateur do it for fun um and so they're the ones who are are putting in more money than what they're taking out and so that's kind of how these economies end up growing but from my perspective you know the the new model of play to earn definitely kind of flips this idea that games are a waste of time a little bit on its head um but i don't think they were a waste of time to begin with um so you know it i guess it's all in the eye of the beholder in that sense but from my perspective it's very obvious that there are tangible learning and development benefits that come from games um and so you know i i don't think that games were ever the the one to demonize to begin with hear that mom ariana is never wrong and she says that games were useful the entire time i was playing them as a youth there you go and the world of gaming is already just a massive force a cultural force already like but before we integrate a bunch of like financial components into it and you know esports especially in the last five ten years has absolutely exploded onto the scene and you know drawn more attention and more eyeballs than you know any american sport that we have here or i think even soccer i don't know you might have to fact check me on that one but still um so now that we have like the uh and so gaming was already a cultural revolution in of itself and now we have a revolution in gaming coming on with crypto gaming so ariana how do you see esports as like a subset of the whole gaming world being changed due to adding like a financial layer to these games yeah you know um i think esports are interesting because there are definitely a lot of the same um principles at work as you see in other kinds of of crypto gaming um i'm starting to see a little bit happening at the intersection of crypto and esports but i don't think it's quite hit its stride to the extent of what we've seen in in other parts of crypto games so um you know my lens on it is it's something i'm watching closely i literally have a book on esports somewhere around um that is on my reading list for the weekend but i don't think it's yet um kind of reached its aha moment to the extent that other parts of the ecosystem have but um you know if there's any people building really exciting stuff out there where we're super excited to take a look so let me know well i'm i'm curious just what we're talking about kind of you know esports is a major force right now but you mentioned earlier that major gaming studios would actually enter into crypto i i'm curious if you've got some inkling on on how they might enter how that might evolve so the epics of the world the blizzards the activisions of the world um are they having strategy meetings right now and being like hey guys what's our crypto plan because we really need one and how do you think they'll enter in what ways so they are um having those meanings um now what comes of them i think is still an ongoing question um there's a few options for them and i think by the way this is similar to what we've seen whenever there's been a new paradigm shift in technology a technology sub sector on the whole um you know they have the ability to build something themselves or to buy it or to partner with somebody else and so um as far as i know most of the current efforts are focused on the either partnering or maybe on the buying but we haven't really seen much of that happening yet but as i was saying earlier i think it's a very uh politically challenging thing to propose or orchestrate in some of these larger organizations because when you have kind of the the golden goose it's very difficult to want to say oh hey you know how we've made like billions of dollars to date we're just going to not do that anymore and we're going to try this crazy new thing that's a very challenging um proposition from sort of an organizational politics perspective and so i think in many cases um you know this this goes back to the innovator's dilemma in many cases this won't be acted upon until there's a real existential threat at that point it might end up being too late for some of these organizations but um you know i don't think that they've necessarily felt the full pressure of what's to come yet but as users start to see that there is a new option that there is a world in which they can be rewarded and actually own the items that they've built up or acquired or whatever in these games they will demand the same um in more traditional games and so at that point it's like well if you don't want your users to leave then you'll probably have to start listening to what they want and so in my mind like over time they'll be more and more of a shift towards users having certain expectations and makers of games being kind of forced to you know cater to them because otherwise users will leave um and so i think that we're just kind of at the beginning of that transition period but i do think it's happening i want to switch gears here but also maybe not actually uh how does this conversation fit into what is uh what we're all trying to figure out is the metaverse how is this relevant to whatever the metaverse is well um you know i think at its core the metaverse is a virtual world of some sort so um most crypto games are virtual worlds of some sort and there's generally you know people are saying oh what will the metaverse look like i think the great thing about the metaverse is that there doesn't need to be just one and so people can exist in multiple virtual worlds that serve them well for a particular reason but they don't have to choose one and commit exclusively to that so you can be a participant of multiple metaverses um and that's fine that's great so i think what we're gonna see in terms of development of these categories is there's going to be different ones organized in different ways around different shared purposes with different communities and users or you know people will be able to flow between them based on what they want at a particular time or um you know their preferences and i think that's a super powerful concept because you know in a world in which you can't necessarily move to a different country because you know there are border controls or whatever else um we have the ability to create a much more open set of digital worlds powered by the internet and crypto um and i think that's sort of the direction that we're heading um so yeah we're spending a lot of time in that category i'm super excited to see what people come up with you know i think as investors our job is not necessarily to be the creative ones but just to find and support the most creative entrepreneurs across the space and we're seeing some really interesting stuff in that area and yeah it overlaps with gaming in various ways you might have a game that becomes very successful and then becomes a whole virtual world and then there are other games in that virtual world or you might have someone who creates kind of an open-ended virtual canvas where you can create different games from the get-go um and allows developers to come in and build whatever you know they might be interested in doing like in the case of sandbox for example so um you know there's there's many different ways that you can approach it and i think multiple universes will always be under development at the same time and so people have the ability to kind of pick and choose what is the best fit for them what do you think about this weird thing that we've seen recently with like loot where you actually you start with a an asset and then that gets sold that gets some you know social traction and then the idea is like a metaverse is built on top of loot so i could bring my loot into like an axi or a world of warcraft or a diablo do you think that has staying power or that model or do you think we kind of junk jumped the shark there and it's a little bit overhyped i think it's a fascinating experiment in the sense that it's taking the role of the community which i think has been a very important part of the crypto story to its like furthest logical extension whereby you are just providing a literal list of things and giving people effectively free license to go build experiences around it and that's a really interesting point because it means that the community is not just you know a voyeur or sort of a passive participant it's like they literally have to do everything um but it's it's incredible to see how creative and willing to pick up the mantle people have been already in just a couple of weeks since loot was dropped um and so you know i don't know if lewd is gonna end up being like a big thing in in five years time but i think it's the first experiment of its kind and so far i've been really impressed with kind of how um excited and again just really creative people in the community have been let's talk about uh how this fits into the the broader i guess crypto economy than ariana so you know we we we've talked about like these items these nfts many of these get um registered on a self-sovereign property rights system like something like an ethereum um i think part of the reason uh uh we're here today is uh you tweeted this out can we all agree ethan's money yet and then uh bankless twitter jokingly replied you realize tweeting this gives you an auto invite to the bankless podcast in reality we've wanted to have you on for a while ariana and discuss these things but we are definitely proponents of of that idea that um eth is becoming monetized through nfts through the metaverse it's becoming an important economic system can you talk about how you see the role of crypto systems like ethereum fitting into this and what the effect on something like ethy asset might be yeah in terms of context for my tweet which was definitely like kind of tongue-in-cheek um i think historically if you go back to kind of the early days of crypto when it was really mostly a bitcoin-centric community um a lot of the proponents of bitcoin by the way i'm very pro bitcoin still have my original coins generally never you know so it's it's not at all um a dig on that but i think a lot of the initial logic has been proven wrong and what i mean by that is i can't tell you how many conversations i had with folks who were like well bitcoin has a cap supply and therefore it's going to continue going up in price and will become kind of the ecosystem uh cornerstone eth doesn't have a cap supply and therefore it's gonna be worthless and if you look at what has happened obviously that's not the case and so i'm sure that um if there's any bitcoin maxis listening they would argue with me that we haven't reached the end of the story yet and therefore i'm probably still going to be wrong in 10 years but you know i think most of us um can agree that you know the the richness of developers and projects and sort of um uh creativity and innovation that has been built around ethereum as a platform is staggering and i think that's what's driving um value capture on this change so in my mind if you have something that you can use to buy all kinds of things and interact with different protocols in the ethereum community and that's eth like that is serving as a form of money at its most basic it's an asset that you can trade freely for other kinds of goods and services in a given ecosystem and you know eth definitely meets that uh description as far as i'm concerned so i was kind of tweeted as a joke but what i really meant was that like it's obvious that despite in the abstract it's seeming like bitcoin's um you know characteristics as a financial asset might lead to um better outcomes in reality what's happened is that all of the brilliant development that's happening around ethereum is actually really driving that sub economy and so from my perspective it's incredibly exciting to see kind of this whole ecosystem continue to develop and so i think eth will be a critical currency not the only one but i think a critical currency of kind of the metaverse and so if you can become like the currency of the metaverse like that's huge so um to me that's like a really very big uh market and so i'm excited to kind of see things continue to move in that direction eath as metaverse money is a really interesting concept um that um that we've only started to explore i think and it's going to be increasingly an interesting narrative to watch um but but is this really what we're doing here ariana so you said earlier that like what's the tan what's the total dress bull market for crypto gaming and you're like seven to eight billion people everybody right um is that what's going to happen is basically everyone is going to be drawn to crypto in one way or another maybe through through crypto gaming for instance this could be a big on-ramp for a lot of people and then are they just naturally going to fall down the rabbit hole of all of the rest well now i have my first you know crypto bank account which is a an address and i have a private key and i have a wallet that works and now i may as well do my banking in d5 and oh as far as storing my wealth well i may as well buy something like bitcoin or ether just to store the wealth because now i'm interacting this economy is this a huge catalyst for adoption for uh the rest of crypto what's your take there absolutely i mean it's already happening and the thing is like as we were discussing crypto is becoming all the things and so you know it's like do users want access to the new version of all goods and services in addition to kind of these new digital worlds that we're talking about and the answer is yes so if you're coming in as we said from a game and then all of a sudden you have access to credit and you have uh you know your your new version of a bank account which is actually controlled by you you have all of these different um experiences at your fingertips like yeah everyone wants that and so it's it's not to say that it's gonna happen tomorrow or that this is going to um immediately supplant all the existing versions of everything but as i was saying like crypto is becoming increasingly a part of the stack of more and more technology goods and services and so it's natural that you know as people come onto the internet and they start to interact with crypto in certain contexts they then percolate out into others um and i think that's an incredibly you know exciting proposition absolutely well ariana is been an absolute pleasure to explore crypto gaming with you pretty soon we'll just drop the the prefix and just call it gaming because crypto is going to become all the things i want to maybe close with with this last question for you uh and that's this um what's coming next in crypto gaming so actually had this massive year uh you know surprising caught many by surprise do you have any uh thoughts on what the next big thing in the sub sector of crypto might be well you know we've touched on the metaverse but i think that's really the next frontier as we've said we've seen some of these games start to gain a lot of traction in a particular context but what we haven't yet fully seen is like the development of full-fledged virtual worlds that you can do a lot of different things in and so i think that is really the next frontier and one of the areas that has the most promise because the more rich we can make these virtual worlds the more time people are going to want to spend in them and the more ways there will be for people to interact with them and so i think that's sort of the the next frontier for what's happening in games the next frontier is building out the metaverse ariana simpson thank you so much for joining us on bankless today thank you so much bankless listeners some action items
