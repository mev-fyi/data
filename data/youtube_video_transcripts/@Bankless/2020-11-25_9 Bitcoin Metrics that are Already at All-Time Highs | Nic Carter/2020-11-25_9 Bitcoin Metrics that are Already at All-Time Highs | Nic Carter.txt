hey guys the next sponsor is ledger and ledger is running a 40 off black friday week sale so if you haven't gotten your ledger yet you are in luck for the week of the 23rd through the 30th you can get 40 off of all ledgers on the ledger website so if you are still using a hot wallet or you're just looking to get a backup maybe for a multi-sig or just for some more redundancy now is the time to go get that ledger there's a link in the show notes that can get you that 40 off black friday deal if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiren is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well um one of the motivations behind the article that we wanted to get you on to discuss the nine metrics that are at all-time highs for bitcoin which to me are nine reasons to be bullish bitcoin that are just not related to like the happening right they're they're outside demand rather than intrinsic scarcity yeah yeah they're mostly demand side metrics or they might have something to do with financial infrastructure um or or even macro but yeah so this was the reason i wrote this article is to somewhat demystify you know our current rally um you know and like cast a little bit of light on market structure um you know some of these things people don't pay that much attention to so i wanted to say look there's like good real credible reasons why the bull you know has returned by the way before we get into the article nick i just want to like finish off that discussion about bloomberg so like um you got some flack by a contingent of the bitcoin community for breaking orthodox on something that i didn't even know was orthodox in bitcoin culture but like what does that feel like it shouldn't be does it does it piss you off or is there still an element where you're like well you know bitcoin culture does need people with very strong opinions uh in order to sort of forcify its social defense structure are you just like this pisses me off and then like i'm angry about it i mean i i didn't catch your discussion with melton so i don't know exactly what you said but i think i understand the metaphor of like there being this like hardcore right you know cotter of like really you know like strong willed holders that are the guardians of you know the the views and the social contract and then you know percolates out from there but um with stock to flow in particular i just think it's a like a faulty opinion to hold so it's just like in my opinion not a valid model uh so it would be a big shame if that was somehow interwoven into you know the orthodox bitcoin doctrine because you know bitcoinism in my opinion should be more about like you know the political objectives of the system and not about some you know contrived but some you know contrived mathematical models stipulating that um so it would be a big big shame if that was somehow interleaved into the most orthodox kind of set of core views all right well so let's talk about um some of the views that probably almost all bitcoiners could share and certainly we've seen this massive uh price run up like you you start the article by saying it's entirely plausible we could regain 20k level again which um i mean it's it's quite a stunning ascent from what was the low on bitcoin we're like did we get did we get below 3000 at all or it was 3 200 just above three 3k on bit max i think yeah wow and that was a year and a half ago something like that i mean yeah i was oh the low in in 2019 yeah yeah really not long ago but i mean as recently as march we were wicking down to the 3500 range all right so crazy to think about so this like kind of marks the the the beginning of the bull market i think for bitcoin so can you talk about some of these charts and like let's go through the data here and uh tell us what's different or what's unique about this bull run or how we should view this bull run i don't know where you want to start but um let's start with the first one um addresses of 10 addresses that hold 10 worth of bitcoin or more yeah it's one of my favorite charts uh any of these metrics of dispersion and the point is there's just more bitcoiners today than there were in 2017 and there's a number of ways to get act you know to apprehend this data you could use survey-based approach which uh the cambridge study is pretty good i think and they look at holders on exchanges and this is just kind of more of a directional approach it's not really telling you with any precision how many bitcoiners there are that would be the wrong way to interpret this but it just tells us directionally like bitcoins getting more distributed to smaller addresses and of course there's a number of different ways to get at this data i could cut this data you know 20 different ways but to me this is just the purest uh single expression of this dispersion there's just more people that have heard about and own crypto today uh as opposed to three years ago so we have a more stable base so this this number basically has to go up and to the right for bitcoin to be successful right like we have to yeah 100 and so like and this the fact that we are can seeing it continue to do that and especially do that really really strongly in the 2020s is just overall bullish yeah and uh i would encourage you to look at this data for ethereum too i'm sure you have um a theorem is showing that same dispersion which guess what that's not the case for every uh of every blockchain uh both of the the major forks of bitcoin showed concentration and to me concentration spells do right because it basically means like a lot of people sold their coins on exchanges and whales bought up the coins so you see the address the utxo set actually shrink and to me that is a sign of morbidity right i always want to because we're talking about brand new monetary systems you want to be distributing that to the entire world's population so if it starts shrinking you've failed you're in the first inning you've already failed so this is particularly important a particularly important metric for those uh crypto networks that are trying to become money or global money in any real sense undeniably undeniably and i've seen more attention on the dispersion metrics recently but in my view they're absolutely critical i think everybody should be looking at them totally agree all right let's move on to the second topic of open interest in the cme bitcoin futures why is this a important metric to pay attention to nick this is actually probably the most important metric in the entire article wow yeah so the the rally these days is characterized by participants that really in some cases can only participate in this market specifically the cme is a market where if you're you know a large hedge fund or an asset manager or you know institution as they say you have likely already sort of done that counterparty risk analysis there's no additional work that you need to do to get comfortable with this market trading on this market that's obviously not the case for any of these newer crypto exchanges where you have to do your diligence you know um and you have to you know ascertain their their trustworthiness uh the cme is you know deeply intertwined into sort of established financial plumbing uh so the cash settled futures product is really critical um and the more open interest we see that's indicative of a very certain type of market participant that in some cases is only able to trade on this specific market uh so i gave the example of rentec that's where you know probably the most successful and lucrative hedge fund uh in history uh this was the one market that they uh specifically said they would be able to take their positions on a lot of these guys a lot of these hedge fund guys when they come out and say they're taking bitcoin exposure they're talking about the cme product uh and a lot of bitcoiners will listen we'll hear that and say well that's you know that's fake bitcoin and it doesn't affect the spot price but my response to that would be that the market makers that are trading on those exchanges are hedging their trades with swap bitcoin so i do believe that it does affect the spot price of bitcoin it you know there's like all these conspiracies a lot of gold bugs like to say you know paper paper gold you know is totally decoupled or even suppresses the price of spot gold um a lot of bitcoiners subscribe to that view as well but i i do think this is tremendously positive more liquidity more open interest on this product a few people complained to me that open interest is a bad metric uh but but whichever one you use to to look at it whether it's contracts or open interest the number looks good it's it's more liquid than it's ever been so what's interesting is we've had a few other developments this year with like bitmex being sort of shuttered where it seems like regulators are really trying to clean up the space has been almost a theme we also had as you mentioned renaissance technologies and uh cme we also had um the block blackrock cio manage 8 trillion or so in assets said something crazy positive about bitcoin that you would have never heard in 2017. do you remember 2017 and jamie diamond was uh big news right poison was that when that got out yes like around that time it was like you know folks like charlie munger and warren buffett and jamie diamond um but now this this time around it seems like the tables have turned and maybe it's partially because these institutions well now they could become uh bitcoin bag holders too right they could buy in they didn't have a way to buy in before but now with the cme they do this product you guys remember this product launched on december 16th 2017. literally the precise top of the last market and some people attribute it to the collapse of that market which is kind of plausible like you you finally as a certain set of institutions have the ability to instrumentalize the short against bitcoin which they couldn't do before totally plausible or december 17 i guess they launched um so yeah this is really important as you say like if you listen to some of the reasoning behind that bitmex uh indictment they also talk about this notion of unfairness the fact that there's offshore derivatives exchanges which can operate with less constraints or no constraints and they can sort of outmaneuver these onshore exchanges which are regulated and the regulators and the enforcement arms that sort of you know work on behalf of the u.s state they want to uphold the validity of the u.s regulated uh you know capital market and so one of the reasons they enforce is to maintain fairness and say you know you can't just go offshore and compete with our american regulated exchanges um and so i think that's actually part of the reason is that they they want to inculcate this vibrant uh you know local ecology of uh of marketplaces and that's part of the reason why they go after the offshore exchanges for better for worse is to protect and maintain the competitiveness of the cmes and the sibos of the world and the backs of the world and so on so because there's more volume happening on cme which is a is a u.s friendly institution what does that mean for the prospects of a bitcoin etf very very positive extremely positive that's probably the number one thing that the sec called out is they are interested in more and more bitcoin volume taking place at markets that are kind of us regulated with surveillance sharing agreements where the market structure is apprehensible to regulators and it's not very cypherpunk of me to say obviously but that's the specific thing that the sec called out right that's what they asked for wouldn't it be interesting if the uh cme launch marked the top of the 2017 bull run and a bitcoin etf marks the top of this 2020 to 2021 bull run or just continues it yeah i mean oh yeah the the the first gold etf um i think gld that launched in 2004 that had a billion dollars of inflows in the first three trading days and then we're going to smash that record yeah with bitcoin i agree smash that record yeah right you got to keep your bullish hat on right can okay tell can you tell that i'm a little bullish and like fired up right now new paradigm there are no pullbacks right david that's exactly right it's straight up all right realize capitalization that's another metric that you've i think popularized uh nick can you talk about it yeah so realize cap it basically just measures the value of each individual coin at the time it last traded or settled on chain so it's kind of a liquidity adjusted market cap you can also see it as the aggregate cost basis of all holders that's way way above the 2017 highs to me this is a more pure market relevant measure of capitalization than market cap is uh what it shows to me is that look you know bitcoin cost like people are storing more wealth in bitcoin than ever their cost basis is higher than ever people are buying bitcoin at higher thresholds than ever in 20 in late 2017 we wicked up to these crazy levels and that was it we weren't there for very long there wasn't a lot of economic activity that happened at those levels this tells us that we've been you know having bitcoin commerce at these high levels for much longer and for a much more sustained period so we're way way above the all-time high here i've also heard this described as it's it's almost kind of a measure of the average um bitcoiner basically their cost basis so it's almost a measure of like the happiness of the average uh bitcoiner right so like this goes up and the average bitcoiner is really happy because they just made a but that it just means they made a bunch of gains right so and then what's the average bitcoin are going to do um tell her friends about bitcoin how awesome it is and how much money they made and then that creates this feedback loop right is that another way to look at it yeah there's the flip side of that though i mean if price outpaces the realized price or if market cap outpaces realize cap too much you know and you can look obviously look at the ratio it's a great reliable kind of top picker then people it's an indication that people are going to take profit most likely right um if if the ratio gets too significant and so i love it uh for trading purposes uh to me it's one of the purest things that i've found in terms of ascertaining where you are in the market cycle and so where does this indicate that we are in the in the market cycle from your reading of it midway through rally but uh by no means at the extremes of uh 2017 i think the the ratio hit something like five or six in 2017 i think we're in the maybe the two range uh right now wow okay room for growth awesome yeah keep keeping the the bullish hat on let's let's keep that going uh moving on to uh the next one let's uh what is this bitcoin options open interest well i'm personally going to need a definition for this one because this is outside of my area of expertise i mean this is like among the least consequential uh charts in the article but uh so we don't have to dwell on it necessarily but yeah options open interest is the nominal value of all the outstanding contracts uh and as you can see the it's mostly derebit that we're talking about here but really the point is here options give you more creative ways to express your opinion uh of their you know price direction and volatility characteristics of an asset and that just basically didn't exist before you know it wasn't really an options market so does larger and larger open interests imply that more and more bitcoins need to be held by the parties that are participating in this um that's a really interesting question um i'm not an expert on options so i don't necessarily have a good answer for you okay um you you mean like sort of it as like a protocol sync yeah yeah yeah exactly really the reason i included it was just that it shows that a miners for instance have more um concrete ways to potentially hedge their exposure should they want to and i happen to know miners that are using options to hedge their exposure and um all of this was not available at all during 2017 basically didn't exist basically didn't exist in size uh and you know it just means that as a trader you can engage with bitcoin in a more creative way now this is a super cool one nick bitcoin price in the turkish lira why the turkish lira i love turks i got many turkish friends um but you know they're having a currency crisis and guess what the bitcoin market in turkey is booming it's booming there's a number of exchanges btc turk is the biggest one and of course bitcoin is well at an all-time high really the point here is doesn't really matter which sovereign currency you look at it at you know in in in which terms like it could be the turkish era it could be the uh you know brazilian real uh could be the nigerian ira the argent any of these kind of weaker currencies bitcoin is already well past its all-time high and we have this dollar bias because we denominate our lives in dollars but that's actually not the case for most people worldwide they're forced to use these more inflationary currencies so let's just sit back and remember that these hard monies they look extra good when you denominate them in extremely soft monies like the dollar is one of the strongest sovereign currencies but there's so many other currencies worldwide that are super inflationary and where are most people in like a turkey getting their bitcoin is it something like local bitcoin or are there um exchanges no they have full uh sophisticated order book uh exchanges in turkey so they're they're well provisioned from an exchange perspective it's also a country where there's like a cultural fendi for gold and i think one rubric or heuristic you could use would be it's kind of easier for the for individuals living those places who are used to storing valley outside of the state or the banking system to make their peace with a new thing like bitcoin speaking of turks that we all know and love melton is in the chat saying that uh btc turk was the second ever bitcoin exchange so hi malcolm and thanks for the info shout out btc turk let's go so tell me to me that the turkish like you just said is just like this representative of uh other other currencies which there seems to be just the the the metaphor that i've gotten from from uh bitcoiners is like bitcoin is the apex predator of currencies and so bitcoin is just working its way up the the line of weaker and weaker currencies and it's gobbling up each one right like the last one in line is just eats that one and it needs the next one and it's just working its way up to the to the final boss which is like the dollar right the dollar is the one like leading the charge so it is uh there's like this fiat herd of wilder beasts and bitcoin is is picking off the focus ones as they go yeah totally correct totally correct and here's the twist on that bitcoin helps the dollar predate on the other currencies by the way you know like not just bitcoin but crypto infrastructure we've all seen this crypto infrastructure is proliferating dollars around the globe we're seeing these you know digital crypto dollarization whatever you want to call it aggressively predating on these weaker sovereign currencies my guess is that it's because of crypto infrastructure not even necessarily the existence of bitcoin i know that's heresy as well it's because of you know like public settlements infrastructure allowing dollars to proliferate globally that kills off a lot of these weaker currencies all right nick do you have time for a quick side quest quick detour because this is this is on point there we go all right quick quick side quest right so circle partnered with um the uh bolivarian republic of venezuela this is jeremy and crew who basically circle has usdc and they are providing it's it this is almost like um like political action wouldn't you say like because they are arming the um a dissident government government in venezuela with usdc stablecoin in order to circumvent capital controls is that's what's going on here uh well yeah i mean so what happened was the maduro regime had some funds that were seized by i believe the treasury sees them and then you know in the eyes of the u.s establishment here juan guayido is the legitimate president of venezuela and maduro is actually a pretender to the throne even though he has de facto power and uh so that's that's the us's attitude to this whole thing and so they didn't see anything wrong with you know uh appropriating the uh venezuelan account that they could sort of get access to in the u.s banking system because in their view guido was sort of the legitimate president and maduro is the pretender so um it's sort of in the eye of the beholder whether you consider this to be theft or sort of a rightful return of capital to where it should be but so what's happening is that you know the u.s said okay guerdo you can here's your budget you know these are um these are funds that kind of belong to your government and his move was to try and distribute them to medical workers in venezuela directly using air tm which is kind of a fintech app which is dollar denominated i had ruben galindo on my podcast quick little plug uh if you want to learn about this uh in detail um and uh so that's what's happening here so it certainly is you could maybe discuss it as slightly imperialistic or interventionist um but honestly uh venezuela is undergoing this dollarization anyway in fact the maduro regime is in favor of the dollarization of venezuela because it's kind of a politive measure it's making the local population less angry with the regime the fact that they can dollarize so they decriminalize dollar ownership this year so you know there's as much of a pull as there is a push happening and it's interesting it's using crypto rails so this is usdc this is not um you know us foreign policy intervention through the use of the swift system uh for example this is like the first time it's being done through a stable coin well there's a last mile delivery problem right because you know people there's no real market to spend usdc in venezuela right now um so they still face the challenge of getting usd liquidity into bolivars which still exist or uh into actual physical dollars really venezuela dollarized with physical dollars you know like remember those things yeah we used to use them before the pandemic uh so there's there's probably about two billion dollars worth of physical dollars circulating in venezuela that's how they initially dollarized then it got more complicated they used zell a lot of zell um but the problem is that zell is kind of powered by banks like wells fargo and there's no sanctions on venezuela the whole country but there are sanctions on members of the kind of regime the elites and if you have if you're unlucky enough to have sort of you know maybe your uncle went to the coffee shop that's run by the nephew of the minister of transport or something and then you know he sends you a birthday gift you might have become tainted by association in the in the transactional graph kind of like chanalysis taint that idea so because of that venezuelans are constantly getting de-platformed from zell from all these fintech apps so you see there's an obvious case to be made for the usage of stable coins or fintechs that are built on stable coins really fascinating sandbox environment but yeah you do need to kind of close that loop a little bit and get local merchants to accept usdc if you want this to like fully work if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share

preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways well a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred

coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well interesting because i i i feel like um there's something about that that was bullish crypto rails right but also like bullish non-sovereign currencies that are credibly neutral like a bitcoin or we would argue an ether and maybe some element of dye because um from like venezuela's perspective from the um the anti-us regime right their funds were essentially confiscated and there's it's the same old problem of swift where they're being kind of locked out of the existing system right so us's ability to exert some sort of control over something like a usdc where they can they have a centralized apparatus where they can exert that kind of control um also makes space for the presence of a of a non-sovereign uncontrollable neutral currency like a bitcoin or an ether i recently wrote a op-ed and coined us saying um you know the us should embrace crypto dollars because the alternative is the emergence of much less accountable forms of crypto dollars like die for instance yeah um and so they should embrace the somewhat you know fairly neutral kind of stable coin infrastructure um and surrender their control over the system that they exert with swift because the alternative is much worse for them it means that they have no control over the financial system if we go fully hashtag bankless yeah that would make sense if you're the us government hashtag bankless uh tweet it out okay bitcoin held by grayscale this is um we had mike michael sonnenshine on a couple weeks ago and then we played the episode like two weeks later and we had to change the titles because at first we started like there's six billion in grayscale and by the time we actually shipped episode there's like over 10 billion in grayscale so this is blowing up right yeah and this chart's a little on maybe cheating to use this one because it only goes up by definition it cannot go down right right you know so melton pointed this out on her podcast i think what grinds my gears uh gbdc is a black hole of bitcoins or you know the equivalent for ethereum as well you can't get them out you can only put them in so it's the most unbelievable phenomenon really ever i think uh is it's that it's just sucking all this liquidity in and the only way it gets out is if you know they wind it up and there's an etf maybe and then they go into global settlement or something but really that is the prospect isn't even described in the documents as far as i understand it um so um yeah the grayscale is is absorbing so many bitcoins right now it's preposterous and some people say well that's because hedge funds are creating all the units of the trust to do this arbitrage play but the reason that the arbitrage play is profitable is because there are investors on these brokerages bidding up the financialized bitcoin product so that's the reason the arb works because there's still that sustained bid pressure on the exchanges nick i remember hearing i think in one of your weekly recaps recently where you noticed how bitcoin tends to pump during business hours and how that was associated with grayscale can you talk about that connection because we just watched bitcoin pump from like 18 500 sorry guys i i just lost you um oh i just lost the audio oh you can't hear us it sounds like he can't hear us he can't hear us that's weird we could talk amongst ourselves david yeah okay i'm back i'll come back sorry my phone's just flipped to my phone so i was uh i had been listening to one of your weekly recaps weekly roundups with matt walsh on uh the on the brink podcast and you talked about how bitcoin tends to pump during business hours which is actually exactly what we've seen this morning where bitcoin jumped from eighteen thousand and a half to like nineteen thousand and two hundred and you associated that with grayscale why why are you associating this with grayscale i might be wrong to do that honestly um you know maybe they are running their operations on the weekend or outside of business hours but my guess is that either grayscale or um any of these institutions that are intermediating bitcoin custody brokerage for you know this institutional clientele the nydigs of the worlds the fidelity digital assets of the worlds i don't have precise knowledge of their operations but my guess is that those u.s based more institutional in nature organizations are more likely to be active during u.s trading hours and the seasonality bears this out i mean i looked it on sku yesterday you have strong return profile during weekdays and you've the absence of those returns on weekends and the strongest returns in the last few months have been u.s trading hours so in my view that's consistent with the existence of a bid during banking hours um when those markets can really clear so so nick one thing that that keeps on i think surfacing as we're going through these metrics is this departure from the 27 the difference between the 2017 bull market and the 2020 bull market that we've seen so far that you've described as in maybe the first half right maybe the midway point maybe not even the midway point and that theme is um institutions like we're talking about the cme we're talking about this robust options activity we're talking about bitcoin holdings and grayscale trust i mean these are all institutions it feels like like none of that infrastructure was available in 2017 now it is we're seeing it all go up and to the right essentially is it is the bull run that we've seen thus far a result of the institutions coming are here and uh has retail not yet arrived yet or is retail taking cut of this first who's leading this bull market is it different yeah i would just say the capacity is very very much enhanced and that just broadens the you know addressable set of entities that can get exposure to the asset class now you know we talk about institutions you know pension funds endowments um you know like it it it's kind of a squishy term a little bit uh we know anecdotally that um you know sovereign wealth funds we know that they have exposure to the crypto industry or a handful of them do in certain ways some of them through the venture vehicle uh through you know some of those larger venture funds some of them through startup exposure um you know they're getting exposure in a variety of ways i would say honestly probably the biggest change though would just be the social acceptability of having a long position in bitcoin among high net worth individuals and family offices um you know people on wall street they obviously didn't want to be involved in a like a retail kind of clown show in 2017 which was ico driven and hype driven nobody wants to buy the top from retail investors right absolutely nobody wants to do that but this time around you know those people have had time to think about it and devise an investment thesis there's macroeconomic tailwinds which are incredibly real this time around they weren't really present 2017. so it's just become much more acceptable to have a bitcoin position as you know this you know as a wall streeter or a billionaire you know or a dissident in russia and you're trying to offshore your wealth i mean all these people now the the just the general atmosphere around exposure to bitcoin and crypto has changed and obviously the plumbing is better so you can actually get that exposure if you want it now you don't have to mess around with the ledger or anything so you know i think it's it's you know there's maybe a little bit more to it than just like the institutions are finally here you know it just sort of depends but basically the industry can finally actually absorb capital uh from a variety of participants in a way that it just fundamentally could not do in 2017. wow that's a huge change all right um stable coin free float there's a few more we've got stable coin free float we've got um what else oh uh silvergate silver gates settlement network layer which is interesting and then what else do we have the growth of crypto native credits yeah which which are the most in what's the most interesting thing to talk about of those three nick which would you like to dive into up to they're all very different um i i had kind of a contrarian take on the credit i know a lot of bitcoins don't like banking i was trying to say the credit if you look at where these lenders are lending to and you know we invest in lenders right so we pretty direct understanding of this market the the consumers of this credit are arbitrage firms market making firms trading firms a lot of these firms make markets they're the reason that these pairs are tight you know the spreads are are thin and or you know that markets are liquid so the incredibly liquid and integrated you know and like sort of no arbitrage markets that exist in in crypto exist partly because there's so much credit outstanding because the cost of capital has decreased in the industry so and that's a great feature right you want the markets to be incredibly liquid so we have the lenders to thank for that that was the point i was making here but this is huge right so this is like we we didn't have any of this again this is another thing we didn't have any of in 2017 there was no such thing as block five for retail genesis from a lending perspective was just getting started and to be clear guys what what nick is talking about is um crypto bitcoin in this case collateralized loans basically where you can you know deposit your bitcoin and then you can take a loan against the value of that bitcoin and that market has just totally exploded and i think genesis is is certainly one of the the leaders of that so where do you see that i guess developing moving moving forward in this in this bull run nick i think we're going to see the largest deposit-taking institutions coinbase is the world all those exchanges realize that their destiny is to become a bank so right now they're banks in the sense of i will custody your gold coins for you and then give you back those same coins right but in the near future they're going to become banks in the sense that they will give you the option to have an interest bearing account and they will put your assets to work for you and create credit uh the same way that commercial banks do and i can see you shaking your head because this isn't very bankless this is bank full you know which is is the wrong direction well i think i think you've got an interesting slant on that where you talk about how bitcoin specifically enables a much more auditable trail here but but like let's talk about banks for for for a minute in the next evolution right so first they're starting with these collateralized lens uh loans but at some point banking they love to make fractional types of reserve products right that's how they yeah i mean the banking um the banking i'm referring to is is not lombard loans but specifically standard commercial banking um where with you know credit creation where so you think that's coming that's coming then undoubtedly undoubtedly there's there's nothing which really stands in its way um and of course you know exchanges will probably give their depositors the option to have the full reserve account so you'll sort of have the option full reserve not interest bearing fractional reserve interest bearing um but there will be an explosion of credit you know simply because if you actually look at the yields um in in the crypto industry the interest rates are kind of structurally high and so there's clearly an under provisioning of credit even though this chart is up and to the right there's not enough credit being created in the crypto industry there's a structural high demand for credit someone's going to satisfy that demand my guess is that one of the major exchanges starts to turn on interest bearing counts kind of in the near future that would be interesting i do want to touch on the stable coin supply because that's uh highly relevant to both bitcoin and ethereum so i think right now there's roughly there's perhaps even at this point over 25 billion dollars in stable coins out there and maybe i think we have like three or four billion in tether at the peak of 2017 and so not only is there less than that yeah not only is there just straight up more stable coins there's also more kinds and they're spread across the ecosystem well that's actually not totally true there's like three billion on tron and i think the rest is on ethereum uh so so nick when you see just a massive supply of stable coins out there what does that tell you about the nature of this particular bull run so the one thing as it pertains to bitcoin is that bitcoin was the uh it was the kind of quote currency for exchanges right and it was the default currency pair for all crypto exchanges kind of long to all coin exchanges derivatives exchanges and that changed in the last year i think you guys have pointed out too these exchanges became largely tetherized tether became the default collateral it became the default pair that things were traded against and so what that will have done is that will have removed some of the structural kind of reservation demand for bitcoin so you know you think about crypto exchanges as being a sink that bitcoin you know falls into if it's the default asset that was eliminated largely and then tether became the default pair so despite that the bitcoin is now trading back at its all-time highs means is trading more on the basis of being kind of pure macro asset as opposed to being you know like a a reserve currency for the crypto industry so that's a very positive thing in my views that you know bitcoin is largely eliminated from that reserve asset use case tether kind of replaced it usdc as well and so it's impressive that it was able to sort of recover from that loss of a major use case and then as for just the you know i think what this allows us to do is just reason more carefully about what we use these things for it's clearly stable coins are the default uh moe in the crypto industry they're what people use to transact with and then ether and bitcoin people are using more as like the base collateral in these systems i think that really clarifies what they're for and you know we don't have to smash together all these different features and or try and use uh i mean you maybe you guys disagree with us but i don't think that we have to force a square peg into a round hole anymore and trying to believe in retail bitcoin is this like payments asset which is really not suited for um so the stable coins as a cohort have taken over that activity um the other interesting thing is that stable coins have a mutualistic relationship i think with i i know i i wrote for you your newsletter that it might be parasitic but my view currently is that it's highly mutualistic with stable coins and crypto native uh crypto native assets uh because the stable coins need something to trade against something that's liability free and if there's ever run on tether what did what are they gonna sell it for they're gonna sell it for the most liquid cryptocurrencies because you know those can't be confiscated if there's a worry that your stable coins can be freezed or confiscated frozen or complicated you'll just trade it in for the most liquid crypto pairs yeah though i think that take could be right on right because as you said there's always the concern or the fear that the uh birth of stable coins could lead to the demonetization of uh something those crypto native assets like a bitcoin or uh an ether but but but really what it seems seems to be um happening is it's really totally killing the use case of 2017 i mean part of the 2017 ico fervor was these futility coins where any coin can be a currency and therefore have a monetary premium associated with it i think the the the success of stable coins completely slaughters that 2017 like that was the lazy fat protocol thesis if you will right like all we have to do is we'll create a protocol and then we'll create this medium of exchange and we've got our own currency and bam we've got evaluation to compare with ether or bitcoin right well like no just use just use usdc in in d5 right you don't need that so it does it it does i guess almost like act as a an apex predator in the crypto ecosystem in that it like eats these tokens that aren't a bitcoin or an ether and can't rise above and create this monetary premium it just eats all of those other imposters it makes them more honest you know these payment tokens if you're selling something as a payment token you're gonna be you know my challenge to you is are you gonna outperform a stable coin in terms of your your qualities and your transactional usage this puts a gigantic hole in the ripple story by the way knowing what yeah gaping gaping chasm and the ripple story ripple's a bridge asset that never happened but guess what is a bridge currency stable coins a hundred thousand percent right all right last question for you nick why is ripple going up right now then ripple's really popular in uh you know in like japan and korea um oh god i don't necessarily have a ton of color it could also be that people think um the next administration is gonna be favorable towards ripple that's plausible ripple invested a ton of money and energy in lobbying for good outcomes in dc maybe what's being repriced right now is their prospects of getting uh avoiding the security monitor moniker and being called a commodity so that is one theory that i have to explain the price action and it changes nothing about the overall fundamentals of the project yeah virtually no usage as a bridge currency yeah obviously just use stable coins instead yep that's exactly right nick thank you so much for putting the work into this article and then also coming on to share it with the bankless nation i'm particularly bullish but again looking at all this data uh it's nice to have the data to back up the bullishness my pleasure gentlemen thank you for having me back it's always fun thanks a lot we'll do number five pretty soon here nick
