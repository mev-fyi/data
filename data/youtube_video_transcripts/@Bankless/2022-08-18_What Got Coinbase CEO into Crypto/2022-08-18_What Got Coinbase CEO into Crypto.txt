thing that certainly got me excited about crypto in the first place was the values it just never made sense to me like why does every country have some small number of people with their fingers on the dials manipulating the currency that seems like a huge conflict of interest i also had worked at airbnb as an engineer and they were trying to move money into and out of 180 countries around the world and i got to see just how inefficient it was if you compare it to things that we know of and use in tech like email or whatsapp if you send a whatsapp message it goes anywhere in the world it doesn't care what country you're in not every country is using their own proprietary messaging system but money's not like that it's like every country in the world has their own proprietary system it's like not super interoperable with the other countries there's a high fee whenever you move the money and so i just think of it as this huge unnecessary friction on the world economy and so i had just like kind of felt it viscerally that this was unfair i feel like this is the future of the financial system i think in 20 years it'll be a substantial portion of global gdp i'm in it to create more freedom that's that's what i'm all about
