I've been very consistently skeptical of what we now call the content moderation regime the thought that platforms should be Arbiters of Truth I've always been very skeptical of to be clear I am not a free speech absolutist I think they should be able to ban partner hyper violent content I've always been skeptical of it for two reasons one as someone who's been inside the machine and opened dashboards in which the numbers are all in the billions I just felt it was Impractical you just wouldn't be able to do it at scale and then secondly even assuming you had some regime that sort of did it at some point it would be ideologically captured by one side or the other I'm not necessarily pointing figures to one side of political Spectrum but there would be a contingent that says you know what this is actually good speech this is bad speech and it would be difficult to apply anything like an objective standard to it ask yourselves this do you feel safer now are politics less polarized now that Facebook is the Arbiter of Truth and actually has like an oversight board that sits in a closed conference meeting and like reviews decisions do you feel better now that like the Supreme Court of free speech is now sitting inside a conference room a Twitter or Facebook right it sucks I've been calling this since 2017. it's a terrible idea and it's not good and it's not successful it's been a complete mess
