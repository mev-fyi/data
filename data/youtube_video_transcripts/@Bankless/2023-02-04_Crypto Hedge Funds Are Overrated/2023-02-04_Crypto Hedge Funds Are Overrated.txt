how about crypto hedge funds overrated or underrated overrated for sure I'm half joking but I like the concept of total democratized Capital formation in crypto I like the structure of so-called Ico and group crowdfunding I do think crypto has moved towards a system of private fundraising I would like to move towards a system that's a little bit more open access
