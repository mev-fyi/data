a lot of the expected value of crypto being good for the world is in the future we need to start realizing those positive externalities soon and start scaling them up to be at like FTX 50 billion dollar scale I think yeah there's also the problem that all the good things in the world become normal and then all the bad things in the world go on the news and so like there's also just like a public perception crisis and Technologies in their infancy it's like super easy to hate on them right you can just like go to Reddit right now and be like nft is bad and you'll get like 10 000 enough votes I think that's probably why I felt like so demoralized this last week and so many in the crypto industry kind of said they felt the same as like like what do we take to the normies right now what do we take back home to Thanksgiving and say hey I'm proud of my industry
