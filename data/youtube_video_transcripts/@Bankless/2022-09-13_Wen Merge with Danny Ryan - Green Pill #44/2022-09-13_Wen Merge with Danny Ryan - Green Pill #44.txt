[Music] ladies and gentlemen we got him danny ryan coordinator of the ethereum merge is on the pod today to talk about the merge the move from ethereum on proof of work to being on proof of stake really excited about proof of stake as a more decentralized secure and anti-fragile mechanism for securing ethereum the base chain and we talk about proof of stakes design construction we talk about carbon neutrality and then we talk about any advice danny has for anyone who's out there making social change in the ethereum network or in dalles so a really great episode danny is such an inspiration for me he's been working on the merge for all half a decade now and it's going to be a really important thing for the ethereum network for the world and really excited that danny has

hey danny what's up kevin thanks for agreeing to do this all right my first question is my first question is when merge although i have pushed that question off for many years as it's been asked to me um i can actually give you a day or at least a day with some error bars um there was a you know mainnet blog announcement post this morning and you know it's been the past couple of meetings refining and deciding on this the past a couple of public meetings and that is september 15 2022. um it's based upon total difficulty which is based upon how much mining is happening between now and then so depending on what miners do are they selling their hardware are they revving it up or you know like you could get you could even get plus or minus five days at this point uh so 10th to the 20th but the target is that 15th right the total terminal difficulty that will trigger the merge is five eight seven five and then a bunch of zeros so the date calculated off of that is september september 15th is that right yeah it should be i mean what i've seen recently is like right on the cusp utc right on the cusp between the 14th and the 15th um and you know moving 30 minutes here and there uh there's a couple different estimators and stuff so it's a bit of a it's an art not a science in estimating uh difficulty because we're also you know we're like you make like a linear regression you're like okay if this happens this is you know but you're also trying to say things like well are the miners gonna mine through the merge are people gonna start dumping their gpus and turn you know we're gonna have like a 10 drop in mining power between now and then i don't know yeah when it gets to humans the behavior gets fuzzy and you can't always predict it yeah yeah especially in this like one-off event right like in proof-of-work and proof-of-stake you're like you kind of set up this like infinite game this game in perpetuity but we're killing the infinite game of proof-of-work uh so the the kind of long-term incentives and behaviors you expect uh to have designed for you're like i don't really know what happens when you shut this thing off yeah yeah how does it feel this has been the culmination of a ton of work from you and hundreds of other researchers programmers designers in the ethereum community it feels like you're at the apex of something really monumental i mean removing the whole network from proof of work to proof of stake how does it feel very good um i when i had been working on this thing for like three years i was like wow i've been working this for kind of a long time and then four years i'm like yeah that's a long time and now i'm i've been working on this for five years and at five years it doesn't feel like oh this is just kind of like what i've been working on it's like oh this is like what i've been doing with my time for a significant part of my life at this point yeah so it feels good um i'm i'm i'm very excited i think we are ready um you know i i think the feeling is you talk to client developers it's it's a range everyone's had their their nose the grindstone for a year plus um really really really really pushing and so i think some people are tired i think some people are anxious i think some people are excited um and everyone's you know ready to see it happen so and then if you if you ripple outward from there and you go towards the community i mean people thought this thing people thought proof of stake was coming in like 2017. so right everyone's more than ready uh everyone is is excited and you know it's definitely a huge thing to celebrate and i'm excited uh davecon is really well timed i think it'd be fun to kick our feet up a little bit and uh you know enjoy this this milestone so yeah um yeah i can imagine that you're super proud of the community as well in addition to the anticipation and just feeling really good it's the culmination of a lot of decentralized coordination yeah more than i expected going into this yeah well it's and i think that from what i've heard the proof-of-stake algorithms went through a lot of different iterations so the reason why the merge didn't happen several years ago as far as i've heard is that there was just better designs that were discovered as as y'all were exploring the design space and so it must have taken a lot of courage to not hit that deadline of moving to proof of stake the first time under the old algorithms and to iterate towards the better one yeah yeah it's a it's tough when you're simultaneously trying to engineer something and like get it out the door for users to use while also like performing groundbreaking research on stuff that people haven't done before so it's like you know if we if we didn't do any more upgrades for the next 10 years and just thought about it we could come up with some really good designs i'm sure but like you kind of have to find the balance between like what is good enough what is sufficient what is secure enough um and what do we know today so yeah i mean like eip 1011 hybrid proof-of-work that's that was that that thing that was it felt close at the time in retrospect um knowing what i know now it needed a lot more testing a lot more security analysis a lot more engineering you know i i don't think we were actually like four months out i think we were probably like 16 months out on that design uh but it didn't even get us all the way there right it was like this layer on top of proof of work and then we were going to kind of like remove proof of work over time um it also had a 1 500 eth minimum to stay like 32 is still a lot um but the utilization of the ls signatures and aggregation has you know allowed for far far far more participants i mean granted there are many quote validators that maybe is a staker that's running 10 of these entities and so 320 but there's there's a lot of home stickers that run a 32 validator um so opening that up i think is made for like a much healthier distribution much much safer network so uh but yeah yeah it's it's always a balance between that next like research breakthrough versus shipping things today yeah well i hope you're going to celebrate in bogota at devcon when you uh when the merge has happened do you have any plans to celebrate so on day of and i'll at an undisclosed location near where i happen to be um i won't disclose here but we're we're gonna do some sort of uh watch party so i'll i'll let you know um so definitely day of we'll we'll have a bit of a watch party and hang out and then i think um right before devcon we'll have something of like a research workshop as we often do with many of the researchers and developers and probably like that night like all go out hang out enjoy and talk about you know have our war stories and stuff um i guess i'm extremely confident that the merge will go well um i'm you know moderately confident that it will go off without a hitch although you know a client team here or there might have a a software issue as we go in so i'm like i'm very confident that if and when an issue emerges uh we'll be able to kind of figure it out resolve it and patch it so uh i guess we'll we'll know then and we'll be reflecting on maybe some of the uh the crazy moments between now and then yeah i guess we had a bit of a crazy moment yesterday geth released their merge ready release and then perry on our devops team upgraded the nodes on like a shadow fork a testing environment and all of the guth nodes bricked right there i think gets corrupted or something yeah yeah like something about the state database uh structure got corrupted and um they they had quite a last 24 hours scrambling to find and fix that bug which they did which they did but as these things go that might not be the last one of those so we'll see yeah well fingers crossed i think we're recording this in late august i'll probably air this in early september right before the merge happens so uh we'll see what happens between between now and then but i think everyone's rooting for this to go off without a hitch yeah it will go well there are gradations of well you know but and i i hope if you know if your listeners are ethereum folks they probably heard the multi-client drum being beaten over and over again um but you know there's five implementations of the consensus layer there's four production implementations of the execution layer and like that that's a feature so like you know if uh one i wanted to say a particular name because any any client team could have an issue guess you know who we we hold is like very robust like having issues but when that happens like a certain portion of nodes will have an issue and then a patch will be released and it'll keep going where instead of like 100 of the notes happening is failure all at once so the redundancy definitely helps us there yeah i think that attribute of anti-fragility coming from multiple clients being implemented in multiple different languages by people on different continents is really a beautiful attribute of the network that's been it's wild so like you don't really see it in almost any other environment it's like it's hard to replicate i'm wondering if you could take us down the deep rabbit hole of how proof-of-stake works uh i'm i'm just thinking that every time i hear vitalik talk about proof-of-stake and how a game theoretically works and in the design criteria for uh proof-of-stake i i get a more full conception of what the design criteria are and how the system works and i'm wondering if if you could just like take me into danny ryan's brain like how does proof-of-stake work how does it secure ethereum what were the design things you were shooting for and and uh i'm wondering if you can paint me that picture so i think the first thing i like to do is take a step back from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake and it's really just like economically bounding the the impact or influence of any actor in in this distributed system um i know you you spend a lot of time thinking about civil resistance and stuff but ultimately in like in a decentralized consensus in a network of nodes that are trying to agree on something um you know by default it's really easy to to replicate yourself to civil yourself to attack and like try to have outsized influence on on the outcome of the system and so the the um the aha moment improve work is realizing well in this decentralized context actually bound the say bound the contribution bound the role of of an individual to the amount of like economic weight they bring to this system and if no actor has over a threshold of economic weight um traditionally like that percent fifty one percent um then the system will have certain properties and so in proof of work that and the really thing the hard part here is how do you prove to a distributed system that you've actually dedicated like an economic you know something a scarce resource to it um and in proof of work turns out that like crunching on hashes and and solving you know cryptographic puzzles uh is a really uh clear way to demonstrate that you've dedicated mining hardware and energy consumption which are scarce resources to the protocol um whereas you know the aha moment and the flip from moving to proof of work proof of stake is that okay there is this other scarce resource that's really easy to get to prove to the protocol that you've dedicated the protocol and that's the the kind of the end protocol token itself right so it's like the ether the bitcoin or whatever and instead of having to constantly consume energy to prove that you're dedicating those resources you can actually lock them up in inside of the protocol in a game where they're now at risk um and that that's that's the kind of thing it's like it's proof of dedication of scarce resource so the protocol if we could if you could like prove that you've dedicated your vehicle to a to a blockchain protocol like that would work like proof of car like but it's not really obvious how you'd prove that to a distributed system whereas you know like can you can you prove that you've dedicated storage to a network it seems like the that's actually harder um you know these proof of space-time protocols but it seems like there's there's there's some stuff there that that does work and so it's really like scarce resource dedication to protocol kind of like being such that such that it bounds the say it bounds the kind of the role and so a lot of what we're looking for in designing ethereum proof of stake at least the core of it is like can we actually get in proof stake environment some of these properties that you get from work right like can you have a chain that is resistant to large economic players from from attack you know from from reorganizations from from rewriting history um from censorship you know if if there's no attacker or cartel over a certain threshold will can they can they not censor blocks and the answer is the answer is yes so a lot of these like kind of core properties you want liveness you want good safety properties you want censorship resistance um turns out that in this alternative cryptoeconomic instruction proof of stake proof of dedication of your crypto assets to the protocol um you can get those properties and so you know that's that's a lot of what you look for at the bases is is proof of work it's a simple machine it's an elegant machine um and can we get can we get some of those core properties and actually hoist them into this this alternative environment um and then some of the other things that we're looking for are then so proof of stake uh gives us security um we would make arguments and claims that it is more secure under different under analyses than proof of work and it gives us sustainability sustainability economic environmentally in the sense that we don't need to be burning energy as our scarce resource we can use the the end protocol tokens um and but one thing also that we're looking for is is scalability right and so it's it's a question of as we're designing these systems can you utilize proof of stake can you utilize these validators these economically incentivized actors to actually come to consensus on more you know more than that single chain paradigm more than like the baseline amount of scale you get out of a system like ethereum or a system like um bitcoin um and so one thing one interesting thing about that is is the answer is yes like proof of stake lays the foundation for much more sophisticated constructions than proof of work because your actor because your economic actor is kind of in protocol like you have a notion of these discrete consensus entities that you can say like okay well not only build a block but do this do that do this other thing and so you can you can construct more complex games because of that and i think you can probably construct such games in a proof of work environment but you probably end up like kind of simulating proof of stake in a weird way like you end up having minors like register identities as they mine to then be given different roles and stuff over time um so so one of the things that has been a very important part of the design here and something that's been very topical recently is um recovering from failure modes so earlier when i'm talking about security we you know with these protocols you generally make a claim unless there's an actor of this size or a cartel this size then you get property x y and z you know whether that's like liveness or safety or censorship resistance um but then implicit in that statement is that you do have these failure modes where if you do have an attacker that is willing to that has a certain amount of capital or is willing to burn a certain amount of capital or whatever um that you do have failure modes and those failure modes could be censorship those failure modes could be trying to reorder rewrite history and in proof of work there's not actually very good ways to recover from this so one of the one of the design points in proof of stake is to actually have better recovery modes and it's because so in proof of work if you have over 50 of the mining power you can essentially rewrite history you can censor blocks you can do whatever you want pretty much enter god mode and the only way to remove that that uh nefarious god that is entered into the system is to um change the mining algorithm so to essentially brick their hardware but in doing so you also break the bad guy's heart the good guys hardware um so there's there is there's like an ultimate abort but like you're kind of totally screwing the system at that point whereas and so kind of the intuition is like the protocol because the the economic assets carrying the protocol is outside of the protocol mining hardware and energy consumption the protocol can't really do anything can't punish that asset like it can't go the protocol can't go burn down somebody's mining farm whereas in proof-of-stake the end you know that economic asset is in the protocol itself thus the protocol can punish nefarious activity so there are provable faults pretty much like if you provably if you say a you say this you say something over here and then you directly contradict yourself in a private cryptographically provable way then your assets you know not only are you getting rewards for your asses but your assets are at risk you know so you're in in the extreme your out your the entire stake can be destroyed and so you end up with this like nicer security margin you're not just rewarding but you can actually punish um by you i mean you know the protocol for explicitly nefarious things and then there's also kind of so you know that in certain modes certain types of attacks uh reorgs double spending that kind of stuff like the attacker has to accumulate the capital to do so but then they actually have to spend the capital to do so whereas in proof of work you just have to accumulate the capital then you have you know you accumulate the assets to conduct such an attack and then those you can conduct the attack over and over again whereas in proof of stake you can you conduct the attack once all your assets are burned hopefully it was worth it everyone loves burn teeth and the protocol can recover um there's other these other failure modes like um very explicit censorship censorship other of other blocks those types of things um and some of the once you get to like mega super majorities where you're you know maybe two-thirds attacker you're censoring and you're you're kind of in proof-of-stake god mode you have some um you have kind of some some last fail safes and that's essentially social recovery so in proof-of-work like you didn't really have much of a social recovery like i mentioned earlier you you can um you can change the mining algorithm that's about all and you hurt the good guys and the bad and you probably enter into a pretty insecure environment because you've changed the the hardware requirement um whereas in in proof of stake there is you know it's it's kind of clear the default attribution even in these like non-internal protocol faults and in the extreme social recovery you know you can either soft fork such that the good guys no longer listen to the bad guys and the bad guys would have to exit or slowly their funds would slowly leak due to inactivity um or in the extreme you know there there's the hard fork ability which you know you either hard fork exit everyone you hard fork burn everyone's funds your heart you know and these these are the types of things that like the threat of the failure mode hopefully prevents the failure mode from ever happening uh because it's not i don't i don't claim these should there's any any of this type of recovery should be done um in a very light-hearted manner um and i and having such a conversation and coordinating such you know a social recovery uh would not be easy but it's certainly certainly feasible um so better better failure recovery uh due to the do that crypto economic asset being being in the protocol it's quite a bit of a ramble but that's definitely some of the stuff we're thinking about when designing these systems no i mean i just got that feeling you know you hear someone describe a beautiful painting or a glass of wine and all of the attributes of it and that's the feeling that i get when i hear you

be anti-fragile you have to make it so that it's cheaper to defend than it is to attack because we're in an adversarial environment there are adversaries in the world and it feels like that security margin that you get from being able to slash in proof of stake is what creates that fundamental attribute within proof-of-stake that basically when you have the assets at stake then they can be slashed as an attacker and so that wards off the behavior from the attacker attacking the protocol that asymmetry feels like a a core design thing yeah it's very very important like so in proof work it's probably it's more like it's as easy to attack as it is to defend so you kind of have this like one-to-one you don't want to you don't want to cross that threshold whereas because of the asymmetry and like in the attacker's funds being destroyed and making it not a repeatable game for them um i think you that's where the asymmetry comes in here which is very valuable right do you worry about unknown unknowns at all you know like say you spend a bunch of time securing the front door and making it anti-fragile to attack but then there's like a back door that someone left unlocked that we just didn't know about is is is you know is that something that sort of enters your mind at all yes in a sense so the protocol itself the analysis of the protocol the construction of the protocol the clients that build the protocol the multi-client nature of the protocol i think these things are pretty solid um i think that there are certainly there are there are known weak points that uh have known hardenings that will be layered into the protocol over time you know this is a matter of uh there's always kind of this tug on shipping stuff here between security enhancements and features right so like you know maybe adding secret single leader election to help uh anti-dos dos resistance is a kind of a security enhancement whereas um adding more scale through some sort of shard and construction would be like a feature and these are at odds with each other like because you can only ship so much um so there are certainly things in the protocol that we know we want to harden over time but then it's kind of the stuff that gets out of the protocol that ends up being you know stuff that you can't necessarily control so there's a security team at the ef uh these guys are like they're like a classic red team they pretty much like just try to break um and they come from like a world of zero days a world of like reverse engineering byte code a world of uh finding an exploit that lets you then elevate and exploit and exploit you know you compound these exploits and these exploits aren't always just the end piece of software you know they sometimes often they start with you know a linux backdoor and then and then a privilege escalation and then this and that and then all of a sudden you're corrupting a database that then is making somebody sign some weird message or you've stolen their keys and so that kind of stuff um it's stuff that we're always thinking about it's stuff that the security team at the ef's always looking at it's stuff that bounty hunters the bounties are currently up to uh between now and and and the merge one million dollars for criticals um so there's lots of people looking at this stuff but that's the kind of stuff that like we can we can try to find and we can try to plan for uh but you know it's not part of the protocol it's just like part of computing um it's just unfor not unfortunate but these there's a lot at stake so there's kind of a highly incentivized actor to kind of figure out how to exploit these things um so it's always in the back of my mind like if 50 of the network is running like linux systems and someone finds a back door and then can slash 50 in the network right like that's not something that we can like totally prevent or it's something that we can probably recover from it's something that would not would be messy but it's something that like the protocol can't quite care about everyone that running the protocol can care about it and should and diversity in setups diversity and country diversity and cloud diversity operating system diversity like all of that actually helps and there's you know there's a there's a decent amount of diversity there um if you go and look at it but uh but that stuff's scary yeah yeah i mean i i think it's it's beautiful the work that's been put into proof of stake in the construction there but a little bit scary to think about how we're relying on the history of computation and everything all the way from the the hardware of the computer to the network stack all the way up through tcpip and then linux boxes and and you start to see that we're when you think about planning for anti-fragility you're thinking about not just diversity in the design criteria of the protocol that you've built but also the foundations that it's built upon and knowing how security has kind of been bolted on to a lot of systems in the uh at the end instead of from construction that sort of gets scary for me yeah i mean we're standing on the shoulders of giants and also you know sometimes think you're standing on legos yeah so we're simultaneously lego giants we should well fund our open source software and make sure that that's secure i think is the logical conclusion from that yeah absolutely i mean the fact that like i think it was was it ssl like heartbleed a handful of years ago you know that that comes out and then you're like wait only two people maintain that part oh my god and the entire internet is relying on openssl okay i see how it is yeah yeah it's kind of funny because i i mean i'm going to take this conversation in a public goods direction but the pothole outside of your house doesn't get fixed and you see it and you become a squeaky wheel and your city council takes care of it but there's really digital infrastructure it feels like is out of sight out of mind and because of that it's been sort of left behind and left up to people just by altruism working on giants to handle it you get really big asymmetries like i think linux for good reason is able to like raise quite a bit of money whereas like these smaller projects that ends up being just like a very important piece of this larger puzzle um that you know they're often left behind so sorting through those asymmetries is probably really valuable you know another vector i sort of look at the public goods problem from is that we all have our national state and city governments that are focused on public goods of those hold-ons of those levels and there's no real global public good you know so when you get to things like climate change or you get to things like digital open source software or the quality of our information environment the quality of our biosphere there's no institution that is focused on coordinating that so um you know one of the things that i i'm really excited about with ethereum is this idea that we have a global coordination uh high resolution programmable substrate for creating human coordination so that's one of the things that i hope speaking on buildings uh building on the shoulders of giants uh one of the visions that i hope to see for ethereum green yeah um do you have any advice like you know i i think that you know as you know i come from the get coin side of things and get coins going through a similarly complex transition from bitcoin grants being a centralized company to being a decentralized protocol and you know it's it's hard for me to you know i hear you talk about the the merge and how it's been the culmination of several years work for you to move from proof of work to proof of stake i feel a symmetry between the centralized grants platform and the grants protocol that i know that bitcoin dao is working on and there's lots of all sub problems with civil resistance and quadratic funding do you have any sort of advice uh coming from the other side of the proof-of-stake transition for whoever will be focusing on the git coin grants merge which will be the merge of all of the activity uh from the centralized platform into into the dow uh it seems like there's similar well maybe not similar levels of complexity but there's large amount of complexity with that transition and you're kind of subbing out one engine for another any advice for anyone at get coindal that's listening to this i mean a couple things and i think from my perspective of what's going on with the iteration of the grants platform there and it decentralizes that they're already kind of following this but modularity where possible i mean you can overdo it but um in an open source environment where you're relying on people that really give a and people that are gonna like dig into something um you know it becomes much more scalable from like a team's perspective uh in this kind of very distributed environment to have modular components like i think we we in lucked into of stake this like separation of the consensus layer and the execution layer it just kind of like how everything evolved um it it came out it came out of it but it like i now in retrospect like would have a hard time imagining it otherwise just for the listeners that aren't familiar with this like the the we have these quote consensus layer teams these are the teams that were working on eth2 for years and essentially the teams that specialized in super sophisticated proof of stake and built the beacon chain right and then we have these execution layer teams which are traditionally you know the eth1 teams the teams that are on ethereum mainnet today that are operated by a proof of work consensus but really the sophistication there is in the there's this application layer it's execution layer it's like it's state management it's transaction execution it's the ebm it's the mempool it's kind of all everything in that layer and that's you know the proof of work stuff hasn't changed for years it's just been the sophistication honing of that and then the unification i mean it's the merge of these two things but the unification is thus that uh these proof-of-stake teams they get to be really really damn good at proof-of-stake you know and these execution layer teams get to be really really good at the evm and there's crossover and there's knowledge transfer and stuff like that but like it is such reduced the complexity of kind of how these systems operate and allowed for in this kind of open source context where you have i think usually smaller teams that are really really driven and really really specialized you know like those open ssl guys there's just like two and like this is what we do we do openness as well similarly like the guest team gets to be like we do the evm you know and the lighthouse team gets to be like we do validators we do signatures we do we do this like you know crypto economic construction so i would say you know you can overdo it you could like modularize this thing like 10 times more and i think then you start to have losses but i i do think you know when constructing these things in a distributed context in a community context that moderation such you can have smaller teams and have like people that work on things they're really passionate about is is really important and then in terms of the parallels on upgrading you know iteration is very important um i do not think that like so the beacon chain launched in 2020 right it's been it's been out for almost almost two years and it's been in a production environment to a certain extent there's really there but there's not a lot of you know it's not really user activity but it's been able to like get this software into a production environment get the software really tested embedded get the software iterated on uh before it kind of like met with the big thing the thing with all the user activity so i would say you know any sort of like iterative role out or you know if there are various components like testing component a but not testing component b and c at the same time i think it's just going to reduce the amount of failures and reduce the when something inevitably does go wrong it's much easier to target okay well this was the problem because this is the new thing um and it just reduces like the compounding of failures of this the new the new piece of software so you know iterative iterative rollout i don't know there's there's i'm sure there's 10 other 10 other learnings with those ones that come to mind totally so the unix philosophy of modularity and then sort of taking an iterative nature from there and uh those are the two two major takeaways that i heard yeah i think in in like maybe traditional software releases they're much more likely to be like and this is version two and it's like everything's changed and better and upgraded and whatever but i think in this like more decentralized context more distributed context that it's much better to like slowly change the components rather than change the whole thing at once right um we'd love to pivot the conversation to talking about the carbon neutrality of proof of stake feels like a pretty big deal do you know exactly how much uh how many kilowatt hours or how many tons of carbon are gonna be gonna be saved over the next year so this is from october of last year which hash rate is variable um but there there was a website that estimated the energy consumption of ethereum at 80 terawatt hours per year but there's another website that's presumably a bit better that estimated at 25 terawatt hours per year um but that's a lot at the 80 that's like the energy consumption of chile which is in the top 40 countries um of energy consumption at 25 you know we're probably in the top 100. so either way you're you're eliminating essentially a top 100 country energy consumption from the world but importantly like there's a linear relationship between the asset price the core asset price of a proof of work platform and the the equilibrium of the amount of mining that will be on that platform so you know in a world where uh ether price is 2x or 10x the new equilibrium is to be burning twice or 10 times that energy so it's kind of like a really it's not only eliminating like a discrete number but eliminating like the potential for growth as well um i guess more on my napkin math so like a home computer apparently uses 0.05 kilowatt hours per hour so about 400 kilowatt hours per year there's probably about 10 000 nodes on the network so call that like four gigawatt hours per year of just just like running computers right so like there's a network of nodes and there are computers and there's also this auxiliary mining process so what we're really going from is the auxiliary lighting process plus just all these computers to just the computers just a network of a bunch of computers doing normal computer stuff like drawing on on regular electricity um and so you know if we're looking at the 80 terawatt hours per year energy reduction you know we're looking at uh 99.995 percent more efficient um without that linear growth component if you're looking at you know the 25 you're at more like 99.98 regardless like absurd absurd uh reduction in energy um someone was trying to figure out like a better way to communicate this and it's like okay we're going from the energy consumption to chile of chile so the energy consumption of like 100 middle schools of of their computers you know something like that or it's just it's like almost inc incomparable wow it's it's pretty incredible i mean climate change is one of the things that i really worry about as a father and just a citizen of the world and i think it's gotta feel really good to be increasing the security and decentralization of the network and decreasing the carbon of of it by 99.95 percent like that just feels like an unequivocal win to me yeah i mean marius last september we were all together mario's from the geth team um passionately he's like this is literally the most important thing i can be working on yeah because of the energy stuff alone um and so you know hats off to the 100 plus people that have been working on this day at night for at least the past year and many people have been doing it day and night for three fourteen so yeah i mean i guess you know one of my sort of ideas in the green pill book is that in order to have crypto so the subtitle is how crypto can regenerate the world not how crypto is regenerating the world because i don't think that it's happening yet but uh basically the first idea is is like first do no harm which means get rid of the carbon the the carbon that the network is emitting i think that there's work to be done at the social layer to make sure that there's antibodies against the frauds of the world the terra lunas of the world the ponzi schemes that are built on top of the network not that the base layers should proto should censor those but the i think that at the social layer there should be an immune system where the capital and talent don't flow into them instead they're flowing into projects that are actually coordinating things that are good for the world and you know i'm wondering if we could spend the rest of the conversation talking about how ethereum opens up a new realm of human interaction and coordination creating shifts in power value and organization you wrote a little bit about this in the forward to the green pill book uh your your vision for this and how crypto can be be good for the world and so i'm wondering you know once we've we've we've and how can we ship that build on the momentum of the carbon neutrality of proof of stake and net net net net make make crypto and web 3 good for the world like how does that unfurl in your mind yeah virgil griffith said this to me probably like circa 2017 the way he described ethereum is that ethereum is a technology for the construction of new positive some games right it's it's a way to make very abundantly clear the actors the mechanisms and try to tune them in such a way that like the various actors entities and mechanisms result in people doing what they think is you know good for themselves is also the kind of net benefit for for others or other systems and stuff and you know i think in the context of proof of stake that's kind of very fundamental like is this positive some game where a validator or minor shows up they do something that's selfish they they put up some capital and try to get a return and then the uh the outcome is also that it creates a secure networking platform for others you know so it's it's my my selfish yeah i don't even use that word selfish in kind of a traditionally i mean like self-interested way uh because of the construction and tuning of of this game makes it so that it creates a secure platform fillers and then the extension of that is like one of the most important things about these is it becomes kind of a neutral platform a neutral landscape for others to or for everyone to kind of interact to kind of have the baseline same permissions and to construct new games on top of so i think one of the most important properties here is that there are massive massive asymmetries in the games that we play traditionally um and by games i mean like kind of like economic games you know take for instance the uh the wall street game like there's a game that can be played by certain companies and certain individuals that like you and i cannot play or i'll speak for myself that i cannot play um or others in developing countries cannot play and thus the the asymmetries of the kind of the construction of these things allows for further asymmetries um and allows for kind of unfairness to kind of proliferate whereas on an open platform open neutral generally extensible platform like ethereum um you know we we bring everyone to the table we bring the rules of the game broken wide open uh we allow for um rapid iteration through games so like you can make a bad or unfair game but it doesn't become like so enshrined as it does in in the traditional world and such that like i think the um you get much more rapid evolution iteration through these new types of interactions such that we can find good and better ones over time um yeah yeah i and you know i'm i'm going to be i don't know sometimes i'm pessimist but the optimist in me you know says that you mentioned the scams and stuff like it because of because of this kind of open platform because of this permissionless ability to innovate um create new rule sets and and allow people to kind of interact with them you do you do have a kind of a scammy landscape that emerges but i i am i'm optimistic that um there are there's far more good far more good games we can construct in this this new reality um than the bad ones but we'll see yeah yeah you know for me where it feels like you know having spent a lot of time thinking about this both through my work at get coin and in writing the green pill book it feels like the theoretical constructions are there like you know if we're building a house we've found a strong foundation for it and we're starting to build the scaffolding of the house but there's a lot of you know draw the rest of the owl here for me to mix like you know how do we go in in ethereum is a game game-changing technology which is this article by virgil that you that you mentioned we talk about the prisoner's dilemma and how you can shift the game theoretic landscape from defection to coordinating being the the shelling point but you know when you're doing a prisoner's dilemma you just change the weights of the outcomes towards coordination and away from defecting but it's not that easy in the real world to do that you know how do we create a shelling point for the hopeful how do we create a mass shift of the talent in the capital in the space going going a to the space but be away from building just bigger decentralized casinos and building more pro-social stuff i think is the real big question uh for myself and for the community and so i guess i'll just ask you ask you that like how do we build from just theoretical underpinnings to actually manifesting that world you have any thoughts on that well that's your job but the um i don't know if the like decentralized casino is going to go away right i think it's like one of the just i think it's a very obvious thing to do i think it's a very like low hanging fruit right environment and so i think it's the minesweeper of ethereum right right it's the first utility it's pong yeah it's well it's ponzi but pong um the so i don't know if that goes away i think and i think that's okay i think it's okay that like this such a platform might be used for you know hopefully less scams and more just like defy constructions financial constructions that kind of stuff but i think it's probably more about educating those that are you know this is their life goal and life mission to to begin to construct such games right like there's a lot of people in the world that are trying to solve problems trying to solve the world's problems and like you know i don't want to just say hey if you tried blockchain because today maybe it's not ready three years it definitely it goes it definitely wasn't ready but like i do think that you know as this gets more into the mainstream that people will more regularly think like oh there there are tools here oh that you know like how how ngos had to realize well you know in the 90s or early 2000s like we should probably have a website um you know maybe it's like oh we could have we could reach far more people if we're using uh quadratic funding on the kind of an open platform distributed across the world like you know maybe maybe it's it's more about like this was all interesting for you to say the word quadratic funding by the way i think i'm taking the bait [Laughter] so yeah i don't i don't know exactly the mechanisms and the constructions that can or should be come out with but like i do think that it's it's getting the there there is increasingly a suite of very interesting and compelling tools that people that are engaged in trying to solve the hard problems in the world should be you know looking into and i i would suspect that in five years and certainly in ten years a lot of this is commonplace a lot of this is like you know i have i have a suite of tools and many of them happen to go on blockchain and i'm trying to solve you know solve hot problems beautiful uh i think we only have another minute or two left so i'll ask a wrap-up question is there anything that i didn't ask you that you want to say danny ryan i mean you asked me the hard question the beginning when merged so i i i feel i feel satiated i feel like we covered a lot of it and i will say um i am just a dude i am just one of many many many people um that have worked on this thing like this is i thinking back on it like the amount of engineering the amount of testing the amount of security analysis the amount of like research and design that's going into this thing is like is stupendous uh it is it's it's pretty astounding so shout out to all those guys yeah well if you're listening to this and you worked on the merge thank you for the work that you've done moving to ethereum to a more decentralized secure and carbon neutral world and thank you danny for helping spearhead it and coordinate it can't wait to see what you do next and let's celebrate until then [Music] you
