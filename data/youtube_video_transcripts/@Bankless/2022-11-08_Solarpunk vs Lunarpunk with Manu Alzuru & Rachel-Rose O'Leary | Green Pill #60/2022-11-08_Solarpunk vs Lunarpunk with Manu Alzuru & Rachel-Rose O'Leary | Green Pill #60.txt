foreign [Music] ation how you doing this is an episode I've been planning for months now there's an episode about solar Punk and lunar Punk and I'm joined by my friend Manu alzuru who is the founder of doing good a Community Driven art Marketplace representing the solar Punk perspective of the ethereum community the other guest on this episode is Rachel Rose O'Leary who is a coder at darkfi and was the lead tech writer for coindesk in 2017 and 2018 covering privacy Tech and ethereum she has a background in digital art and philosophy it's been writing about crypto since 2015 she is representing lunar punk what are solar and lunar Punk solar Punk is an art movement that imagines a world in which we've solved our contemporary problems with sustainability it's kind of a high future High utopian type of art movement and basically how can we use web3 to build more public goods and build systems that are good for the world lunar Punk is well you'll have to hear it from Rachel since I think Rachel Rose who I think is much and saying it than me but a more privacy Centric uh bent on coordination so when the the moon comes up and the lights go down on solar Punk the lunar punks come out and there was a big stir that happened in the crypto Community about two or three months ago in which darkfi released this video about lunar Punk and the dark side of the cycle it kind of went viral and provoked people into talking about how do we build public good systems that are more privacy preserving so this was a debate that kind of blew up over the summer on Twitter solar pumpkin lunar Punk and that's why I wanted to do an episode on it I wanted to see where could we synthesize solar pumpkin lunar Punk and how is the two communities building in the same direction versus in different directions and are they directionally the same when you zoom out and you look at the Fiat industrial system or do solar and lunar punks really have that much in common or that much apart and I was hoping to tease that out in this episode I think that trying to reduce these movements into two or three people uh Torres O'Leary representing the solar Punk's menu representing the solar Punk solar punks sorry Rachel rosolary representing the lunar punks and Manu representing the solar pumps like that's reductionist you know these are just one or two people in each of these movements but I do think that it's a good debate that we had in this episode and it's it's kind of one of my favorite ones that we've done because Manu and Rachel Rose are just really articulate and they're both very Earnest in approaching this conversation with each other so really good green pill episode this entire week we're going to be doing episodes on solar Punk lunar Punk Cypher Punk terrapunk and so I've got a special three week episode coming at you this week in which we're going to talk about how web3 is all those different types of punks and what does that even mean to say that web 3 is solar Punk or web3 is solar Punk aren't these things all just mirrors in which we can reflect our own values we can now program our values into our money so what kind of monetary systems will we build and so this is a really fun streak of episodes I got planned for you this week I hope that you enjoy it coordination without further Ado I give you Manu and Rachel Rose peace working in web 3 is awesome it's

and solar Punk two different visual art styles and value systems that describe where ethereum and web3 and blockchain distributed systems could go in the future and I would love to start with an intro of of you Manu and the work that you do let's maybe stick for like 30 seconds or less intros and then we'll really get into it sure um amanu I'm originally from Venezuela even though I don't believe in imaginary lines and I'm an engineer by studies and I've been working in the tech industry for the last I don't know 19 years 20 years more or less and I'm also one of the founders of uh doing good and been participating in multiple dials amazing Rose do you want to go next sure um so I I'm Rose also known as Rachel Rose and programmer and I work um on a Anonymous layer one very programmable Anonymous smart contracts called darkfi and um I uh I've been in crypto for a number of years before then I was in Iris and philosophy um and I think you know I try to synthesize these paths in the the the thinking that I've been doing around leaderboard amazing so great to have you both here um I would love to talk next about solar Punk and uh how we Define solar Punk and then I would love to get into lunar punk from there Manny you want to tee us off yeah for sure um solar Punk is uh movement that combines uh sustainability energy technology and the organic it's really focused in the collectivism also focusing social social justice and he has a aesthetic and political and political movement that imagines um how the future can be using let's say green Energies and also it's imagining a world um that is uh collaborating in different social ideas and access because uh of uh let's say because of what we're currently living with the late stage capitalism and yeah the solar pump movement believes that humanity and nature can Thrive together and we can coexist and basically create environments that includes everyone um the solar Punk movement also offers uh uh positive and kind of like a optimistic view of the world and and yeah that's that's basically the summary of what solar Point means to me amazing uh Rose uh you've published or I think people that you are associated with darkfi have published a video about lunar Punk and the dark side of the cycle which I think defines lunar punk as a aesthetic movement and in an ideology and also um I guess has some criticisms of solar Punk and I'm wondering if you can unpack those for us here definitely um so you know on Southern punk I just want to briefly comment um that you know there's something there's a reason why we as dark fight have started to kind of tap into the um the punk uh uh uh meme Plex and it's because that I think there's something very valuable happening um in the emergence of the certain Punk meme within ethereum and web3 which is uh I see it as an effort of the Ethereal Community to define a vision uh for where they're going and where they want to go within their with their software so I think that's a really positive thing it's a it's a bottom-up emergent um ideology or or set of practices that is motivating uh ethereum and providing it with the um with the direction which I think is really valuable um so where lunar Funk comes in is um it's basically it's something that I've been thinking about for a number of years because in 2018 I was uh going to a lot of ethereum conferences I was the uh the the lead uh ethereum writer for coindesk and I became increasingly um disturbed by the emphasis on transparency which you know is is seen as a solar Punk principle that underpins a lot of the design choices meaning you know there's a there's a emphasis and an effort to make transparent systems uh within the solar pump uh within the sort of book design Paradigm um so I saw a lot of this at the eat conferences but I found that it was became very difficult to distinguish between uh things that are transparent for um reasons like let's coordinate around social goods in a way that's uh that can hold people accountable and and another kind of transparency which is very prevalent in a big Tech which is you know surveillance so these two kind of Tendencies of Technology the tendency of transparency in the surveillance tendency we're combining themselves in ethereum and you know it's not just ethereum Bitcoin also made a very big mistake in its early days by turning away from privacy and anonymity and putting the the emphasis on scaling you know it's a common uh mistake but ethereum made it as well and um it's had these huge uh ramifications on the kind of tools that are used on ethereum and it also means that even if ethereum is solar Punk and it has these ideological Tendencies you know it has Good Will and it wants to do something positive for society even if it has those intentions the the fact the reality of the software it's making is creating an environment that is leaving its users vulnerable to exploitation by big Tech and surveillance the surveillance State and system uh so that's that's something that really bothered me very early on uh in my interaction with ethereum uh so people were defining themselves a soda punk I said you know uh that lunar Punk is a much better framework uh and so you know and that's that's kind of where where we where we're coming from um and it was then in the in the last year or so that I that I started to write the uh write these ideas but lunar Punk is an existing um oh sorry I'll let Manny talk but lunar Park gets existed for uh before you know this article I I didn't um arrive at it by myself although I did arrive in it independently of the other uh kind of sides to lunar Punk so I would say my my version of lunar Punk is quite singular um and it's quite specific um but we can talk a little bit about what is that version versus the other versions but I'll let uh Manu uh chime in yeah I just wanted to say that um the idea that solar Punk is only focusing transparency and it's I think it's just a narrative that is being used to create this separation with this between these two two groups I personally haven't seen anywhere uh that it says that solar punks are not are not um are not let's say a group of people that care about privacy I myself have been cutting myself a solar Punk uh based on the optimism side and not based on if something is private or not private um and I'm saying it as a Venezuelan that used to fight the government back in Venezuela and I had to have my myself because the world government was you know spying on WhatsApp and spying on all the different social media apps um so yeah I think uh I think uh is is uh is currently more a narrative than than the reality of what solar punks are I think but maybe I'm calling myself solar pump without knowing uh the whole definition of the solar Punk then I would say that I think that you know we're all it's it's hard to it's very reductionist to try to collapse a lot of these memes down into one words and maybe they mean or one word each and maybe they mean different things to different people but I do think that um you know ethereum and Bitcoin having uh transparency at the base layer and ZK technology sort of being developed on top of these things but only in an opt-in basis has maybe been what's been the real driving wedge of what uh uh of the differences between the two and you know uh Rachel Rose I'm wondering if we could go into your work at darkfi and it seems like you're building a layer one that has privacy baked in at the base layer I I hopefully I didn't misstate that but I'm I'm curious if you think that's the wedge and and tell us about what you're building with darkfi absolutely and it's in Venezuela as being something which uh made him conscious of the importance of privacy and because I do think that this is an aspect and you know don't see this as an attack against soda Punk necessarily but perhaps it is an attack on ethereum where you know I I do think that there's a lot of people in ethereum who forget the Privacy aspect deprioritize it um and it's because they haven't had those life experiences uh in you know conflict scenarios or at war with the government that have led them to you know realize that that the Privacy is actually something that's essential to um you know to safety and survival something very very key um but uh in terms of dark fight yeah so so you know you made this uh remark Kevin which I think is good about the um the um basis of the solar-prong systems such as ethereum and Bitcoin as being a transparent layer and then having opt-in ZK uh infrastructure on top of us and so what the I would say the lunar Punk um design choice is to have uh anonymity and privacy at the base layer and then having transparency as an optional thing that can be configured in extreme cases where transparency is considered necessary but it's not the default it's like an extreme case um so I think that's a really important distinction I see it as a correction of the current Paradigm because it used to be believed that uh this this this Paradigm of transparent-based layer ZK uh kind of sub layers or you know layer twos Etc but this would be that this would work but you know since tornado cash we've seen that if you have Anonymous systems oh no if you have Anonymous systems uh tacked on top of transparent systems um it's a it's a recipe for censorship issues um so on ethereum you can censor those contracts on a layer two currently they're all using centralized sequences which means that at any activity on the layer 2 if it's Anonymous can be easily censored by the sequencer or you know in the same way as a center to Nato cache by censoring the the contract so that that's that's uh that's why darkfi is taking the approach of of anonymous uh base layer optional privacy in the extreme case I I just want to say also the flag I really wanted to show you guys is comment them on the women's Association which for in the uh Irish Independence Movement um back in the 20s but yeah go on beautiful um I I'm wondering if we could actually talk about some object level examples of where privacy is important I think that might be important to ground The Listener in something relatable and and I think that you each have your own version of that so maybe we start start with you yeah sure um something private um is something that you don't want to make it public to the whole world um and it doesn't mean that he's secret secret means that you don't want anyone to know of it uh something private uh would be for example the communication that I was having with my uh my friends when we were let's say um creating some protests against the government back in Venezuela we will communicate in a private manner uh some of my friends they had um radios for airplanes um so we would use those radios for airplanes in different frequencies to communicate between us uh in in town because uh we knew where the police was coming and where the let's say the uh National Guard was coming and attacking us um at the very beginning when we started protesting it was let's say very uh very peaceful only with um only with writings uh you know claiming what we wanted um but then it started to become more and more dangerous like the first time um you know it was peaceful the second time the police or the National Guard came and started shutting uh shooting a Ruger rubber bullets at us the third time you're kind of like already prepared the fourth time you are already communicating between uh the people that you consider um consider let's say a language your values so in that specific scenario we were using privacy and not secrecy um we were using a privacy in order to protect ourselves against the government and against let's say Force um so yeah that was let's say an example of how we use um let's say private networks to communicate between us in order to coordinate and in order to protect ourselves as well um and when I say to coordinate I would say I would say in order to let's say decide where we were going to be um protesting at what time and how we were going to be dressed of what signals we were going to be using having on top of us in order to show to the uh to the same side of our of our team that we were uh that we were part of them um so yeah I think uh privacy can be used in order to protect but also in order to strategize uh against uh against those that are let's say using Force um using Force to impose their views and impose uh impose their uh their loss let's say um in the digital space um we were also trying to use private um let's say private channels to communicate but most of it uh was related to communication and not really not related to transactions because at the time uh there was no blockchains there was nothing like that um but yeah there's there's more um there's more things that I'm starting to identify why privacy is also important at the transaction uh layer and we can see it with what happened with uh let's say um with tornado cash for example there's a lot of people that are using tornado cash for good reasons in order to protect themselves in order to protect uh also their families and in order to let's say um transact without having someone spying on them um but also there is the other side uh that is uh you know which is most of the most of the let's say narrative that is being used which is that is being used uh for laundry money and so on but then the people that are saying this these type of things they forget like what are the currencies that are being used for doing that um US dollar is the currency that is being used the most for transacting with drugs for human trafficking and for all of these other things that goes against humanity um so yeah um that's that's my perspective thanks so much Manu uh Rose would love to hear examples of where you think privacy is important it may be obvious but I would love to just get them out there so that the audience can relate to them before I go into the to the concrete example I just wanted to talk a little bit about how privacy is framed by um these communities and I think especially from The Cypher Community it's often framed in a negative sense as that it's a it protects you you it's a freedom from coerce that are violence from the state so privacy enables that I would say see privacy in a positive affirmative sense that privacy is what enables people to Define their own Destinies so it enables political self-determination and uh you know so to illustrate that point uh in 2019 and I spent some time in Syria in in the north of Syria the Kurdish region uh where is the rojava revolution which is a experiment in building a Society without any kind of nation-state and it was inspired by the writings of Abdullah that is a writer who's heavily influenced lunar punk in various capacities um so rajaba was an interesting example because it's a place where there's very poor privacy so um the communication systems are go through enemy territories so there's a there's unencrypted data cables that pass through various enemy territories that can be easily intercepted so from a communication standpoint the Privacy is very weak from a financial standpoint the Privacy is not too bad it's an agricultural region historically very subjugated they don't have any banks what they do have is uh a system of trust-based credit um called the Valhalla Network where that you can use to send cash around pretty anonymously um so it's interesting because while I was there we were discussing with people uh to bring cryptocurrency to that region because philosophically ideologically there's a lot of alignment but we were faced with the fact that um in cryptocurrency today and the use of those systems would actually bring um you know would actually uh reduce the overall Financial privacy of the people um so you know all that to say that I I think that privacy is essential because of the fact that it's what um it enables a big degree it enables sovereignty and autonomy I actually believe that sovereignty is impossible in a state of surveillance um because surveillance is what it removes our capacity to implement our own moral and political Destinies which is to say our our ability to determine our own politics so privacy is is a necessary precondition for that um but you know in in our in our current um kind of blockchain Paradigm we haven't we haven't built that in and so the the systems that we do have they expose their participants and they mean that anyone who's who's who's who's using those systems is vulnerable to survey violence and therefore massively be that they're they're the space of activity that they can take uh earlier this year we raised uh 50 million to as part of the Assange there and the mission of the Dao was to free Assange by all means necessary uh and available that was our core mission statement however uh we raised all this money and because of the fact that we are on ethereum and all of the actions of the devil is known and all of the people on the Dare is known everyone who donated is known uh the multi-sig holders are pretty much known or could be uh because of all these factors we were very limited in terms of how we could deploy that Capital uh so this is something which dark fry has been working on a lot we have created um a prototype now for anonymous doubts because we believe that privacy is really what what's going to enable um crypto to take up its political destiny and become a true force of power against uh the surveillances thank you so much Rose um yeah and I'll just share an object level example from my experience being involved in git coin which is that uh there was a Ukraine round on bitcoin grants in which people could support causes related to the war effort in Ukraine um non-military causes and I think that you know creating a blockchain based emission of supporting Ukraine could harm you if you were ever going to Russia one day or anyone who's an adversary of Ukraine and so I've been really a big fan of Oren McMillan and the Macy and CLR fund teams because they've built a quadratic funding tool that has privacy baked into it so uh shout out to CLR funding to Barry White Hat of the Macy team I

from both of you do you think that someone can be both solar Punk and and lunar Punk is it a different of art Aesthetics is it a different of Def difference of defaults um you know can somebody be solar Punk or lunar Punk solar Punk and lunar Punk at the same time uh Manuel I guess I'll go to you first well um if we Define solar punk as a let's say as people that want transparency and if we Define lunar punk as people that want privacy I believe that yes I believe that then I'm both um because I do care about privacy but I will do also care about having public infrastructure transparent infrastructure when it comes to uh when it comes when it comes to let's say things that should be public which is like uh um government making decisions uh government spending funds uh government also receiving receiving money as well uh who is actually coordinating and making the decisions on how that money needs to be distributed I think that needs to be transparent but I also believe uh we need to have a lot of private a lot of tools that can enable us to perceive our privacy so we can and let's say communicate our ideas and also create new forms that might not be necessarily Allowed by let's say governments um so yeah I believe that yes that's the answer for me Rose same question to you yeah definitely um so I mentioned before that I uh I think there's a lot of definitions going on here and there's various branches of of solar punk as there are branches of lunapunk and I happen to represent uh a branch of lunar Punk which I believe is the true Branch but like obviously you know all kind of uh well you know it's easy to say that but uh the branch of solar or of lunar Punk that that I'm on and that my community is on is uh has a is has a very clear kind of definition which is um that it's a kind of revolutionary science fiction so in the same way that solar pump Monk Is about using uh projects such as speculation to imagine a future which is a very clear critique of what we call state-based Society uh so it has a definition of what the state is and um you know it tries to define a Way Forward outside the state so the state as understood by lunar punks it's uh it's largely influenced by archlan and this is a a prototype of civilization 1000 years ago it's a civilizational form that has you know lived lived for five thousand years at various points it's kind of become the dominant civilizational Paradigm and other kinds of civilization Democratic civilization have been repressed um so at the moment of time that we're in we have state-based civilization uh uh at its most extreme and it's kind of combined with technology and it's combined with with capitalism to become like immensely powerful and essentially we Define the state as a system of hierarchy in which the value that's created by Society is taken away from them and used to fuel uh the the used to fuel the state so it's a process of extracting the value created by society and and storing it away in the state so that's the definition of the of the state that leader poems have and lunarbronics are also very interested in what we call moral political society which is the kind of societies that we can create outside the state which is what lunar punks refer to as the external orientation of lunar Punk so you know lunar punks our symbol is the moon this is a uh you know something outside our frame of reference it has like uh um uh a external Celestial quality and so the this is very core to the lunar Punk framework because it's about how do we how do we um use speculation and tactics like speculation to um navigate our way towards an outside beyond the restrictive framework placed on us by state-based civilization so that's why we have science fiction that's why we have you know this kind of alien uh inhabitants because the alien is a symbol of trying to bypass that uh that that cultural impasse whereas with solar Punk and you know I I think that the issue you know the core issue that I have in Solo Punk is that it hasn't properly it doesn't share the same analysis that we have as the inner products of the state so it risks replicating state-based society and state-based behaviors inside of its systems so one evidence of that would be like you know let's let's make everything transparent for example but also more deeply you know the emphasis on on the sun uh the sun historically has always been a symbol of domination you know of of of Monopoly um you just like for example think of the coincidence between polytheism uh and and and decentralized uh environments like forests um oceans mountains uh so so you know there's a kind of a Confluence between geography and spirituality where we see more political societies emerging in these Landscapes with diverse terrains whereas monotheism is something that emerges in a desert landscape so it's this it's this it's this kind of um combination a collision of like the desert and God and man and like submission to God um so so I see that for for me there's an evidence that solar Punk hasn't fully uh it doesn't share our analysis it doesn't share our critique of the state and the evidence of this is in its relationship to the Sun that it upholds as a central symbol yeah I think that uh a lot of people don't don't know what a state means uh because they haven't experienced it themselves um and it's because lack of knowledge rather than they want the state um but it's more lack of knowledge in my perspective uh also in my humble opinion I I think that um that the sun is not necessarily just a symbol of totalitarianism um as you mentioned um as you mentioned polytheism within the Aztecs and the Mayans they actually use the Sun as a form of God but they had also multiple forms of God um so I think that we cannot completely say that one thing is blight or why completely it's just a spectrum and we just need to find ourselves within the Spectrum um but that's again my personal opinion yeah I I I I agree and I think that there's um you know someone made the point of one of the discussions that uh that solar lunar punk are like two aspects of the one mind and I do think that there's something very essential and integral about uh dualism you know like these two if you look at ancient Egyptian myth there's a uh often gods they have counterparts you know so if you've got one God you always have a counterpart um to kind of balance it out so there's like balance and Harmony was considered like the the important thing and and if and also in Psychology this has a big uh resonance because you know one definition of of Madness is when the Mind goes like too far down one extreme and it loses its counterbalance and and so the other side of the mind which has been which has been forgotten takes over and it becomes and the mind descends into madness and I and I do see that um you know the kind of the lunar Punk Insurrection inside of ethereum now as like a form of psychosis that's overwhelming the the kind of mean Plex because of the fact that the solar punks have gone too far in One Direction you know and they've missed they've lost touch with them with this counterbalance in the form of like of privacy but not just privacy but the lunar Punk disposition which in general you know which is more kind of attuned to the reality of conflict uh you know it's it's it's it's more inherently revolutionary I would say uh it's it's more willing to um but again to say you know I say revolutionary the lunar Punk is defined uh the kind of the Revolutionary activity as restoring uh the moral and political fabric of society um so uh restoring the social Fabric and the social nature um that's that's that's what I'll say about that go ahead man I think that that's the probably the the difference between uh let's say what I consider lunar Punk and solar Punk uh and why is because uh there is like this conflict between these two ideas um but in in the in as you said in the lunar punk you see yourself as a more as a revolutionary and I personally see myself as a more as a evolutionary type of person because I believe that uh Revolution means conflict means fight means uh Means War means all of that and I don't want to live in a world like that because I have already experienced that and it's it's really nasty it's really uh it doesn't put first humans it puts first ideas uh against humans um so yeah to me uh the let's say the solar Punk type of uh experience is more uh evolutionary more guided to evolve and and yeah not necessarily create conflict I just wanted to say that like I I it was apparent and you know is a terrible thing and there's there's you know very little good about war but um the the distinction I would make is I would say that we are already in in war we are already at War and Society at large is under siege um and unfortunately you know we're this this is the issue that I have with a lot of crypto is that we're we're very sheltered from this in the west and I think a lot of the people who interact with crypto are very sheltered from this but actually the world is in a state of War it's in a state of Crisis and a state of conflict so you know for me it's not enough to um simply will it to improve uh you know as and and even actually you know so it's not enough to Willard to improve um we we have to uh take we have to consciously engage with this but also Evolution I just wanted to to remark is a violent process evolution is not a gradual Continuum but something that happens in fits and bursts um punctuated equilibria uh so even Evolution itself is is in a state of conflict I agree that we are in a state of let's say War um in in a world right now um but what I what I wanted to say or what I was saying before is that I don't want to leave uh I don't want to leave my daily life in a state of mind of War um why because I have already lit that and it's not healthy at least for myself and I'm not saying that the people shouldn't be doing it or people shouldn't be thinking about it but for my own uh let's say well-being I cannot be in a state of mind where I'm only focusing focusing my attention in war um I want to focus my attention in other aspects like love like compassion and we have seen let's say uh different different let's say activists in the world that have used uh conflict um and that have used let's say peace as a form of as a form of uh protest and we have seen like that that is possible to also uh resolve our problems using love and using uh using let's say peace um and actually elevating people to a higher conscious Consciousness level um I that's my personal opinion and I personally have uh seen that it works uh that it can work but it requires a lot a lot of uh work and a lot of uh let's say willingness to to not uh to not let let's say the forces um basically make you what you are trying to fight against um so like I there's something I definitely agree with you on there which is about um so you know I describe the current situation as society as being in a state of War and you said I don't want to live like mentally in a state of war and I think that's a good point because you know uh I've also lived in in in in war-like scenarios like when I was in rajava uh we were waiting the reason why I went over was because erdogan said he was going to invade and this was different to at the time Kurds had been at war with ISIS um and and rajava had been gaining a lot of territory it had been mostly winning the war against Isis a very different kind of War though in between like um a like asymmetric Warfare with a gorilla Army like Isis and the kind of war that you would have against a nation-state like turkey so erdogan was saying he's going to come in he's going to fill the sky with drones turkey has the most advanced uh drone Warfare or yeah in the in the planet in my view so uh he was going to fill this guy with drones so we went over to uh because we felt that rajava was um a place that was worth protecting because of the fact that it was trying to use a lot of these principles like we have in crypto decentralization you know of freedom and uh and self-determination and put those ideas into practice in a political way in a political system so he said that's worth protected we went over and the whole time that I was there uh The Invasion did not happen but every day there was there was something new in the news like the tanks are lining up on the borders you know like uh oh there was a there was an air Striker like or there was a car bomb or just like something always sneaking in at the periphery this constant pressure and this is a form of psychological warfare and the impact that this constant pressure has on people's minds is like basically twofold it puts them in a state of um of reactive thinking where basically everything is is is short-term you know it's like it's like net has to be done now and uh and there's there's a there's a difficulty of putting a lot creating long-term plans and putting them into practice over years huge periods of time which we actually see that I know a lot now with the Iran situation is a lot of people saying we got to do something we got to do something now you know it's with Sarah what's happening let's let's go let's go but you know the you have to have a long-term perspective and you have to have the patience and the kind of clarity of mind to you know work on these problems for years and not be in this reactive state of like let's just go go uh which is which is you know this is why uh the kind of trap invasion is is used as a war tactic so I agree with you that you know we have to have a mindset which is not under which is not in a state of worth so our our minds should not be in the state of War even though we're in a state of War um and you know I also agree with you that uh you know uh you were saying about finding non-violent means to uh to improve society and I and again drawing from the rajava revolution where uh big Advocates of creating educational infrastructure like economy systems in order to raise the people up you know to have them engaging in for example technology and philosophy and trying to create more enlightened people um and and that being you know the major revolutionary activity is actually you know liberating the people uh kind of from the bottom up and not you know not through some kind of violence um activity so you know I would I would I would say in those respects there's there's a lot of power parallels in in what we're talking about um but you know I guess the the lunapunk would be uh maybe more um uh so like somewhat um realist perhaps or at least trying to be when it came when it comes to the the situation that we're in and then just trying to be you know thinking clearly about ways ahead and maybe having a more more of a preference for uh pragmatic um methods like education over more um you know over things which are purely um uh ah you know just pure kind of art art and stuff not not like just art I find so much of it is like it's just like Rich westerners uh like trying to get like free up their guilty conscience so like I I would hope that I would hope that leader punks like try to try to be a little bit more uh socially conscious unlike I'm like engaged with the the actual World At Large and its realities and I'm not getting trapped in you know a lot of the uh culture of ethereum is is is very much like parties and and kind of um art exhibitions and you know this ICS um as I see as like um what do you call Ted Kaczynski has a great word for it surrogate activities which are detracting from the the overall mission I don't know I think that we need to create a culture here and I think that both are important uh also I believe that celebration is important um because it unites people and bring people together um so I definitely think that uh that we cannot say uh art on and let's say parties and so on uh are distracting us they are also part of growing as a human species they're also part of our let's say Evolution itself and also bring us together uh and we need to find those those places where we can share not only our worries but also share the things that we cherish and the things that we love um so I think that uh both are necessary uh I think that it cannot be completely like white or black it has to be that we need to find the middle ground for everything and also another thing that is important to mention is that actually art has been used uh as a form of expression um and art itself has been used um let's say through history as a as a way to express the feelings of people that might not necessarily know how to express it in writing or or in voice uh but they might uh they might represent it in a visual way or in a audio or in any other form of art let's say of creation and by the way I think that even what you guys are doing is a form of Art thank you uh for that um and you know like definitely there there can be good artists but I just find like if you go to any contemporary art exhibition and I say this having like literally studied art and uh and and worked as a contemporary artist but I just see it as like evidence of um Western decade and cultural degradation and and I see it as very insular and disconnected from the world and like you know uh the The Hunger Games for example the the the top hierarchical world where they're all wearing these like like wise wigs and like plastic skirts and that's how that's how uh the West seems at times and um so also parties you know on on yes celebration Festival it's a it's a integral to human activity and something that humans have done for you know since they were humans uh as far as we know um you know even pre-humans you know like had uh ceremonies um the however um when you go to again like I've been to parties that parties that that I've seen are not expressions of of um of communality or or social connection but they're just like nearest uh like depressing um destructive environments where people with no meaning in their lives go to shake off some of that meaninglessness uh which you know I'm not gonna say like you know like each to their own or whatever but at least from lunar punks we want to create a culture um that is moving away from from those kind of those kind of surrogate activities and trying to give people a place where um that they can they can focus on using their skills and their intelligence their creativity to uh create tools like a really Drive Society forward rather than getting mired in all the kind of um like decadence and and downwards by ireling of Western Society yeah I just wanted to say that um you know I personally recognize uh Art and Science Fiction uh not just as an entertainment but as a form of activism as a form of expressing ourselves um and I think every human being is an artist I think every human being has something to give and something to contribute to society and that's a form of Art yeah that you know if you're willing to loosen your definition I mean I I guess my definition of art is is stricter in the sense that I'm trying to remark on a specific cultural phenomena which is literally it's not even modernism uh like I feel like art has has gotten progressively worse over the last uh few centuries and that at the moment now it's like it's really like the art World itself not art as like a with a capital A but like the kind of the art world as it looks um from as a Westerner going into art exhibitions um again I just see I just see it as evidence of cultural Decline and narcissism and and individualism um you know I think there's an episode of Adam Curtis where he he talks about how um Paddy Smith living in New York in the 70s and she like that the whole scene that they're part of they they stop engaging politically with what's happening and they start just seeing it in purely aesthetic terms like oh look at this like environment isn't there like a weird Beauty to it and they just and they just start like hanging out and doing parties and the um the kind of the political side to Art making at that point was lost and that became the the status quo so I do think it's a way of manufacturing uh like controlled opposition um and you know and actually this kind of connects back to what we were saying about conflict and something I forgot to say which was that the the lunar prone campuses on self-defense so again this is coming from archelon but uh what channel basically says is um you have this state and the state uh extracts the value from society and it separates Society from its power and it does that in two ways first is it uh it it colonizes society's mindset so it it comes in and it starts to dictate how Society shouldn't be inherited organized its values um so Society loses its ability to articulate its own values that's a big part of how the state kind of enslaves society the second part is by taking away its weapons uh so it's means to defend itself from the state uh so this is how the state basically transforms Society into like a herd of animals that they can just like pull around and manipulate uh so a big part of what Luna products are trying to do is in a way re-weaponize Society uh you know not because it loves War because war is something abhorrent like definitely not promoting War but because uh but because uh self-defense is like an essential capability and without that we're like in the same way as without privacy we cannot uh live our own moral political Destinies and actually privacy is a kind of self-defense uh it's you know it can be a weapon in a in a set of tools that we can use in this way so um you know I I think that there's room for societies to make ours when the society is healthy and you know has the ability to have a moral and a political Destiny but at the moment the society is Enslaved the society is at War so personally uh like I put my own art practice aside I decided um some years ago that is not the time for ours uh that maybe there was a time for art and there will be a time for it but it's not this time uh so I put aside the artist and that's where I started you know getting like focusing on programming and because that's where I can see myself delivering value to society and again to me that's a form of art like it's a form of uh expressing yourself um is just might not be the visual way but you're expressing yourself in a new way which to me it's it's art on its own you know and and you're basically putting out there to the world the way that you the way that you see it and to me that's a form of art for sure so coders are artists to me as well so really enjoying the exchange here in the interest of limited time I would love to get us to a place that we're we're sort of converging towards an end of this episode um and and I guess you know the question that I've been been one cast as I've been listening to this back and forth is that um when I was doing my research on this episode someone pointed out to me that they think that like solar Punk cypherpunk lunar Punk Tara Punk they're all moral entrepreneurship in which we're saying that I value X and I think that Society is currently undervaluing X and through my efforts it can be corrected so I'm wondering if we can kind of stick the landing on some of these debates and I'd love to hear what well hey if you agree with that frame which maybe you don't uh what what is X what you know what what kind of world are you trying to create take us forward 10 years in the web 3 Revolution where do you think that we're headed now and where would you like to to turn the ecosystem um and I feel like Manu I've gone to you a lot so maybe Rose I'll start with you and go back to Manu yeah sure um so good question uh I I agree I I applaud the effort to create a definition that is like flexible enough to describe all of the punks and I think it does do that quite nicely like um so if if we're gonna follow along with this definition and say that there's one thing that lunapunk is things Society is missing it definitely is anonymity um and again for reasons that I've stated this is uh this is seen as the in the positive sense of anonymity being a means for communities to Define new moral political Destinies and that sounds a bit uh that might sound a bit abstract but again to you know make a concrete and practical um I really think Anonymous dialers are are going to be the frontier of this uh like moral political expansion of society uh so Society beginning to carve out new zones that are outside the um influence and oppression by state structures and that can live their own um value systems so that's why I'm really excited about what we're trying to engineer now inside of uh of of dark fight and this this world this Vision that we're trying to compose of a like a plural verse if you will of uh a plurality of different worlds in which communities can Define their own moral political Destinies we call that world the Dark Forest um and that's a spin on an existing concept that uh that comes from the the tree body problem um Sci-Fi series and also gets talked about a lot in ethereum but it's usually used in ethereum as a as a critique um against the transparency of the mempool where uh essentially the mempool is transparent which means that you can do Mev and you can Harvest users uh for their revenue that in a way you're this parasitic you're extracting the value created by the user base um so that's that's what's become known as dark forest and eth how we call it in dark by uh you know repurpose this term and and and we said actually forest forest environment is something we want to create forests um you know historically have have often been a place of sanctuary which protects inhabitants and a big example of this that draws on my own background is is in Ireland where the forests were uh the the the the Island used to be covered in forests until fairly recently and the forests were um a large part of what allowed Ireland to resist carnalization and to uphold you know the the previous the Gaelic civilization that had existed there um and as far as we're integral to society they they shaped the the language and that that uh the the written alphabet was named after trees you know they shared the spirituality um which was Pagan religion uh with lots of forest deities and so they had this big impact and they also uh were a place where you can coordinate um and and plot um rebellions against the invading forces and so that was why the forests were targeted by the like colonizing Britain Britain um they were they were they were systematically cleared for a large one of the things was because it was profitable to do so but another reason was because they didn't want uh Irish people being able to anonymously coordinate uh inside of the forests so they cleared them again I really see a Anonymous days and and the kind of uh anonymized landscape that done new kinds of violent Moreland political Society societies to take root uh and form menu same question to you yeah from my side I see short-term um that more governments are gonna try to oppress um uh so they can keep the power that they have um but also I I am super optimistic I see that we're gonna come together as a human species we have for the first time the tools to communicate and to create value and exchange value globally for the first time um and yeah I think that we're gonna let's say evolve and achieve a collective Consciousness that will enable us to understand that um that nation states uh that are basically imposed on us are not the way to go but has there has to be a new form that we create or own and that we uh let's say up team and also have the possibility of opt-out as well uh and that's kind of like the future that I'm seeing and I believe that every single human being is a Creator I believe that every single human being is an artist and it would they will and we will uh understand it and we will see it when we understand that we have the power to create and also the power to destroy uh and we have the we have the um we're gonna have the um let's say capability of deciding what is it that we want to do if it's creating or destroying um and I also think that each of us uh is building pieces of the Apostle and now it's time that we bring all those all of those pieces of the Apostle together um because what uh let's say what a rose was saying I also agree we need that we we also need privacy preserving uh tools um and yeah it's used a matter of bringing all of those forces together and creating systems that as I said before allow us to obtain or opt out whenever we want um but yeah that's that's what I that's how I Envision it I'm very optimistic I think the war is gonna become better than what we currently have because uh I believe in the power of good alrighty well it uh we're just about out of time it's we're a half hour over or 29 minutes over and we got a break before the next half hour I'm wondering if I could get a a final statement or or any last thoughts from from both you Manny why don't you go first yeah um yeah first of all thanks uh for for bringing me here and also for having these uh super insightful conversation um I have to say that many of the principles and the ideas uh the rose Express I also share those ideas um and I personally believe that we need to create more narratives that actually unite us rather than a narratives that separate us and that try to point fingers like oh you did this you did that but rather like finding like the things that uh we're doing bad in the in the whole space and pointing them out but not just to call them out like uh and point fingers but rather to create co-create and build together I really want to invite any anyone who sees themselves as a lunar Punk to reach out and and express uh your opinions on the things that you dislike about the current infrastructure that we have in the space so like that we can build better systems um and systems that are more inclusive as well um I also want to reiterate that everyone has something to give everyone has something to contribute and and yeah as I said before everyone is building their piece of the Apostles on their own and now it's time to bring them together and build together um and yeah that's it thank you again uh Kevin and Rose for this amazing chat yeah so when Bitcoin and also ethereum were first created but most like big word anyway when they're first created um a lot of this tooling around privacy and anonymity didn't exist uh so it's only very recently that we've had the capabilities to actually have for example fully Anonymous smart contracts um so but the time is now like the this tooling has finally become accessible to Developers and therefore it will soon be accessible to users um so I would just uh encourage everyone uh especially solar punks uh to think about like the the Reliance that they're that their engineering has on transparency and the risks that that poses to its user base given the situation that we're in of regulatory conflict um so uh so I would I would just encourage them to that process of of internal reflection um and and because of the fact that ethereum early on and also Bitcoin they made this trade enough and and and it was probably correct at the time given the technical restraints but they said let's prioritize scaling and let's de-prioritize the Privacy aspect and but because of this Choice uh we have had a design space that's developed on eth that is uh completely biased towards uh full information is always available at all times so we have a lot of engineering that is uh dependent on for example strong concepts of identity and but not just identity like which is a big part of the solar Punk uh you know engineering space but also more simply just uh transparent data in general so like known variables the classic example of the amm is the amm which cannot be done privacy privately without some like major uh changes to the design because the way that the Airman is the the mechanism of the amm um is requires you to know the entire state of the program so that means like you need to know all the money coming in all the money going out all the money that's there at all times in order to calculate the price along the curve which is essentially what the amm Primitive is is trying to do it's a price Discovery mechanism in a detailed decentralized way and it's very interesting uh primitive and it you know it's very it's revolutionary in its own right but it cannot be done privately so in order like without significant trade-offs so in order to uh in order to enter the next phase of crypto's advancement where it can actually truly Define its own political Destiny we need to uh Master what we call Anonymous engineering which is Engineering in a context where you don't have all the information and where you can't choose to for example docs in person in order to have a strong concept of identity within your program so we need to we need to change our mindset when it comes to engineering these programs towards a new Anonymous Paradigm so it's a really exciting moment and uh I think you know ethereum has got a great community so many smart people uh but they need to like step up to the reality that we're in and uh and start engaging in Anonymous engineering um because that's how that's where things are headed amazing um I just really appreciated the discussion and um this this podcast has been like two or three months in the planning and I just want to thank you both for not only being so thoughtful but also approaching this from good faith it seems to me like there's a lot to be learned from each other and I just really appreciating the diverging and converging perspectives here so thank you to you both for for the conversation thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
