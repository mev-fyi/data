my conversion to you know the ethos money cult was just as a result of me just comping ethereum to public software companies and ethereum was such a different asset when you compare it to public software companies every single year it's paying 100 of its revenue as dividends to the people that hold it and the people more specifically that stake it when you think about equities you know let's take exxon for an example there is no staking behavior there is no behavior where you say i want to go off and stake this equity and so when you comp them to each other it just becomes a lot clearer that ethereum is an asset that really the world has not really seen before in the sense that it's high growth it's high margin it pays stakeholders in its native asset for using and staking the asset but also you have this entirely other use case of the asset where it's used as money it's used to buy nfts it's used in defy and it accrues yield i think it's just going to be a massive paradigm shift where people see an asset like they haven't really ever seen before and and they might not ever really see again
