hello everyone this video we are going to read through ether a new model for money the first big article that i ever wrote uh and i hope that these uh video readings of these are a useful way for people to internalize articles not everyone likes to read some most people like me like to have the information spoon fed to them and so i'm spoon feeding you this article right into your ear holes and eye holes so here we go this article this article explores ether's role as an asset in ethereum using data from the last two years of the ethereum economy i propose a novel definition for understanding ether the asset bandwidth for permissionlessness inside of ethereum this article is summarized in the following two paragraphs ethereum is a foundation for building an alternative internet-based financial system this financial system has the capacity to be completely open and trustless this new financial system needs a native money to operate financial applications in this new landscape need a trustless form of collateral for their operation and the only truly trustless asset on ethereum is ether as a result of this demand ether has become an economic trifecta a triple point asset satisfying all the requirements that a new economy needs all at once as a result of this ether has become the best model for money that the world has ever come up with if you want to watch or hear me give this talk a 23 minute video at tel aviv ethereal back in 2019 that video is also useful um a lot of this is going to be the same information just in two different forms there are in this analysis in this article there are two assumptions of ether and ethereum the first is that ethereum 2.0 is alive and well and proof of stake is a real thing and eip1559 has been submitted and implemented which burns the bulk of the transaction fee like 90 plus percent and then the remaining little bit is just a tip paid to the validators so this this article assumes that those two things are are working so uh this article's gonna be separated into three categories uh so there's part one there's three parts there's gonna be part one which is defining ethereum uh and then part two is defining asset classes like what are the various asset classes that all assets fit into and then part three is kind of wrapping those two things together so we define ethereum we define asset classes and then we define ether in ethereum you need to start at the beginning right so we need to define the things that ether lives inside of which is ethereum and which lives inside the internet so we're building up to a definition so that's what we're getting to so part one defining ethereum before we define ether we need to define ethereum ether will be defined by how ethereum is used defining ethereum has also been difficult attempting to find to define ethereum feels a bit like defining the internet in the 80s no one really knows what is coming the cool thing about open source technology is that the use and application of the technology evolves and emerges as the community builds and discovers its best use case applications define the internet if you ask google to define the internet you will get this answer a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols personally i don't think that this very this definition is very helpful it is technically right but it is a definition meant for the technically minded if you were to ask how is the internet or how does the internet impact humanity we need to look at what we are doing when we are on the internet for the majority of the time which brings us to these facebook instagram google wikipedia youtube netflix twitch reddit these are the things that we do on the internet this is what the internet is for for us it is how we use it the internet itself is a stack of different technologies with applications at the very top while the internet cannot exist without any one part of this dac is the application layer of the internet that defines how the internet meaningfully impacts our lives all the layers below the application layer are a means to an end to provide products and services to the people so this is a little uh illustration this is the internet network stack this is how the internet is built upon each other to produce the end result which is the browser right the browser is this ui for viewing the internet for viewing the applications in the internet the missing layer value the inner innovation behind the internet was to make data cheap available and infinitely copyable this innovation opened up the world to abundant and cheap information and humanity is better because of it however cheap available and copyable is the opposite of what money and value are money and value are by definition scarce expensive and difficult to access when bitcoin solved the internet's double spend problem it achieved creating internet scarcity for the first time ever when you sent something on the internet you could no longer keep it for yourself however with bitcoin this is only true if you are sending bitcoins the bitcoin protocol only provides scarcity scarcity to bitcoins nothing else this is where ethereum comes in a platform for providing digital scarcity for any digital asset ethereum gives the power of digital scarcity to more than just its own native currency because of ethereum digital scarcity can be made for any asset found on its platform tokenization and the erc20 standard is the printing press for digital scarcity as a result ethereum has become the asset agnostic settlement layer for the internet ethereum exists as a new layer on the internet it uses the communication protocols below it to create a new network that defines how digital value is managed ethereum is the value layer of the internet stack so in this image there is the old tech stack this tech stack that we use when you are using to watch youtube right now and then in this new internet there's this new stack there's this new layer that is being interjected in the middle of the internet which is the ethereum layer the value layer the value transport layer the settlement layer of the internet the value layer of the internet where layer where value is is settled if you go to ethereum.org you will find the following definition for ethereum ethereum is a global open source platform for decentralized applications on ethereum you can write code that controls digital value runs exactly as programmed and is accessible anywhere in the world the applications on the internet define what the internet is likewise the applications on ethereum will define what ethereum is ethereum's application layer the revolution of ethereum is the establishment of a new application layer on the internet the internet of web 2 is the internet of centralized databases and centralized data facebook google amazon and their products represent the big applications of web2 ethereum provides an alternative a new layer a value layer that allows for new applications while the internet of web 2 is saturated and dominated by gargantuans web 3 provides an unclaimed landscape of potential value applications so this series of graphics which actually could be updated because we have two more graphics from ethio network that uh are the continuation of this growth of defy i compare that to the growth of the network of the internet the arpanet arpa arp net back in like the 60s 70s 80s and so like as nodes are being added and connections are being added there's more transactional capacity and one it's transactional via data the other one is transactional via value but the growth looks the same the growth of this network the financial applications found on top of ethereum have begun to dominate the application landscape led by maker dow and the establishment of permissionless stability from dye ethereum's permissionlessness finance permissionless financial network has exploded open finance on ethereum has begun to lock in ethereum as a global value settlement platform the open finance movement that started as a curiosity in 2018 has erupted into what is perhaps ethereum's main purpose a network for permissionless applications and services ethereum's open finance landscape spawns horizontally across the internet of value each application is able to become is able to be composed with others generating generating endless permutations of transactions between each app however ethereum is not a flat landscape financial systems and economies are inherently stratified and ethereum is no exception with the base blockchain at the bottom ethereum's applications have stratified themselves in a way that maps onto the legacy financial system the money is always at the base of every financial system gold is a great permissionless store of value except that it is heavy tangible and capturable ninety percent of the world's gold has been captured by the central banks and the financial products and services below these central banks have all been relegated to the fiat money that central banks put out because of the capturability of gold each financial layer under the federal reserve must ask permission to the layer above it because it's the layer above it that has the money so this image is a example of the stratification of ethereum um at the base is always the blockchain right the the base layer is always the chain somewhere very close to the base layer is maker dao where stability comes from and then we have borrowing and lending services and then we have applications and then we have like the user aggregation layer which is these apps that bring in many many users and they use the infrastructure of apps below it to provide services to their users and then those applications use the lending and borrowing networks which use maker which uses ethereum this image is an image i made that kind of compares these two structures of the two financial systems uh the there's really no reason for ethereum to be upside down or for the traditional um pyramid to be right side up or whatever but it's a it's a stylistic choice that i think represents the differences between these two systems right because you know the the old world is a very top-down system it's a trickle-down economy it's a the the federal reserve manages interest rates to impact the rest of the world in this trickle-down way whereas in with ethereum everything is based off of ether everything is based off of the ethereum blockchain things use the ethereum blockchain as a foundation to move upwards and so it's a bottom-up economy this hopefully illustrates the role of a permissionless programmable store of value money at the bottom of a new alternative financial stack gold is permissionless and so is bitcoin but if the systems that leverage the value of these assets aren't also permissionless then over time they will capture the asset and generate a permissioned system in which rent seeking is enabled the idea here is that if you have a permission list or value like bitcoin that's great but if the institutions that leverage the value in bitcoin are themselves permissioned then we really haven't solved any problems we it's a step in the right direction but you need to have both a permissionless store of value and permissionless applications in order to fully capture the value of a permissionless decentralized world so stitching it together if you have so far believed in my illustration of ethereum thus far here's how i define it ethereum is the internet of value the internet native global settlement layer for digital assets a landscape of permissionless financial applications which together support a permissionless economy so now we're on to part two which is defining ether which requires defining asset classes ether as an asset has been difficult to pin down the maximal flexibility offered by a turing-complete blockchain ethereum means that ether can truly do anything this makes defining it inside of the scope of other asset classes difficult in order to define ether as an asset we need to understand what asset classes are so here's a graphic i pulled from the placeholder blog from chris burniske really awesome article that you guys should read which is linked here in the article i'll link it in the show notes who also uses robert grier's 1997 paper what is an asset class anyways which proposes that there are three asset super classes he calls them capital assets transformable consumable assets and store value assets so let's get into these capital assets are productive assets they are assets that produce they produce a source of value they produce cash where whatever that cash is examples include include equities the main goal of a business is to be just to produce cash flow bonds bonds over time produce cash for their owner rentable real estate you rent out your house you get cash taxi medallions you own a taxi medallion and then you can rent it out you can you can rent it out to a driver who will then produce cash for you all these assets produce cash flow then there's transfer transformable consumable assets which are like commodity assets i call these one-time use assets you consume it and you can burn it and they produce something as a result of that and so the the production of whatever it produces is some sort of economic yield and so for example uh wheat you can turn wheat into bread and bread is better than wheat you can eat bread you can't eat wheat the only thing you can do with wheat is you can turn it into bread or some other product oil you can't actually consume oil you can't do anything with oil but you can put it in your car and your car can take you from your home to your work where you make a business deal or something or it goes into the energy in your laptop which makes allows you to write uh make a youtube video that you can monetize just examples it's and yes and so examples include gold oil commodities or energy really it's energy it's all about energy the best example of a commodity asset a transformable consumable asset is energy it's you use it up and you are better off from the energy that you got from it store value assets specifically cannot be consumed their value persists across space and time and they are scarce examples include gold currencies real estate art or bitcoins this is the most simple asset class but also perhaps the most important these types of assets must be scarce and hard to produce or duplicate or copy they should be desirable ubiquitously across the globe they should be saleable from wherever you are and they are the assets that benefit from global trust in the perceived value of the asset so store value we the best example is gold you can buy and sell gold anywhere in the world art is a good store of value but only in america where there are wealthy people who will buy that art from you if you take your art to india or to some third-world country it's not going to be worth as much real estate really good store value across time really there's always going to be demand for real estate so when we are discussing monetary premium monetary premium is part of the store of value asset classification not everything in that's a store of value is money like houses aren't money art's not money uh but if you are talking about something that does have a monetary premium it is we are talking about a store value asset you may have noticed that some assets fall into more than one category real estate properties are great stores of value but you can also rent them out to generate cash flow likewise gold is an important component in industry products due to its ability to carry electrical signals and its resistance to decay it has also been the greatest store of value humanity has ever seen until now ether all three asset classes ether fits perfectly into all three asset classes depending on the context ether can can be operating as any of the three above asset classes and even all three at once ether is a capital asset in its capital asset form ether is a share of the ethereum network a claim on ethereum's fees and the right to produce work for ethereum so first one ether is a share in ethereum ethereum's network is a decentralized institution the ethereum network produces products and services for its internet of value in it in an attempt to grow its network grow its users and capture more value the better products and services it creates such as maker dow compound dydx auger the more customers there are for ethereum ethereum's customers are both the applications found on top of it as well as the users of those applications for a continuation on this idea watch the next video in the series called ether is equity where i make the claim that ether the price of ether it directly relates to the value that ethereum produces for the world and so that that is the two of three in this series ether is a claim on ethereum's fees in order to keep the network running if ethereum needs to pay its workers these workers come in the form of validators those that make sure that all the user customers are paying by the terms of service of ethereum ethereum's terms of services you follow the rules of the evm you don't double spend if you're following the evm you're following the terms of service these fees are paid to the workers for their labor but also act as a wall that protects ethereum the height of the wall is highly correlated with the total fees produced by the network the height of the wall is the cost of attacking ethereum the right to produce work owning ether is owning the right to produce work and to collect the feeds of ethereum ether is the mechanism for ensuring incentive alignment between the ethereum network and its workers all workers must own eth in order to provide work for ethereum if you want to be an employee of the ethereum network and be paid for your services you must own eth to make sure that you are aligned with the network these are the components that make ether a capital asset when staked ether is a productive asset for its owner ether produces more of itself for the owner that stakes it and does work for ethereum the current east 2.0 spec has an issuance schedule that is dynamic fewer total e-stakers mean that the eath stakers are paid comparatively more this is to incentivize more eat stakers to come and provide security to ethereum when there are more stakers staking their eath ethereum pays each staker less as more total security is being provided and therefore security is not as needed here is the capital asset return rate for those for um based on the different numbers of eth being staked and so what that what that last part was about was talking about the dynamic between the u-shaped dynamic between return and ether being staked if there's not much ether being staked ethereum isn't very secure and so if there's not much ether being staked ethereum is issuing more ether to these stakers as a reward if other people stop staking you get paid more as a staker and vice versa and so if a lot of people are staking people are are being paid less because clearly we don't need to pay that much p that that much and anymore because so many people are staking that the security is really high we can reduce the budget security is low we increase the budget however that's not the only way that ether stakers are paid the above return rate is just for the issuance of new ether ether stakers are also paid as a proportion of the fees paid to the network here are ethereum's top paying users on september 18 2019 so this is kind of old the fees collected are added on top of the network issuance and paid to the workers of ethereum in the 30 days in september 18th of 2019 over a one month period five million dollars was paid to ether validators now eip1559 tweaks these numbers we won't really know what the real world numbers are until 1559 is up and running and we're in proof of stake every all the economics change but the idea is that there will always be customers of ethereum's block space who will be paying the validators for serving that need okay asset number two ether is a consumable transformable asset consumable transformable assets comes in many forms the most apparent asset in this class isn't one particular asset itself but rather a number of assets that produce this thing and that thing is energy energy is a consumable asset that we all use to transform things in the world around us energy is how a raw earth ore turns into the steel inside of a skyscraper or the frame of a car energy is how elevators move people to their office and how we transact and do businesses do business on our computers or phones it is the power behind cargo ships creating worldwide commerce it is the heat in our ovens that turns raw food into edible meals imagine a world without energy energy makes the world go round without energy we would not be able to to turn useless things into useful things this demand for an energy substrate is what gives oil its global value why electric cars or hot topics and why batteries are so god damn expensive energy is the economic substrate that powers the world economy ether is the economic substrate for the internet ether's original definition gas for ethereum illustrates this well this the consumption of ether is the cost of turning the economic wheels inside of ethereum at any time any activity is done ether is consumed anytime an asset is moved a loan is generated an exchange is made a purchase is executed at dow started ether is consumed ether last one store value ether is a store value asset if you've ever paid attention to the eth locked in d5 metric you're paying attention to ether as a store value asset being locked is referring to how it is being used as collateral for something it wouldn't be locked if there if it didn't have a commitment to act as the value that backs some sort of agreement or contract or asset on ethereum ether as a permissionless global asset is the vehicle for generating permissious financial institutions on ethereum we've called these permissionless financial institutions dapps and the economy economic network they create defy or open finance if ether wasn't permissionless or if these open finance applications on open finance applications on ethereum ran on permissioned collateral such as centralized stable coins or tokenized gold then they wouldn't be fully permissionless systems we would have to trust the centralized institutions that issue the on-chain assets that excuse me we would have to trust in the centralized institutions that issue the assets that the off-chain assets are legit and that they will honor the on-chain redeemability thankfully ether is permissionless so we don't have this problem if we use ether inside of open finance hint we do ethereum's first dap make or dao the first app not as first as in first in time but first as in the order of operations the bottom of the stack maker dial is crucial to the development of open finance on ethereum stability is crucial for finance and without a stable reference point to ether many of the financial applications on ethereum simply would not be able to operate platforms like compound dydx or set all require a stable currency in order for their application to function there are plenty of stable coins on ethereum but there is only one permissionless one permissionless one die the only native stablecoin the only stable cryptocurrency on ethereum is the only stablecoin on ethereum and it achieves that nativity by being backed by the only trustless asset on ethereum ether dye achieves its value by the store of value function of ether as well as achieving its permissionlessness from its over collateralization so ether is what makes die permissionlessness permissionless excuse me permissionless stability enables permissionless finance having a permissionless stablecoin is really important in addition to providing a stable foundation to build finance upon if you want the financial structures on top of that foundation to be permissionless you need the foundation itself to be permissionless if all of d5 ran on usdc we would all be trusting circle with their management of our funds dye is the only stable crypto stablecoin that cannot be removed revoked or burned from a user's wallet via essential authority this is why open finance applications can get assurances when building their application with dye if die runs in their application no central party can disrupt the application or its assets and all of this is based off of ether as a permissionless programmable store value asset okay the next application compound compound finance is the borrowing lending application for ethereum it is a financial primitive and a crucial component in the financial stack of ethereum compound is an application that pools borrowers and lenders together and matches the demand and supply of each party with a variable interest rate this produces the die borrow and die supply rates or the cost of borrowing die and the interest received from lending die you can check out rates at loanscan.io compound is trustless because of collateral collateral is what makes compound a permissionless platform borrowers always must over collateralize their loan in order for lenders to be given the assurances they need that there's always money in the bank that is going to be available for them to withdraw in other words trustlessness below is a chart that has two lines in red the total value of all collateral locked and compound denominated in ether in purple the total number of ether locked as collateral so the difference between the purple line and the red line is a uh the difference between being ether as collateral and everything else as collateral so the difference in those two lines is the everything else part there's not that much difference it's mostly ether it's basically all ether the discrepancy between each locked and the total value of locked is a bunch of oh that's a caption sorry ignore that the vast majority of collateral in compound is ether borrowers are locking up eth to be the collateral for their loan in this scenario ether is being used as a store of value asset an asset that is perceived by the market to hold its value across time as the collateral for a permissionless loan this permissionless collateral is what powers the lending side of compound as the compound application ensures over collateralization and auto liquidation of the collateral from borrowers lenders don't have to trust borrowers the compound application removes trust from the equation compound does this via two mechanisms using ether as a store of value and user using ether's programmability to enable trust removed borrowing and lending dydx dydx is a platform for margin trading lending and borrowing doi dx runs on smart contracts and ethereum and allows users to trade with no inter intermediaries dydx provides its services to users by requiring a store-value collateral in order to borrow or trade on margin the collateral could theoretically be anything and dydx has enabled usdc as collateral however as you can see in the chart below the vast majority of collateral inside dydx is ether ether is the primary store value collateral that is used the combination of dydx contracts and a permissionless door value programmable asset like eth enable dydx's permissionlessness and trustlessness as a financial application demand inside of dydx is 94 ether or die and that counts as 90 together that just counts as ether because die is just stabilized ether behind the value of die is because of the value of ether on to uniswap unit swap is one part ether one part any other token in v1 of unit swap all token trading pairs trade against store value ether it's ether's role as a store of value that makes it such a great collateral for all the token trading pairs to trade against in version 2 of unit swap which just came out yesterday from me reading this uniswap will be able to enable any token to any token trading pairs and i'm willing to bet that the next most used collateral inside of uniswap will be dye which is stabilized ether ether is the store of value for open finance 10 years after their inception only one use case for blockchains has been discovered the permissionless management of value across the internet open finance is a new fertile landscape for new financial institutions in the open finance landscape institutions are autonomous humanlessness humanless contracts on ethereum and from what we can see so far in d5 is that they use ether as the underlying store of value asset for their application so here is the the net of all defy applications and there's two lines here again red and purple red is the total amount of value locked in defy and then purple is the total amount of eth locked in d5 and so you can see like it's all ether the whole thing is ether there is a small difference that is not ether that a decent amount of is die like greater than 50 percent somewhere between 50 and 80 and then the remainder is stuff like usdc or rep or mkr and you know rep and mkr get their value from it being a cash flow service that uses ether as their the cash flow so it's all ether it's all ether while i expect further assets to be able to come to open finance and act as collateral such as more centralized stable coins golden vault securities treasuries bonds etc i expect ether and die will remain the significant majority of collateral for open finance applications open finance applications that leverage ether and die are retaining full permissionlessness if the open finance applications use off-chain trusted assets then they are acting as a hybrid open finance application with trusted assets which is fine it's totally fine i love to see that happen but i also would love to see fully permissionless applications that leverage the trustless eath and trustless die which brings us to ether the triple point asset depending on the context ether acts as any of the three major asset superclasses staked eth is ether as a capital asset consumed ether in a transaction is ether as energy either as a consumable transformable asset or ethe loctin d5 which is eth as a store value asset ether is the first asset to ever transcend all three asset classes this is a this is great for ether money is something that is by definition flexible money is what you need it to be when you need it to be that thing and ether fits into all three major frameworks for what a valuable asset should be the story doesn't end here however the triple point is a reference to thermodynamics in thermodynamics the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases i mess up that that sentence okay the triple point is where you perfectly balance pressure and temperature for a particular substance so that the liquid solid and vapor phase of a substance all intersect uh and so here is is this going to turn into a gif um unfortunately not uh so there if you go to youtube and type in triple point of water you will see people's cool different science experiments where water is boiling freezing and being liquid all at the same time on the same spot it's really really cool super fluid collateral in open finance okay so this is getting to the point where we're illustrating how this is how ether is being all three assets at the same time and it's a lot of this came from dan eliter's inspiration super fluid collateral and open finance so i definitely recommend that as a read so what happens when collateral becomes liquid okay sorry i'm just kind of catching up with how this got here okay so yeah again check out dan's article then this is kind of referencing what dan was talking about in his article so here's what dan was talking about you can put ether inside of maker dow to produce dye then you can use dye and ether to be collateral inside of uniswap inside of the dye ether trading pool now uniswap puts out a token when you add liquidity to uniswap you get a token as a receipt that represents your claim on the assets that you deposited and so for ether and die you get this token back and people that are using unit swap to trade between ether and die are paying fees into the pool right and so ether is acting as a capital asset there after it's also acting as a capital asset inside of staking so it's acting as a capital asset inside unit swap as well so it produces this token and so then you can put that token in theory inside of compound and then you can use that capital asset store value inside of compound to act as another store of value so the main point that dan was making in his article is that the ether locked inside of uniswap generates a new token that represents its value which is then re-locked inside of compound the same ether that is collateral for unit swap is also collateral for compound i'm sorry i'm skipping ahead here okay and so you use that new unit swap token in a compound to act as a store of value to lend out and you get a loan of die based off that collateral but you could also do it in reverse where you can lend that uniswap token that receives fees into compound and receive fees in a token that receives fees and so now we have this store value plus a capital asset that is being lent out and returned in fees which is acting as a capital asset squared and so this whole and while this is happening we've made eight transactions the ether has gone into maker dow to produce die that's two transactions ether and die are both submitted into uniswap which is two more transactions and then that outputted what is output is another token that represents a claim on that which is another transaction we put that token into compound and another and alone comes out a compound and all these things are burning ether as a as energy in the ethereum network and so all this is happening at once and so this is how ether is acting as a capital asset a consumable transformable asset and a store value asset all at the same time because all these things are happening all at once and this is just one example uh you can you can talk about any number of other d5 or open finance applications and you can go through the list of like okay here ether is acting as a store value but it's also collecting fees and it's also being staked and it's also and it's also and it's also and because things are super fluid as dan calls it in ethereum all these things can happen at once so why is this significant ether is the first asset in history to operate as all three asset classes asset types as ones why is this neat what does this mean so here's the model for the that that here's an a model for the us economy we have the store value dollar you have the irs which collects fees to pay for the security of the network and then you have the capital asset which is the bond market the the treasury bills currencies are great stores of value assets nation-state currencies are designed to hold wealth across time however they could be better at this as many bitcoiners will point out currencies are the trust vehicle for communicating and transacting value across space and time the us dollar has been the most successful currency of all time and it is the store value asset that dominates the world economy u.s treasury bills are the foundation of the u.s bond market the bond market is perhaps one of the greatest economic forces in the world as it enables the market to express its trust or distrust of a government ability to repay its debts bond market yields are the fundamental risk-free rates provided by the u.s government with your store value asset the u.s dollar with a promise to return your u.s dollars with an extra percent in interest the us government then uses that value to secure the u.s economy taxes are how the u.s government pays its debts and funds new endeavors the irs represents the entity that collects fees based off of economic activity to support the u.s economy the taxes collected partly go to the holders of u.s treasury bills as is the revenue mechanism for paying the interest owned by t build holders in theory the u.s government also pays off t build holders via inflation of the us dollar reducing the dollar strength as a store value asset which is why crypto is cool in the first place something we should never forget ether and ethereum follow the same model this same structure of an economy is found in ethereum as well however this time it's ether at the center of it all and it's ethereum as the economic system so ethan finance is the store value ether staked eth is the capital asset and gas is the consumable asset so bringing it all together at the heart of ethereum is the infrastructure needed for generating an entirely new economy this time the financial services inside this economy are entirely run by code completely trustless and permissionless and is on the internet now that we have this new economy we need a new money to run inside of it if we want to retain the trustlessness and permissionlessness of the ethereum economy we need a trustless and permissionless currency and the only trustless and permissionless asset in ethereum is ether which brings us to ether's role in ethereum ether is bandwidth for permissionlessness the demand for and use of ether inside of ethereum is a function of its demand as a permissionless money inside financial applications there is a finite amount of ether in ethereum meaning that when ether is locked inside an application the application is using up a part of the total sum of ether applications compete for ether collectively using a portion of all ether and ethereum this is what we are calling eth locked and defy or why we think ethan defy is important it's also important to know that when an application like maker dao is using 1.3 percent of all ether and 1.3 was when i wrote this article it's now at 2.3 there is 2.3 less ether on the secondary market that is available for other apps now if this was the us government and there was demand for dollars and dollar price was going up because some application is you sucking up all the dollars the federal government just prints more but there's no printer there's no money printer in ethereum that doesn't work that's the fundamental to the value proposition of cryptocurrencies is that as demand for an asset increases there's no more and so instead of new ether being minted the price just goes up and so this is a reference to economic bandwidth which i'm about to get into and so at the time of writing and these are old figures i need to almost triple these uh maker dow was using one point three five five percent compound point four three percent dydx point one percent units what point zero five percent the total bandwidth of ether that was being used by d5 was two point one percent i believe that number is now like four percent ish um and the bandwidth i'm using is referring to each locked and defy or how much eth does this application need to serve the use the service users right now bandwidth usage is pretty low there's a lot of room for application growth and further eath capture with the current market price of eth however if we want more dye to come into existence it's going to need to lock up more ether to generate that permissionlessness each die one die requires 1.5 dollars worth of ether to support it and if the demand for compound loans increase compound will require more ether collateral to back those loans same for dydx if unit swap grows in volume and liquidity it will need more ether and more dye in to add to these liquidity pools all of these things and all the other divi applications that have come into the network since writing this article all of these things require a portion of total ether representing the usage of ether as bandwidth as a permissionless currency so how do we grow the bandwidth the at day one of the internet the bandwidth was awful we were selling sending kilobytes over the internet and it took hours now we can stream netflix on eight different tablets in our in our home wi-fi it's not a problem how do we get there how do we how do we scale if the old internet is all about data and the internet of value is all about value how do we scale the new internet well that's that well that's what we're about to talk about ether has plenty of bandwidth for the current state of ethereum the market cap of ether is 20 billion at the time of writing while total value locked in open finance is 600 million we currently have the bandwidth we need to achieve the current needs of the users however ethereum as an economy leaves much to be desired if we want ethereum to be the global financial platform for the internet the internet of value the global anal global settlement layer for all digital assets and we want this to be a fully permissionless trustless settlement layer then we need ether to scale to larger numbers trusted finance and permissioned assets are welcome on ethereum they have their role and function in ethereum all the same but the real revolution is totally permissionless financial applications that operate using totally permissionless money anything else is a compromise there is 1.7 trillion us dollars in circulation if we want to host those dollars and all this economic activity on ethereum ether price needs to increase by 85 times so that we can have those dollars be represented on chain if we want synthetic stock market assets if we want to host the stock market's activity in a trustless and permissionless way we need to have those assets with ether collateral so we need ether price to go up by 4 000 times in order to host that value the global monetary supply is 90 trillion dollars if we want we don't need all of that all that money supply it'd probably be more efficient if that money supply was reduced maybe cut in half but still if there was if we want 40 trillion dollars of global money on ethereum we're going to need ether price to go up we're going to need a bigger ship and ether price goes up going up is how we get a bigger ship if we want to onboard the next 1 million or 1 billion users to ethereum ether will have to increase in price to support the economic activity required by the permissionless and trustless financial applications that are serving this growth in people so how will it actually scale how will ether price go up it will just magically go up automatically kind of and i'll explain why the three-way tug of war here's my model for understanding how ether will appreciate and this is the fundamental value proposition for ether so this is a three-way tug-of-war between three different components one of the first component in no particular order open finance attracts eth open finance applications provide products and services that require ether lockup collateralization powers trustlessness and ether powers trustless defy defy applications will create valuable services for ether holders that convince them to lock up their ether inside of the application to access the product or service maker dial compound dydx uniswap more useful applications more reasons to lock up ether the continuation of this paragraph is the third in the series ethereum is an emergent structure so if you want to continue this particular line of thought about how d5 is this massive single structure that sucks up eth that is the article for you that is the third in this series so that's uh that's ethan d5 that's this tug of war right up here second again in no particular order the eth stake rate the alternative to locking your earth and defy is to stake your eath the eath steak rate offers the risk-free rate or maybe the trust-free rate for ether holders if you believe that you can receive a better return on your eath by staking it then you can by locking it in defy then the east stake rate is your incentive to stake the eth locked in defy and the east staking will constantly be fighting over eath people will look at defy and be like what kind of return can i get on my ether and defy and then they will compare it to the east stake rate and they say well how much is the east stake rate giving and can i beat that and defy or can i not and these two incentives these two gravitational pulls will fight over people's ether notably the more ether that is locked in defy the better the east stake rate is if defy continually convinces people to not stake and instead supply ether to defy well then the east stake rate according to the algorithm the issuance algorithm is going to increase its issuance to stakers to further incentivize security and so the more people don't stake the more lucrative staking will be so the more ether that's locked in defy the more lucrative staking will be and lastly the thing that balances everything out is the us dollar price on the secondary market both of the two above forces pull on the u.s dollar price if defy is fighting for eth and if the stake rate is fighting for eth then there's less eth available on the secondary market the only mechanism that the us dollar has to generate its equal and opposite pole on the above two forces is to increase in price the u.s dollar value of eth is a representation of the cumulative forces pulled by the e-stake rate and the products of d-phi if d-phi and e-staking have successfully pulled ether off of the secondary market then in order to get the ether back on the secondary market the ether price must go up and so you can think of this as ether actually leaving or you can think of the same amount of value is still on the secondary market but there's less ether there because the u.s dollar price has gone up so maybe maybe the the market cap of ether on the secondary market has gone from you know 10 of ether so 10 million ether there's 10 million ether on the secondary market um but then ether locked in defy and ether being staked goes up up up and maybe there's only five million ether left on the secondary market so that's less ether on the secondary market but what if ether price went 10x and because of that and so there's half the amount of ether left on the secondary market but there is 10 times as much value on the secondary market and so um you know you you net those things out and the secondary market becomes really really liquid even when there's less ether there which is how ether is going to bootstrap itself into real world money but that's a different topic so these things happen which is fantastic because it means that as open finance becomes more useful the price of ether should scale alongside it to match the demand the higher demand open finance generates for ether and the better the e-stake rate the more uh the the more these things pull on the price of eth which increases the bandwidth of ether and open finance and therefore the security mechanism that supports the open finance economy all these things are stitched together all these things are one single structure they all relate to each other and the u.s dollar price doesn't stand a chance as long as d5 continues to generate more financial applications on top of it it's going to make the ether stake rate more lucrative and so you don't even have to believe in d5 to have exposure to its growth if you are staking your ether as proof of stake and defy is providing all these products and services for other ether holders who are not staking so you can instead that's just good for you because then you get the higher stake rate and the only people that lose are the people holding dollars on the secondary market who have to up the u.s dollar amount to convince that ether to come back to the secondary market these things are going to happen automatically and i'm looking forward to watching this so this is the first of three articles that i've kind of bucketed together in my mind it's not the only articles i'm going to read and put on the bank that's youtube channel so please listen to the next two they are linked in the show notes and they are the continuation of this this whole idea this whole journey of defining ether and defining ethereum this is just the first one uh it's kind of the one that sets the foundation however so it's really important uh so please subscribe to the bankless youtube channel please subscribe to the bankless podcast give us five star reviews on the bankless podcast follow us on twitter
