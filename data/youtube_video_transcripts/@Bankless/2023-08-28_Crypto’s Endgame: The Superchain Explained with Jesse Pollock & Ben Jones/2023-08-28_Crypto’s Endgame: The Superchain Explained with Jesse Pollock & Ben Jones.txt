but Ben you just introduced a a newer structure which seems to be a composition of many chains and you called that a super chain okay so super chain how does the super chain idea tie to what Jesse was saying earlier of getting a billion people on chain it like how important is the structural element well they all come through independent chains like just paint the picture of how this new structure will impact the future here welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless we have two guests on today and there's two parts to this episode the first part talking about base the second we talk about the super chain what is base bases coinbase is Layer Two we talked to Jesse the creative base about how the launch went this is now two weeks I think something like that there's almost a million users already and there's more transactions per second on base than the ethereum mainnet this chain was of course built using optimism's Tech stack and we think this is one chain of many thousands of Layer Two Chains that we'll see in the coming years and so how do we tie all of these things together we have Ben Jones on who is a co-founder of optimism to discuss that that is the second part of this episode where we discuss the super chain this seems to be the key to how we bring on a billion people on chain first we talk about the law of chains which is a constant Institution for uniting layer 2 Chains that's the social layer of the super chain the second part we get into the technical chain hopping today is very clunky it's kind of painful feels like a border crossing how do we make all of this feel like one chain finally we end with the question of fraud proofs how decentralized is the optimism Tech stack today can coinbase goink your funds from base we don't have fault proofs yet when are they coming we discussed that with the two guests I think one theme throughout this episode is it's becoming clear that ethereum is more than just a digital Nation it's a substrate for building networks of digital Nations and this for me was the most interesting part of the episode David why is this episode significant to you I think the super chain is so cool I think it's really emblematic of what brought you and me and so many others in the bankless nation into crypto the conversation of the super chain is one that is about cryptoeconomics it's about political philosophy it's about coordination and the relationship between the individual and the collective I think a lot of the subjects matter that we have explored here on Bank lists is all being comprised in this super chain conversation it's not just about the technical hurdles that come with wanting to to allow for ten thousand change to Blossom and then figuring out how to blur the lines the boundaries between 10 000 chains to make them seem like one seamless super chain it's also about the coordination incentives of people joining a digital Collective how do we actually convince people to come into the fold or how do we incentivize coordination rather than defection how do we get large centralized institutions like coin base to cooperate and to coordinate with decentralized Dows that I think this this is uh what we've been training for quote unquote Ryan when it comes to exploring so many different facets of what makes crypto crypto and this is why the optimism super chain conversation and really the whole entire optimism Endeavor has always resonated very very deeply with me this is one of the I think most important conversations that we've had in a long time and perhaps will have if the optimism Vision does manifest especially the super chain Vision which is being validated by coinbase and bass I think this is the substrate for a change in the whole entire world and so that's why you can just hear the excitement coming out of me right now yeah I I think the whole time for me I was like uh I can't wait to get to the debrief because I want to discuss this like a lot of ideas bouncing around in my head that I want to talk to you and of course the debrief is the episode that we do and record right after this at the episode that is available for bankless Citizens on the bank list premium RSS feed you can access that now David I want to talk to you on that episode about this idea of the super chain the United chains of optimism is that what we're creating here how will other layer twos respond well they have their own United chains I think so a lot to discuss there and before we get to the episode first we disclose both David and I are long-term layer two bulls you know that you know we hold eth as well we're also advisors to optimism we're long-term investors we're not journalists we don't do paid content there's a link to all

am extremely excited to introduce you to Ben Jones co-founder of optimism and also Jesse Pollock the creator of bass Ben Jessie both of you welcome back to bankless so glad to be here thank you Jesse just two weeks ago base launched and coinbase has been putting a ton of weight behind this launch both with marketing and promotion not just not just internally to the crypto world but also externally as well which is great because we could use some external uh marketing of what we're doing here in crypto and I would say I've put this tweet out not too long ago after base launched perhaps one of the most successful protocol launches that the crypto industry has seen seemed to go off without a hitch so two weeks later now we're recording this two weeks after base launch how does it feel it's just like thoughts Reflections sentiments emotions dump them on us well I mean first off it's just been awesome to see the response from the broader World about what we're doing with bass um you know I think when we started thinking about bass we kind of had this vision of bringing a billion people on chain bringing the whole world on chain uh and then as we got closer to launch I think we started seeing a lot of organic energy around it happening this summer her and when we were launching base we wanted to throw our weight behind that we wanted to join the party we wanted to kind of meme this on-chain summer meme into existence and I feel like that's kind of what's happened and so I feel incredibly grateful for everyone across the whole industry the ecosystem um kind of like believing in that future alongside us and throwing their weight in throwing their energy the optimism team like everyone you know I think there are hundreds of teams that have kind of come together to make this happen so I think grateful is the primary feeling that I have the the other big feeling that I have is it's day one like this is this is the very beginning of what is a long long journey to bring billions of people on chain and so um I think our feeling is like awesome we're excited we're excited other people are excited but our heads are like already back down and we're just focused on building focused on making it so that folks can easily build the next wave of applications on chain so that folks can easily use those next wave applications as they're being built and really doing everything we possibly can to Shepherd in the next era of the internet so I'm grateful and back to building Ben what was it like on the optimism side of things for for base chain which is you know not enough not the optimism uh main net it's its own independent uh ecosystem but it's also an OP stack fork and this has been a very long partnership between optimism and coinbase so how how is it like to view these things from the optimism side of things yeah no I mean and the partnership is deep I'm sure we'll get more you know a lot more into that later but you know similar feelings of excitement and gratitude you know I think for the optimism Community like this is just an incredible proof point for positive sum in action right where like the proliferation of chains like bass is going to what we're going to see is that it's not just a bunch of users hopping from chain to chain to chain to chain it's going to be more users joining from Every Chain from Every Which Way and every Dimension so you know I think a feeling of excitement for the future and like some of the next steps of like positive some thinking for the collective are at the first you know like the first exciting moment of this um obviously the other one is incredibly happy with like the code and the tech working you know like uh we've been working on the Bedrock code base which is like what enabled base to be able to go from zero to 100 real quick um for a while and so it's like absolutely incredible to see that now not in just production on op mainnet but in production on another chain getting massive usage and and holding up real well and you know shouts out to the the base team for all the engineering that went into getting that chain running um but from a fundamental core protocol level that's incredibly incredibly exciting um so yeah we're I mean it's just like hype all around you know what I mean the future is looking bright I think some of the excitement really comes from the clarity That Bass has provided a lot of the crypto world with what really the next steps for crypto looks like how are we going to scale ethereum what does it mean for layer twos to scale uh and I think a lot of this uh excitement comes from just the fact that we see the next steps forward we see where coinbase is going we see where layer twos on ethereum are going and that gives us a lot of excitement because we can actually plan ahead and see some of the future at the same time it also brings up a lot of questions and I think a lot of these questions exist inside of the the super chain what actually is it and I think that's a lot of the questions that we want to ask here on the show today because I think they spawn the the asking of that the answers to that question comes with some of the formations that coinbase and optimism have created together and this is a case study for perhaps future examples and so I think this is what I I really want to get done here on this show is start to peel back some of the questions behind the collaboration between coinbase and the op Collective and what that mean might mean Downstream and how that might be emblematic of the future roadmap for ethereum scaling and also onboarding the world into crypto so I hope I can lead us in that in that conversation I really want to start with um this this broader question bass is a part of optimism how does that work an important part of the story is the collaboration between coinbase and optimism and so I want to ask first Jesse why is this collaboration so important for coinbase what does this collaboration mean from the coinbase side of things yeah absolutely and before I answer that question I do just want to like emphasize what you said which is it feels like we've gotten more clarity about where we're going and for me it feels like just in the last three months like no one's even transacting on ethereum anymore everyone's transacting on layer twos like we weren't there six months ago or 12 months ago but now like every day when I look at my transaction history when I look at other people's transaction history it's like people are doing way more on L2 whether it's nfts or D5 or social than they are on L1 and so I feel like we've kind of spedrun what I think a lot of people were nervous about which was like is transaction activity gonna move are people going to get comfortable with this transition and now it's like oh yeah yeah these things are here so anyways I'm just really fired up about that it feels like we've taken a huge step forward as an industry um in terms of the collaboration and optimism you know when we were starting to think about building base um we'd actually looked at building a chain twice before um and both of those times uh we we consider building an alternative L1 to ethereum and we kind of ruled it out we said no and the big reason we said no was that um we didn't want to isolate kind of ourselves from the broader crypto ecosystem and it felt like if we were going to build our own chain that was the result and we were going to be putting ourselves on the island we were going to be disconnecting our users we were going to be taking them away from what has historically been our mission which is bringing them into this Global crypto economy that's way bigger than coinbase and so as we were thinking about building base I think the things that really kind of enabled us to get comfortable with that and get excited about it for two things one is we felt like we could build as an ethereum layer too and that meant that we would be bringing our users our energy to scaling what is the largest crypto ecosystem in the world by far um and what we believe is kind of the foundation for the Unchained global economy and then two as we kind of zeroed in on how do we build an L2 and we realized we could be working really closely with optimism we realized oh we could be building on an open source technology stack that's a public good that's freely available so all of our contributions would be uh kind of a creative and and additive to everyone else in the ecosystem who was using this technology and we could be a part of a structure was actually bigger than just us I mean this is where this concept of the super chain comes in I think we kind of convinced ourselves that layer 2 wasn't going to end up being just one chain but instead that it was gonna be many chains that kind of collectively scaled ethereum and having a substrate in the op stack um having a a kind of organizing body and optimism that could help bring those layer twos together to create something that collectively scaled ethereum while making that experience really really easy to use for everyday people giving developers the kind of confidence to be able to move across a bunch of these different uh chains and kind of in general shepherding this next era I think that felt like uh like another big kind of unlock for us and I'd say the the third the third thing was when you think about coinbase um and you think about our strengths uh really it's you know we have scale we have users we have kind of this massive brand that you know I think in many ways is kind of the strongest brand in crypto but we're also a large Center public company and so as we were thinking about okay how do we build a decentralized open permissionless layer too and uh like do that in the right way having a compliment someone who could really kind of counterbalance us and be kind of a pair to bring strengths that we don't have like decentralization like open source like on-chain governance I think that's all kind of components we found in optimism and it made it just a very logical kind of fit together of the the coinbase and base team and the optimism team in broader effort with super chain so Ben Bass is not the only op stack chain that's dropped it seems that we kind of get a new OP stock chain one or one or two a week lately we have the public goods Network there's Zora Sello D Bank mode just to name a few but the problem that it rises here is that all of these op stack chains are their own chains they are Forks of the op stack and the optimism Vision has always been one of a singular coherent Network and so we have this concept of the super chain but if I'm on the optimism main net and I want to go over to base I got a bridge and and so I'm wondering about like how we actually go from point A to point B how do we go from many different Forks of the op stack to an actual cohere Network because right now like the op Collective is just like Adele and so that's not doing much for coherence of all the users who all the users of these things so how do we actually get from the forking of the op stack to actually a single year a singular cohere Network where does this story start yeah I mean great question and I think I would Echo exactly what Jesse said in terms of clarity I think like the one thing yeah Jesse I hope this resonates with you for both of us in working together and forming a partnership with like each of us realizing what the other person's role to play was and like understanding how the pieces would all fit together you know like the role to play and the collaboration and the agreement yeah and and just in general like what what does it mean for decentralized governance of a standard what does it mean to be a centralized party like coinbase which has incredible strengths strengths and bring those into the decentralized context like yeah absolutely I I just like time and time again right so I mean look I'll back up until a little bit more of the story right is you know at the last Devcon like a year ago right Carl got up on stage and we talked about the op stack and he said hey guys there's this thing called the super chain now it's going to be a bunch of tank chains working together right and it's always been clear that to scale ethereum we would need to have some notion of multiple chains at least in terms of like the underlying data structures that we envision as a chain you know I think in the future a chain is going to look more like a smart contract or like a sub ecosystem or a you know social you know fabric more than it will sort of a religious ecosystem like you've seen with Bitcoin or an altel one or ethereum but uh that's all great you know to say but but there's a question of what what does it actually mean and like what are we gonna do about this and what is the path to get there right and so when we put on the op stack you know like you said David like the momentum has been incredible it feels like every week now someone's not coming out with a crazy new OP Stacks thing right but this begs the question of like what does it mean to have a bunch of these chains and what do we gain and what do we lose and certainly we gain a lot of innovation but we do risk losing some things you know it's like a really good problem to have right but there are there are certainly challenges that come with getting a bunch of chains and Jesse alluded to what I think is one of the most substantial ones which is basically that you need a way for these chains to basically align and share improvements with each other right so one of the failure modes that we could see would be a proliferation of chains right op stack makes it really easy to spin up in a chain if you can click a button and deploy a chain then you can modify the chain click a button and deploy that modified version you could quickly Envision a world which led to you know fragmentation where basically a bunch of people were working in different silos and making their own improvements but because of a lack of standard there's no way for those improvements to be shared between chains and like talking about positive sum and public goods right like that's kind of table Stakes to be able to have that kind of positive some collaboration to make this all work um I think the other side of this sort of on the flip side is that you also are presenting users and developers with a real challenge of now there's a bajillion chains to deploy to and what does it mean and you know if you look at the scaling ecosystem today for a developer or a user making a choice on where to deploy or where to bridge there's a lot of idiosyncrasies and a lot of different uh uh you know security models and patterns and idiosyncrasies of how the evm works of how you Bridge all these things are good in terms of innovation but they are dangerous in terms of overwhelming users and developers with choice so basically both of those perspectives are pointing at the same thing which is that there needs to be a shared standard even if there's which there absolutely should be a ton of innovation on top the core standard protocol that is like the best in class thing that everyone can use and everyone should use needs to be standardized so um that's a bit of a ramble but that is how I we think about unifying chains like ultimately we can talk a lot more about technical specifics and sequencing and crazy things at the end of the day it's about having a standard that benefits all the people that are building chains so they can all share in their efforts and having a standard that allows users to make an assessment that is not on a per app or per chain basis it's an understanding that this is their accepted you know properties of the decentralization so if I'm understanding this correctly maybe the op stack is the basement level standard that is being accepted by all these various chains right and the idea of the optimism vision is to actually make that standard grow based off of the shared consensus what are the shared attributes of every single op stack Fork well if they're focusing the op stock fork and then they also all incorporate this one additional property maybe that one additional property needs to be merged into the main op stack code base is that is that how you envision this moving forward yeah I optimism governance is basically being a vessel to facilitate those positive sum Integrations right you you need some like you basically any change that someone makes to a chain that is really really good everyone should be able to take that and run with it but it shouldn't come at the cost of a terribly fragmented ecosystem where users are overwhelmed with and developers are overwhelmed with choice of where to deploy and the idiosyncrasies and security models um and basically the developers of the public goods are faced with just like a flurry of 100 different repos all with their own little differences that they're trying to reconcile into one thing so uh I want to ask the question is something you you said earlier I think is really interesting Jesse and uh both you and Ben and I think all of crypto are kind of working towards this this is um the idea of bass is a you know kind of day one in this attempt to onboard a billion users into crypto and uh get a billion users more than into crypto actually on chain okay and that's really cool and um I want to dive into this uh super chain type concept because part of the question is okay how do we do that right now we have bass and I know it's quite you know uh quite um speedily reached over a hundred thousand I think users like different active accounts I don't know what the numbers look like today yeah how many is it how many users right now Jesse uh I was looking I think in terms of monthly transacting addresses we just crossed like 700 000 or something like that so you know those are addresses not not users I mean we don't you can't directly connect them but um it's a lot so the hundred thousand I mean I think like the hundred thousand number that was just like daily people who are coming back daily and then yesterday which was pretty cool we we crossed the number of uh we had more transactions than ethereum which I I kind of I expected it to take us maybe like six months or 12 months or something like that to get there and so to kind of cross that milestone in two weeks was um kind of mind-blowing absolutely I mean that that's amazing growth and amazing progress right and probably I mean I don't know how many years it took crypto to reach those numbers uh the kind of the numbers that that base saw in just like two weeks so our Cycles are accelerating here which is absolutely phenomenal one other thing that I'll say is base cross number of transactions that ethereum did and we were just like just over I think we were like whatever 16 transactions per second and ethereum was 12. yesterday was also the the largest number of all L2 transactions and it was 5X so ethereum was at about I think like 11.7 and all l2s were at like 56. and so if you look at that chart of L2 transactions that is probably like the most epic growth chart I've ever seen in crypto because it's so consistent it's literally like two years ago if you go back two years in time we were at 1 100th of the number of transactions on ethereum I think it was like one tenth of a transaction per second and now we're at 5x the transactions on ethereum and that is just like a straight line up and to the right or like a log whatever uh exponential line offer to the right and you know that's a huge shout out to everyone you know obviously the optimism team in op mainnet and and also like Arbitron and ZK sync like there's so many people who are coming together to to embody this vision and I think we're just excited to be a part of it okay all right so so we've got um traction uh so far and I want to get back to this idea of of the the super chain because I have a feeling it's going to take more than bass to onboard a billion uh users even though they're we're making you know great strides here and I'm interested in something that Ben said about kind of this the structure that we now have right if you think about like you know the human body or all of these structures that underlie you know systems of Nature and that sort of thing you have cells which are you know one set of of structures and there's a lot of complexity there and um like independent uh an independent system working together and that kind of composes up to like the organs and then you have an organism and then a group of uh human organisms compose a society right we have greater and greater complexity in our systems that are stacking what's kind of interesting about the concept of the super chain is it seems like we're introducing a new structure into crypto right so we have like this structure of the chain you know first there was Bitcoin and that was the original chain right so we have kind of like single channels and the chain single cell organism uh and then we got a you know multi-cell kind of organism maybe with uh ethereum and smart contracts and oh here's another structure that we didn't know we could do it's a programmable chain we have this new structural system element called smart contracts and then birthed on top of that we have a smaller atomic unit called kind of a token and now with layer twos we have this idea of chains right and so base is maybe an example of one of those chains there's all sorts of op stack type chains out there but Ben you just introduced a a newer structure which seems to be a composition of many chains and you called that a super chain okay so super chain how does the super chain idea tie to what Jesse was saying earlier of getting a billion people on chain it like how important is this structural element well they all come through independent chains like just paint the picture of how this new style texture will impact the future here yeah so I mean a few things to be said there I think um I love the I love the life analogies and the shout out to the bank listing both you and David are so good at the life of the slime mold and the collective anyway I love one of the one of the great other things that we see there is the notion or another great thing to talk about is the notion of emergence right which is the notion that that basically like smaller parts come together to form a hole that is greater than their sum right and I think effectively the super chain you can think of as the emergent structure that will emerge from chains like op mainnet and bass and Zora and others coming together to form something that is more cohesive and looks more like you know the third wave of the internet right it's actually very similar when you look back into early days of the internet right there was a notion of like networks and everyone kind of thought of like there's a network that this company has and then there's a financial credit network over here right and eventually what happened was that the internet emerged which was basically just saying okay sure there are individual networks but they're all also connected in This Global Internet that is changing the world right so you can almost think of the super chainus analogous um to that practically speaking what are the properties that I think should have or like what does that look like you know one of the things that you said and I was touching this before one of the things you said earlier David was you know sort of this is fulfilling the vision I think one of the core aspects of like fulfilling the vision of scaling ethereum that you know we've had for many many years at optimism ethereum is like one cohesive thing and there are sub ecosystems and communities but but ultimately when you think about using ethereum right you're thinking about one decentralized platform that you can understand and wrap your head about and reason about right it should also be the case that these chains should be a part of one larger system that in the same way you can wrap your head around right and when I say wrap your head ultimately what that is going to boil down to is like the properties of the block space themselves so we're not fulfilling the vision of ethereum if we scale to a billion users which to your point will require you know thousands millions whatever have changed it it's not enough of all those chains are like wacky all over the place some of them are centralized some of them are decentralized some of them make these assumptions some of them make that assumptions and there's no way of understanding what's up ultimately what we need is like a consistent substrate for us to build this new wave of the internet on and basically what we've come to realize with the super chain and with Incredible folks like bass is that the basis for doing that is basically a bunch of chains that share upgrades right so I think probably when you were asking questions about things like um you know how do these chains talk to each other and you still have to bridge right there's a lot that we could get into there on like technical specifics and if you want to dive into ask ask away ultimately I think what we've realized is that for any of the crazy technical future stuff to work that makes These Chains all really feel like one chain the basics are that we need to have an environment where a bunch of the chains that are forming today uh are are effectively governed and upgraded together because the block space is homogeneous so Ben trying to get down to the actual practical details of how a super chain comes to be and how 10 000 chains Blossom without creating 10 000 choices for users I see this conversation unfolding in um two um different domains one is the social and then one is the actual technical like technically how do you get one transaction on to happen twice on two different chains and have that be like obfuscated for users but I I want to start with social because I think the technical one is um uh the more hairy and so I want to leave that Beast for further down into the podcast so socially let's define this why does a chain want to be a part of the super chain what is the incentive for a chain to join the collective what's in it for the individual chain to join the collective chain yeah so I mean it's interesting because that answer will surely change over time on the social layer but I'll talk about our on the technical layer right but I'll talk about the basics is again the substrate of the future of the internet is it needs to be standardized and it needs to be understandable right so the simplest reason to do this is because it should be the security model and the construction that we as a community like think upholds the rights uh and the protections of the users and the developers and the sequencers on the network fundamentally there needs to just be consistency across that space obviously there's going to be incredible Innovation and that's going to happen constantly and we need a way to get that Innovation back into the standard like we were talking about earlier but the fundamental social basic is just getting to his point where we have a governance system that says that all of this block space together is going to work the same and it's going to work the Best in Class way that everybody needs to so socially I think the first step is basically just understanding the homogeneity of block space and the reality is before we solve bridging and we make make it so that you know users are transacting seamlessly between chains and people don't even realize what chain they're on the place to start is nothing more than they don't have to think about what they're bridging to and from because they understand that the properties of that chain those two chains are consistent and something that they agree to you know I think the homogeneity of block space is probably a really good foundation to to start with say we have you know a 10 15 20 op stack chains and they and they all have homogeneous block space but we also still want to encourage Innovation and and differences right and so I think this is when we can get into the the law of chains because what actually what actually sets the standard how does the standard become set so maybe you could walk us through this uh law of change concept and what that does for the formation of the super chain absolutely very very very excited about the law of chains so and and I think it's also great because what's fascinating is that this is like the law of change is a fundamentally incredibly important social construct okay so first of all what is the law of change the law of chains is a governing document that is a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the optimism Collective so that's our governance system our Dao um and it is basically the governing document that will adopt all of those constitutional principles into the land of uh of multiple chains right so you know the past you know year and a half of optimism governance has all been about Op mainnet with the introduction of base and other chains we've got to change Kyle Optimum missing governance uh Works basically and particularly the way that we're going to do that transition or the thing to understand about that transition is that optimism governance goes from governing upgrades of a single chain to governing upgrades to a protocol that are shared by many many many many many chains so right the way to get that homogeneity is to have all of those chains basically share the protocol and it's that protocol which gets upgraded right so that's that's that's a very important basis for what we do with the law of chains now the law of chains itself goes a lot further than that and it basically is a framework um for how optimism governance should behave neutrally and how to enforce the neutrality of that block space and oh and I also want to say a huge shout out to the base team among others for you know massively collaborating with this like like I said it's been absolutely incredible to have like these things realized and put into writing as we in these these Partnerships um so okay actually I'll pause there I can keep going into ramble mode does that does that make sense I think that's the most fundamental nugget is we're gonna go we're going from a world where uh optimism governance governs op mainnet to governing a protocol that is used by op mainnet but it's also used by bass and all of the other chains that join and this gives us the homogeneity Ben when when I hear you say that I'm trying to uh again because like my brain just works on analogies and maybe some listeners are are kind of like me right and so you know David asked this question earlier of like what's in it for a chain to join the super chain and that seemed pretty obvious to me based on something you said earlier it's kind of like that's like asking why a local area network that a company set up wants to join the internet right well the answer is obvious Because the Internet is just fantastic and you can communicate with all of the other local area networks right and that you know so everyone is going to opt in and join unless you're doing something super you know secret uh and uh you know you don't want to interact with anybody else so that to me is is obvious now I'm trying to get like the analog of how you actually join the um the super chain and what this law of chains is and it almost to me it feels like one part standards body so it's like some kind of technical standards by body that you're opting into you're like yep I'll agree to conform to a set of like you know their internet did this in the early days like we got a set of Internet Protocol standards and we all conform to that so we can talk to one another so it's one part that but then it's one part like governance nation state thing and it almost reminds me of like um the Articles of Confederation when you had like the original 13 colonies in the U.S who that were independent uh you know States essentially nation states band together and create this document that they all signed to form a proto-union of types so it's like one part standards body and that's Technical and geeky and we've seen that before in the early days of the internet and then another part governance experiment thing and we've seen that in almost like the birth of nation states and to me that is just so fascinating do the do these um like analogs hold up to you or you know are you seeing some of this one of the key I mean I'll draw on the analogy further and you're 100 right and I think the only thing that I would say or add to what you're saying fundamentally is that the standards body and the governance experiment are really one it was all the same thing all the same thing all along okay exactly exactly right so it's like part of the governance experiment is that it's governing this standard right and that makes it a standard spotty um but you're 100 thinking about it um the right way I think one of the fascinating um one of the additional things that the law of change says I kind of got into the basics of like fundamentally it's about being a standards body but what the law of chains really in bulk talks about is what does it mean to be a standards body and like how should the Dow and the governing system react to that and so one of the key things that it does is it basically a lays out a set of all of the stakeholders across the super chain so an example of a stakeholder is um Jesse and bass as a chain Governor which are the people that are you know basically bringing These Chains into existence and driving usage to them and providing with distribution and all that right there's actually another role which is the chain servicer right which is the person that's actually providing the sequencing Services which right now is also uh based for for base um but for other chains there are other people that are basically like roll up as a service providers and so that is another stakeholder that governance needs to think about and then of course the most important set of stakeholders are the users and you know when I say users I mean both users and Developers and one of the things that the law of chains does is it basically lays out protections or guidance for how the you can almost think of it like a Bill of Rights and this is why this is where I was going with the analogy is like I think if you want to go to go the whole like founding document analogy thing there's something really similar there in the in the the Bill of Rights um and it basically lays out what are the protections when governance is making decisions about uh the standard it should think about how decisions impact each of those stakeholders and and um okay I'll I'll I'll pause there hopefully that's resonating we can talk about some of those like protections and guidance and I'm also curious if you have perspective Jesse um but yeah I think the analogy is a great one it's like part standards body part crazy digital Nation thing um and it all comes together with some real Beauty so wow yeah I think from from the base perspective as we were kind of working through this and contributing to law of chains and thinking about kind of how we join the super chain there are a few things that we were trying to solve for um one was how do we ensure that base remains open and permissionless um and how do we ensure that it kind of preserves that characteristic which ethereum started for us block space and this was something that we felt like we could get kind of from optimism and from the law of change it's like if we kind of set up the chain in the right way if we commit to this thing um then we're going to have kind of a forcing function to ensure that uh you know we don't have kind of single person in control in a way that could risk that open permissionless nature of base and so I I think that kind of characteristic is one of the big things that we're getting from the super chain now on the flip side I think one of the things that we thought a lot about is how do we while kind of ensuring that that open permissionless nature of base is enforced also preserve our sovereignty you know like we want to be a part of this larger structure but we also want to have economic Sovereign we want to have social sovereignty we don't want to be completely subsumed by this superstructure and so that's again where the law of chains comes in and it says Hey like even if we you know are enforcing this open permissionless nature of you know the block space we're not going to infringe on these other characteristics or these other kind of areas of sovereignty like economics or governance that are really really important to protect for chains and kind of going back to your now a kind of analogy with the Articles of federal of Confederation I forget what it's called um uh you know I think that that's a similar kind of tension that you see in unions like the United States and other unions around the world where you have these kind of local regions that want to have some guarantees you know whether those are guarantees of protection or you know you know rights for Citizens so folks can move across those regions and know that they can have kind of a consistent set of expectations regardless of where they are and those local regions you know the states in the United States that they want to have sovereignty they want to be able to set their own taxes they want to be able to have their own governing bodies they want to be able to vote in their own ways and those two things need to live in tension and I think that's kind of the tension that we are trying to capture in this law of change we're trying to capture the tension between the fact that this is many kind of social systems and and groups that are coming together to create something bigger than any one of them and that requires alignment it requires coordination but it also requires software entity and like one thing I'll say on this is you know me and Ben and you know a bunch of people we spent the last nine months thinking about this and trying to figure out like what does this mean like how does this work how do we kind of uh articulate this in a way that people can understand and articulate in a way that can you know persist for years or decades or centuries right and what we've kind of released thus far is the V 0.1 of that it's first draft right like an optimism team to release that we we contributed to it um and it's not truly not perfect and we do not have all the answers I think what we're trying to do is we're trying to believe that this is possible and we're trying to take kind of all the brain power of a bunch of really incredible people across a bunch of different diverse organizations and say what would this look like and then we're putting it open to the community for feedback and saying hey come and tell us like what's imperfect what can get better and that's why we're on this call right now because we don't have the answers we just have the best intentions and the best effort that we're putting into it and so I guess like there's so much complexity here but if I could kind of leave one message with people who are listening into this is like get curious ask questions like engage with us help us figure out what is the right version of this and how do we make that something that can both support this kind of homogeneous block space this consistency so that users and developers can build with confidence and and transact on chain with confidence but also protect the the rights of those folks and protect the rights of change and protect the diversity that comes with that and I think you know it's going to be a learning process but super grateful to be getting to work on it and getting to talk about it the tension between the sovereignty of a chain and the alignment of a collective I think is a really great articulation of this and I and you see the same pattern throughout history this is the tension between defection and coordination and the balance between the individual and the society where the best societies allow the maximum expression of the individual while also ensuring that there is a rule of law that there isn't things like murder and theft and lying and cheating but there's only the minimum level of law needed to produce a society and then after that it's up to the individual and this is what I see forming in the super chain where we are establishing quality assurances of block space while still allowing for Innovation and freedom of expression of protocols to be expressed by all the different chains that elect to join the super chain now that last phrase elect to join the super chain is I think the Crux of what optimism's role is the op Collective is I'm sure optimism wants everyone to join the the collective but right now Jesse as you know perhaps less than one percent of the world is not on chain and we need that to grow to at least one percent so that we can get to 10 so that we can get to a hundred percent and I think this is of one of the biggest parts of this story is that coinbase is blazing a 17 billion dollar public company-sized hole through the jungle that is the path towards becoming on chain and so I'm hoping you can take a moment and like talk about the way that coinbase is actually showing a way for very large public companies that aren't on chain into getting on chain like what what is the formula that that coinbase has provided the world here yeah yeah and you know I think again we're still trying to figure it out but you know for the last two years you know at the end of 2021 that was the mission I set on it was how do we bring coinbase on chain so that we can kind of show the world what's possible here um and uh you know a lot for coinbase has been you know building base and and contributing to this I think um as we're thinking about how we build base uh we're making a number of commitments that uh kind of guide how base is going to be built and how we're going to come on chain um one of those is obviously contributing to kind of the underlying op stack uh and so we're joining we've joined as a core developer and we've already landed a huge number of positive changes from scaling to decentralization to monitoring we're working on off breath which is the second client with Paradigm and we're going to keep kind of like blazing that path so that the foundation of the op stack is something that other organizations whether they're public companies or small private companies can use to run chains uh you know super chain or not so that's the big way that we're trying to kind of pave this path it's like make sure that the technology is really solid the the second big way that I think we're trying to pave this path is we are committing base to this law of chains we're joining um and we're saying we're going to uphold that commitment around open neutral block space um we're saying we're going to participate in this Collective process of bringing chains together to create something that's bigger than just base but is this full super chain and we're saying that we're going to participate in that kind of governance process to make sure that the standard is maturing in the right way to make sure that that neutrality is is being upheld in the right way um and I I hope that's going to pave a path for other organizations to similarly make that commitment and similarly benefit from those guarantees of the law of chains and The Sovereign in the absolov chains um and then I'd say the the third thing that um we're really doing is we're putting our money where our mouth is we are actually taking a percentage of the revenue from base and the sequencer that's been space and we're contributing it back to the optimism Collective to fund public goods and that's going to enable us to actually support the work that's happening to make this infrastructure be possible for everyone else to use and we're going to be participating in governing that as well so you know I think for kind of us this is about doing this in the right way so that other people can say oh this is the right way to do this we can follow that path we can also fund this public infrastructure we can also opt-in to open neutral permissionless block space we can also contribute technically because at the end of the day we think that those are the things that are going to ensure we have the decentralized open foundation that enables us to have an open global on-chain economy that brings a billion people in and increases economic freedom everywhere plus plus yeah I mean plus one with everything that um that Jesse was was saying and I think um I just want to take a moment to express my gratitude for for you Jesse and and the rest of the base team I think like you know if we were looking back in the very early stages of this partnership there was you know talking about this balance between you know like sovereignty and you know collect and the collective um that only works if someone actually wants decentralization right and it could totally have been the case that coinbase jumped in here and launched them L2 that wasn't actually planning to be decentralized and was just like some sort of meme land grab thing and so I I think it's like a testament to where we are like that basically Jesse and the rest of the basically Jesse and the rest of the base team um like actually are putting their money where their mouth is and like building a decentralized thing so yeah I'm just I'm just grateful for that I thought I'd throw it out Jesse you mentioned that uh bass is going to be part of optimism governance because it's part of the collective so it's going to participate in governance well just what does that look like to you like what what is that actual like base and the optimism governance what does that relationship look like yeah absolutely so alongside the revenue contribution or the sequencer fee contribution that we're making uh to the optimism Collective we're really grateful that base is going to be receiving a grant uh that we can earn out over the next six years um that will be up to 2.75 of the total supply of op tokens and we're going to be using that to participate in governance and this grant is being kind of uh rewarded retroactively for the contributions that we've made thus far and then we'll be earned out over the next six years for the contributions that we make to the super chain going forward and what we're going to be doing with that is we're first off going to be capping our overall governance participation and so we will never be voting more than nine percent of the total votable Supply that ensures that base doesn't have too much of a voice in optimism governance but we kind of preserve the decentralized neutral characteristics of that body and then we're going to be working to apply hold this kind of neutrality commitment that you know the super chain and the law of change is making we're gonna be working to ensure that the right public goods are funded and we'll be working to do that in a way that's aligned to the community and so um we're actually just starting by listening uh we've had some experience participating in decentralized governance with ens but we've taken a lot of learnings from that and we want to take a lot of learnings from the folks in the optimism ecosystem about what they've seen work what they've seen not work and so we're starting by listening we have a forum post up that's going to be kind of asking for folks for feedback we're talking with delegates and if folks have perspectives on how should base participate in this process we'd love to hear it and then over the next few months as we listen as we learn we'll be sharing out kind of clear perspective on how we're going to participate going forward to make sure that we are really like living up to the best of what's possible here anything else to add there Ben um no I mean I think the only thing I would add is like this is yet check another box in exciting Uncharted Territory that we're doing here together with y'all having a Fortune 500 participating in the Dao is incredibly incredibly exciting um so appreciate the thoughtfulness that you're bringing to that and I'm looking forward to the future of that that would be awesome so Jesse you said uh over the the next six years two point seven percent of the total supply of op tokens uh is that like a linear vesting as in like every single day linearly vests and so it becomes available to coinbase uh over linearly over six years is that the mechanic um it's not daily but yes that's the mechanic okay not daily but effectively the same okay cool yeah yeah effects of the statement there's Milestones that we have to be heading along the way basically in order to do that what do those Milestones look like how what are those parameters uh it's basically following through on the commitments that we're making so we have to continue contributing to core development uh we have to continue joining the super chain uh participating in the security Council basically fulfilling on these commitments that we're making around Technical decentralization and contributions there uh the law of chains and the the kind of commitment to that overall and then participating and being an active Governor uh in the optimism governance body basically being an aligned chain and a lined player being in a line chain the line player and continuing to provide value to the overall Collective and support of the public goods that are making all this possible positive some baby yeah pause the song but you know when we when we first started thinking about optimism uh and thinking about kind of building on L2 in general um this wasn't a consideration for us and actually when we launched the test net this wasn't a consideration for us we hadn't even had a conversation really about like what would this look like from a kind of governance participation perspective it was really only after we launched the test now we started realizing hey there's like a really important opportunity for us to contribute here that we have this conversation and figured out how to make sure coinbase could participate and so I think that's really reflective of like this retroactive model that optimism has been pioneering like we didn't say hey we need this in order to use this technology instead we said hey let's go use the technology let's go show that we are good stewards that were ready to show up they're ready to do the work and then through that contribute Fusion I think we realized hey there's actually a lot of value that coinbase is adding here has added already and that base is going to bring over the next decade and let's figure out how to align those incentives so we can continue bringing the best of Base to the optimism Collective to the super chain and ensuring that that's kind of uh happening in perpetuity are you a metamask user well you're listening to bank lists so of course you are the

here and then I think David maybe wants to Pivot to Tech um but before we do I'm going to attempt to kind of summarize this so I I just feel like I got some uh breakthroughs in the conversation that we just had and I want to try to summarize this so one thing I'll just say is we keep referring to this law of chains okay and um we we talked about that you know my analog for that is like Articles of Confederation for the 13 colony colonies think of like a constitution so the law of chains is an actual draft of a document that chains opt into and we will include a link to the law of chains you can read the document it protects rights for different groups right covered participants users chain Governors chain servicers talks about user protections right so when Ben says kind of a prototype of a Bill of Rights it's kind of it's kind of right and here we are this is the Continental e-congress like we're figuring out so this is version 0.1 and there's going to be a version 0.2 and a version 0.3 that's what we're actually talking about when we say the the law of chains is you're opting into a governance Collective you're also opting into a technical standards body if this is how you're going to implement the chains so that is cool I guess the part that this also unlocks for me is I think um probably two years ago if you you asked me what ethereum is I think a mental model that Dave and I have had is um is a digital Nation we'd say it's a digital Nation right I'm starting to get the feeling that maybe ethereum isn't so much a digital Nation and it's more a platform for launching digital Nations okay so what I see in sort of the um the super chain and this whole Collective that we're building is ethereum is basically the infrastructure to launch this Confederation of States this confederation of chains essentially right and uh so optimism and the op mainnet is kind of a lead organizer of this confederation this loose config Confederation of chains and then base is opting in and more will join and you can fork and it so I heard a politician this morning talk about like you know uh this is a new moment for America you know it's 1776. I actually think he's right it is 1776 but for digital Nations like because we've just created the superstructure for launching these new social experiments and it's it's incredibly exciting uh for me to see now I guess one question may be um that's lingering in my head to sort of tie this off and then we'll get to Dave and we'll talk talk on the technical side of how this all comes together so is the super chain that optimism is creating it's kind of a law of chains is this interoperable with other infrastructure that is being developed in other chain ecosystems so we look at other layer twos like stuff that's going on in the in the world of ZK EVMS and we look at like our arbitrum are these distinct separate silos are these also interoperable uh with with uh optimism I'm trying to get a sense of whether um this is kind of its own unique uh I guess digital Nation over here and this is the optimism digital Nation we're going to have other digital Nations like the arbitrum digital nation and and you know maybe the the ZK sync digital Nation all of these other systems or if they're somehow tied together as well what would you say to that Ben yeah it's a it's a really good question um I I would say a couple of things I think I love the whole digital Nations coming to life thing I totally love that I also think it's digital Nations all the way down like I think we could absolutely think about bass as a digital Nation as well right and like probably that like that like one-to-one thing that we were talking about is really going to extend many levels down right so like ultimately you can imagine a big tree structure of like Nations on Nations on Nation you know and some in some weird sense right so coordination all the way down yeah right yeah yeah so so yeah I mean that's the first thing I want to say is like I love that analogy and I think it's just like you can draw that analogy all over the place and none of it is really long it's like different layers of nesting and how we're going about it um I would like to think that what we've put out with the law of chains is a Innovative step in governance that we haven't really seen historically that puts into practice a lot of these analogies that we're trying to get at um so I think that's very exciting and I'd like you know I think there's some ego you know a little bit of ego left of me that would say yeah this is new and exciting and its own thing at the same time I think what you know everybody is going to converge around this around similar things to this so I think we're just first not not last and then in terms of actually like the boundaries between um between different chains right and between different super chains if you were right fundamentally um the evm as a substrate is just about the most interoper it's like one of the superpowers of the evm I think that's actually slept on a lot of ethereum is not the it's not just the decentralization of it it is the interoperability of it and the the ability to extend it and interconnect it so I think whether or not like it we make it explicit the way that different chains are being connected today is a train that's gonna is a trend that's gonna continue and so it's definitely the case that we'll see you know optimism super chain bridging get better and better and better between from from optism to some other you know some polygon or whatever right at the same time what we're doing here with the block space homogeneity does afford uh in the long run technical advantages that allow you to do that interoperation in a fundamentally like more secure more decentralized way that basically comes from it being a standard right so if you want to have two chains talk to each other and it's not guaranteed that those chains stay in sync and like one of them might do an upgrade that breaks the interconnection in a way that the other one can't do right then that does pose challenges and like people will continue to overcome those challenges but at the same time that homogeneous block space property I think I believe will make it uh will be a stronger connection within the boundaries of individual super chains um because of that shared standard and because of the on like the homogeneity basically one last topic to make sure that we touch on before we go to the technical details about how these lines between chains become blurred is the 15 fee that goes to the optimism Collective uh Ben why does the optimism Collective get to charge a 15 fee and where is that fee going to go to public goods funding I mean you know Jesse talked about this like first of all I having a fee I think is a huge win for sustainability because it completes the part of the picture that maybe we didn't previously had right so zooming out when the optimism Collective was birthed right we made it very explicit that our mission was here to fund public goods sustainably right and at the time that story was very clear you had we had a chain it was called it was op mainnet and we committed to those fees being used to fund the public goods that produce it right and we've done you know two rounds of retroactive public it's funding I could go into a whole rigmarole about the mechanisms leaving that aside one very exciting thing that we have here is that uh the narrative extends to multi-chain now right because the question you might ask is okay well you have op mainnet but when a bunch of big people go and Fork you then aren't you going to lose the sustainability because those other chains aren't contributing back and so just logistically one of the key components to talk about is the fact that because we can embed a fee into the standard right then we can tie the sustainability together in a more fundamental way with that being said I want to call out some very important caveats one caveat is that it is incredibly important for the collective to provide additive value and not coercively extract right so it's very very very important I I I for us for our values in a way that goes way back but I think also equally important um quite frankly for this whole thing to work is for the ability for Jesse and I just in a room and go okay well coinbase could take this code and run with it and go some go do something totally different that the ability to do that will massively legitimize anybody that's going to opt into some system right it's much I think just legitimately stronger for a super chain ecosystem to say the tech that underlies this is a public good it is given away and the only reason for you to join and pay a fee is because there's an additive value that is going to be provided to you so I think that's like you can think of it almost as an accountability but that's an extremely important piece that I think is worth bringing up so the the way that we say this on Bank list is the freedom to exit is always a check on the power right and so the only reason why a chain will join the collective is that if the 15 fee that's being charged we produces more than 15 of value for the change that join it otherwise they'll just fork and leave yep and so all that so that funding should go back to public goods funding right because the people paying will benefit from the technology stack constantly improving um the only other thing that I want to call out um is that uh we have a notion in our public goods funding of like the scope which is basically like what is the set of public goods that Optimus is meant to fund and I think another key part of this is in a chain like base joining we need to expand the collective's model for what public goods we fund to include those public goods that are beneficial to base right and repeat that for any other chain that's joined and so this will also help make it more compelling so it's not just about funding public goods if you're a chain that is contributing value to the collective the positive impact that public goods have on you should be rewarded just like you know the op stack itself so I'd like to get into some of the technical details as to how the super chain actually for homes because okay we've got we've say all these uh organizations that have forked the op stack recently they all desire to be a part of this super chain they face very clearly and has stated that they desire to be about a part of the super chain but there's like 10 other op stack Forks that I'll desire to be a part of the super chain so we'll just we'll just imagine the future where this um law of chains is adopted by all of these op stack forkers and so we do have homogeneous block space but that doesn't produce the super chain that is just producing the foundation for the super chain to emerge we still have a bunch of other technical hurdles that we need to get across because you're still going to have to bridge between chains we're still going to need and this is me putting on somebody else's Dev cap things like cross chain Atomic execution cross chain messaging cross-chain transaction calls and so Ben I think for like the idea of the super chain super chain is going to emerge it's going to be this one network of interconnected blockchains it's going to be great it kind of feels like that uh draw the rest of the owl meme if you're not if you're familiar there's like a four four steps of drawing The Owl and the first step you draw the first two circles and then you draw the second circles and then third step is just like question marks and then the fourth step you have this beautiful completely constructed owl and like we're missing a step maybe you could like fill in the rest of the owl for us like how how technically does the super chain actually emerge yeah I mean I love that I love that Meme that is hilarious Meme and that's a good analogy to the question that you're asking I I do I do think that um the power of homogeneity is not to be underappreciated and I and I think the more time that we spend on it the more we we've realized that that's like the table Stakes for anything else so like that homogeneity property like in the owl meme right you draw the circle in the other Circle that's missing a lot of steps but it is the right two first steps that an artist would actually do enjoy the owl so like we're starting with the right thing and we think that like it's table Stakes to have you know basically homogeneous box place that upgrades together to be able to upgrade together into something that's more interconnected um and even that homogeneity on a technical level will bring I think a lot of things to the table that are that that people don't appreciate um you know one example of this is Integrations like I talked a lot about application developers you know having idiosyncrasies idiosynchronousies to pick between chains there's a whole Suite of of tooling like um you know infrastructure providers like inferior Alchemy um there's like your block explorers Etc et cetera et cetera a shared standard and homogenous block space will also make it a lot better be to be able to get all of those Integrations to happen right quite candidly if you're making a change today I like one of the hurdles is definitely bridging and getting that set up there's an equally big part of it which is the huge amount of developer tooling that's out there that that um that you need to integrate and being on a shared standard allows us to integrate that shared standard and get those Integrations everywhere okay anyway so I I'm just homogeneity is great and so I'm just like re-emphasizing like let's not undersell that concretely what needs to happen um for us to bridge these things more and more together I think one of the big steps uh next steps is just going to be not even solving the bridging problem in terms of like some core technical improvements to bridging to the bridges but it's basically just like making it really easy for users to Bridge and transact across chains like like the whole notion of switching your your RPC provider and going and changing the metamask uh you know Network and then like hitting going to some Bridge website and going and bridging and right like even without some even just using the core underlying tooling that's there like one of the first things is just going to be make that really easy right like people should be able to go from op mainnet to doing you know the next basement an on-chain summer in a way that does not feel like they're like switching between you know two two worlds right and like crop you know it's it shouldn't feel like a border crossing um so you know that'll be one of the first steps and and you're right uh the next ones are basically like um shared sequencing which basically gets you the ability to uh sequence basically gets the ability to include two transactions on the same chain on two different chains just sort of in the same spot um and that's that that's one step along the way and the ultimate final boss of course is um is not just which which to which that is prerequisite um is is like shared uh execution or like cross chain atomicity so basically the ability for one transaction to be executed and like do everything that it does that you can do in a Flash loan between two contracts on ethereum between two chains and that's going to be sort of the final boss of all of this it's gonna be a long way to get there like I said we have drawn the correct circles for the owl for now and we actually think that those circles are much more valuable than the you know the owl analogy um but we'll continue we'll we'll continue to get there until it's all one giant homogenous evm magic land so maybe to frame this in a timeline that many ethereum people will be familiar with from 2015 to I would say 2019 was ethereum research and development phase where we had the north star of what we wanted ethereum to be but turns out things like proof of stake and sharding were more Concepts Concepts more than they were actual engineering challenges and then in 2019 to 2020 we had ethereum 2.0 Serenity arise and everything that was researched and development just turned into just an engineering challenge where we knew the path we just needed to code for it where would you say the super chain is on this timeline oh man that is a toughie that is a toughie I think um let me think about that I would say candidly somewhere in the middle that's a really it's a really tough one to answer um I've been really pleased um by the progress of decentralized sequencing protocols this has been something that's like been sort of on the protocol back burner for a while in some sense where like ultimately the L2 construction can train constrains the sequencer a lot so decentralizing the sequencer isn't the top priority now that that sack is maturing there's a lot of people in the community building decentralized sequencing and I think and and shared sequencing and I think we're getting an increasingly good handle on that so that's definitely like leaving research uh territory and like entering real implementation territory like for example espresso right now is working on a on a on a leader election prototype for the op stack um as a result of a a grant from the optimism Foundation so I think I think that's all getting figured out the final boss of like Atomic execution and how to coordinate all these sequencers in a mass thing together isn't perfectly solved there's still a bit of research going into it but I think all the foundation like is being laid before our eyes so I don't know maybe not the most satisfying answer um the next steps are clear you know I don't ask me to commit to an engineering timeline come on now oh I wouldn't I wouldn't dare but maybe maybe I can ask you about an engineering nearing uh timeline on this next question which is going to come to the conversation of fault proofs now fraud proofs and fault proofs are the same thing for the bankless listeners maybe Ben will talk about why optimism elects to call them fault proofs um but why doesn't optimism have fault proofs uh and so maybe we can talk about like what what are the security assumptions of a chain that does not have fault or fraud proofs like can base yoink people's money like what are what are the risks being uh behold beholden to the user in the current state of the optimism ecosystem and then also where is where our where are the fraud proofs where the fraud proof's been the fundamental question at hand um around the fault proof thing is um really a broader question of like what is the development like what is work in progress what is complete where is the stack app right and through that broader lens I'm incredibly incredibly pleased with all the progress going down right now um so Bedrock which is like this the code base that enabled bass to go in less than a year from like zero to like there's a whole pardon my French there's a whole chain going on here that's incredibly exciting and doing record-breaking numbers right so to get us there was the Bedrock release and I think I don't know how many months ago it was uh now that that I was on here talking to you guys about bedrock um but the first thing that I want to say is that that release we actually view as a big milestone towards fall proofs in the first place because basically if you don't if you missed that that episode what what Bedrock was was basically uh ground up rewrite of all of the things after years of running out pumena that we would realize were broken and needed to be improved and there's a whole host of I mean I could talk about the modularity of it the minimal diff I think there's actually a whole argument uh that not an argument there's an entire point about um the security of a better Rewritten code base being better in all sorts of other ways than just this one dimension of fall proofs but fundamentally we viewed that as a prerequisite uh or as this next step in the journey to doing the fall proof thing in the first place and I can talk about some of the specifics why later um but fundamentally like yes is it true that some of the folks that were working on Bedrock like could have like there was some opportunity cost that we could have kept with the old um you know op stack that was pre-bedrock and like had some weird kind of version of fault proofs on that um that would totally be possible but to us getting Bedrock was like the next step along that journey and so um yeah we're there okay we'll get back to the uh fault proof conversation with the op stock in a second but uh Jesse just want to talk about the risk profile of Base uh base without fault proofs because since base is part of the op Collective and it's been having all the homogenation of the block space because optimism mainnet doesn't have fall proofs neither does bass uh so what what is the risk what is the risk profile base and like Point Blank uh can can base your people's money like what's the deal here yeah absolutely and this is something that we thought a lot about it's like what is the kind of decentralization characteristics that we feel comfortable bringing bass to mainnet with and one of the big kind of important kind of uh gates for us was we couldn't launch base in a structure where um any single party could have control of the network in order to kind of negatively impact users or impact funds and so the way we've solved for that in the absence of fault proofs which obviously we're working towards to get out as quickly as possible is we've set up the upgrade system of Base such that there's no single party who can upgrade base so instead what we have is we have uh nested multi-sig structure where there's a base upgrade multi-sig and then optimism uh multi-sig and that's the same multi-sig that controls upgrades on optimism and in order to make any upgrades on base you actually need both of those multi-sigs to sign off and so that means that coinbase can't upgrade base independently nor can optimism upgrade based independently you need both of those folks to come together so that was the first thing basically ensuring that no party could upgrade base in a way that could impact user funds the second thing was um you know on the withdrawals uh ensuring that there couldn't be an invalid withdrawal proposal and the way that that's enforced in the absence of fault proofs is something called The Challenger mechanism there's basically a whitelisted set of parties who can say challenge a withdrawal proposal and say this is invalid and that prevents it from going through and similarly we didn't want to make it so only one party had that opportunity such that if that party kind of uh did something negative they could withdraw funds and so again what we now have is what's called a one of two which basically means that either that kind of Base core multi-sig or the optimism multi-sig can challenge proposals and so if the base team were to do something invalid Optimus them could come in and say hey this is invalid we're going to challenge them we're going to ensure it doesn't go through what those two characteristics get us is basically that kind of uh decentralization characteristic that we want which is that no you know coinbase no base folk can make that decision to impact users in that way and then of course in parallel to that we are working towards having full fault proofs that do this with a larger set of people fully permissionless set that can ensure that you know there's even more confidence in the overall decentralization of the system and one thing that I'll note is you know I I think if you look at the actual decentralization characteristics of this this means that base is more decentralized than opium or I think any other op stack chain uh because you have that kind of nested multi-sing um you know uh that means that there's basically even more parties who are ensuring that base is acting in good faith it's not just coinbase who you have to trust um it's also kind of the whole optimism Collective and the people who are standing behind that and so that for us like we didn't we wanted to go above and beyond and you know we obviously are working to get involved fruits out as quickly as possible but this felt like the step that would get us there in the right way so one of the critiques been of the op stack Fork strategy of optimism is that now that anyone can Fork the op stack they're forking this chain that doesn't have fault proofs and so we're actually increasing the total supply of chains in the market that doesn't have fault proofs enabled uh and uh so I want to uh I'll actually like put on my Optimist hat which fits nicely and and kind of reiterate something that you were saying earlier which is that there was a a sequence of steps that optimism needed to go through in order to do fault proofs right and the optimism Bedrock which is what everyone is forking was that first precursor step that the fraud proof module ultimately slots into and so once false proofs are actually caught coded up and shipped then every single op stack chain that's Fork the op stack will also be able to incorporate fraud uh false proofs fraud proofs and I would only imagine that the inside of the law of chains if we want this homogeneous block space that that is going to be a prerequisite for actually being a part of the optimism Collective that is that is that the correct interpretation of events here yeah I mean the way to the way to translate and that in love change speak is governance minimization right so basically while while government while like the part of what the law of chain says is that you know optimism governance is setting this standard and and ensuring that you know users protections are enforced the best way for optimism governance to protect the users is for it to not have to do anything at all this is the notion of governance minimization yeah and so fault proofs are absolutely like key to the story there because of all proof is what allows no governance to be necessary just one honest party somewhere out there that could be you um to be able to keep the chain secure and to protect those um and to ensure those user protections okay so when are we getting them oh good question so you know when are we getting what and what does it mean to not have fall proofs is like probably the dynamic to to dig into there right like I want to be clear it's not like we embarked upon bedrock and left the fault proofs as an afterthought that like oh hopefully it'll work and we'll figure it out right for a year and a half now we've had sitting on um the mono repo Canon which is the evm equivalent fall proof that the basis for fall proof work that's going on very rapidly right now is based on um and that's since been moved into the monorepo um post bedrock so the question really that you're asking is like probably when different stages I don't know if the audience would be familiar with like the l2beat breakdown there I can go into that if that's useful what do you think yeah semi-familiar yeah we just did a show with the Arboretum team about the whole pie slice and everything yeah got it yeah so okay so yeah there's stage zero stage one stage two um right and Stage zero is no no fault proofs or at least they're not deployed right because they're sitting there on the monorepo stage one is they're deployed but there's training wheels and stage two is like training wheels off right so we're at stage we're at stage zero um nobody is at stage two there's no question that we need to close the gap and get to stage two that's like the number one priority of the community right now and progress is going amazingly fast I'm very very excited about that ultimately the question that we need to answer is not how to get from stage stage one it's to get from stage one to stage two because those training wheels right which is effectively a multi-sig right everybody on stage one and nobody is patched stage one right now everyone stage one makes the assumption that there's a set of multi-sig parties that are not going to rug the users effectively right as and it gives them the authority to do that via this multi-sig that is obviously not where we're trying to land and that is the most important milestone for us to get past so what's going on um in terms of this progress again we need to get from stage 0 to 1 and we need to close that Gap ultimately everyone needs to land on stage two part of the work there is basically to um a part of the work that's kind of actually tangential from these stages but actually we do view is incredibly important is moving to a decentralized security Council which is effectively a stand-in for the multi-sig being not just folks from altruism Collective and folks from base but instead of being a much broader set of community members that are holding us accountable so that's one thing that's honestly actually kind of like independent from Fall proofs in many sense it's just about like this set on the multi-sig we do have some designs in there that we think are unique and there's different Technologies I could get into there that's not worth doing but that's one thing that's happening so that we're expecting to land in early 2024. um in terms of getting to stage two the right first of all you have to ask the question like why does everybody why is everybody on stage one right now right and like why does everyone have stage training wheels and the reason that you don't have training the reason to have training wheels is because you can't ride a bike yet and nobody can ride a bike I want to be clear that there's a reason for that it's because the bar for taking off the training wheels is extremely high right what we're talking about is a bar here that says this implementation of fault proofs is final it is immutable and we're entirely relying on it so if there actually is a bug sorry you're out of luck because there's no multi-sig to bail you out so I think the most deep question ultimately that you've been getting at here is how are we going to get to the point where we're trusted trusting in that and the answer is basically a multi-client approach so our view is basically extremely similar to what ethereum does with its client diversity efforts and for instance these two having a bunch of clients and that diversity being very important the reason for that is because security risks come from Bugs and if you re-implement something you probably will still have bugs but they'll be in different places so the key thing from our perspective that will get us to stage two like full decentralization where there is no multi-sync to value out of things go wrong is only one in which there are multiple redundant implementations of the fault proofs that are checked and all have to agree with each other for the whole system to work what does this give you it gives you the ability that no one bug implemented one of those implementations is going to break the entire system is that following so far does that make sense yeah I think the way that I might uh re-articulate this is that in lieu of a multi-client ecosystem a layer two has to fall back on a multi-sig as its stand-in second client that that is the role of the multi-sig is to be like well if our first client has a bug then therefore that bug becomes Canon because there's no second client to check it therefore we just have a multi-sig to to act in as that second client and so maybe what you're saying Ben is that optimism has been focused on building out the multi-client ecosystem so that it can only have its training wheels on for a very short amount of time and it can go straight from stage zero to stage one and straight into stage two is that is that what you're trying to say that's exactly right yeah from our perspective the Delta to stage two is the big one not to stage one because before that it's still on multi-six and yeah and you're exactly right if you only have one client the multi-sig needs to be a backup if that client has a bug if you have three clients that's how you get comfortable and again I want to I want to caveat that's from our perspective it's possible that others could have one client and say nope we're gonna fully rely on this and it is immutable and if it's wrong then we're screwed and so that could be a decision that's made our bar for decentralization and uh not sacrificing security to get decentralization is this multiple client approach okay how many clients does optimism have oh that's a good question and Shout Out shout out to the folks at base that are working to build out yet another one Opera um they're a fair number I honestly like uh I'm not sure how long ago was that nethermind came out and just randomly released op another mind which we like I think we talked to them a little bit but it was like extremely exciting for us um so it's going very quickly uh one of the things um one of the interesting things that we probably talked about in Bedrock a bit is in the same way that there is um consensus client execution in East 2 right I'm sure you guys talked about this in the context of the merge um that also holds true for Roll-Ups where there's basically like the uh op the consensus client which is like reading the call data from L1 and and turning it into like evm execution and then there's the evm client so we have two consensus clients at this point one is the op node and the other is Magi by a16z so we have two uh uh consensus client implementations then we have nethermind we have opgas and we also have op Aragon shout out to um test and prod another core development team um and Opera in the works like Jesse mentioned uh so if you do that then we have two there and four here so in theory you could run eight different node configurations between the two for the um consensus client and the four for the the execution client um short answer is it's a lot and it's going very high it's going very swimmingly and again this is why we built Bedrock to be so modular like it it was infeasible to re-implement it's infeasible to re-implement many other clients if you don't take the approach that Bedrock does Jesse anything you want to add to this before we move on I guess the only thing that I'd add is you know I think plus one to what Ben's saying um you know we we got to find the path to get from stage zero to stage one to stage two um I I also just say like we clearly have a lot of work to do um to get there you know like Ben said we have a bunch of clients I'm excited to see those fully productionized and live um I know we have a bunch of people who are working on getting us to stage one and I'm excited to see that fully productionized and live and so this is a P0 priority across the base team across the op Labs team optimism and a bunch of other core developers and um you know I think it's good and healthy for the ecosystem and community and y'all to ask questions and be like hey when's this coming um and so I'd say please keep asking the questions um keep following the progress It's on GitHub it's open source and we'll keep sharing updates in the next few months about the progress we're making and I think um like Ben said with bedrock we've really laid a strong Foundation uh and you know that was the goal it was like lay a foundation that we can build on top of and now I think it's kind of up to us to leverage that Foundation to deliver uh and to deliver with speed so that's what we're gonna do it's almost as if bedrock was meant to be a strong foundation for the for the layer two ecosystem yeah Jesse Ben I've learned a lot in this conversation and uh I think anyone who's listening to bank list knows that I get very excited over all things super chain so yeah this episode I think is is going to be a good one to help clarify why that excitement always shows up when optimism a new OP stack Fork shows up in the news Jesse Ben I want to ask you guys each this um because each of you represent a different chain uh Jesse what is the near-term focus for bass uh once you hang up from this podcast what are you gonna go work on what's what's the base ecosystem focused on at this moment yeah well we got nine more days non-chain summer uh and then it's September and so you know we're still really focused on just uh telling the world about base and telling the world about what's happening on chain bringing one thing to do every day on chain that we're kind of curating and then helping surface all the incredible stuff that's happening across the community so if folks want to participate in that you can go to onchainsummer.xyz uh get involved get on chain this summer and then after that we're gonna take a break and it's gonna take a few days um to breathe it's been a really crazy month um of kind of bringing this into the world and then we're just gonna get back to building like we we just talked about kind of getting fault proofs and Security Council and and further progress on decentralization that's our P0 priority and then make it easier and easier for developers to build on base easier and easier for for people to use bass and kind of creating that ecosystem of Builders who are bringing those applications creating those applications and bringing the next billion people on chain that's what that's what I'm focused on so yeah build build build I will say for the for the bankless listener out there the last time I saw Jesse was at ECC and the time before that was at a different conference I can't remember which and and then also then hopping into this uh this chat right here to record ever since every single time he's running around like a madman talking to 10 000 different people talking to different developers and then we just like hop into the recording because that's what I do a podcast and then and then once we're done he hops around and starts running off to go do something else about base or something and then that's been what I've been seeing Jesse do for like the last like six months and then he comes into this recording studio on Riverside and he's like scarfing down his Meal which looks like he's it's the first meal of the day or something it looks like he's just been running around for like six months straight so the fact that you're telling me Jesse that you get a moment to breathe in the next uh coming up soon uh go congrats do touch some grass thank you for all your contributions uh but we need you to to also stick around for the next following decades too so burn yourself out you've been doing a stream a day for the past month isn't that right yeah streamer day every day for 15 minutes I do we're doing on chain Summer Stories it's the first time I've done like direct content and it's it's been having a lot of fun um talked to the onboard team who uh is based in Nigeria today and you know they were sharing about how Nigeria is coming on chain and how the African continent is coming on chain and so I think yeah I mean like candidly it's been a Sprint for the last six months and my feeling was like we only get to do this for it once like you only get to bring something like base into the world once and I wanted to give that like literally everything that I had um and I've given it everything that I had I think our team's given it everything that I had that we had um and now we're gonna take a beat take a breath uh and settle in for the marathon which is going to be the next 10 years the next decade you know the 2020s of bringing the world on chain so you know I guess like only thought I'll say is like thank you everyone for all of the energy and positivity um over the last six months because it's really been the thing that's like made it possible for me to push as hard on our team to push as hard as we have to try and make this all happen so really grateful for all that love and appreciation yeah Ben same question to you what's the near-term focus for optimism op Labs the collective what's going on over there yeah so technically there is only one answer and that is fall proofs and like Jesse said you know go look at the GitHub we're incredibly thankful to have a community of folks like yourselves and the people at l2b like there's an entire company basically focused on holding us accountable which is absolutely incredible and really exciting so technically that's the number one Focus like I can come up here and talk about the differences in stages and you know the unique strategy that we're bringing to the table at the end of the day we just have to ship and like we're gonna let that speak for itself as opposed to um anything short then in terms of governance I would say it's basically the law of chains and getting optimism ready to go multi-chain like I think we we had I'm glad that we had some aha moments about the law of chains and what it means but the work to actually get the Dow ready to fund the public goods on base and uh understand that there are multiple chains and understand that it has you know an obligation to create sequencers now for example that is a very meaningful amount of work for us to be doing and we have an incredible governance team that um you know I certainly can't take any anything close to a Lion's Share of the credit there but that's definitely the Focus right now is like basically preparing the optimism Community to go multi-chain and for the next billion users to come on and join the super chain here we go we've come full circle this episode uh Jesse as he said this is day one uh Jesse Ben thank you so much for guiding us through the super chain and phase today thanks y'all it's a pleasure thank you action items free Bank list Nation will include a link to the law of Chains It's what we've been mentioning throughout this episode uh there is a governance post you can look at to read more about that gotta end with this of course risk and disclaimers crypto is risky so are all the chains that we're creating you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you
