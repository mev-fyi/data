[Music] welcome to layer 0. layer 0 is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with the artist people pleaser who is the renowned artist behind the uniswap x times y equals k animation that sold for almost half a million dollars and 100 of that revenue was donated to charity uh people pleaser is also the inspiration for pleaser dao which has just become a gargantuan of just a dow that is sucking up all the cool cultural artifacts of the world and people pleaser has really led the charge into what it means to become an nft artist but also an nft artist that resonates with some of the ethos and the culture of the cryptocurrency space and has truly become focused on generating nft art and using that skill that that artistic talent to direct uh money into charities uh throughout her collection of work she's donated over two million dollars of total value into various charities from uh from her from her work and really believes in making sure that we instantiate some of these values for the long term of crypto and not just focus on this whole moon boy number go up 100x bag culture so i really appreciate that that angle from from people pleaser and overall had a ton of fun finding out what it was like to be an artist before crypto uh what it was like for her to get into crypto and now become a very prolific hard worker in the world of crypto art in nfts so i hope you enjoyed this conversation with a people pleaser before we get to that conversation a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbetrom you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrary and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many default applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defy apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space hey people pleaser what's up hi how's it going not bad that's i was literally just thinking about how the last time i did one of these was also the first time and it was the first time we had ever met and it's crazy now because what it's been like eight months or something yeah eight months since uh the unit swap x times y equals k drop uh and then that was my like introduction into me realizing i very much missed out on joining uh pleaser dow before pleaser dad was pleaser dao uh and so yeah for the for the listeners the backstory is uh x times y equals k people pleasers uh very famous um animation of uniswap v3 that came out around the same time made a bunch of storm because a bunch of people got into it into a group together pooled their funds to buy this thing and really the story was really really cool so i pulled people pleaser into a quick interview uh as well as leighton cusack and that's where i met matt people pleaser and now i've met her in real life a number of times and so a lot of these relationships that uh people listen to on podcasts they're actually people are watching them form in real time which is kind of cool yeah no i think that's super cool and yeah i mean so much has happened i feel like in the past eight months yeah yeah especially in the world of nfts and definitely your career which is definitely something that we're going to uh tap into here on this layer zero but but first before we get there uh people pleaser what what's up with that name how'd that come about um it's funny because this name actually came before i was sort of involved with crypto um and it was um you know recently i guess like in august or something that i revealed in my sort of like op-ed that had been published was that uh why i sort of got to d5 last summer and everything was because i um during the pandemic was supposed to go get a job or i got a job at apple but then um they rescinded it because of the pandemic and then so i ended up basically unemployed uh and needed to look for a job and stuff and so during this time well this was like probably in early 2020 and then so i sort of just to fill my time um like my free time while i was job hunting i created um an art instagram and then at the time i was just looking at all these like cool artists online and they all had like i guess like cool artist names and then you know my real name is not particularly interesting or unique and then so i thought that i needed also an artist name i mean i never thought that it was going to go anywhere when i created this i was just like i'm just going to create something you know almost like it's kind of like the equivalent of being on ct and creating an alt or like an and on account right and then so um i was looking for a name and my personality just i guess um in general is very much a people pleaser type and then so it just kind of came to me on the spot and i just thought that oh i can always change it later anyways if i wanted to but i guess that didn't end up happening i didn't have like time to do that um but yeah and the way like the way that it's spelt is like super weird and people get it wrong all the time and the reason for that is literally just because at the time it was really trendy to do like names that didn't have any vowels in it and then so i wanted to just do like ppl plsr but then that one was already taken on instagram so then i just slowly added vowels back in until it like wasn't taken and that's literally why it's felt super weird and i've seen like every possible different combination of like the wrong spelling now on twitter like up to date so that's and when you were coming up with this uh pseudonym this was pre you were not in crypto at all this was you you are pre-adventuring into crypto right um i mean well i actually had like bought and you know was investing in crypto since 2017 but um i guess i wasn't in crypto in the sense that i wasn't like an active like contributor or a participant i yeah it's true like at the time when i created my instagram account i didn't even have a crypto twitter account i just had like a regular twitter account from like you know 2012 that i used to like occasionally complain to companies to or something that's pretty funny so let's keep on going backwards because a lot of your skills that you are now injecting into the crypto world came from you know your at your actual career so what was your career like before crypto um so when i graduated college i immediately just started working as a like a visual effects artist or like in 3d animation um and so i worked for a bunch of different like either feature animation studios or um visual effects studios and i worked on some movies um like batman vs superman wonder woman star trek beyond um and then yeah a bunch of other like animated movies so what would you actually do for these things or were they like were you and what were you what part of these movies were you animating so i was in this um department called lighting and composing which is um as everybody knows like 3d animation or like computer graphics is extremely laborious and very very like um specialized in every every single department and then so you know you have something like let's say you need to create godzilla right um so you start with like the model so somebody you know just like modeling something in real life with clay will literally go and like sculpt godzilla or like you know what they think is a godzilla and then that's the model that's created and then it'll go to you know sort of like either um texturing and shading which is um where somebody determines like um i don't know like just how sort of like like what godzilla's like skin texture is gonna look like you know what colors um that kind of stuff and then it's gonna go through all these process of like rigging um animation which is where you like fit a skeleton on the model and then suddenly like godzilla can make moves and then the animator will then go and keyframe all those moves so that you know let's say godzilla's like throwing a punch then like the animator will do that and then they pass it to like um sometimes like there's like effects which is um the department that does like all the smoke and debris or like explosions whatever and then after that all of that is done um they pass into somebody called in lighting which is like what i did where um when they pass it to me it doesn't really have like you know how if you see like 3d programs and everything is like all like gray and stuff like that's basically what it looks like when it comes to me and then so i would be the type i would be the person who first renders um the scene and also determines like what the mood and setting and everything of the scene should look like um and then so i do that and then i send out the renders so then all of that 3d becomes 2d again because it becomes like 2d renders and then just rendering frames like you know typically at 24 frames per second and then however many seconds a shot is and then after all those frames are rendered out then it goes through the last um department called compositing so sometimes i do that sometimes other people do that and it's just sort of like putting on all the like finishing touches so i'm just kind of like the person who grabs everything and like puts it together make sure it looks good and then we ship it out yeah so i was doing that for um many many years um and then before like i got into crypto my last job was at blizzard um on their cinematics team and then i was working on the diablo for um game sim and map not in game cinematic but like the ones that like look like movies yeah the cut scenes the diablo cut scenes yeah and blizzard is also like famous as a company for making really really elaborate like lore and and cut scenes so and also as a fan of diablo and i think there's a lot of uh crypto people that are get like use diablo 2 as their like crypto gaming metaphors like oh my god what if what if diablo 2 had in-game assets i think there's like a large like overlap between like diablo fans and and crypto fans so having you is like working on the diablo cinematics and then coming over into crypto is actually kind of uh fortunate i would say i mean i would hope so it's funny because i i wasn't a huge blizzard gamer i do play games but i didn't play that many blizzard games it's mainly just because they're kind of hard and i'm like not good at games so when i was interviewing with blizzard they're like so what which games do you play i was like uh i mean i don't really play any of them um but obviously you know i do know about the games i have also played diablo 4 which apparently is really similar to up to diablo 2 but you've played diablo four huge flags i i have it it was scheduled i had it on like the month january 2022 it's like blocked off time off my calendar and then i realized that they they canceled it or they didn't cancel it but they they kicked it out oh yeah i'm not surprised i don't think i'm coming out for a while oh no oh no breaking the alpha sadly here on the show um what was your favorite part about making the diablo cinematics there's any part about the cinematics that really stuck out to you have you seen it yeah um so it's the one that yeah debuted at blizzcon in 2019 and um i mean i think it's just i i really like working on that one because it was so gory um it was just so dark i think they actually they changed it so that it became a little bit less um messed up because the original version was even more dark and gory um they were like okay this is maybe a little bit too much but i mean i really liked it because yeah i kind of brought it back to the whole um sort of vibe of diablo ii of like the very dark lore um and uh lilith was one of the main characters at the end um she looked really cool um so and i just liked how the entire um it was about like nine minutes i think the sort of like the short film i guess the entire short film like all the way up until the end was just like this constant ramp up um you know just like very dark and weird and at the end there's like this mega grand entrance of lilith and um the music is pretty crazy so i think yeah i mean obviously it was really interesting to work on the aesthetics of it but nothing could compare with like the feeling of watching it on the big screen for the first time at blizzcon because you're actually just sitting in a crowd of people who are so like passionate about this stuff and like hearing their reaction to like the whole thing was just it was pretty pretty cool how have uh have you been able to find similar experiences with your nft art in crypto um honestly i think yeah like um with x times y equals k specifically you know a lot of people always say oh like it's so cool that it sold for you know however much and i mean yeah definitely you know that and everything about pleaser dot was super cool but i think my favorite moment of you know sort of like that moment i guess um didn't even have anything to do with the fact that it sold as an nft because earlier that week before i even announced that it was going to be an nft when um unisoft just tweeted it out without any contacts just to read everybody's um comments and responses was a similar feeling to watching i mean obviously it's not like a premiere or whatever but it's like the virtual version of like watching something at blizzcon and seeing everybody's reactions right um and so that was really rewarding i thought that was definitely the coolest part do you have any sense of like the differences between what the reaction of what crypto twitter was versus the crowd at blizzcon like what were what were the crowd of people at blizzcon really focused on that they really liked and then what were the crowd of the crypto twitter people focus on were there any differences there um i think it's just well obviously crypto twitter being online um you're watching all of the reactions happen in real time and all of the comments and stuff and i think and also the animation is just so much shorter so um people were really really um i mean i i think it's the funniest so people are like oh what did i just watch or like what does this mean because it was like so vague at the time um and then watching people pick it apart like you know looking for any tiniest hint of like easter egg and definitely really cool that people spotted the v3 at the end in the stars um whereas the viewing experience for the blizzard cinematic was way more like almost like watching a movie or something where everyone was very very quiet and focused you know the entire way through and then at the end they're like whoa and then you know they stand up and i was like standing innovation or whatever um so yeah so with uh your time working at blizzard uh it you the way that you illustrated it kind of made you feel like you were very a part of a very specific team that does a very specific job but my gift with uh the universe v3 animation is you are much more of like the the total end-to-end like conductor of the whole entire art uh so what what what about uh v3 and your first introduction to you know being your your own uh artist being the end-to-end artist i know there were other people that worked on the v3 animation with you but i think with this one you just had a lot more control what was what was it like to like take the shackles off of your your nine to five five corporate drop and start to actually do art for art's sake well i think it's really nice because it's just like um you don't have to gain anybody's trust right like and also you know the unisop team were also just extremely um trusting in my vision and they were just like uh do your thing and you know because of course like the animation itself is uh like i said before was pretty vague um at least at first glance right so um it's it's cool that people would just be like because you know maybe somebody who's more conservative might watch that and just be like i don't even understand what this is promoting or you know and i'm really grateful that they don't try to push that kind of you know old school like very narrative literal type of art direction on me you know to make it like a commercial because i really don't like that because really to me it was more about creating a piece of art right um and so yeah i mean there were three other people who worked with me on it um but i i'd say i probably did like you know closer to like seven like 70 80 of it um you know the whole thing was just night vision but it's just more of like the execution of it um given the time constraints and everything and then there's maybe yeah like i was saying within animation there's specific very specific parts that um you know somebody who's a professional in that field would do a lot better than me so for example the movement of the unicorn and the piece looked so natural and cool because my really good friend who now i work with frequently called marion i used to work with in london and she's a professional animator and so she animated like i don't know um if you've seen like detective pikachu the movie like she animated a bunch of the pikachu shots um you know she's just like so good at bringing these things to life and just giving them such natural movements um and then i also worked with this guy her feet who was helping me sort of do like all the simulations for particles um you know that has to do with more like yeah it's like generative simulated stuff um within the video and then obviously lastly there was isaac's leader who did the score of the music and so what happened was i originally made the animatic against this um this track by this artist named pariah that already exists and then i was like this is the i sort of like cut it to the way that i wanted it and i was like this is the kind of look and feel that we're going for um and then i sent it to isaac and then we had some back and forth where he would send me the track and then i'd give him notes and be like okay i feel like it should feel more like this so yeah it's like on top of just making the animation i also felt like it was the first time that i was doing more of like a director role um so that was definitely a very cool experience and super rewarding but um when you're working on like real movies and stuff you know when you're in a team of like literally hundreds of people um yeah obviously it's a very different experience at the very least i feel like with the blizzard cinematic um the diablo 4-1 it was a vision that sort of aligned with mine so the end product is something that i also liked whereas definitely that doesn't apply to every single like other movie or feature animation that i've worked on so yeah when you're working on something that you know you don't think is sort of like an aligned with your taste it's a lot less motivating and feels way more like a job did you like stepping into that director role with swap with a x times y equals k animation or is that like okay i did it i don't really want to do that anymore again that was oh i'm glad i did that one time but maybe back to the artist how do you feel about like director role nowadays um i mean i really enjoyed it i think as long as you have a solid team and then clients that really trust you um i would totally do it again how um how did you actually convince because as far as i remember correct me if i'm wrong but like this was like you were donating your time towards you and a swap right they were not compensating you uh and i think perhaps that's also true for the other team members uh and so is that not is that not right no that's not true um so actually unisop um did pay me for making the animation um and then uh and so and then obviously with the people that i worked with um they were paid to sort of like do the work as well um but it was very very like it's like not not a lot of money like at all right yeah yeah it's just to just to get the ball rolling um okay so my question was going to be how did you convince all these people to like um sign up and and uh commit to the labor to to produce this thing but i think perhaps maybe some of your answer was like because it's cool maybe because uh like it's there's the clout there of like helping the uni swap team produce the animation but we want to talk about the incentive but for you and all the all the team members yeah it's funny because um i mean all of those team members and this is also why i actually was just thinking about this yesterday where even to this date now a lot of people that i collaborate and work with are people from my past life as in like pre-crypto life let's say um and so thankfully for my i guess maybe it's either my people pleasing personality or something that i have built up really um great and solid relationships with people in the past and so um yeah when i for example when i approached them for the unisop thing uh other than isaac who is doing the music because he is um teo's friend so teo from unisop um brought isaac in for the music but for the you know the two sort of like animators that i was working with they're my connections they didn't know what unicef was so um they were just doing it i mean obviously mary and i used to work with her so you know she's doing it because you know we have this like trust and great relationship and then hafid i found actually through like an online community i interviewed a few people um but he was just um down to do it because he liked my vision and he thought that when i described the vision of the the piece to him he felt like it was really cool and he just wanted to do it so yeah i think i'm just blessed so blessed that you know neither of them knew how big it was gonna be or anything and they were just doing it based on trust and merit and yeah cool factor did they get cryptopilled in this process are they not crypto people as well um i think they both got crypto pilled in the process yes they are both um very much like more and more diving into crypto um nnfts and yeah i think they both like hold crypto now which is great what do you think did it for them was it the just the recognition of the community and the appreciation of the art was it the fact that the art itself sold for almost half a million dollars like what do you think really brought them in i think um probably you know i think it's just like this world is so intriguing right now and definitely had to deal with the fact that crypto has i feel like gone a lot more mainstream this year as well um that you can't help but just pay more attention and look into it right um and obviously you know with me talking about it i think it brings a lot more things to attend to their attention as well um whereas you know maybe like surfing the web you would see that a little bit less um yeah i don't know i feel like it's just sort of like it definitely wasn't like overnight it wasn't like after the unison video and they're like all right i'm in how do i get involved it was definitely more of like a transitional process um so yeah i think it's like a slow red pill when was the decision made that all the revenue from the unit swap animation would go to charity how was that decision made uh beforehand i i had made that decision so i literally i remember i was so i was like so nervous because i mean at the time actually it was just like wait i was just going to make this animation because um you know anybody who had been familiar with my work before was just i would make these animations for different d5 protocols and then pretty much all the utility was just they would post on twitter um and that was it right and then so around this time was when nft started sort of like really blowing up and um because i had been so busy because i did sort of like list and sell nfts like even back in defy summer and stuff but um it was never really my focus because i guess i wasn't really like famous then so it's like harder to sell nfts um and then so my main sort of like stream of income was just doing these commissions for d5 protocols and then so at the time i felt a little bit of fomo thinking about like oh i had spent all my time like making all these animations for d5 protocols but i had missed out on the whole like nft wave um or at least i just i didn't commit much time or like resources into developing myself as an nft artist or a brand things like that and then so i just like thought of oh what if i sort of like uh double purposed this video by you know obviously the original purpose of making it for unisoft so that they could tweet it out with the v3 announcement but also if i could drop it as an nft and then um some like multiple reasons um first like my family sort of like values and stuff that i grew up with um my parents are pretty big on charity or volunteer work so that's just something that i've always liked been used to and then also that um i had always wanted to do so when nfts even like you know first was like came into my radar i was just like oh i would love to do like charity drops or something but being that i wasn't famous at the time you know let alone feeding myself i don't think i had enough sort of like firepower to be doing any kind of like charity drops and then so that was just something that i wanted to do and also because of the fact that unisoft had already paid me um to do the work so i felt like there was no purpose for me to take more money from this piece and then so i just kind of like was really nervous but came to them with this proposal like hey i think it could be um cool if we drop this as an nft and then donate it to charity and then um you know i was like really nervous the night before because i got what if they say no blah blah and then i mean they were just like cool yeah let's do it and then so that's like how it happened do you think that how much this is going to probably be an impossible question to answer but how much do you think that the hype around and the ultimate price that was discovered for the x times y equals k uh animation which i think was 430 thousand dollars i think so a very large number do you think that how much do you think of that that price that value is added because it was uh ultimately going to be donated to charity do you have any speculation on that um i actually don't it's so hard to say um i i almost feel like maybe it added a little bit but you know at the end of the day i think that a lot of the value came from um sort of it was a combination of like all these people in the d5 community who i had like previously worked with or were familiar with my work um who just sort of like wanted to i guess like support me because it's almost like they feel like i'm like one of them and then at the time i think the nft space was also very much like still kind of a separate community right and then so they were like kind of like i was like they're i don't know like poster child or something and then so it was really nice that i think everybody wanted to support that and also combined with the fact that the the video had gone so viral like literally within 24 hours that it came out um it was over half a million views on twitter it's like um like you know i think even to the state it's like uh unisop's accounts like most engaged tweets so you know like obviously things that like have this sort of element of virality you know also suffer a lot when it comes to like nfts and um but i feel like the sort of like the charity aspect is sort of what put it in the stratosphere in terms of like um the impact um afterwards like after the sale people were like oh like why is this girl just donating all this to charity and i don't um a lot of people were like oh she's like probably doing it for attention or something but like yeah like i was pretty saying like this is just something that my family you know has been sort of like largely believed in and just like values that i was raised with and yeah and just in a time where i'm just going transitioning from like last summer where i was totally jobless and like worried about affording rents to being grateful that i just had some kind of income by creating these commissioned animations for defy um like that was already so sufficient for me that this like crazy irrational influx of like nft money just didn't even feel right for me to just be taking or milking at the time um so it just made a lot more sense for me to share it with others and um yeah i don't know i feel like probably for that multitude of reasons is like but i definitely didn't think that it was going to go for that much like so yeah it went for around like 310 east at the time um which yeah and i remember that week too like east dipped so um at the time it sold it was about like 525 000 but like um that was like literally during the low point of eve because like earlier you know like eighth was like way more and stuff and then um and i had actually wondered if i should like delay the nft drop because i was like ethan's really low right now um but then i like um i spoke with uh machi big brother i think before i was just like do you think i should still do it and then he was like don't try to time the market like just stick to your original plan and i'm really glad that he um convinced me to do that so yeah yeah you might have actually gotten more eth because it was valued at a lower u.s dollar number uh and so that actually might have been accidentally the optimum time yeah that's entirely possible the the critique of oh she's just doing this for attention i think is is interesting because if there's the type of person who would donate all of the revenue to charities also the same type of person that doesn't necessarily need attention like that kind of feels like it goes hand in hand but also like if the out if the output of that decision is a bunch of attention there's something to say there about like how this nft world can really just like be marketed to the mainstream right uh if the nfts that get don't that donate to charity generate more attention than the nfts that don't uh this is exactly what vitalik was talking about in one of his um articles i can't remember which one but it's something along the lines of like you can bestow legitimacy upon nfts by committing a lot of their a lot of the sale money to charity and he just said i think something along the lines of like 10 to 20 but you just did the whole full 100 um do you have any like thoughts or reflections on that i mean i definitely feel like um just for all the reasons that i said previously which is why i just donated because then it's like also because i wasn't gonna be like trying to um barter with unisop like oh well do you guys want to keep like 60 you know what i mean like it just it just like didn't make sense and it's like i don't think unisop needed the money or did they care about that money and for me personally it was like like i said i was just going from like literally being jobless to like um having just being grateful to have income to sustain myself to like here's half a million dollars that that sort of like transition was just too it was almost like incomprehensible to me and then so um even myself i wasn't comfortable just like taking all of it basically i was just like i don't um yeah i don't feel like it makes sense um you know there's it was definitely even now to this day i feel like um it's just it's just a personal value really and i have placed like zero judgment on anybody else who's like really milking the nft movement like good for you you know um i think it's just for me that contrast was so stark that um even now i have like either like imposter syndrome or i'm just having trouble like adjusting so it makes me feel better to share it with others because at the end of the day it is just really ridiculous if you think about it you know like i bought some apes for like you know five apes for combined like what a thousand dollars worth of eve back in april or something and then now two i only have two of them left but they're both worth like a combined of like 250 grand like it's just it's insane and if you think about you know pre pre 2020 2021 emily where i'm just like sitting on the sidelines thinking like ugh i'd be grateful if i could get a 70 000 per year job right now you know it's just like that difference is just so insane um and so for me to be able to sort of like share that with um other people who didn't have that exposure like myself before i think is something that adds value to my life in what ways yeah let's i want to go into that that last sentence in what ways has the decision to donate the money to charity actually ended up paying you dividends like more job opportunities more clout more friends like wha how is that decision paid off i think it paid off in the sense that i can sleep better at night and also um obviously you know the biggest moment was when i had worked with endowment um because this is actually work where people are like oh you do you know what i actually say that but i actually i'm really grateful that to this date i don't think like i have very many haters like haters like i don't think i've seen more than like five of them or something so that's honestly like really cool um but yeah just like you know to counter like the oh this is just for attention kind of thing it's like i've been sort of consistent with my like ethos you know i did the same with like the fortune drop um and i just did like a drop on solana and um and you know it's actually what people don't realize is it's not just like oh i wave a wand and then this charity thing happens when i get a bunch of classes like i actually have to dedicate a lot of time after to working with um endowment and or like the volunteers and like you know researching into what like charitable organizations we should give this to and like having meetings and like discussing this and you know it's like that's all work that's obviously like not only you're not getting paid for but it's like you're literally giving away money um and also having to do that to make sure that it like goes into the right hands and that's done properly and stuff and so you know it's definitely like no walk in the park but the whole um process of learning this is also extremely interesting like i don't know that people many people do this very often and they should because like i don't know it's interesting and then also just like it makes it so much more clear like the value of the blockchain of everything being transparent applies so much more linearly and um straightforward um to charity because it's all there like you can literally see where the money is going um and i feel like maybe something that has helped people back from donating more money in the past or something is that they're just like well i'm not sure where this money is going you know what if the organization just takes it and you know and i feel like so with with obviously like the blockchain i think that sort of sheds some light there um which is really helpful and then i guess like the last aspect of it obviously um i guess maybe like social karma is that people trust you um and when you say things actually you know what i want to bring up another point is that you know i i had at some point this summer there was like this other nft artist who was like i don't think donating linearly to charity is like uh making any sort of like impact or whatever um and i i just kind of like to counter that i was just thinking well you know at the end of the day it is hard to tell if the amount of money i'm do i'm donating is actually making a difference because you know there's so many problems in this world sure like one person can't solve a lot of things but i think what is more powerful is that um one person or like a girl like me um making what people call chad donations like that gives me a platform for people to actually start paying attention to what i say um and i feel like if that alone um gives me sort of like those stage to tell people and spread this idea of like value sharing and that um web3 can be more than just like stacking wealth for yourself but you can also have like the room and ethos of sharing it with others um if just like donating this um given that that monetary value doesn't make that much actual difference in the real world but if um that many people um more can sort of receive this message from me because i've donated um that and alone it's worth it as well yeah what you're talking about is just signaling the the chadness of the of the move itself right and so you're like a lot of humans out there we learn by mimicking like we learn by copying what other people do and if there's a bunch of people out there who think that people pleasers really really tight and they want to be just like people pleaser well the thing that people pleaser does is donates to charity and so you're kind of like leading by example right sure and i have been actually um so many artists afterward um have been inspired by this movement and we're like even if it's just like five percent ten percent you know they're like oh part of this is going to charity i think that's that's amazing um and um should be something that people feel better about doing and shouldn't be shamed um into doing but last but not least i always i can't emphasize this enough i started doing this after i had determined that i was able to have a steady income from just doing commissioned animations like it's not like i didn't have any money and i just started like obviously it's it's like the plain analogy where you put an auction mess on yourself first before you put it on other people um you have to feed yourself first like don't go and be like oh i'm gonna start donating all my proceeds um and then end up sort of like not fending for yourself totally yeah if you can put food on the table gas in your tank and healthcare for your family it's actually you're actually going to be able to produce much more art overall once you get to that point and like it's actually positive like rationally positive to be able to if you want if your idea is to maximize money to uh money to charity you got you have to make sure you're comfy first so that you can actually work yeah do you know because this was not the last piece that you made where you donated money to charity this was perhaps just the first do you know cumulatively like about how much money has collectively gone to charities throughout your career um big ballpark number big ballpark number probably like closer to 2 million now nice over how many different pieces well i mean let's see so for the unisop one actually by the time hilariously you know even though it sold for 525 000 um uh when i actually donated it um because like i said there was all this work that went into after like researching and stuff so when we actually made the donation um is when we convert the eve um was like i think maybe two months later and then so eve had gone up so it was like i think almost seven hundred thousand dollars that ended up being donated which is great and then um for the fortune one i think it was also almost seven hundred thousand dollars um and then uh there's like a few other pieces of mine like the a16z one that i did back in may that sold for like i think 120 something thousand and then also for the um the the solana one that i did recently was um about 130 000 and so yeah i guess like if you add that up it's like maybe almost like 2 million and every single one of these 100 of the revenue all went to charity uh no so for the fortune one um 50 of it went to charity and then me and fortune split the other 50 okay and then um for the solana one uh over 50 percent went to charity um and for the a16 z1 yeah actually all of that went to charity very cool very cool uh how how did the i'm assuming it was the una swap piece that really was the most impactful how did you you had i'm sure you had some vision of how you wanted your life to go and then you made the uni-swap animation and then perhaps after that your vision of where your life would go changed is it if if that's true how did that change how did it change well i mean before that i just thought that oh maybe if i got famous selling enough teas or if i got famous then i can just sell nfts for a living um and just like drop you know let's say a piece of art every month and sell it for like one east and then i'll be like cool that's like a salary right um and maybe i'll have a lot more other time to do you know other things or work on other projects uh but definitely after the unisop drop happened i think it was a this year was obviously very transformative for me but um it is an ongoing process but i i just very very slowly realized that my role within the community and just in the space in general has changed because suddenly there was so much sort of like more attention and responsibility that i feel like was bestowed upon me that um that i i had this realization that my role was no longer to just make my own nfts and sell them for a living but that i should probably use this platform and voice that i have responsibly and which ties back to what i was saying earlier about if i have a voice to just inspire people to do better um and to share with others um you know this crypto bull run is so crazy i'm sure everybody who's been participating this year feels that way and it'll yeah it almost just feels um unfair for the people who missed out or don't have the opportunity to participate in something like this um so if there's like the double purpose of educating them about it um bringing this to their attention and also like being able to literally help their life um that's literally i don't know upside for everyone so how do you what's that experience actually like so when it comes time for for people pleaser to work it's it's work time but you're actually not making animations you're not making art you're doing what you're just describing which is helping you know spread the message what does that look like what are you actually doing it's funny because i don't see it that way um i see it the other way when i work i'm actually creating or producing something and then so even this year right like i went through the unisop era where i just put my head down and i'm just you know similar to building or whatever i'm like creating and then same with like the fortune thing or the one for the ethereum documentary um and then sort of like after so i see them as like sprints so i'll be like sprinting and like creating these pieces and then after i do that it's almost like it's almost like a i go on like a little press tour after or something where it's just like rounds of like interviews podcasts or like speaking at conferences um and that's where i'm doing things like spreading the message and so yeah like it's like i work and then my breaks are usually where i am doing you know sort of things like this and um and then i'll go into work mode again where i'm creating so when i think of myself as working it's always when i'm in the process of creating and then the breaks are sort of like the little press tour runs that i do very cool and then are you like hands-on with other artists and getting them into this base are you talking them individually or are you like talking to platforms about how to inspire people what's that like um i mean honestly at this point i don't have the bandwidth that i used to to sort of like talk to a bunch of artists individually um of course you know there's always like friends who come to me and ask who are like curious about the space and i'm always happy to like hop on a call red pill them into crypto like show them metamask like the whole shebang um but yeah these days i feel like i'm spending most of my time um you know sort of either like talking at conferences or on podcast interviews um and yeah occasionally i check my dms that's that's a great way to put it occasionally i also check my dms but very very very rarely um so as a result of the uniswap uh animation this thing called pleaser data was formed uh just like high level reflections on what the hell pleaser dow is and just like how how that's impacted your life um i mean definitely from the unisop thing i think you know like the most touching moment was when i realized that there were this group of like d5 degens who just came together and formed a dao and then literally named themselves after me i mean that alone was i think just a stamp of verification that my work has obviously resonated and moved them in such a way that they would be motivated to do something like this and you know for them to each ship in 10 eve is like i i couldn't even imagine myself like selling a piece for tennis let alone so like 20 something people all being like yeah i'm willing to put in 10 eth for this you know and then obviously it's like gone a lot crazier but back then it definitely felt a lot simpler and more pure in the sense that it was just there they just wanted to support me and and that's like super nice and then while now plays your dad's like grown into this machine which is a whole other monster of its own where they just literally i don't know they're just like buying everything that exists on this planet basically like in the future our houses are gonna be like owned by police or town the logical conclusion of all dallas are to own everything it's just a matter of how you actually get there or not did you of any of the people that are now in pleaser dow who of them did you know before please redoubt like did you know leighton or or jameis at all before pleaser dad was formed i i had like i think i had spoken to them briefly like on the internet so um leighton i remember actually this was like probably like december of 2020 i think he reached out to me um and just asked if i'd be interested in doing like a little animation for pull together or something and then actually everyone in the d5 space has reached out to you and be like hey can you do an animation for us yeah literally that's what was happening and i remember i had this little spreadsheet of like okay so after like boring dao i have to do a d hedge one and after the d hedge one i have a sushi slop one and then you know it's like and then so i remember i think at that point when lane had reached out my my list was like so backed up that i was like oh it's possible but you know you're probably gonna have to like wait months or something um and then that was pretty much like the only like exchange that we had and i mean i didn't know that he was so cool like i usually always feel so bad when i can't say yes to people immediately but i'm like oh sorry and then i always think yeah i always think they're gonna like hate me after or whatever but i mean obviously people are like super cool like leighton was just like the next time i had any interaction with him was just him wanting to support like my work despite me never having um the opportunity to do something for pull together so yeah and then jameis um uh hilariously i actually um i think jameis was also one of my like early followers from defy summer and i remember him because he would sometimes like comment on my stuff um and then uh he had messaged me one time um just to see if there was any sort of like collaboration that we could do in terms of like nfts or art or whatever it also didn't like really come to fruition or anything so these are sort of like the light interactions but it's always just like the people in pleaser down at the time were either people that i heard had already worked with or spoken to online but i had never met any of them um so yeah that was super cool yeah and do you have like what's your role in pleaser down now uh since you weren't actually part of the the crew that actually bought your own piece that would be a little or a boric like how what's your position and please adapt to this day um yeah so basically a few weeks after i mean i think right after i i remember jameis kept messaging me he's like join please are down and i was like that's weird i'm not gonna join the doubt i've bought my own piece like so i just didn't but then um like a few weeks after that happened maybe um i think it was both like andrew kang and other people who were sort of explaining to me like their vision for pleaser dao and like you know where they think it'd go and then i was like oh this makes sense and it's actually really cool and it's more than just like i thought that you know blizzard would just end after like they bought my piece i remember me too um at the time like um somebody came up to me and was like oh like i want to join please redoubt how do i join and i just be like why do you want to join it's literally like the thing has ended like it's over little did i know it is not over and then so so yeah like um i felt like their vision was cool and i wanted to see where it went so then they onboarded me as like an honorary member and then um i was a lot more active like in the beginning months like for example when we were purchasing snowden and everything i was like oh um you know sort of like or half orchestrating like you know the the things um like the purchases and like the bidding and stuff and then um obviously you're like i feel like recently i've gotten way way way more busy so um i just sort of like um the dow is almost like you know there's like full-time hires now too so you know i am um sort of like almost like advising from time to time um i feel like now my role in the doubt is just kind of like i'm like the spiritual godmother or something every now and then i like float in and i'm like guys remember like to have positive social impact and like you know just to like make sure that we don't lose sort of like the ethos that we originally had which was what made pleaser down so cool and that we don't just turn into something that's like using other people's money to buy things to gain attention which is not the way of the dao or at least for me you know it's like if you want to do that then you can operate it on some other name but as long as it's going to be pleaser dao i would hope that you know it's like things that have positive social impact you know maybe some charitable aspects um things that because i do feel like you know you can make like a successful like um also maybe like profitable dow that's also good for society right like it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive i do think uh in this world that i'm about to make up that the in the world where the unifop animation didn't have the money going towards charity pleaser dow might not have formed um i know i know one when i was talking to leighton about this he he wanted to own the piece that's why he sent out that tweet in the first place but he also i think expressed like one of the motivations as to why he thinks this could work is like oh everyone can feel good about like contributing their money to the pot to buy this thing because of the charity element uh and so maybe there's a world out there where please or doubt actually might not have had the uh the cohesiveness and the energy to form as a dao without that charity element yeah absolutely and i knew that it also um you know for people like leo chang or machi big brother um it really resonated with them because um i think they felt very very strongly about the cause that i was donating to at the time which was the um stop asian hate um because this year it's funny because it feels like a lifetime ago but it's actually just this year in march where all these like terrible asian hate crimes are happening um and obviously being asian myself i felt like it was a responsible cause to um contribute to and it resonated with other asians in the dao i guess how did you uh land the the fortune article how did that happen uh not the article the the cover they reached out to you yeah is that one of the times where you checked your dms and then all of a sudden there's like a request for a fortune cover in there well so finding it funny enough like even when unisoft reached out to me at that point i wasn't even really checking my dms anymore so it was always through like um somebody that like you know it's like somebody that you know or whatever so unisop teo reached out to tyrone who then um obviously me and tyrone already knew each other so we were connected on telegram and stuff so tyrone is like the famous telegram that i always refer back to touring my messages one morning goes hey someone from unisap wants to know if you want to work with them like that's where it all started um and same with fortune so it was alex masmedge um who reached out to me because we already connected he's like hey uh somebody from fortune wants to connect with you and at the time was robert hackett um who just sort of like got my email and he's just like hey i just want to know if there's any sort of capacity that we can work together and then that was kind of the exchange and then nothing happened for like months so i was like okay i don't like really know where that went but cool and then a few months later their creative director peter herbert got the email from albert hackett and he just cold emailed me and then so i do check my emails obviously because you know less people have access to that and stuff and then so he just cold emailed me and was like hey emily like we love your work your unicef thing was awesome and you seem very like you know sort of perfect for like the crypto community narrative and then we're uh doing this new issue that's gonna focus on crypto and d5 do you want to do the cover and i was like seriously and then so yeah that's literally how it started for those that haven't seen the uh the fortune cover maybe we can get luke the video editor just slap this on the screen while i'm talking about it it's just a it's a a landscape like it kind of looks like a building a skyscraper there's a bunch of different rooms but importantly there's a bunch of uh crypto twitter characters on there all of these like avatars that crypto people have on on crypto twitter importantly none of them are human pictures right they're actually just like digital representations how did you go about the selection process of who got to be on the fortune cover or not ha ha this is where i wield all the power no i'm just kidding it actually is um you know i mean at the end of the day fortune reached out to me they wanted me to do the cover they had zero direction for anything they were just like we just want to put your art on the cover and then obviously knowing the piece was going to be about like um crypto and defy i wanted to make it sort of like fitting and i just thought look they reach out to me and there's a lot of people who have like are sort of like internet friends that i've made along the way or people who have supported my work and have shown me kindness and sort of to give back to them i i will put them on the cover that's pretty much it i mean obviously a lot of them are also like influencers because that's where like emily's like business brain kicks and i'm like well i'll also you know the thing basically markets itself you know like once it comes out all these people are obviously going to be excited that they're on the cover they're going to tweet about it it's just like and then they're all there and they're all already bid for it all that's the thing markets itself like that was purely a business decision and but in terms of who went on it because i knew that there were some like crypto influencers who were like why wasn't i on the cover and stuff you know who obviously also had a lot of followers and so i'm like well first i don't know like you've never spoken to me before you know so yeah all the people on the cover are people who um i would consider my friends um have shown me kindness before have talked to me before and i'm like look if you're a friend of mine i'll put you on the cover nice nice yeah and i the through line that i keep on thinking about in many many different capacities is how this industry incentivizes kindness uh and uh it goes back to the very basics of like the chain is transparent right you people can see what shenanigans you get up to like if you hack a d5 protocol we can see that maybe we don't know who you are but we know where the money goes uh and because of that transparency like in order to grow a name for yourself because people can check on everyone else in this space like you really get to reward kindness and reward the properties and the qualities that you see in the people around you uh any thoughts on that um yeah it's a positive some mindset right or positive flywheel um whatever you want to call it is just your effects um affect other people and you know if it's and you know to sort of like get a little bit more philosophical and i think like just like more like wacky conversation is like i imagine a future where like ai is literally being trained by everything they see on the internet so if everything that's happening on the internet is always like hateful comments or you know like trolling things like this like negative things we're probably when we reach something like the singularity gonna be in a pretty dark place where ai has learned those ways and so if we're behaving like showing kindness um behaving in like more positive um like positive loops then um hopefully you know we're just like building a better future for ourselves really all right guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with people pleaser thus far in the second half of the show we get into a little bit more of people pleasers personal life uh her relationships with her social groups of people that are in crypto versus out of crypto how she balances that those two very big dynamics those two differences uh we also talk about further the the role and importance of charitable giving and spreading wealth and wealth distribution inside of a an industry where the number has gone up really really quickly inside of a very small set of hands as it comes to the global population so i hope you guys are enjoying going to enjoy the second half of the show just as you've enjoyed the first half of the show but before we get there a moment to talk about

involved in governance before you got into crypto i'm assuming you had non-crypto friends uh have they become crypto people um some of them actually and then it's funny because it's not through me like um for for a while after i started i guess like getting more notoriety within the crypto community because thankfully i conveniently had this like all pseudonym people pleaser and then so i was actually able to keep the identities pretty separate and then so you know i never actually talked about my crypto career or what was happening in my life to my regular friends um and so why this is also sort of like a metric of how i feel like crypto was becoming more and more mainstream as i was getting bigger was like i would literally get messages from people in the past being like hey i like saw you on the news today or like yeah you know like and then so i'd be like okay this sounds like kryptos like actually becoming mainstream if they're seeing things like this because obviously when i was doing it during d5 summer like nobody would have like known what the heck i was talking about i'm sure you feel the same way probably about with your like non-crypto friends or his like crypto friends um it wasn't until i think it was the first time that i went on bloomberg and then they were like oh we have to i was like oh i prefer to be called people pleaser they're like we have to say your first and last name once because um i don't know something to do with journalism and they can't like do fake like reporting or something like it's like a rule and so they doxed me and then fortune did the same thing they also doxed me and like their article and also they're like nifty 50 ranking and all these things and so i feel like now um the identities are like meshing together and then yeah there's literally it's kind of embarrassing like there'll be like people from my like non-crypto life in the past like have come back oh my god i didn't know you were like doing this and like you're so like big and like and if he's now or whatever and i feel like i didn't want you to know about this like why do you want to compartmentalize those two different worlds i don't know i think it's like it's just there's a few different reasons well first it's like i feel more it's just like having an alternate identity right like i don't have to worry about people judging me when i say things on twitter if like they don't really know the real me or whatever um and also and it is becoming more more of a thing where i get more and more messages now from people in the past who are just like um asking for things you know like they're like oh can you help me with this or you know i mean you're like oh can you give me an nft or you know like things that are obviously either like financially motivated or something that you know it's like dude you haven't talked to me in like years and then suddenly you want to be my friend again um so that's kind of like why i want to keep it separate but obviously i knew that it wasn't like probably it wasn't possible forever it was nice while it lasted um one thing i talked about on the second ever layer of zero was with eric connor and we talked about this thing called what we call ethereum brain where you wake up you check your crypto twitter dms you check your discords like read the ethereum based article and it's really just like too much ethereum just in your in your brain like toxic levels of ethereum do you experience that uh as an nft person because i mean i personally definitely experience that but i'm much more focused on ethereum itself where i think you are much more focused on nft and teas and art do you experience this sort of just like toxic levels of crypto in your brain at times definitely sometimes i i just wonder if you know there's a whole echo chamber um analogy right just like am i in an echo chamber um and so that's also why i like to keep it separate too because when i i just as much as i love crypto i don't want to be like spending 24 hours of my day thinking about it and talking about it and then i think something that almost all crypto people are guilty of but also because it's so interesting and fascinating as a topic is that when they get together that's literally just all they talk about and i think it's um kind of alienating and excluding for people who are obviously like not part of that conversation and so it's almost like i can take a breather from my life when i hang out with my non-crypto friends and we can talk about things that are not like just crypto because yeah it's just like refreshing to know that there's other things happening in this world that is not crypto but as you're going more and more into the crypto world uh are you still able to relate to your non-crypto friends uh as well as you once were i definitely this is a confession that i definitely feel like i have to make more of an effort to stay focused and be sort of like interested and engaged and the things that my non-crypto friends are talking about um after being red pilled and um you know before i spoke to this really good friend who's also in crypto who was saying like he was like oh well you know it's just it's nothing against my non-crypto friends but i just think successful people are more interesting and i feel like that's probably not the right way to put it um and i think the right way to put it is just that's kind of a rough delivery yeah i think the right way to put it is more that our interests are now so sort of like embedded in this community and everything and so that who we find interesting you know it's literally the word interest right that's where our interests lie and that's why we find them interesting it's not because like they're more successful or whatever than like our regular friends it's just um our interests are more aligned with these people in terms of like you know so many senses like a career sense like passion sense value sense yeah how's your uh how's your social life changed uh getting and becoming a crypto person um i i mean i feel like i i hang out with a lot more crypto people now um just because you know like you know even like meeting people like you it's just been so lovely and just to hang out and you guys are actually just like all really cool people you know what i mean it's not like we're all like you know like people who don't talk or anything like we ha get along really well we have a lot to talk about so it's definitely changing that's in that way um it also changed and i'm sure you noticed this as well like going to crypto events is like um a lot more people try to talk to you i'm like not really sure if that's a good thing actually um because sometimes it just feels like you can't really like be yourself um you're sort of like constantly under a magnifying glass but the nice thing is that only happens during conferences um or like crypto events and then so um but otherwise like hanging out with my non-crypto friends hasn't really changed that much other than i do feel like i have less time to do that now right how has uh has crypto made your imposter syndrome better or worse i mean i don't think it's gotten better but i don't think it's gotten worse either i think it's about the same yeah how uh how how do you have to like manage that like just like oh wait no this is my imposter syndrome coming out i don't need to pay attention to this is this something that you like you try and like actively manage i don't think so i actually didn't even realize i had imposter syndrome until i talked to either like some people in my life i remember the first time that i met linda um in real life because i've been such a big fan of hers like you know she's just such an inspiration like female um leader in the space and so when i met up with her um you know we were just having a chat and then i was just saying like oh you know i hope to like be like you one day and so she's like what are you talking about look at your timeline and like i don't know she's just like saying only she's like you definitely have imposter syndrome and um i feel like that was the first time that was like really really brought to my attention um because i didn't think about it that way before right um there's some artists and this isn't just root for artists but uh i was recently watching this like climbing documentary of this guy that would go out and climb all these different routes and people that were paying attention to him uh as he would go across the world and climb this one route and like transcend this mountain you know like claim victory and then you would go across a different world and do the same thing and people would say like oh it feels like he's building up to something it feels like he's like working on just like some grand thing uh are you as an artist working up to something like do you have some long-term grand like magnum opus like in on the horizon um i think it's to become picasso i'm totally joking that's the picasso of nfts that was a terrible joke um i don't even know if we can qualify as a joke um it's funny i actually feel like there's a few quotes that i can pull um one is from um the dark knight where the joker says oh it's like a dog chasing an ambulance but when you actually you're like constantly chasing it but when the dog actually catches up the ambulance you don't know what to do with it um sometimes i feel it's kind of like that where i'm always working towards something but it's hard to define what i'm actually working towards because i feel like every day since i've been in crypto or everyday means maybe stretch but every week definitely my life goes in a different direction so when you're headed in a life like that's like literally doing this all the time it's hard to see what's gonna happen in like two or three years but so the most i can do is make the most of what's happening in the present and when i'm given a task that i feel like is important has a platform for example like the fortune cover the unisop video um all i know is to just put in my best work do what i do best which is to insert my creative vision to it um make it look cool and have meaning and educational purposes to it and at the same time inspiring people to be more charitable is like a nice plus if we uh were to fast forward like three five years into the future uh what would you want um people to look back on the legacy of people pleaser to be how how do you want that to be defined it's really funny because i always feel like if i ever had a wikipedia page um i would always imagine i don't know it's like when you read like bill gates's wikipedia page or something there's always like a giant chunk that's just like philanthropy and then it just talks about like and i feel like that would be the part that i would be most excited to like read about it's just like how has like people pleaser um contributed or like yeah and it doesn't even have to be donating money but just in terms of like spreading awareness to things um the message that i create you know like yeah it would be cool to be like a crypto greta tunberg or something i don't know if you've ever like heard anything that she says by the way it's so powerful that um obviously i'm not and nowhere near as like eloquent or the messages that i feel like are not as important but um yeah i just to sort of like feel that power and just be so inspired by listening to people i can totally see the value of why you know that kind of platform exists what about the world of crypto bugs you the most what do you really not like about crypto what i really not like about crypto hmm i think it's a combination of like the sort of like sometimes i feel like there's like this element of like gatekeeping almost um i don't really like that i noticed that a lot especially with maybe less so crypto but nfts in the beginning um it's like oh only like the best artists can get on these platforms and you know sort of like this separation of like good artists and bad artists or like good artists and regular artists which really what people mean is just like an artist that is able to sell their work for a lot and you know and i feel like art is so subjective that including people like myself it's just a combination of being in the right place at the right time it's not because i'm more talented than other people and um yeah i wish people would drink less of their own kool-aid and see that a lot of it is just luck really so the amount that your art sells for doesn't really reflect who you are or how great you are as a person when it's a time for you to log off of your computer close your laptop lid and go do something in the real world what do you like to do um i mean i like playing on my nintendo switch that's like what i do when i watch so i guess it's not really um obviously yeah you think that counts oh 100 what kind of games do you like to play i love playing smash brothers or um obviously i went through like and also recently went back to it since the pandemic um animal crossing i feel like now it's just like it's almost just like taking a little break from my brain right like you don't really have to think and animal crossing has all these like relaxing tombs of background um yeah so definitely i think during the pandemic what really saved my life um from going insane was smash brothers animal crossing i played breath of the wild i also played pokemon sword and shield um yeah those are like the ones i played i think uh single player multiplayer uh both yeah yeah with multiplayer is it with like your other friends or just people on the internet uh usually my friends yeah it was like it was like the only way for me to like be social during the pantheon it would be like to visit my friends islands on like animal crossing or like play smash together or something when it comes to you and your friends playing smash together are you competitive or you just like playing um i i'm i'm not that competitive so i much more enjoy playing you know like the mode where you're both on the same team and then you're just fighting like another team or something because i don't like to go against my friends like [Laughter] probably because every time yeah also perhaps something to do with people pleaser you don't want to make your friends upset i'm not good enough to the point where i can make my friends upset okay what about now that kova is over what about uh non-screen related activities well i mean i love going to parks like in the summer um and just hanging out in a park i know that sounds really weird but it's like totally a thing um or just i guess i go into bars and stuff because you normally am based in new york and so what is there to do in new york city other than drink right um how did you end up in new york have you been there for a while uh yeah so um i've been there for three years um and i originally moved there i was working in london um and then i i was living and working london this was like 2018 and then i had gone because of work like i got this new uh work or job thing um and also because like like they were giving me a better offer and then my sister um lives in new york she's been in new york for like 10 years and my parents are like you should just take the job in new york because you should be closer to your sister and also when we visit you guys we only have to make one trip okay um yeah which was like really sad to me at the time i always say i have like one heartbreak in my life which is when i had to leave london because i love london i think it's like one of my favorite cities in the world so when i first moved to new york i was like i hate this like i want to go back to london i don't want to be here but now i've learned to love the city new york is like a crypto it's like the hub of the crypto world right when it's time for conference time it's basically like it's in new york right but that didn't happen until this year or at least like i wasn't participating in crypto conferences obviously before the pandemic but like that was just like pure coincidence like i was like i don't understand why new york suddenly became like the world's like crypto hub it's like so random was this was it like this before uh the crypto conferences pre-covered are not like the crypto conferences of today um they you were you did not miss much uh going in like 2018 2019 conferences uh that really the the culture of the cryptoculture cryptoculture was not instantiated at all as it was as it is today like 2017 2018 crypto culture like is it was like the moon boy lambo ico culture craze that just like is not something that anyone really enjoyed uh and so like what crypto is as a community and who we are as a group of people has really been defined you know start starting at the end of covid right that's really like but crypto assets started really going up the community started really defining itself uh and also we also meet meeting each other in real life you know at the start of 2021ish uh and so like you you are especially the stuff all the stuff the meetups that are happening in new york like you are watching like the birthplace of cryptoculture wow okay yeah i didn't know this i was just like a humble hodler prior to the pandemic just like holding some ico coins and then yeah what's it been like to be in new york during the rise of all these like crypto meetups crypto conferences and just you know social gatherings i mean it's both awesome and exhausting i mean i don't know i've always been somebody who's like constantly lived in high stimulating cities for all my life actually so you know i've lived in like taipei la um and so you know it's not something that i'm not used to um but definitely it never had never been at this capacity where like especially during like a week like main net or something it's like there's a party every single night um and i was like i didn't even do this in college and so you know like it was definitely really really tiring i don't know how some people do it they really just stay up till like 4 a.m or something even during bitcoin miami i think my average bedtime was like probably around midnight to 2 a.m the latest like i'm i i'm just like an old person at heart like literally after the pleaser down party at maine everybody was like okay we're gonna go to the after party at this club or whatever i was like i'm going home bye like i literally just went home i'm definitely we need to figure out the club of people that wants to be in bed by 2 a.m and like get all those people into the same hotel so we could all like you know make this group decisions like all right the the the 2 a.m bed bedtime club people like we're we're leaving it's time and you know when elsa you'll feel bad about leaving the group yeah absolutely what have your what's the biggest lessons that you've learned uh the mistakes that you've made the biggest mistakes that you've made that you definitely know not to repeat anymore being an nft artist or just existing in the world of crypto um saying yes to things that you don't actually feel like doing that's just that's still a muscle that i'm practicing today or yeah or my biggest regret is not saying no more often um just because you know at the same time you're creating false expectations for other people and you're also not living true to your own values um of what you actually want to do all for what like the fear of offending one person or something and you know as it shows like people are not that harsh or like easily offended as i was so um terribly afraid of and so yeah my biggest regret is definitely just not saying no enough um because it's definitely something that eats away at me like i feel like every time i try to please other people i'm giving away a tiny piece of myself and it's not an infinite amount that i can give away right so do you think that the uh the belief of people uh would have been upset if you said no came from a pre-crypto world or maybe that was just a preconceived notion that you had in your head that should never have been there in the first place i think it just should have never been there in the first place um it probably definitely stems from some self-esteem issues um like confidence issues where oh i want people to like me because if i don't please them maybe they won't like me well i think hopefully if the the narrative that i keep on spinning about cryptoculture is actually true and not just a fabrication that we are in a community of people where it's easier to find people that value you for you the individual and in your contributions to the community at large yeah hopefully i mean i think so it certainly seems to be heading that way uh what are you excited for with the future of crypto what about the what about the world of crypto makes you optimistic for the future um i think just things like um positive sum games and obviously you know the overly told narrative of removing the middle man um something like the industry that i wasn't before crypto like vfx is it suffers hugely from this right um the movie industry is systemically so messed up in so many ways visual effects workers work so hard and are notoriously underpaid all the time when life of pi won the oscar for best visual effects ironically that studio literally shut down to being bankrupt and couldn't pay their workers um and so there's just so many things that are wrong and that crypto has made life so revolutionary not just in terms of nfts but just um to be able to like have passive income for yourself that's not just 17 cents coming into my bank account every month from interest like how ridiculous is that um and you know sort of just this is a true story right this is a true story i posted this on twitter i was like look i got 17 cents in interest like this is i don't know it's just insane um and so yeah like things like that um transparency of the blockchain make me bullish um you know like i said about how why i think it's important for charity as well um but i do feel like you know sort of with crypto picking up steam like this um it is creating sort of also a wealth inequality um and speeding that up at a crazy rate which is why i always go back to preaching we should share with others whenever we can um because if things keep going the way they are it's possible that there's like probably going to be like a civil war that's like brewing and it's not going to be pretty i think um so things that we should be mindful of as sharing with others and not being like haha we're so much like light years ahead of you and then you're concerned that just the wealth disparity between crypto people and not crypto people just become so large that the society just like flips the table and just like and that can't happen yeah yeah i totally see that happening one of the one of the narratives that i tried and really like beat the drum on is like our crypto assets are actually going to go up in price the more we spread them around uh and so like if we if you own like 100 ether and then you give away half of it to you know strategically to at the right times in the right moments to like a bunch of people well the value of the individual unit of ether might actually double as a result of that distribution so you can actually keep the same amount of like real wealth while also spreading the same amount around to more and more people yeah and i i definitely believe in that so i think the fundamental values and the technology of crypto are revolutionary and you know in the right direction but it is up to us the users to also use it in a way that is creating a brighter future for us and not the dark sort of like bleak one that you know could also happen as a result right we need to make sure that the doors to the citadel are open rather than rather than closed correct well people pleaser thank you so much for coming on layer 0 and telling me your story thanks for hearing me out if people want to see your work or follow you on twitter
