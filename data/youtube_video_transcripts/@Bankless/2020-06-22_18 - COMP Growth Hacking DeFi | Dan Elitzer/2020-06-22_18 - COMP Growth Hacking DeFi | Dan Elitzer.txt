[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we've got a really exciting guest this is going to be a fantastic podcast and it may be our most timely podcast yet can you tell us about it yeah dan elliser a personal hero of mine in the d5 space dm'd me the other day and he said i've got a lot of stuff on my mind all obviously around what's been going around in defy with these new emergence of governance tokens and when dan messages me and says that he's got a lot of stuff on his mind i i give him a platform and so we bring him on to the bankless podcast to hear what dan is thinking about when it comes to these this new emerging uh apparently emerging class of tokens that uh compound has established with their comp token but the the concept of this token is much greater right we are now being able to use our imaginations and see what happens into the future with this yeah so what i love about this is dan really answers what's happening like what is going on is this new um are are these new d5 tokens for real are they or is this sort of a repeat of 2017 and will we see another boom bust cycle we talk about all of those things we also talk about how to yield farm to get the highest returns and dan has some practical strategies that he's sharing about uh that he shared about yield farming and how to actually get access to some of these assets that i think listeners will like too dan wrote the very prophetic piece superfluid collateral in open finance a little over a year ago which talked about how you can deposit collateral in one application and receive a token that you can then deposit as collateral in another application and that really just super drives overcharges the efficiency of collateral in defy and we've seen a lot of applications use that sort of theory that concept as foundation for their that design and so we asked dan about the concept of super fluidity when it comes to yield farming which is another super interesting topic that i expect to see play out in some form into the future i also love that we talked about some of the downsides in the future of these d5 tokens and what to look out for as we enter into what i think is going to be a new chapter in the d5 space i always looked to dan to see what is coming on the horizon of d5 he is in the weeds talking to the teams he's a he's a venture capitalist so he always inspects things with a closer eye than everyone else and so uh dan's perspective is always super valuable to have and getting him onto the bankless pod to talk about this emerging topic of governance tokens was both really valuable to me and i'm sure it will be really valuable to you you know what else i love about dan the last thing david what's that he listens to state of the nation he watched our new show state of the nation which comes out on tuesdays on youtube uh he took a look at the the first episode and loved it so that's what you have to do too if you have not taken a look at state of the nation we publish it every tuesday on youtube and we also publish a podcast version of it on wednesday so make sure you check that out yeah we listened to dan to learn all about what's happening in d5 but dan listens to us about what's happening in the bankless nation so you should also tune in to the bankless nation before we get into the podcast with dan let's talk about our sponsors maltus gives you the ability to run your business without a bank that is the dream it is the first ever bankless bank account for entrepreneurs who want to run their business both on crypto and traditional currencies like stablecoins so it features a multi-sig wallet that means you can have team access not just individual access which is necessary for a business so you can implement access controls you can also earn interest on your crypto using money protocols inside of multis like compound and ave and others you can streamline pay payments as well multis has been featured on bank list we're huge fans of the product they're adding fiat on-ramp soon and as you are listening to this on june 22 they are launching a completely revamped app you've got to check it out if you're starting a business want to run a business in crypto check out multis.co in their revamped app we're going to be doing a video pretty soon and publishing it on the bankless youtube channel as well alright so you need to go to multis.co that's m u l t i s dot co and check it out when you mention bankless they'll put you ahead of the queue they'll give you better priority and let you sign up quicker when you get your value off of your bank account and into the world of crypto you pass through what ryan and i call a crypto bank where you send your money to an exchange so you can swap it for crypto and then send it to your ethereum wallet however it doesn't have to be like this getting value onto these systems doesn't always require a crypto bank and that's where monolith comes in coming soon on monolith is an on-ramp into your monolith smart contract wallet directly from your bank account so you don't need to pass through any sort of crypto exchange crypto bank to get your value on into ethereum monolith for those that don't know is a smart contract wallet that also connects to a crypto visa card so you can go to the store swipe your visa card as you normally do and instead of pulling out dollars from your bank account it pulls out die from your smart contract wallet so this is a way to live a bankless life without having it impact you and your daily livings with with your friends and family and you don't have to be that weird person that only has crypto money and no real money so it wraps your ethereum address in a visa card and visa is accepted basically all over the world and you still get to have access to your die earning that interest rate in d5 at the same time so check them out at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card today okay we've got a special guest today i want to intro you to dan elliser he's an investor at ido collab ventures he's a writer as well we're actually going to get him to do some writing this week on the bankless newsletter so very excited about that he's also a yield farmer and he's going to tell us a lot more about what the heck is going on with these governance tokens in particular the comp governance token balancer and others dan it is fantastic to have you i know this is a last minute episode for you but we're glad we could snag you thanks for having me it's it's exciting to have this conversation with you guys you've been uh really leading this bankless community and been at the forefront of a lot of the trends that are really now starting to explode in the space so excited for the conversation well we want to keep the bankless community at the forefront and we know you are at the forefront of what's going on with these defy tokens these capital assets as we've called them uh previously or like soon to be possibly capital assets can you just um maybe tell us like what your day-to-day looks like and how how you're involved with these governance tokens so we can get some context and then we want to dig into them deeper and we want to figure out what exactly is going on here but why don't you start with some of that background for us dan sure so my day to day is that i'm an early stage investor with ideoco lab ventures we have a traditional venture fund that is focused on investing in what we call distributed web technologies so blockchains crypto and increasingly defy personally i've been closing in on 100 of a d5 focus for the past year or so and we've made a lot of precede investments in that space um some of our more well-known portfolio companies include instadap and pool together and there's some really exciting stuff that's been been happening over the past year but i think things have just taken off in the past week with the launch of the compound finance governance token comp so we can we can talk a little bit about that and some of the trends that are showing up there oh yeah we are going to get into that i'm just curious for from my perspective was was the shift to more 100 d5 was that kind of a you know a calculated bet or did it just sort of happen to to happen can you tell us how you went from just general crypto blockchain to more 100 d5 now yeah well so our whole fund we've actually got five people who work on the team and and to be clear i'm one of the people on the team that is most uh far down the d5 rabbit hole so we did recently launch this uh product validation day for d5 teams which actually happened yesterday with 30 top defy teams we've got an upcoming d5 residency but our fund is still more broadly focused we do still invest in other things in the space largely this has happened just kind of following my passion and my nose over the past year you know you guys know i wrote that superfluid collateral piece in february 2019 as i was just starting to get really excited by some of the possibilities here but d5 represents why i got interested in this whole space in the first place uh prior to uh joining ido and prior to being into crypto at all i worked in microfinance and when i i saw bitcoin and started actually paying attention to it in 2013 uh what clicked for me was the idea of a bank account that was accessible to anybody with an internet connected device and it was the first time in the history of the world that you've been able to have one person to send value to another person who was physically distant from them without any intermediary and i i think that still just alone is a huge huge game changer but what got very exciting was thinking about okay just being able to send and store money is is a superpower but what we're starting to see the glimpses of is the ability for anybody anywhere in the world to create or access any imaginable financial product on the same terms as anybody else so it doesn't matter where you're based it doesn't matter anything that we can bias by it it doesn't matter right it's just reduced to pure open source software and of course there are all of these regulatory hurdles and there's always things that you can do that are going to make more sense when you have more capital than you have less but there's now kind of a global base rate uh that you can get on exchange on borrowing on lending on all these things that as long as you have a wallet uh a digital wallet an open source wallet you can now start to access these things and so that just got me incredibly excited at seeing that this ecosystem was starting to reach a place where there was real diversity in it and a lot more capabilities were becoming real and not just for people who were comfortable getting down to the command line but for as much as you know everybody likes to hate on metamask and some of the the painful ux flows that exist today they're still a lot better they are um you know graphical user interfaces that a non-technical person can interact with if they care enough uh and and we're getting to a place where things like argent and dharma are really just taking up to another level where i think very soon we're gonna see this be something that really anybody can use dan your article superfluid collateral in open finance was one of the was how i figured out who you were and how you think and it really told me that this particular individual is seeing things earlier than everyone else really seeing the writing on the wall of what is possible even though we are not yet seeing that being developed on a technical level in some of these uh defy applications and it was one of the main the core pieces that i used to uh to stand up my ether is a triple point asset article and and then over the next 12 months we saw a lot of that a lot of the content that was in that article become true and is continuing to show itself as an extremely prophetic piece as we see different d5 apps uh be designed in a way that fits that the thesis of that article and you've been uh we we've been you know messaging each other on twitter and you've been throwing the these articles about the concept of like governance tokens and and what turned into like liquidity mining tokens and you were sending these to me like months ago like three or four months ago trying to to get me on the ship of like this is the next big thing this is the the thing that is going to wake up the movement once again what writing on the wall did you see with this liquidity mining phenomenon that we are seeing so much hype by like what what were the things that really alerted you as to why this was such a big deal well i want to give um full credit to my colleague gavin mcdermott he he wrote up this piece about what he called the saf g simple agreement for future governance that was really getting into these concepts and i think he did the same thing with that piece as what inspired me for the superfluid collateral piece which was neither of us came up with a new concept we just took these trends that we were seeing other people circling around and just called attention to them and gavin did a great job laying out how this is something where it's unlike the ico boom in that you've got a real working protocol and you're giving out tokens that are necessary you're not forcing people who interact with the protocol to use the tokens these aren't um payment tokens these are governance tokens and so 99.9 of people are going to eventually be interacting with these protocols and not caring about the governance token the the ability to just have them be useful and have them be live today really separates them from what we saw in 2017 and the governance tokens are a way that you can actually make these things credibly decentralized and distribute it in a way that is actually proportional to the use and is is encouraging the growth um and hopefully eventual you know dominance of some of these protocols in a global way can we just uh recap for those who haven't read it like uh gavin's article dan so like like the concept as i understand it is is you know that there's this idea there's this legal document in vc in the vc space called a simple agreement for future tokens right which is based on you know um a simple agreement for future equity which you know angel investors y combinator cetera have been using for a long time and then kind of you know th the tokenization movement and almost the ico movement created this simple agreement for future tokens where accredited investors can buy um a contract essentially that that yields them uh tokens in the future but you know gavin's article was sort of a riff on this saying it's essentially like a simple agreement for future tokens except what you're getting is a governance token so this is not a token that necessarily yields cash flows in any way there's no promise necessarily of future profit but it does enable the token recipients to some sort of uh governance stake in the decision making process is that essentially what the what the article was is there more to it how would you talk about it yeah that's that's what the the article was and i think the the other piece to it was right this is giving you governance rights governance is also a responsibility and if people are going to take this responsibility seriously at some point it's likely that they will decide that to support the governance and support the long-term health of the protocol the token holders may decide to vote in some sort of value capture mechanism right there's no promise of that there's no way to guarantee that but if you think about it and you think about how human motivations work and wanting these protocols honestly to be long-term sustainable right and to actually be able to be inclusive and allow anybody to participate in this process you're probably going to need to eventually get to a place where there is some uh some sort of value capture backing it and what form that takes and when it happens or anything is totally up in the air but we're going to see that experiment play out over the coming months and years will some things go and stay pure governance for years maybe will some of them try to stick value capture in there sooner but most likely but we we just don't know and it's going to be a fun experiment to watch now i think one of the things that uh he pointed out was really different was the two examples that he called attention to his compound because compound had said they were going to be doing this governance token distribution to users of the protocol but they had not yet started it and the other one was future swap which is a uh on-chain perpetual swap protocol lets people go up to 20x leverage long or short on ethan erc20 tokens and that team had done an alpha release and had just gone completely bonkers right they they planned to be in the market for a couple weeks within three days they'd done 17 million dollars in volume and closed it down just to be safe because they they learn what they need to do and they were like guys this is an audited contract which wasn't fully on it right they didn't sponsor they want to do more because they really care about the safety of their users and and we've worked closely with the team and so we saw how they were thinking about this we worked with them on product but what we what we saw there was they promised from day one usage of the protocol would result in receiving a governance token and they actually went a step further though in one direction than compound in that they said and by the way this token is non-transferable so they don't want you know speculation on this token they're saying hey if you're using this from day one you get a voice from day one um and you know as you gain that voice at some point will those likely you know governors choose to make them transferable they may but there's no way to guarantee that compound went the other way and i said you know we're not doing a governance talk from day one we're going to build up a useful product to a certain size and then we're going to layer on the governance token on top i don't think one is right or wrong but gavin did call attention to how these are to two similar but slightly different models like one is bootstrapping from zero and one is get yourself to a certain level and then you know dump a whole bunch of rocket fuel on it so what i'm really seeing here is i'm seeing a clever way to get around some of the regulations that have really been holding the the industry back lately um specifically with regards to like securities and the how we test right uh and the mkr token has always kind of just been dubiously assumed that if the regulators took a closer look and were more public about it than they would call mkr a security because it was issued by a central party and it fit and it fits the the howie test etc and it had and it had the profit mechanism baked in from the start however what we're seeing with with the the comp token is that what these and the model of uh you know the the enabling future governance and enabling the ability to govern over where cash flows are directed what people are what these token issuers are doing is they're issuing just a governance token but it is a i guess it's not really assumed by anyone but why would you not assume this that the nebulous set of stakeholders which are almost by definition uh decentralized by nature of how the token is distributed uh is they they would just ultimately vote themselves into the security aspect of the token after it had been like fairly issued and fairly distributed uh is that how is the this clever engineering of distribution and issuance and governance is that how you are seeing this well i think it's it's hard to look at these tokens that on the day that they're released and say that um you know they they passed the howey test right which meaning that they are securities right there there's there's not i think basis for really saying that um but you know it is a question right i think this this um is a different take and you know it's possible that some of these things will remain forever governance tokens um one of the the interesting things about comp uh ideocool adventures is uh a delegate for comp we don't own any comp as a fund uh i i've been doing a little bit of uh kind of farming uh comp tokens like on on a personal basis on a very very very small personal basis um but i don't have anything meaningful like maybe i if i have a hundred dollars in comp right now i'll be pretty excited um but you know it's not something that we have an interest in directly as a fund and yet we've still been one of the most active governance participants we've been administrators on the camaraderie forum where proposals are discussed we've been talking about it on twitter um we're we're in a number of chats with like other people who are delegates and we do this because we think like hey it's just one of the most interesting things happening in the space so i want to be involved but b we've got multiple portfolio companies that are highly dependent on compound and so as part of our fiduciary responsibility and part of you know being good investors and supporters of those companies and those protocols we want to help make sure that the protocol they rely on is in a position of strength long term and is taking their needs as other companies and protocols building on top of compound into account when governance decisions are made and so from that perspective like i look at comp and you know i do not care if comp actually uh has a value capture mechanism for me to want to be involved in governance because i'm hopefully going to make money as an investor on these other things built on top of it and so i'm willing to spend that time and do that how does that translate to people who like have chosen to pay money for comp like i could see a potential future in which we cared enough and it was important enough that we sought his responsibility to also directly have ownership uh instead of just receiving delegation like that's possible uh but honestly i don't know exactly how that ends up playing out you know what's cool about these assets to me and so like to recap for everyone what we're talking about is basically d5 protocol assets that have tokens associated with them essentially being released and going through possibly a couple stages of transformation you know the first transformation stage is basically they become these governance tokens so you can vote on decisions in the protocol and then later possibly the governors of the protocol may decide to add a value accrual mechanism on top of it too and transform these d5 protocol assets into capital assets right so securities aside these are these can potentially become cash flowing assets that are associated with a protocol that has a tremendous amount of value uh capture on top of it what's super interesting to me dan is that what we're essentially creating for the first time is crypto native governance and crypto native capital assets in that when you if you're a shareholder in a publicly traded company and you do a proxy vote of some sort you know that vote is governed by essentially the the nation state uh by you know kind of the the laws of the land in meat space or whatever jurisdiction you reside in whatever country you reside in or you know state or what have you but when you vote on compound your jurisdiction is essentially ethereum and the vote you cast is binding on chain on ethereum and if um you know if some sort of a capital is is issued if fees are added to the protocol then these are also fully settled on ethereum two so they become like capital crypto native capital assets and to me that is the first time that we've seen these types of assets come into existence i want to contrast this though because we've had an absolutely crazy week in in d5 this week with uh you know compound i don't know what it was trading at dan did it start the week at 20 or something like that yeah well i think the the i've heard rumors that you know the valuation like on the last private round was like 150 million 250 million something like that okay um i think it initially when i when i first glanced at where it was trading uniswap on on i think monday uh it was around like the 50 mark right and i think it's got it's gotten as high as i i saw it as high as like 200. it's 323 right now yes i think yes yes so the uh so two right and that's like a market cap of over two billion right i mean so fully market cap right yeah so people see that and they see like a 900 growth just this week and they start to think about 2017 because they start to think about the the ico bubble is it different this time in some ways yes in some ways no right history rhymes and so is it similar in that there is a lot of speculation and uh evaluations just going up really rapidly and looking at mania's around this yeah yeah absolutely people see an opportunity where things are moving quickly and and generally in an upwards direction and they want to get rich so yes it does have that similarity to it uh i i don't think there's any way that most the people buying into uh comp either you know through uniswap or by liquidity mining i i'm guessing a lot of them are not doing uh some kind of formal valuation methodology that supports it being at a certain price that said the difference here is that we already had a protocol that had uh more than 100 million dollars in value locked in it right uh and was doing significant essentially loan origination and volume and it's not hard to look at that and say okay well i can reasonably say i expect it to grow at this rate and so you know five years from now i expected to have how many billions of dollars in assets in there and loans originated and if you take uh 10 basis points 25 basis points 50 100 basis points who knows then i can discount back that cash flow into the protocol um assuming there is some way to capture out of it but like since you control governance you can figure out any number of potential ways to do value capture and i think that's one of the next stages that i'm just excited about because i nerd out about this stuff is like what are the best ways to capture value on cash flows coming through some of these protocols and there's different things you can optimize for and i think we're going to see a lot of different experiments playing out right the most simple being in some ways the maker mkr buy and burn model as a way of essentially paying doing share buybacks effectively and then you can look at something like synthetics which is a much more complicated model but you're essentially able to stake your snx and then claim fees every i think it's a couple weeks um and they're very different models but i think we're going to see all sorts of different experiments happen around value capture with these but the core difference is it's not trying to be application-specific money right these are intended i just said more towards capital assets whereas in 2017 everyone was talking utility tokens and um you know honestly that took me that's one of the reasons why i i think i was a little actually late given i had been in crypto for a while it was late getting on the the bandwagon in terms of tokens was i looked at this i said this makes no sense why do i want to manage different types of money for all these different applications like that's terrible ux and even assuming that like we can fix the ux because fixing ux would probably mean just automate that in the back end when i hold uh you know stable coins or i hold you know bitcoin or eth on the back end and then i just like swap into exactly the number of that asset that i want when i need it and that leads this crazy velocity problem and then those tokens aren't really worth very much and they have trouble capturing value because there's no reservation demand um and the model just didn't make sense and now we're saying you don't need to hold this token people can use the protocols if they are getting value from using the protocols and they don't even need to think about that they only need to know there's a token involved um for those who who are aware this kind of model of giving out tokens to users the protocol can be a very powerful incentive to onboard new users and new capital um and then it will be very valuable i think to govern this and allow it to be truly decentralized over time but uh i i'm still very hopeful that we get to a point where again like 99.9 of users will not care or potentially not even know that there is a token involved in the product they're using at all you said why the ico mania didn't work right but there are also a lot of you know there was a lot of optimism as to why the ico mania or any ico the ico model at large was why people were hopeful that that would work at all and i see still a lot of those same fundamental fundamentals in this new governance token model right where like the token was meant to be this sort of a community gathering uh incentive mechanism where you know people you are incentivized to work for the for the protocol work for the product because you are paid in this token or you receive rewards in this token somehow and it was supposed to generate this positive feedback loop uh of building out the protocol from the ground up using a token as a distribution mechanism well i think the problem with that was there wasn't a feedback mechanism for those right it was as a token purchaser in an ico i would give money to a team and say okay here's here's money now now build this out make it useful so my so the number will go up right and that's right that's not a feedback loop um and as we saw it's very very a broken model right there's a reason why venture funding has developed in a way where you don't just give people millions of dollars up front and be like okay i hope in a few years you ship something um and and what happens now there is a feedback loop right with this new model in that i i contribute capital but it's it's being put to work in the protocol and by putting the money into the protocol it actually makes that protocol more useful for other people uh and it and then okay so it's more useful other people that means the value of the perceived value of these governance tokens should go up and so that will attract more capital and make it more useful or attract people trading and doing other things right it gets more use in the protocol and i think if you look at what's happening on compound today it's very hard to say that the majority of the what is it 400 million that has kind of flowed in over the past five days that the majority of that is like doing something other than mining comp or farming comp right like a lot but um it gets it up to a level it is getting more capital in there and there's already a bunch of proposals on the table to you know fix some of the problems with how things are currently structured because the folks involved genuinely do want this to work they don't want to be some stupid game where people are are just you know farming a governance token and then selling it and getting high yield the goal is to make compound global financial infrastructure and so this hype is good initially to get attention and bootstrap and like people are paying attention to it again but you know having been part of these governance discussions people are taking this very seriously and they want to tamp down some of that excitement they want to get it to a place where it's building a measurable value for people who are driven to use the protocol for things other than just collecting comp and it already got into 100 million plus uh in in deposits prior to comp just because people did find it useful so i don't think it's hard to say that this can be done like it absolutely can be done we just need to get it to a level you guys talked about this in your state of the nation right that that the goal here is not just to collect a lot of assets in protocols the that that's something that we do it's a means to get to the end which is if you get the means is you know getting all this liquidity in there and the end is okay great now it's useful to many many millions and hopefully billions eventually of people who can tap into this huge amount of liquidity in these protocols and make it really cheap for them to access credit or to do exchange and hedge their risk and do all these other things but until you get that large base of capital that base of liquidity you can't enable all these other use cases right when i mentioned working on microfinance products you can't create these microfinance products on top of blockchains that don't scale yet because we don't have robust live l2 systems and we don't have enough liquidity so that you can have people um you know shifting hundreds of millions of dollars in one direction the other like it just doesn't exist but we're building that up and if we need to play some things that kind of feel like ridiculous um games that are all about money we play ridiculous games that are all about money in service of eventually getting these protocols to the place where they are providing financial tools and financial freedom to billions of people so there's this feedback mechanism that's going on right now and the fact that this uh new token model started off with compound one of the biggest was already one of the biggest defy apps on ethereum is really allowing us to really see this experiment play out in a relatively like isolated manner right like one of the biggest apps on ethereum is experimenting with one of the biggest new shifts and token models and we're seeing the price of the compound token i'm looking at it on on d5 market capital io right now at 223 dollars a token which is basically its all-time high and and i mean it's only been out on the market for a few days but it's it's pushing up its all-time high which we're seeing a just a massive influx of capital of different types of tokens and value being deposited into the compound protocol in order to access this token right like that's the whole point of the token is to incentivize those deposits and so we're seeing compound at 418 million dollars worth of value locks not far behind maker dow which is just under 500 million and so the value of this token is based on the cash flows of all the value that's deposited so the token value goes up but then there's more incentive to deposit more assets into the compound protocol which makes the token value go up which makes the incentive go up so there's this feedback mechanism right and no other application is doing this right and it's the also the biggest borrowing and lending application on ethereum and i think that what this is this is planting a flag saying like if you are a borrowing and lending application you have to do one of these tokens like there's no way you can compete why would you submit your capital to you know some small borrowing and lending application which doesn't issue you a governance token and that doesn't issue a token that gives you upside potential based on the application when you could instead submit it to compound and so what i kind of want to turn this conversation to is talking about where does this put us or where what has compound done to the other applications on ethereum like is this the now the new status quo is every single application that can do this do they now have to do this yeah i mean i think it's likely true yes um and there will be some cases where it's not true but uh for most things if you need to attract liquidity then if you're not paying a competitive yield then people aren't going to put capital into your protocol and there are ways you can do it right if you you could raise a lot of venture capital and you could directly subsidize the yield you could you know pay people out usdc or whatever you need to pay out uh to pay for them to provide that liquidity to you um that's one way to do it but what i think is actually happening like let's let's get under the hood and talk about what do these tokens really represent right let's let's assume that at some point in the future uh the compound token holders will use the governance process to vote in some sort of value capture um so we can assume that there is going to be a future cash flow that somehow token holders will have access to now let's take a super simple example assume that you know the compound labs team had been entirely self-funded there were no vcs whatever right they own a hundred percent of comp tokens day one and compound has gotten some usage and i say okay we want to supercharge this so we're gonna start giving out these comp tokens now they could uh like i said they could they could raise money from from vcs they could sell the competitive money and then directly subsidize yields to attract more capital to be deposited into compounds uh alternatively they can give out these these tokens and what these tokens actually represent is you can think about them as a probabilistic like or yeah there's there's some element of it where you can discount the likelihood that that you know it may never capture value but let's say it does have eventually a claim on future cash flows you can then discount back the present value of those future cash flows and say okay one comp token is worth you know the the net present value and npv uh of those future cash flows is five dollars 10 100 whatever it is um and now i'm giving that out and that's a way of subsidizing now so what i'm actually doing is i'm saying if i were compound labs right i'd be saying i'm going to take some of my future cash flow and i'm going to pay it out now as a kind of user acquisition as a capital acquisition strategy and this is not unlike you know paypal in the early days or any number of bank banks right who pay you a signup bonus uh because they expect to make that money back off you at some point in the future um giving out comp now is saying like we're paying to acquire customers to acquire capital um but what's kind of beautiful is it's not just a cash payment it's actually giving them ownership and i think that's that's amazing right that's one of the exciting things that gets into uh what a lot of people were inspired about and what the best pieces of 2017 were kind of hoping to be which was really create something that is owned by the people who use it that's that's we're enabling but at the same time you can create models where you're saying i'm just essentially time shifting some of those future earnings and using them now to subsidize growth and the nice thing is as we talked about that actually creates this virtuous cycle right because as you attract more capital and people say oh this could be big that implies more future earnings which raises the the value of the token and so now each individual token um which serves like you know a fixed percentage of the future future earnings but it's worth more dollars today so you're providing a greater subsidy which will in turn attract more capital uh and it's just a very very positive cycle um but what what it really is what it comes down to is you are you know time shifting you're pulling future earnings forward to the present and using that to subsidize your user acquisition so we want to pause the interview and tell you about two more of our sponsors the first is ramp what's holding crypto back getting fiat into the crypto system in order to get fiat into a defy application you have to create an account with an exchange you have to wire funds that's the same thing that's holding your defy app back users drop off off in the sign up process because they don't have crypto so what you're doing is you're limiting your market to the hardcore crypto people but with ramp that no longer has to be the case ramp is a delightfully easy fiat on-ramp it lets first-time crypto users get eth die usdc this takes five minutes or less this reduces the dropout rate so you can build products for the real world it's free for developers it takes 10 minutes to implement you can 100x your addressable market size if you have a defy app so this is the ultimate growth hack what you need to do is go to ramp.network to check it out that's ramp.network to check it out see how easy this is and when you mention bank lists they will on ramp the first 100k in us dollars for free so make sure you go to ramp mention bankless and get that set up today ave is a d5 protocol that you just have to check out it is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum but with a few more tricks and tools than than what you may be used to so you can put assets inside of it and supply assets and then get your interest rate based off off those assets and then you can also borrow those assets but the cool thing is you can borrow assets at a fixed interest rate which is a really important money lego in order to expand what the ethereum nation can really offer the world around it having a fixed interest rate where you can borrow assets and not have that interest rate change under your fee is it going to be a crucial feature for enabling more tools coming out of the ethereum economy in addition to that there's also a tokens which are tokens that represent the underlying collateral but has that interest rate baked into it ave is climbing the leaderboards of the value locked in defy about to cross a hundred million lock they're currently at 98.3 million so they are just absolutely crushing it developers you can check out their la flash loan protocol which can really help the the ux of your application uh a flash loan is when you borrow assets from the protocol without any collateral so long as you pay back that those assets in the same transaction and this can help your users move their debt positions either a a compound debt position or a make or doubt wall position it allows you to swap out collateral instantaneously in one transaction which really is going to be a blessing for your users and their ux go to avey.com and you can deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing today any ethereum while it works so check them out so dan we talked about 2017 and how sort of the model was these futility tokens that didn't have a good claim on you know net present value of a future capital now it seems like we have better assets in this you know 20 the start of 2020. david and i have talked a lot on the bankless podcast about feeling like we're some sometime in in 2016 right like things are building like there's a forest bed and there's dry leaves and debris and the tinder is being laid and like over the last two years all of this development has happened d5 has matured defy has grown and people outside who aren't as into it don't see it is this going to be the spark that lights all of that tinder i i think so it's hard to look at what's been happening over the last five days and say the tinder hasn't been lit uh it's i i don't think i know any teams in the space who aren't watching what's happening with compound and watching what what's happening with future swap and and saying uh no we're not going to do one of these right it makes sense it's what you're going to need to do to be competitive assuming that you are competing heads on with with other protocols who also care about attracting liquidity which everyone will be um so yeah i think i think we're off to the races and i just hope that we do it in a way where we don't lose sight of what we're really trying to build for the long term and that teams put appropriate kind of warnings and protections in place right like i'm very very uh impressed by the future swap teams and decision to uh shut down their their beta they could have kept it going and grown to even more unbelievable numbers but they felt like the risk wasn't worth it and they were worried about you know users losing funds and getting hurt because they didn't feel like it was really ready to be tested with that kind of capital and so i i hope we see more teams show that kind of care where they realize they do have this rocket fuel that they can pour on whatever little bit of traction they start to get uh but that they do so in a way that is uh responsible and so we don't we don't have people in it getting hurt right i do think some people will inevitably get up hurt there will be hacks there will be things that go wrong but hopefully the voices in the community that are watching out for users and aware of the risks will be a little louder this time and a little larger percentage of the overall community uh given how many of us saw what happened when things got out of hand last time so if we think that we are on the cusp of a governance token triggered uh bull market if i just want to be blunt what is the actual mechanism that would cause price appreciation so we're seeing uh you know compound has its assets under management increased by 60 percent and then we we saw a future swap suck in a ton of value when it was just in its you know in its alpha and its beta right uh and then they had to shut it down because it got too successful too fast bay not based off of the same fundamental uh token right is the reason why this could be a trigger for a bull market just the fact that it sucks up assets off of the secondary market and puts them to good use or is there other stuff going on as well um i'm not sure i completely understand um what why is number going to go up for for the entire space or for like eath and like bitcoin and like we're like what like what are we talking about which number are we talking about going up uh oh yeah i guess just ether and d5 related assets like why is this if we are interested if we are thinking that this is going to trigger a bull market of sorts uh i would expect to see this in ether right as the fundamental native currency that if powers all these things but then also the tokens on ethereum in the same way that we saw tokens on ethereum also go through a hype cycle three years ago i just kind of want to peel back the layers as to like what is the mechanism behind this governance token model and why it may uh may cause assets to appreciate yeah that's so that's a great question i think we've we've already seen a a meaningful appreciation you know two three four x or more in in some of these um defy related tokens and i think it's other people also catching on to something um and maybe being as slow as i've been on on the uptake with some of the stuff which was i i used to be really a stickler for i want to see a good value capture mechanism i want to see a good reason why this token should exist and looking at the mechanism designed for it and i think one thing that synthetics you know very clearly taught people in ave has very clearly taught people is if you have the right team working on this if you've got the right community around it all of that stuff is subject to change and so you can't overly focus on what are the mechanisms built in today everyone's looking at and saying well is there a community around this is the overall problem space that they're going for a very valuable one and do i see can i imagine that there is a reasonable path to accrue a lot of value in the long term and and in many cases with d5 the answer is yes and i think it is narrowly more narrowly focused right the ico boom people are going very wide and looking at all sorts of different use cases many of which didn't make sense here we're saying okay this is primarily a financial technology and so we're sticking more narrowly focused in finance where there are much clearer paths to value capture so i think that's people being able to draw those lines is why those numbers will go up as to the question about you know ether right ryan you posed that to the it's the bankless community today you know why has ether not gone up in value along with all these defy tokens and i wish i knew the answer to that um for sure but i i think one possible explanation is that uh ether in the previous round uh in some ways eth was more money back in 2017 because it was the only option and so that created just a lot of demand for ether to participate in icos now we've got a lot of stable coins and so when people want money they want something that they already conceptually position in their head as money that they're using in these systems and and so i i'm not disagreeing with your kind of you know you guys pounding the drum on ethan's money i think you know that's been a very very smart thing to do and i think it it is um with what i would use as a definition of money but i don't think your definition money and my definition of money is what the average person thinks of today as money and so the fact that we do have a closer analogy to what they think of as money in the form of stable coins uh that's which can you know especially for like usdt and usdc they can just like easily flex to many more billions in additional value without causing any movement in their price right they stay pegged to the dollar because you can at least certain parties can easily mint new ones and and redeem existing ones uh so there's not the need for ether to play that role and expand and contract uh its its market cap uh by moving the token value up and down to meet that demand yeah it's funny i i post that question uh today so we're recording this friday um for for the listeners and got an assortment of different answers on uh why does eth seemingly why is eth seemingly left behind of at least you know this this explosive week for d5 tokens and one of the answers is exactly what you're saying which is um there's now substitutes for ethan's money in the form of of stable coins um that was one answer in the ico 2017 uh it was just ether so if you wanted to raise an ico with funds you were definitely using ether so it positioned itself in that gateway um i've got some other thoughts on this too and i'm probably going to publish some of those next week um but i i do want to uh we might come back to this topic dan uh but i do want to ask you another question because one of the contrasts that we've often been running on bankless is um defy versus uh centralized crypto exchanges we call them crypto banks often in in our nomenclature so um it has been the case that crypto banks have kind of dominated the first call it 10 years decade of crypto right in that it's easier you ux right they do custody but it's easier user interface they're very very close to fiat on-ramp so they have that advantage uh and they've really dwarfed anything that's been built on uh defy so far so defy in terms of volume in terms of uh you know collateral in terms of however you measure it has been a sliver of what crypto bank volume for derivatives for trading for everything is now that's starting to change and has started to change this year in 2020 where d5 is starting to gain on crypto exchange market market value um and you know market share in general i i want to ask you this question do you think that these defy tokens uh these rocket fuel as as you've called it will these be the slayers of crypto exchanges will these allow d5 to really catch up and possibly exceed the the volumes and value going through crypto exchanges today that's a great question uh my simple answer is in the near term no right these don't don't directly take us to a decentralized thing that's bigger than coinbase that's bigger than binance like today uh i do think it it helps them get to a size where they're able to compete in a in a closer league uh but it doesn't it doesn't fully get us there that said um you know i'm not uh i guess i am a power user compared to most people but probably not compared to many of the people in the bankless community and uh what i found though is i man i hate going to centralized exchanges now like it's just so much easier for me to use the dex and and i will i'm happy to pay you know some premium right like a you know point or two um to to not have to like go log in somewhere and like think about like the the delays until when they're going to credit my account and then withdrawing it and like am i obscuring things in the right way if i don't want you know them to then be observing everything else that i'm doing on chain like it's just it's it's such a pain and so i found myself moving more towards taxes and i think there will be other people who will do it too because it's it's getting so easy um and the the other signal that i think is really interesting is looking at what's happening with nexo um and this is a centralized crypto lending platform and they first got on my attention when uh basically wbtc was introduced as collateral for maker and uh and there was you know rates got pushed down to zero or one percent maybe and uh nexo minted a whole bunch of things like eight million dollars worth of wbtc deposited and took out a loan and die and uh you know that's that's great they were like arbitraging c5 rates and defy rates and i thought it was that was amazing seeing this hybrid start to happen and now they just put like 25 million dollars of like you know tether into a compound to mine it which i believe i i saw on twitter um that like the ceo or someone there had responded like this was not customer funds and that like unbeknownst their customers they were putting stuff into content it was like there were there were some specific like large customers who asked them to do this on their behalf um and so i feel a lot better about that than what what most people's perception of it um likely was uh but i do think we're gonna start to see this melding i think one of the biggest opportunities that i'm most excited about and so if you're building this please come talk to me is companies that are straddling the the c5 and d5 boundaries and can play to the strengths of both approaches i think we're going to see a lot of uh the future is is hybrid uh d5 c5 for i believe the majority of users uh there will be some that want to operate in a pure pure defy world but i think that's largely going to be the way that you know we we we think about you know bitcoin max most in some places i was like yeah um i used to think like bitcoin was gonna be like the big the one thing i still think bitcoins be absolutely huge i still i i'm still very very bullish on it but uh you're saying like look realistically there's a lot of other stuff going on um and the people who who stay solely bitcoin only um i think it's gonna be relatively small number of people and similarly i think the people who are purely defy only and don't touch any c5 i think that also likely ends up being a relatively small number of people so dan have you heard our um protocol sync thesis before articulated about uh i i remember the graphic especially for that you had a really good piece of piece for that we've we've got to send you some info about that because i think it's describing exactly what we're seeing and we've got a podcast about this too listeners so we'll include in the show notes but i think it's describing what we just saw this week and what you just described with nexo right yeah so nexo is a crypto exchange and they're actually doing their own yield farming do you say it was like 30 million dollars they're doing this there was 20 it was like there was a 22 million slug and they'd already done like a three million slug prior to that okay so close to 30 million dollars and anyway the the protocol sync thesis is basically like um crypto banks and d5 will merge and the way they'll merge is the most credibly neutral protocols will essentially sink to the bottom of the stack and be used by all of the the defy crypto banks exchanges um and it's just kind of a bullish thesis on d5 but also everything bankless it's bullish on bitcoin it's bullish on ether because those are credibly neutral um protocols essentially that everyone needs to tap into right nexo's not going to go to coinbase and start depositing into your coin bases yield um yield protocols right right um but both coinbase and nexo will happily do so to compound because they understand the rules of the compound game and they are um much more credibly neutral and they're not competitors um does that kind of resonate with uh with what you're seeing absolutely and i think you know that's that kind of gets to you know why i'm i'm bullish on defined some of these protocols and amms in particular right automated market makers when you think about automated market makers and liquidity pools um you know one of the the things that people have pushed back against is saying well you know these are not as efficient as order books once you reach a certain scale and that may be true like there are there are a lot of markets where eventually hopefully they go to a place where order books are more efficient for certain types of users in certain scale but it creates a kind of a reserve a floor uh where you're going to be able to say anybody can access this floor and one of the roles of these c5 organizations or some of these hybrid organizations is they're going to arbitrage they're going to get better rates they're going to they're going to do things but they can always as like essentially a lender borrower of last resort a liquidity source of last resort they will also tap into these pools um and and so i think you know that's yeah i think i think i think your thesis is absolutely right okay so before we get through all of the material we've got a few more things we want to cover with you dan but i i think our listeners are dying to know what yield farming is and how they can become good yield farmers how can they harvest some of the crops that are out there dan from the yield perspective because there's some weird stuff going on it's happening really quickly uh do you have any insights or or tips for folks listening yeah i mean the first thing is to balance um your excitement about yield farming with the risks that are are implied by it the the highest yield uh yield farming opportunities are generally at the very beginning when uh it appears uh first but that's also the riskiest point because nobody else has gone first there's not a lot of assets in there there may be uh you know bugs that haven't discovered yet so be careful right and figure out personally where you are on that risk spectrum but assuming you start going in one of the things that we've seen is right now the rate model for tether for both the supply interest rate that you earn and the borrow interest rate that you pay are just wildly out of whack specifically with the other stable coins but really all other assets on compound and so the result has been that uh tether went from being uh like a few hundred thousand dollars in deposits uh to the largest asset on compound uh because people were just using it to yield farm uh and one of the ways you can do that um is you can't borrow against tether so you could deposit tether um and earn interest and was paying it's pretty attractive rates like you know 10 or so um but uh you actually were better off borrowing it because the amount of additional comp you would earn would just dwarf the interest you were paying and so it created this what in my mind a perverse incentive where actually you get a better rate borrowing than on lending um and everyone's just pouring into to tether you can deposit say die or usdc borrow tether so you're earning a little bit on your diary ostc you're earning a lot on borrowing tether but then you trade that tether generally on via curve um and because there's very low slippage for that for stable coins and then you get more usdc or die you deposit that you borrow more tether you keep cycling it through an instadap which you know we're investors and then i you know love love the team there um they built a fantastic tool that lets you basically automates that that process of levering up and they're using flash loans and running it through and doing all one transaction so you can use their defy smart accounts to select your desired level of leverage um and you know it's it's pretty easy to use from a you know d5 perspective let's caveat that with that but it lets you you know choose your desired level of yield farming uh for for comp um so instadap is essentially creating an easy button to automate that yield farming for you yeah absolutely um and it's uh yeah i think it gets like a 4x multiple pretty pretty easily um you know as always there are risks to using these things but they they do make it really easy well you talked about rocket fuel and i'm looking at compound right now like the total uh value locked in compound and it's just like a line straight up um it was like it's so it's the rocket fuel's working it was 100 million uh at the beginning this week and it's now 500 oh you know 418 million locked in company and the lot is is the supply minus the borrow so if you just look at how much has been supplied it's now over 600 million supplied right and so insane there's actually more that's been deposited into compound than is currently deposited into maker because the maker you can't you don't borrow any assets other people have contributed you borrow die by new die being issued um so in some ways like there's actually more capital that's poured into compound than into maker already i know david wants to ask you a question just a second dan but one more thing on this because i think our our listeners might not understand that this uh and i want to make sure i wrap my head around it too so um it seems like tether is yielding far higher returns in terms of comp tokens in terms of this yield farming for for comp tokens uh than die is right so i was looking earlier this week and you know you can deposit die and with the interest rate that comp that compound gives you plus compound tokens you're doing like you know at least earlier this week it was eight or nine percent but at the same time you could do the same with tether and you were doing like a hundred percent oh you're like you're doing like 200 at the point at that point right it was like nuts why is tether so out of whack with these other assets look i think um there's there's a lot of different ways to explain it but i think there were some considerations around tether where it was handled separately because of some of the risks or the perceived risks around tether versus some other stable coins but but honestly just like there's no real reason why the rate model for tether should be so different from usdc um and so the dharma team has actually put forth a a written proposal not yet a proposal in code in the compound governance forum which is you know community uh started and managed the compound team isn't you know i don't think any of them are actually admins there um and uh they're proposing to normalize the uh or standardize the the rate curves used for for across all different stable coins and so that will that will help address it that's gonna take a little while to get in place probably you know a couple weeks um there have been multiple proposals right now just to to help bring that in to increase from zero to either 10 or 20 percent the reserve factor which basically means the amount of interest the percentage of the interest that's being paid by tether borrowers and play it into a reserve pool and so most if not all of their assets have some reserve factor i think it's usually like 10 in this case it's at zero so so you know one party proposed raising 10 percent dharma came and said you know let's go over the top let's bring this in by going to 20 um i don't support using it in a kind of a blunt manner like that i think 10 is right but i think that you know while it may be out of whack for another week or two letting it be out of whack for that little period is better because this is a four year distribution right that comp is happening over so i'd rather be out of whack for a couple years and not set the precedent of we will abuse a certain variable by by pushing it to do things that it wasn't it's not really intended to do to fix things let's actually fix the way we should be fixing it which is to fix the the the curves on the the borrowing and lending rates so dan i want to get into the concept of super fluidity and with and in the valence of this new token model that has come out like the like i said at the beginning of this article yeah or at the beginning of this podcast the article that i i first recognized you for was that uh super fluid collateral in open finance which talked about how collateral in one application can be repurposed and placed in a different application and you use the example of you can submit ether and die to the unit swap each dipole and you receive a token that represents a claim on those assets and then you can use that token as collateral in other applications and the the reference to uh super fluidity is as one of my favorites always a comparison to chemistry as to how things in the physical world work so how does the concept of uh super fluidity with this new yield farming work what is the connection between yield farming and superfluidity yeah so i think what's what's gonna happen here as i was proposing there was that you know assets will flow and kind of find their level uh uh you know across these different containers of contracts and i think what is starting to happen now is we've actually seen um a number of different protocols either launch or or announce they will launch some kind of governance token balancers one curve is another synthetics actually you know shout out to them as being the ones to kind of pioneer the idea of subsidizing liquidity and it's sent to incentivizing liquidity in uh liquidity pools and in a market uh they did this uh subsidizing i believe is the uh synthetic eth uh eth liquidity pool or the synthetic synthetic susd pool they kind of gave smx rewards for that um and now there's this this new pool where it's ren uh synthetics balancer and curve and by putting renbtc wbtc sbtc into this like balancer pool or a curve pool um you're able to liquidity farm all of those tokens at once and it was you know this partnership they all came together and they're like you know in some cases right with like the balancer piece and with the curved piece um you know they naturally have already mechanisms to uh be able to farm those tokens and then ren and synthetics deliver just like subsidizing this because they want to get rembtc and sbtc to have more liquidity um and and i think that just the announcement yesterday kicked off i think in the early hours this morning i i um don't know what level it's at how quickly but i would imagine it's it's probably going pretty fast and i think that's going to be like that's fascinating for a number of reasons right first being able to uh farm all these different types of of um governance tokens at the same time is is really cool um interestingly though you can't farm comp that way uh and and that's for how some of these protocols have been constructed uh if you want to farm comp in a balancer pool you if you just have like two stable coins or two equivalent assets or any assets um the comp is going to get stuck there so you can't use like cdi and cusdc and cusdt in a pool um the comp will sit there and just be dead um right but what you can do is put like a two percent allocation to comp in the pool and then that gives you a mechanism that will pull the compound so because this is a product where they're trying to like get it to be a pure like different forms of btc pool there is no comp element and and so it doesn't make sense to use like cwbtc um in the pool so it's using your deposited assets in something like compound and putting it in another application like balancer to generate liquidity while also capturing the value of the comp token or the you know x governance token that's issued by the relevant application so yes and the people jumping through these hoops and doing this are probably like they're they're looking to essentially farm all these other tokens but right the goal that the reason the teams are incentivizing this right the reason synthetics and ren in particular are doing this is they just want to build up liquidity and get people to start using their versions of bitcoin on ethereum right because right now those they don't really have white adoption and anybody who wants to use them there's just not a lot available and so their goal here is to just make a lot of it available so if people will will provide that liquidity for others because they're being incentivized to do so great now other people who just they don't care about farming yield they just want to have a representation of bitcoin that they can use in some meaningful amounts on ethereum well hey great now you can do it um and so i think that's that's really powerful and that's that's the intended purpose of of these tokens or the distribution mechanisms of these tokens so for the people the users of defy that aren't crazy farmers that are you know squeezing out yield in every single corner of ethereum and they're just normal users who are just you know you sending back and forth assets and maybe they're you know maybe they've deposited to compound just to generate a little interest here they're just the typical 101s how does this meaningfully impact them is it just that the things on ethereum the assets the tokens are given more reason and more purpose and more to be deposited into these liquidity generating mechanisms like unit swap or balance or compound is really just the impact upon the end user liquidity or is there other benefits to the average user of ethereum as well um well i guess the question is like what what are the average user of ethereum looking for um you know i'd say probably the average user of ethereum is you know as much as you know might not want to admit in the ethereum community it's it's the same as bitcoin it's you know waiting for number to go up on the the native asset um and so you know for that perspective if there is more activity happening on ethereum uh then you know hopefully that makes the the value of ether go up um and so that's that's good for those users um the way that it benefits though with people who are not just sitting there waiting for number to go up uh who actively want to use bitcoin on ethereum or do other things is it it enhances usability and composability because there's just now more assets that can be tapped into in these various protocols by the way dan we are not among that ilk we are very happy for a number to go up we think economic bandwidth is very important yes yes absolutely number go up but you know okay so there's one last maybe meaty topic to dive into dan uh and then and then we'll let you go um and that's can we talk for a minute about downsides so we we are really excited about this right now uh to be clear we we do think it's rocket fuel but i was thinking about a few of the downsides that that we may have hinted at or you know listeners may have kind of seen through as we've been talking about this and in my mind that there are three it one is this could cause another speculative mania and for the good and the bad um there is some bad there right so you know that that's one possibility um another is this concept of time shifting where you're basically front loading some of the almost like defy token equity at the beginning so compound for example they're going to distribute comp tokens for four years but after four years there's nothing left to distribute i would assume so is this rocket fuel i guess going to to run out at some point and is that a problem and then the third thing i was thinking was um one thing that these protocols are doing essentially is they are selling their governance so they are selling some of their future decision making um you know and they're incented to essentially sell it we've been talking a lot about bankless about the value of non-subjective almost governance-free protocols uniswap has been mostly one of those so far but something like this could uh incent a uniswap to now release a governance token and inject governance into a protocol that doesn't necessarily need it and maybe that subjective governance is not as healthy as a governance free fully you know defy robot type of protocol so any comment on those three things those are just a few of the potential downsides that uh that i see at the top of my head what what's your take on downsides okay wow um so there's so much to talk about with within each of those um one quickly uh you mentioned compound having a fixed supply um and you guys have often talked about uh you know bitcoin having fixed supply as kind of like a meme right everything is is subject to social governance decision this is explicitly so right so at four years um if the community the governance token holders decide to they can issue new new shares right they can issue more comp tokens um anywhere along the line the the distribution schedule could be changed and stretch that out to 10 years or longer however long you want um you can you can create tail inflation should you so choose um so none of this stuff is locked in that's the kind of the beauty of governance um the the danger is like part of the reason it works is probably the story that you know people like the idea of a fixed supply uh especially i think for some of this governance stuff and and so it's just easier to wrap your head around and so you know we're opening a bit of a can of worms by by talking about the fact that maybe these things aren't fixed um but you know let's i i strive to to be honest and as you guys do you know explore the the trade-offs in this space um so you know wanted to kind of mark that off here um there are risks right um and i think actually one of the the biggest risks here that isn't often talked about um is uh you know looking at at who's in the space and and who has a lot of ownership in the space now and right like we are you know three white men who are having this conversation here and we're having this conversation on uh juneteenth uh right which is kind of the the anniversary of effective abolition end of the civil war in the united states and um we're seeing on a national stage in a world stage um some of the problems with the existing systems and power structures in the world and i think if we are going nuts now with this stuff and it's growing and it's building a new system that just replicates existing power structures and existing or even accentuates the imbalance and existing capital allocation in the world uh that that leads us to a scary place and not a positive place that i want to be part of building so i think it's it's important that as we're building these systems we are um doing so with care and and keeping an eye and and really intentionally building towards the end goal which is that this the this new financial system that we are trying to help bring into the world should be one where it empowers everybody and is not merely a tool for those who are currently in power uh and who have financial resources to continue to extract financial resources from others um and so that's you know apologies for like the kind of a little bit like a soapbox moment there but um i i do think that we need to pay attention to if we succeed uh what is the impact of these systems in the real world i think that was well said in my uh the bankless nation part two essay that i just released i included a section that i labeled world building which was supposed to be a reminder as to the uh that this is a blank slate of a world and it is going to the future of it is going to be dictated as to how we build it today and kind of a call to action is just to be cognizant and reflective of when we make decisions today that they could impact the all future societies all future generations based off of the world so i'm glad dan that people like you are thinking about that today uh so dan what is next for the grand scheme of governance tokens and d5 if at a very macro level view at a very high level view how do you think this uh in a concise way how do you think this changes the game for ethereum and d5 and what can we predict uh will happen as a result of the emergence of these new governance tokens yeah so i think in the near term we're we're going to go through a hype cycle um i think we're we're going to see a lot of people doing these governance tokens i think there's going to be a period of just kind of copycat activity i think there is going to be rapid experimentation and trying to get to improved models around this kind of saf g kind of governance token distribution framework i do think that we're going to start to see more of these mash-ups between different protocols right to the extent that uh one of the things that's gotten us most excited about this space has been the composability between different protocols this is incentives for composability between protocols so we're gonna see i think a lot more things like that incentivized bitcoin on ethereum pool and uh i think you know from there one of the next phases is going to be as we get into the question of value capture right these things start as governance tokens they may remain as governance tokens but i think there's a very high probability that the governors of these systems will move to implement some form of value capture and i think we're going to start to shift the conversation to what is the right form of value capture what are the trade-offs in different approaches and how should they best be structured for different types of systems so i'm i'm very excited for that conversation to open up um i think there's going to be talk through this um as to maybe during the bubbly part also it's like what is the amount of real usage versus just liquidity farming usage um and i've already got some ideas in terms of how we might start to address that and separate that out and create better incentives that even the stuff that is inflated we can at least see which is inflation and which is more quote unquote real um and uh you know then ultimately hopefully we get to this place where there's enough assets in this and i'm talking you know billions of dollars tens of billions of dollars that have been in these protocols for years and that's when i think it starts to become more appropriate to start trying to mainstream this and expose people who are living pay tech paycheck to paycheck if they even receive paychecks and say and being able to say with confidence yes this is worthy of your trust you should put some money into it um because it will be better for you than the existing financial tools that you're using um and maybe it won't be just a year or two from now maybe that's even further down the line um but i think you know at a high level those are the some of the different steps and things that i see um coming down the line dan it has been exceptionally great to chat with you today thanks for making the time it was a crazy week in d5 and like absolutely it's hard for folks to make sense of it i think if if somebody took vacation this week and came back they would see yet again another new slew of products and a bunch of events that they have to wrap their head around so thank you for helping us make sense out of it today absolutely and i'm looking forward to continuing the conversation in the bankless community and on twitter and you know wherever else excellent thanks so much dan so you heard it here guys dan predicts there could be another speculative mania that there are yield farming opportunities right now that these governance tokens slash future capital assets on defy could be quite a big deal so what you should do as far as actions is dig into this stuff further we've got a few actions for you today the first is you need to subscribe to bank list so you catch dan's article it's coming out on wednesday this is going to be like a a super fluid collateral part two is his very influential article but i think this chapter is going to be about yield farming i don't quite know the title yet but dan is going to publish a draft here shortly so i can't wait to read it um also take a look at the opportunities for defy tokens that are available there are opportunities in in compound to govern there are opportunities to yield farm we talk about those a lot in the bankless discord there are opportunities to front run everyone who's not paying attention to this space so check that out and lastly we will include an article to um gavin's uh we'll include a link to gavin's article where he talks about the called the safji which you absolutely have to read for a glimpse into the future here as always risks and disclaimers eath is risky defy including the yield farming opportunities that we talked about is absolutely risky be careful out there guys you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this isn't for everyone but this is the frontier and we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] you
