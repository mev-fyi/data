David and myself whether we consider ourselves bitcoiners we do but it's been harder in recent days I'll say the past year and a half actually say that publicly there was a time 2018 where no one cared if I called myself a bitcoiner if I called myself a bitcoiner in like 2022 you're not a Bitcoin you're a coiner no I actually like Bitcoin must my first asset I've never sold a Bitcoin that I have and so you'll lose some fundamentalists along the way but I think you'll broaden it the tent in a way that is actually good for this movement that we all call Bitcoin
