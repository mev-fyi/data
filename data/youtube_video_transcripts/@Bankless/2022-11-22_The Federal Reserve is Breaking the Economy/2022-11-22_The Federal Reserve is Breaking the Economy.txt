Federal Reserve is the only institution in the world that can create new U.S dollars at a thin air when the FED creates new dollars it's like putting water into a swimming pool and that swimming pool is called the monetary base it's like how many original new dollars the FED has created so when the FED creates more dollars that monetary base grows and when the FED basically sucks dollars out of circulation the monetary base shrinks for the first 95 years of its existence the FED kind of gradually and steadily created more dollars it expanded the monetary base to be about 900 billion dollars and then between 08 and 14 okay and about five and a half years the FED created three and a half trillion new dollars that's 300X more than 3x the way I put it is more than three centuries of money printing in about four and a half years
