you like looked at all the product launches from inception to crypto to now see what's going to happen in the next 12 to 18 months in the next 12 to 18 months probably going to be way more than everything else combined up to this point and if people are launching products they're grinding for product Market fit they're going to get users the inscript was going to survive it's just that's going to happen thankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless talking about Solana today the chips are down prices are down a major public backer of Solana SPF he's down for the count as well he's definitely not helping the sentiment so we brought on the Solana co-founder to ask the question is Solana gonna make it a few things to look out for in this episode number one we go through the full story of Solana back to its earliest moments number two we talk about the state of Solana today both post FTX pre FDX as well and at the bottom of the bear Market that we find ourselves in well might not be the bottom yet we'll see and number three anatoly's reaction when he first heard the news of SBF and lastly we asked the question that I think is on a lot of people's minds in this market will Solana survive the and if it does how he thinks it will make it out David you really wanted to have this podcast uh tell us why I've wanted to bring Anatoly on uh for a long time and I think right now is the best moment to do that and that's because of of really where Solana is as it as it relates to its Community its Builders and its leadership I think right now the Solana ecosystem is going through a moment of self-reflection as it looked back upon its own absolutely insane bull market throughout 2021 and 2022 and I think I see a lot of parallels to how ethereum progressed through 2017 to 2018. I kind of think Solana is doing a lot of the same taking a lot of the same paths that ethereum took a crazy crazy adoption story uh of a bunch of just uh what ultimately ended up to be a lot of hot air like ethereum had icos in 2017. uh Solana had a lot of hot air in this last 2021 bull market and at the end of this very bad year of this downward price action a big pillar that really held up the Solana ecosystem FTX and SPF turns out to be a complete fraud and so because the Solana Community is really going through this period of self-reflection that makes me bullish about the Solana community that makes me really interested in seeing how they choose to take on hardship how they choose to go about the what is going to be a very difficult long bull market to pull Solana out of the hole that it's in and that's why I wanted to bring Anatolia on because because Solana is different than almost any other chain that is in crypto it's different from all the evm Clones Avalanche Phantom like whatever in that it's got a multi-client architecture it's the only other ecosystem that has a multi-client architecture and there was there are is a real Builder Community there there's a real Solana Community there and so like Ryan I know like you and I have been branded as like you know and we have a big eth bias of course can't really deny that but but now that we are in this bear Market our my walls I think come to it feels safe to take down my walls during the bear Market because of all of the crap that we flushed out during the bull market so like my walls go up during the bull market because a bunch of newcomers come in and uh you know don't really understand the Deep fundamentals about what makes crypto work and now that that is well behind us now that we are deep inside of this bear Market the people that are here are here now here for the tech no longer for the money they must be here for the tech and so that's what I see in the current state of the Solana Community people that are here for the tech and I think now is the right time to bring on Anatoly to tell that story and to ask what's Solana going to do in 2023 well I can't wait to talk about that with you in the debrief because uh there's some things maybe we agree on but I think there's some things we might disagree on about this one because this time and uh you know we'll we'll have that

sure you never lose another airdrop banklist station we have Anatolia jakaveenko he's the creator of salon and the co-founder of Solana Labs Anatoly great to have you on Bank list how you doing good thank you for having me hey how is uh 2023 are you glad to have 2022 in the rear view window uh Dave and I were just talking about this like whether we would go back in time and Crush 2022 um make it so it never happened or not what's your feeling on the year of 2022 uh uh yeah and then I'm glad uh it's behind us but if that was the year that I was like spent obsessing over priority fees I'm dealing with Spam on Solano so if I could just like take that engineering effort and move it a year back that would be awesome I mean how are you feeling coming into this year though are you feeling like burnt out are you feeling jaded are you feeling discouraged are you feeling optimistic are you feeling energetic all of the above like I I don't feel burned out like I think it'll probably take like these Cycles come and go right like I think uh the 1819 cycle is really bad like people were really depressed and like nobody like people were I don't know companies were just like shutting down like left and right like people that were true believers so far that's not happening so there's a lot of energy that keeps you going like people are still coming up with like crazy ideas like things that seem like they have a one in a thousand shot of working and they're then they believe they're the ones that are gonna crack it like uber on blockchain right like that stuff like that I think is is like energizing because uh that's kind of like evoking all of the promises and all the cool [ __ ] and like of an open Financial system build an open source software and there's somebody with a lot of energy that's just driving it right now that to me is like really energizing all the [ __ ] that happened in 22 definitely is uh is a drag and does burn you out yeah yeah yeah we we definitely feel a lot of that as well and and it's only one of the things I think we want to do on this uh podcast today is tell the story of Solana pre-2021 I think a lot of people a lot of the Solano Community came into Solana in 2020 or 2021 uh but the story of Solana begins actually much earlier than that and uh bankless listeners will certainly know of of mine and Ryan's bias towards eth and so for our own purposes I'd also also like to to hear this story as well so sure let's go let's go back to the very beginning where where does the story of Solana begin what was the where was the Inception moment for it um so 2017 like I've been following crypto Loosely like I thought it was cool to figure out if I could build like a faster Miner and our and like my first experience true experience with crypto was one forget the company but they promised to ship you an Asic and uh they mined all the Bitcoin with the async before shipping it to you and I got like the first taste of what crypto is all about foreign run yeah I I like thought it was like kind of silly but um I got it like you know my family left the Soviet Union they saw like the full Devastation of what like a centralized badly run economy and currency can do to like people and like that like belief of sound mindiness and like what Bitcoin promised I think like resonated with me but I wasn't serious about it until 2017 um when I saw that one there was a ethereum like demonstrated that there's now like an application platform and this is what I did on my entire career I build application platforms like everywhere I worked at um Qualcomm majority of my career like if folks ever had a flip phone and ever played like any of those games I wrote a bunch of code that made that possible like I was a kernel engineer brew and like learned how to be an engineer in that like in that environment um so when 2017 came around and like the fees spiked uh across all these networks is when I started noodling on how do you make these things systems fast and efficient and cheap while maintaining like that property of mid-trust minimization and I literally had like tea coffees and a beer this is a true story a cafe Soleil at that time I had like this cheesy side project with one of the co-founders one of the folks that became a co-founder of Solana we were mining crypto while building deep learning Hardware like we were we were into deep learning we were putting up racks of gpus and we were mining crypto with it in the background to pay for the gpus and we were just like arguing about proof of work is it stupid like why why are people like paying for gpus like what is the point of all this and I had two coffees and a beer and I had this like Eureka moment that there's a way to encode passage of time as a data structure in a similar way that you encode anthropy as a data structure in Bitcoin you generate this difficulty like you solve the difficulty challenge right like you generate this long string of zeros you can infer from that that a certain amount of energy was spent to generate that and that means you've proven entropy right there's some some amount of energy with spot and the timepiece was like uh sequential just run shot sequentially is uh and I couldn't Google for it because I didn't know the term verifiable delay function I didn't know the danbone and a bunch of other very smart people working on this and that there's very sophisticated versions of this but that was enough to like make me think that I had something interesting because the time component is very important for optimizing wireless networks and if you think of uh censorship resistance as a communication Channel as a means for a user to send a message reliably to all the subscribers that's what censorship resistant means right it guarantees delivery you can think of it as a communication Channel and once you've start thinking of it as a communication Channel there's a very obvious optimization called time division multiple access this is what 2G cellular networks run on the tricky part is the time part how do you say that everybody agrees in a certain time and that's a very pain in the ass problem to solve there's a bunch of papers yeah sorry go ahead can we because Ryan and I aren't developers we kind of get it uh but the bank list bankless nation is also going to be largely non-technical can we just really drill down on this like you make a moment that you're explaining and just make sure that we because this is this is the Inception idea of Solana so I want to make sure that we get that we get this right could you just like do this one more time and like explain like M5 so Solana came a little later but like just I was just really obsessed with this like kind of Blown Away by the Eureka moment that there's a way to encode passage of Timeless data because there's a lot of like kind of like there's no mathematical explanation of time there's is no error proof of Arrow time moving in any direction so it was in that sense it like Jarred me and like made me like holy [ __ ] I think there's something really fundamentally cool about these systems um why why was really important for Solana is because it's really hard to pick a leader it's really hard to make a block right to decide who's going to make blocks and there's a whole bunch of ways to do it and the way that Bitcoin does it is we solve this challenge there's a puzzle and there's a difficulty such that only roughly one person in the world every 10 minutes gets to solve it and in ethereum they tune proof of work to be I think as fast as proof of work it could possibly be it was like 1 in 12 seconds and that's still much much slower than Wireless 5G right or cellular networks or any anything that we use in the world um and there's other ways to do this where you run consensus and then we elect a leader we all two-thirds of the network agrees that Ryan gets to talk then after Ryan is done talking two-thirds of the network agrees that he's done talking and then David gets to talk and that's a very step-wise process it requires a lot of communication a lot of rounds and if you think of it I have XM on a bandwidth to use for messages and and Ryan gets to talk for five seconds and then we run a whole bunch of junk that nobody gets to talk to to select David that's a very inefficient use of that bandwidth that's a very inefficiently used Channel and this is why Wireless protocols they basically create a schedule and say from milliseconds zero to millisecond 100 Ryan gets to talk then David then Anatoly and if you miss your slot too bad right the network just keeps going but as long as everyone is up and running and and talking there is no gaps right there's no election process nobody has to wait for a random event you just get to transmit and that's basically gives you nearly 100 utilization of the hardware resources that you have and just to really drill down on this point uh this is the main uh architectural difference that separates Solana from I think almost every single other blockchain that that really exists and this is why uh if if people have been following me on Twitter why like I've given a lot more Credence to Solana than I have other evm clones like uh Avalanche Phantom evm clones I don't really find very interesting unless they become layer twos on ethereum uh this is actually I think something that's actually interesting in the fact that it is actually a completely different design space that is unique and specifically created by Solana is that a fair take yes the no one else is down this crazy route and the idea is that uh in proof of work and also proof of stake the next person to propose a block is pretty random and in ethereum's current form it's actually selected but it's selected randomly which is different than and then Solana can you can you go into the difference of how proof of stake leader election is selected and then how that's still different in Solana um I don't want to misspeak about ethereum because I'm not like 100 up in the latest design but like tendermen is like the simplest way to think about it is that you have let's say 100 validators and tendermen they all have one vote and then two-thirds of them vote and vote on the Block there's a known block producer that's next but what's not known is whether the block producer is going to succeed or not let's say that's David so we wait for David to produce a block and then everybody says hey I did see a block from David let's all agree that we all saw a block from David okay we all saw the blog let's agree that the block was good and then Ryan gets to do it and now so there's a there's a block that's proposed and then there's a round of verification and then there's a round of verification of that round of verification and that's the last step and then the next step is another block is proposed and this this design structure is is able to let Solana optimize for bandwidth versus like proof of work or proof of uh of whatever like ethereum's proof of State clear is basically yes so because we know so tendermint you know all the leaders ahead of time too but you have this like stepwise agreement did David succeed or not in Solana we don't really care day David has 100 millisecond 400 milliseconds to transmit if he transmitted great if he didn't too bad right the network moves on and then somebody else goes now there's still Forks that happen logically so when you David proposes a block he's got to attach it to some previous Fork that he observed and then everybody votes and agrees was that the heaviest fork or not and stuff like that but nobody waits for anybody to start transmitting it just kind of goes no matter what happens and that's in the optimistic sense which is actually happens 99.9 of the time super majority of the network is live there's actually no nobody votes on a different Fork there's no forking everybody just transmits and votes and the blocks occur very very quickly and you utilize 100 of the bandwidth available to the node so if you have a thousand validators all of them have one gigabit of bandwidth that's a lot that's not a lot that's a 22 year old standard at this point uh I have one gigabit at my house um you have a lot of capacity for transactions like in the most optimal case in my stupid white paper I said I think we can stop 700 000 transactions in there realistically I think with the way internet operates in like Erasure coding and all the other stuff you can cut that in the worst case by four and that doesn't it doesn't matter how many nodes you have if you have a thousand or forty thousand because of how the blocks propagate we can actually utilize that one gigabit bi-directionally between all the nodes and let's say that's 200 000 transactions per second of bandwidth available right then how do you use it um that's that's kind of like the the the other the big question is like how do you actually process it how do you manage all the state and all of the signature verification and all this other crowd and this is where like the reason why I like started building Solana is like once I realized that I think we have a design that can utilize all the bandwidth available to the hardware the other hard problems that are left were basically the bread and butter of my career and like all the folks that are worked at are Qualcomm how do you get silicon to process a shitload of data as fast as you can and like execute as many programs system calls like move memory from one part of the state to another like as possible this is like I'm sure you guys can imagine people that work at operating systems this is what they do day in day out and this is this is a known quantity and this is why if I was like okay we can I see the the light at the end of the tunnel like we we have a design that as a unique way of utilizing like that gets rid of like the overhead of consensus it can utilize bandwidth that's available to all the machines to whatever limit those machines have and that's an exponentially growing limit every two years that gets cheaper or bigger um and the rest of the problems are problems that I'm very familiar with like I know how to solve the memory problems the runtime issues like the parallelism all of the stuff and that that's what drove me to uh to go like basically take the leap become a Founder try to raise money um and I got pretty lucky there I had like basically a bunch of friends at Qualcomm that I worked with for over a decade and at that time uh Broad Town was trying to acquire Qualcomm Apple was suing them and they had to call like President Trump to stop the acquisition so it's like kind of low morale internally and I called a bunch of people and I was like Hey we're gonna build an operating system we've done this before it's a new developer platform it's for these things called smart contracts nobody knows what they're for but like ethereum was worth a bajillion dollars so like I think we can build something cool and unique um so I never thought of like building uh an ethereum killer we never like Market it as like this is the fastest smart contract platform our pitch was like we think smart contracts are good for finance like I think there's like an application for finance and I think Finance depends on information propagating as fast as possible around the world that's those are validates right yeah that was that was that's that's a Solana thesis yeah right so like the niche that we were trying to build is that because of our unique consensus design we can guarantee that if you're participating in the network that you're receiving State as fast as everyone else and edits like best limit you know 20 years of the best Engineers like crank away at building Solana when you transmit a transaction it's going to get sent to the nearest leader you can have multiple leaders at the same time you don't need to schedule only one you can actually schedule n uh so that that Gap geographical Gap that latency is minimized and then that leader propagates that information around the world simultaneously to everybody so that information is moving basically as fast as unused wire can travel around the world so for markets that's very important some event happens in Singapore that newswire literally is flying through fiber to a Trader in New York by the time the trader looks at a market on running on Solana or one running at naisy the prices are the same because that state transition to change the price for the news already is already propagating as well that means that we have uh we can be competitive with these like monopolies on how execution and finance and everything else happens in in like trade fire with open source software and Hardware like run by volunteers so that was like that that's the pitch that was the cool thing and and it's only one net effect of this so this uh this kind of consensus um change that uh Solana has kind of pioneered in in that Universe um it sounds like it's um really kind of maximizing you said maximizing the bandwidth uh available right and that's specifically a bandwidth for validators does the net effect of that mean that if you're running a Solana validator your bandwidth requirements are going to be higher than say a validator from another ecosystem saying ethereum uh validator it's like do you need that one gigabit per second kind of connection and you need that to increase uh over time is that sort of a a trade-off here well the way that ethereum uh right now works you kind of have the same bandwidth requirements across all nodes but with sharding you actually this is where the the bigger the the scalability that goes beyond what Solana can do with ethereum is when you Shard the chain you have these quorums that are separate they have their own bandwidth requirements and those could be let's say much lower and they finalize the block but they don't need to transmit the entire block to every other Shard you only transmit a portion of it and because you transmit a portion to different parts of the network you can infer that I have honest minority guarantees that no data was withheld by The Shard and if there was a fault if this chart if this Shard transmitted a faulty State transition that somebody could detect it because we have guarantees that data was propagated everywhere but those guarantees you can achieve with sub linear bandwidth and that's the that's the advantage but all of these steps are not are going to be much much slower than the news wire going from Singapore to a Trader right so so like those are all great and I think that's a pretty clever design I mean like I love dunk Rod I've I talk to him all the time like whenever I have like questions about like how did you guys solve this problem in ethereum um it's like a beautiful design but doesn't do different right so yeah it's like is is it part of um the Solana mandate to to ever or Vision or dream to ever have validators being able to run from a phone for example you know ethereum would say it is we like validators should run from be able to run from people's band with constraints can you define a validator and a theorem because like is that like the consensus client or the full node well that is somebody who adds a block to the chain in the producer a block producer yeah you can run a block producer that doesn't have the full State on Solana so that there's like a few basically like a block producer only really needs to like propose transactions that go into a block pick the ones that they think are going to get them the highest Roi uh so they need Min they can guess whether those are valid or not they don't actually need to have full access to the state um but like trustlessness comes from at least one full node that has the state and can evaluate all the state Transitions and say that this is the correct answer and then tell you hey the majority [ __ ] up and then either at least say that or find the exact bisect the where the majority [ __ ] up and give you a proof that they did this is uh I I would love a whole separate kind of conversation on this almost from somebody from the kind of the engineering side on ethereum and uh you Anatoly but we'll say that because Dave and I are not the engineers I think we'll save that for for another date but I I can I could say that kind of the the pitch that you just talked about in 2018 is uh is sort of what I heard uh from what ethana Solana was was uh trying to become I remember one thing Solana is a layer two and ethereum right yeah yeah maybe did I did I forever well I remember hearing about uh Solana in 2018 and here's the thing that kind of threw me and this is another maybe a philosophy sort of difference and I can't say that everyone in ethereum feels this way about ethi asset but certainly many people do and this comes from a little bit of the Bitcoin school which is um Bitcoin is money eth is also money that's Central for the economic security of the network and I remember talking to uh Solana people in 2018 as this network was being propped up and I was very at the time also interested in the cosmos ecosystem and a few others and I asked the question to kind of the early Solana startup team hey is Seoul trying to become money and the answer is always no not trying to become money in fact I heard similar from from Cosmos about the the atom token So Adam token was never meant to be sort of a store of value type of thing and I think that's kind of been consistent with what you've said about the soul token too is you don't see it as a store of value as a money in the same way maybe bitcoiners certainly see their asset as money and I think increasingly much of the ethereum community also sees eth as money can you talk about that um difference in philosophy in the in the early days um yeah so like imagine a world where you had like everyone had like a magical radio that can never be interfered with or obstructed and could transmit to everybody in the world that's a world that's sensed without censorship right I can like push a button and transmit to everybody in the world you don't need proof of work anymore to to build a blockchain you can you have a censorship resistance Channel I can guarantee that messages arrive to everybody you know so like the store value part you can build on top of a censorship resistant Channel I think store value is a social construct it's a meme it's like something that people believe in I think that's awesome like and I honestly think it's very useful to have a a store value that is not tied to any Sovereign given like the [ __ ] show that happened in the Soviet Union right like If you experience that one time in your life that that you have like a very you know that it can happen again right like but it doesn't need to be tied to the consensus layer and functionally what the layer one chain needs to do is to prevent spam and that's what the token does it prevents spam everything else is like I can't like code it up into a store value there's no like code change it can make Salon as a store of value so like I think it's kind of dumb to for me to like try to meme it into that does it also though provide best like I can like security for the underlying Solana chain it's like security the underlying Solana chain and some of those censorship resistant properties are like based on the value can you still find security uh blockchain immutability yeah and liveness the ability to not like not reversing blocks is definitely a key property here so um the economic sorry the economic cost of how how much it costs to go backwards in blocks right is economic security well like the with the proof of stake Network once the block is finalized going backwards is invalid so like you can create two forks and that means the majority created a fault um and then you gotta resolve it but like let's say 100 of the validators were compromised like all of them were compromised so and there's nothing they can do to convince Circle to wire out your dollars from your bank account without your signature right Circle runs a full node they're running in there it's secure it's it's unstaked it's just seeing what these compromise validators are sending them there's no way they can like send it in valid State transitions so security of the network is based on this idea that if I run my full node I can process all the valid State Transitions and I know the exact State now like the creating a fork right creating a duplicate Fork that's an attack that you can think of as like uh I'm mining Bitcoin and in my hidden nuclear bunker and then I'm gonna roll back the last 50 blocks or the last 24 hours right that's the economic security of of a proof of work chain in a proof of State chain it's kind of harder concept because once everyone was finalized binance Circle all the full nodes finalize something all the honestful notes finalize something they're going to reject any other Fork that's proposed they don't have this like consensus hook that says oh if somebody proposes a heavier majority signature we're gonna throw away our state that we accepted and and like blow away all the money that like was made uh all the honest all the honest notes that are not partitioned are basically going to halt and now the network is stuck and humans go in and they're like well what the [ __ ] happened that the majority double sign invalid like make an invalid double signature or something else and they resolve it and that process is not based on the amount of tokens involved what percentage or the value of them it's going to be messy it's going to involve a bunch of humans right like so so then from from your perspective and what you're describing does it make any difference for the economic security of Solana if the soul token is like say 10 cents versus if it's ten dollars um for with regards to safety no it doesn't the likelihood of of like uh malicious let's say the the token was like one millionth of a penny right uh the attacker could cause a liveness failure that could be like okay I'm going to buy two-thirds of the tokens and then I'm gonna halt the network or I'm gonna create a double fork and then cause this messy process to run and that's gonna the Network's gonna have to be down for like three days that sucks right so the value of the of the coin is maybe like prevents for these liveness failures that are like messy and annoying but it doesn't in itself prevent it doesn't guarantee security there's no way like the value of the coin has impact on circles dollars that are stuck in a bank that are governed by this full node I think listeners can definitely see someone like the the philosophical differences that that me and Ryan share about like Ethan's money versus the soul token but I I don't really want I think that's a fun exploration but I think there's a much more of the overall Solana story that I want to get back on track too I think a store of value that is awesome could be built on top of Solana it could surpass Bitcoin sure like I don't see a reason why the album wouldn't be possible right right I want to pick up Anatolia the story back uh because okay so we have this uh Inception of Solana the architecture uh and in the implied existence of the Soul token uh and and so I want to pick up the story again at the very beginning where does Solana go from an idea to an actual like Solana labs and like all of this can you can you run us through that part of the story yeah so I had this like idea for a vdf which I didn't know was called the verifiable delay function but it was like what Jarred me out of like being a day-to-day worker to like I think I should build go build a company in crypto so I quit my job being in San Francisco at the time you're kind of connected to people in Silicon Valley that are VCS just by being here as an engineer uh one of my friends threw underwater hockey it's a weird sport that I play I was working at 500 startups and he was like dude I'll give you I forget this is like 25k or 50k which is more money than anyone has ever given me to do anything uh just on a handshake and I was like holy [ __ ] uh that's like enough money for me to be on Ramen for six months I can like code a lot if I had like I could write a lot of code in six months and like actually see if this thing can work um but I uh with the help of my partner Laura she's like you got to do this for real like there's a moment in time that happened with social networks with search engines with whatever where there's a lot of ideas and uh a lot of people go entering a space and you have to take it seriously and go raise and stuff and that's when I got connected to Raj and he has raised money before he's not an engineer so and um he was like okay I'll help you and like he drilled me on like making the the the deck and doing the pitches and like that's that's kind of that was like whole part of the process it was the first time I ever talked to anyone and like it felt really awkward telling him hey I have this idea no nothing's built yet no proof but give me like hundreds of thousands of dollars so I can go hire my friends and go build this thing um what were the initial like raised details like how much did Salon raise at on day one we were trying to raise 500k that was like my target um the price at that time for the network was 20 million which I thought was ludicrous yeah oh you thought that was ludicrous yeah after going after coming through 2020 like 20 million sounds extremely reasonable think about it as like a first-time founder you guys are like yeah first time founder like all you have is an idea right typical like raises and like Silicon Valley are like for that kind of valuation is you have traction you're like hey we have this amount of Revenue we have growth when you guys invest in us that revenue is going to go up right that's the [ __ ] but that valuation that was not like my pitch but that was I thought it was like scary high but if we if it was any lower there's no way we could have like funded a team to like go build anything um and I'm assuming that's what happened next like starting to building a building on a team uh how many how many employees did you guys hire in that first wave before you had to do round number two um about five people which were all basically co-founders um because they were so early so and these were folks that I worked with um at Qualcomm for a long time like that's still uh if you were co-founders than ethereum though yeah probably have better I basically like called in like all the favors that I had with my like colleagues that I've worked with over a decade like getting folks that are like you know work 10 plus years on GPU optimization to leave their very like career effectively like pause their career in a big company and go do the startup was like a big ask um but um yeah I got lucky with timing um if we did another raise in May so we built a bunch of stuff and we built the first Salon of no like a single node that could show hey look we're processing signature verification in parallel is doing perfect history it was doing like a hundred hundreds of thousands signature verifications per second because we like beefed this box out with gpus and whatever like and our thesis was like look if a single node can do this the way that the network is designed that the network is going to run as slow as the slowest node in the super majority so if a single node can be this fast it means that the slowest note in the super majority can be this fast so if I design it should scale to that and that was enough I think we caught like the last Vapors of the 2017 bull market this was like May 2018 eth was dropping funds were closing and stuff like that but we're able to raise like a an a around like above 14 million 14 million valuation no like 14. excuse me race yeah right okay yeah and bankless listeners will know like Ryan and I have talked about the depths of the 2018 to 2020 bear Market uh and how different it is from this bear Market that bear Market was dry like it's funding absolutely dried up and so to say like I really just want to drive that drive that point home there were fumes when it come when it came to the private Market funding in that in that era uh and so like I'm sure I'm sure fighting for that for that 14 million dollars was not easy so like what was cool was that um people like slam us for being a VC chain but like even from those early days um there were a lot of like validators that were part of it people out of Cosmos they were like hey we like we run Cosmos validators we know how this stuff works and this is cool and weird that was basically like they'd made money on these other networks and were like this is so weird and you I'm like just based on that like invested in in like some of those folks were like the they were all the first ones to run notes and like the first months ago like help us like find data centers to to actually like deal with us and stuff like that so then one of the other points I would say about the kind of the VC chain uh charges like honestly 2018 for people around like there was no other way to do it like how else do you like uh the climate at that time was like post ethereum Ico which sort of broke the glass on this but the opportunity really uh closed up like there was no compliant way to do this uh at least in the US and so it's very very difficult to see how a chain could have raised post 2018 in the way the ethereum Ico race yep and being in the US and like with kids I was like I wanna just not get arrested yeah exactly okay sensible yeah and uh we got I think lucky enough but a lot of our competitors raise like hundreds of millions of dollars um which is who are your competitors hashgraph I mean it's the people that you don't remember it at this point there were like very big rounds for later ones being filled and a lot of folks were like about that we were not just not gonna make it like because there were just too many competitors that were too too well funded there's an article that an employee out of Solana Labs wrote not too long ago and released it uh the December 28th of 2022 and there's a line in here that I want to get your get your take on what exists in the Solana ecosystem now was created by the need to build to build everything fast launch the network before Labs ran out of cash ride the wave of the crypto expansion and create an ecosystem at parity with other older siblings in record time would you fair that would you say that that was it's a fair like characterization of like the the vibe of of Solana in the early days the lack of like 100 million dollar funding in the early days made us like prioritize things uh like wolves I guess we I wanted like I wish we had evm support but it's expensive to build in a way that wouldn't [ __ ] the Network's performance like would Solana be here would you guys be talking to me now if we were like an evm chain that was like marginally faster consensus than ethereum like nobody would care so like stuff like that got cut and like how do you bootstrap an ecosystem with a without piggybacking off ethereum devs was like a big unknown so we were that was a difficult Challenge and we were just throwing everything against the wall that could stick when was there a moment where like Solana was like racing to stay alive and then and then that moment happened where you realized that you were gonna make it what was that moment uh I hate to say it but like so 2020 we were like nine ten months of cash left so the market crashed we like announced your coinless auction March 12th I think or something like that we announced that it was gonna be a week later March 16th is when the markets crashed and I was like [ __ ] you're so dead but I was just too exhausted to delay and we really didn't have an option there was no like at that time there's no Bridge round coming like the funds that we thought were like could back us were also like holy [ __ ] we've never seen anything like this before so like we have no advice to give you like so we decided to launch because I was I think my my theory was that like the worst step to launch would have been right before the crash uh so if you launch right after there's a chance that this is like a huge over correction and then we just see at least a medium upswing and that turned out to be like the bottom of the bottom and then like it started the crazy Bull Run so that was that was pretty wild and then we started seeing I would say the second hackathon is when I thought that we had real traction because you saw some teams from the first hackathon that were just [ __ ] around with the network and built like like very cheesy dumb apps the uh like that didn't do anything like uh you vote to have like a fighter fight Chan or something like that some of those folks came back and started building like defy mango and like whatever and I was like okay people actually like did didn't hate the run time didn't like they got something out of it and they like had an idea that was unique and they built it and it was that was like I thought I thought there was something there like basically after the second hackathon mm-hmm and when did uh multi-coin Capital step into the picture were they were what rounds they were in the early days okay yeah uh was it was that the uh uh the 12 million dollars or the one before that no the 2000 yeah this was like so we ended up we wanted to raise 500K we had it we had it like verbally committed the eth dropped like 30 in one day and all these funds pulled out but we managed to actually end up raising about 3 million during that round after like a lot of hustling and conversations and like but there was like a moment that I was like okay [ __ ] I think maybe this is not gonna happen and uh okay so we're we're coming out of the depths of covid Salon is starting to get traction you mentioned two hackathons where like one the second one started to produce real outcomes uh how fast did things accelerate um yeah things were started moving pretty quickly because we were focused on driving more hacker hackathons we didn't we did another one and twice as many people showed up I don't know the exact numbers but it was a significant bump from the previous one from the second one to the third one there was a significant number increase in registrations and teams that completed and the quality of the teams went up um and that got us that was basically when we had our announcer conference break point um and like breakpoint was the first one was pretty cool there were a lot of uh people that showed up that were just I think high in the Euphoria the bull market um and not as many Builders um but the cool thing there was that you kind of had like a bunch of the devs on their own they like got a space and they called it a hacker house and they just like ran away from all the bull market people and just coded on their own this seems a lot like the ethereum community in like 2017 where retallic got exasperated with like he might remember vitalik saying I will leave this space if we keep talking about like Lambos and moon coins it kind of sounds like a little bit like that yeah uh and like that was pretty cool because that was again we we just then copied that model I was like okay there's a bunch of devs that actually want to go build stuff why don't we like run these hacker houses from one one city to the next and then we did a bunch of hacking houses and hackathons and that year of doing hacker houses and hackathons leading up to break point even though the market turned around and every everything started dumping was actually pretty awesome there's a lot of stuff got built there was a lot of devs like the whole nft space like happened during that cycle like you literally you know magic King didn't exist you know like Phantom like actually became like I think a pretty awesome wallet that everyone I think knows about at this point if if not used so a bunch of really cool stuff happened and the second breakpoint was awesome it's like 40 teams that were building games we didn't have a games thing even at the first break point like um the number of attendees went up by like clo nearly doubled from the first break point so despite this like Market drop of Solana's Peak down to whatever 30 bucks with a 95 drop right by the number of attendees to the conference nearly doubled the number of deaths that showed up was like 1600 it was a pretty awesome fives up until the very last day there's one on the flight back everyone started uh seeing the [ __ ] show with us with the FTX yeah yeah we'll get there but I but I want to cover uh really like this throughout 2020 and 2021 because Solana the sole price uh between the the start of 2021 to the end of end of 2021 did probably perhaps the craziest thing any crypto token has ever almost ever done ever which is like go up twenty thousand twenty thousand percent in in uh a little bit over a year uh and I mean I would imagine that went from like Solana thinking about like damn we're running on fumes are we gonna make it we need it we need to get through this to like oh my God we've like what have like everyone's here like what just go what the hell is going on can you can you walk us through like that that part of that transition from from A to B yeah so like I think part of the reason of that is that because we were an underdog earlier even compared to like the cohort of competitors like apple engineer and all those guys they raised at higher valuations from VCS raised more Capital let us they're when they launched their entry price was higher Solana's coinless auction to launch was 22 cents it cleared in like what is that 104 million or something like that which is what Bitcoin was worth when it was just listed on Mount Cox it was not uh nobody thought there was no hype at that point so the Delta from that to I think we passed the cohort Avalanche and ethereum not ethereum Avalanche and like near and a bunch of those other folks and polka dot that I think was surprising to everybody and that that's I think part of the reason of these like massive multiples but right do you think it's fair uh in in contrast to other chains like Phantom Avalanche like near do you think calling Solana a VC coin is fair if if we're not calling those chains VC coins too uh I don't know to what degree do you do you uh say that that's like a fair branding I mean like I know that's a very dumb thing about this whole VC narrative is that like the crypto VCS in 2018 nearly all of them were people that invested in the ethereum Ico and that's how they became VCS they were literally the ethereum backers that believed in smart contract platforms and saw the future of this Tech they made big bets in the ethereum Ico they wrote it to like 1300 in 2017 and they created a fund nearly all of these folks that were like the VCS of that era came from that um like a16z and a bunch of these other folks were not super active at the time um so that's that's kind of like I think the weird branding sure like I don't know like I don't really care about the VC branding I think it's just pretty dumb like to begin with like are there institutionals that hold a shitload of Youth probably like does that make it a trade fight chain no like it's the people building stuff that make the chain so uh what was it like uh I I would never well because Ryan I've experienced this whenever you uh like are kind of uh whenever you experience success you start to get haters right and perhaps Ryan and I contributed to that to whatever degree we did we're I'm sorry but when did like the eth Maxi crowd come in and what was that like to be on like the receiving end of that um it was honestly like not uh uh I guess stuff that I see in I Twitter like is I just take it for granted as this is just people like being on Twitter growing up in the 90s and forums and bulletin boards you just like [ __ ] post about everything people were getting in like flame Wars about Linux file systems literally like so but when they talk to people that are in the youth Community again a lot of those folks there were early ethereum backers back Solana a lot of the super early those folks became validators and like started businesses that are multi-chain I never felt like there was like a hate coming up from like especially not from like vitalik or Justin or democrat or any of the core devs like I think they've been awesome and like super helpful so the if like people [ __ ] posts on Twitter I think it's just like I don't know I don't even know if they believe what they're saying whatever I don't really like get it the let it get to me um stuff that's I think valuable that comes out of that is like arguing about decentralized like actually getting to the Nuance of trustlessness like how do you minimize trust what what are the trade-offs with sharding what are the trade-offs with big hardware systems like Solana like I think a lot of value is actually created there by getting the terms right getting to the Nuance of the trade-offs so like in some ways like uh like my conversations with donkrat it has have influence like Solana's design it's like this is awesome I do think that's a underutilized tool of uh of Twitter and sometimes can be drowned out by all the noise uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been

see you in the Discord so we've talked a lot about kind of the the birth and the growth of Solana and you know 2020 and 2022 uh but you said something really interesting uh about uh you know to actually uh 2022 specifically and that you were at the breakpoint conference I believe when some of the FDX stuff started to to Bubble Up um can you just tell me about like that whole experience because I feel like up to that point um the Solana community in general um fared fairly well I mean it was a rough year for crypto right we had Terra Luna uh that was really bad for the Terra Luna ecosystem of course then we had three hours capital and we had kind of [ __ ] Celsius uh C5 is very shaky you know through all of that Solana seemed kind of fine of course prices down down but price is down everywhere but this particular event the FDX kind of event the unfolding of that had to hit the Solana Community hard in fact I know it did um partially because I think whether whether fair or not um Sam begman freed was seen as a champion of Solana and I think he was very much in the early days so tell us about that event when did you first catch wind of that what were the thoughts going through your head and how did that affect you and the Solana community there's like it was basically on the flight back is when I started seeing the tweets coming out of like Sam and binance and like that interaction between Alameda and like the balance sheet being leaked was like it was like the so the first kind of like flag but I didn't take it seriously it was like huh this balance sheet is that really what Alameda has that seems like not not great I like it does and that like the seeing binance's reaction and CZ like making that tweet and then how Alameda responded was when like my stomach started churning like holy [ __ ] like this might like be like a pretty bad event but no I again like I was really really shocked when like it unraveled to the point that it did like basically when Sam said that he's trying to sell FTX to binance was like holy [ __ ] something bad really really happens like I know how before that how would you characterize like uh Sam's relationship with the Solana Community was he a supporter uh he was obviously an investor at some level but like how is he involved in the early days like it was a big deal I think uh like that you know again no one really heard a Solana we just launched trying to get people to code in this like weird rust environment where it felt like writing Linux girl drivers the Sam saying that they're gonna build serum on Solana was a big deal that's that actually I think got a lot of developers to turn their heads and be like okay there's something here that's interesting because I think uh FTX Engineers had a pretty high reputation for like being like you know 10x Engineers if you want to call them about but like being a small team that can ship a lot of product and make good decisions like engineering decisions um that drove I think a lot of defy interests and like got a lot of folks in the early days to start building stuff um there was this like kind of relationship between us and Them where like if we had like product ideas or something like that like we could talk to them and be like hey is this like an API you can you guys add it or something like this that was like based on this assumption that like they have a lot of soul they're aligned with what Solana wants to do and they will like help us unblock stuff that's really really hard in crypto because of all the regulatory hurdles you have to jump but they have all the licenses they do all the kyc checks for their customers they can build really good experiences for people to like on board so like for example like the nft marketplace we wanted to build like was open source give the tools to creators let them for GitHub and go launch their own auction houses and that was the birth of meta blocks it was like very wordpressy they wanted like a centralized one that they control the experience that ran the markets on FTX but they use the source code that we built and they built that experience and uh it was the same data structure so those nfts could move in and out of Solana and that was awesome like I think they tried to go get product Market fit for that thing and it failed metaplex I think succeeded so stuff like that like was more like product engineering like flowing um but that like collapse was like really painful to watch because I think a lot of people saw Sam as like one of the pillars of Solana right like like why why would you build on Solana well because Sam is building on it right and therefore like I'm in in a good group of people that are building awesome stuff it was kind of like a Joe Lubin type figure not kind of a co-founder but like almost like a consensus it felt like a little bit they could like build stuff like consensus kit consensus like 2 000 people right like I think that we are in Oregon with like Labs is like 75 people we just don't have that scale to go build a bunch of stuff um having that like disappear overnight was like pretty shocking um and jarring and like I was like holy [ __ ] is this is everything gonna die now okay so like shocking and jarring uh I I will tell you 2022 shook my faith in people yeah uh once again at a level I don't think I felt even in in 2018 uh kind of like faith in humanity faith in people that I thought were I mean many many folks were on on high pedestals in uh the crypto community and they just um completely failed from a trip to 2022 shook me like 2008 sounded like it shook people yeah did you feel that I mean like are you immune to that are you impurities or like people are people did I get like burned down on that and I like I don't even know um I'm a very kind of trusting person like I didn't have any reservations with like working closely with Sam and maybe in retrospect you gotta like you should probably should like be cautious about with anyone in crypto and that like and I don't like being that I don't like having to think like are there alternative motives or are they doing something Shady because it's just like it's exhausting that sucks I think and and knowing how like developers think and work I think that you Anatoly are are a Dev who wants to do Dev things and so probably to like have to consider is SPF a good actor or not is like not it's not you just want to build right is that a fair take yeah we wanted to like make the network faster and like get more [ __ ] on more more people using it I think that if I want to put on my my uh super critic hat of Solana and I'll like this is echoed and like a lot of like the eth Maxi circles is that like Solana just ended up being a place for Mercenaries in this last bull market SBF being one of them there's that guy that like spun up like a bunch of like that ecosystem of defy apps that pumped up the tvl now being investigated by the doj like do you would you say like the eth criticism the eth Maxi criticism of Solana as just like a place for Mercenaries to operate uh how would you feel about that that Chris that critique of Solana inside of it's like 2021 to 2022 era um I think though those folks definitely suck like I'm not disagreeing with you there [Music] um I don't know if Solana had like more of them than ethereum or like proportionally more even um because there was a lot of like [ __ ] that happened on every on ethereum as well and those I mean would it be wrong for me to say that like those were the two growing ecosystems that in in that era that actually experience pretty rapid growth Finance March into right like I think BSC came out and like Bruno produced substantial site and also experience it a big pile of like shitty actors um I think I don't know what like we can do better as like a community uh to kind of like have an immune response to push those people out faster um like there's just some stuff that's like I kind of thought would happen on its own like people would pick open source software over closed Source but they don't they just like pick whatever is like the shiny new thing and they only like look beyond that so that was like to me kind of surprising that you saw the market not resolve that on its own and like simple things like that like is the dev building immutable smart contracts that are open source that have been audited and like it was a development done in the open that would probably filter out like 99 of these folks like just because the folks that want to take those shortcuts are the ones or the ones that are trying to like you know uh take people's money right like and and like for and lie or whatever they're the that same article that I was referencing earlier titled on medium the year that Solana blew up uh in blew up in a good way it might it might have a double meaning when FTX blew up but uh there was a part on cultural debt that I thought was was really really interesting and something that like I really enjoyed reading out of uh especially when it coming from somebody who worked at Solana the uh they wrote as a result we have a massive cultural debt in our community one that must be repaid what what make what do you think when you hear this what I what I think about is that like there are a lot of projects that kind of launched as fast as they could to get either funding or product Market fit or users and they didn't like audit they didn't do open source development from the start they didn't build immutable smart contracts they didn't use a black governance or like a multi-sig for for their upgrades Authority like that kind of stuff I think is like very sloppy and it's something anything that got like instilled a little bit too deep in the Solana culture for that bull market I mean what's weird is that like Armani and like the core Solana devs that you like look at that are like you know Armani the Cheeto guys mango like all those folks are like doing the right thing they like build like Labs didn't build the tooling for people to verify their programs on chain like they did right like they they did all of the stuff to like because they wanted to see it and those are like the people that uh When I Look to like who are this core Solana developers there's those folks and there's like a whole bunch of people in the periphery that were trying to make money as fast as they could that like took those shortcuts I don't know how like how we correct that or is that a self-correcting thing because over time it's just those doubts are the ones gonna are gonna be here in the next cycle and all the other [ __ ] are not oh I'll tell you my take on that I do think it's kind of um self-correcting if you can survive and one of the one of the signs as somebody who's been interested in the Solana Community but kind of wait and see what happens is I almost feel like um bear markets are so good for purifying I think the the charge that David just said yeah it's the purge um of you know Solana being full of mercenaries this is exactly what bitcoiner said about ethereum uh in 2018 basically there's all these Ico scams who who in ethereum who is here for the right reasons could deny there weren't a lot of people that took advantage of the base layer of ethereum to race scammy Ico pump and dumps and exit a ton of that happened um but they weren't the people that stuck around and so from my vantage point and it's only a very much been paying attention to how the Solana Community fares during this bear Market season it's it's being tested in kind of the the fiery Crucible of a bear market and if it survives if it shows sign of life if the builders continue to build that to me is a is a bullish sign that uh Salon is going to persist and continue doing meaningful things for the community so it's almost in some way when we were talking about at the beginning like how about 2022 is like was it good year would you race it if you could um I wouldn't in fact I think that and this might sound okay it's like if I were to say something to the salon Community I think that this is a blessing actually for Salon to actually have to go through this it was too easy wasn't it it can't be this easy you can't just go from like 11 freaking cents or whatever to like 250 dollars twenty thousand people you can't just do that all right there has to be some uh trough of disillusionment there has to be some washout there has to be some purification some testing uh along the way for Solana to really figure out what its culture is what its values are and whether the builders are going to continue to build so uh that's what I'm kind of looking for and I I don't know if we're in the section of we get to talk about like future for Solana yet there might still be some other things to cover but I I don't know if you share that sense with me in Italy like this is the the testing phase for the community oh man it's uh the testing phase sucks it does suck uh it sucks I wanna like the it sucks because it's like deflating for a lot of the people that are doing the right things that are taking slower I think that happened on ethereum as well but like I think the like compound and Navi and all those folks are are awesome right they they build really good products and like they're an example that I think everyone should look up to um I hope we have like the same kind of cohort of people survive that can become leaders like in the next cycle but getting through this phase sucks for sure yeah yeah uh so so Anatolia here we are in 2023 and I kind of want to just do like a snapshot uh an audit of the current state of Solana because there are some parallels that I see to the state of the ethereum community not necessarily the ethereum project because there's philosophical differences that will always make it different but the state of the ethereum community and the state of the Solana Community right uh Solana is just coming out of the overhang of SBF right and FTX massive forced seller of Soul into the market I kind of see a similar parallel of honestly like Joe Lubin and consensus in ethereum 2018 big forced seller of eth because of the operating cost of consensus and to say absolutely nothing about any sort of similarity between Joe Lubin and SPF couldn't be more different just the nature of the fourth selling of a large holder of the bag and then also like in ethereum 2018 you had the Ico treasuries big just sellers into the market and between like like Joe Lubin selling for consensus icos selling in uh because of their treasuries like just drove the East price down and I kind of see that with FTX being a four seller and also funds I uh you know unsure uncertain rumors uh about like multi-coin being being needing to to sell their soul and selling their soul into the market as well and other funds as well you know all of the VCS that did own soul and in ethereum with all the icos sold their eth it was a massive distribution same thing with consensus same thing with like Joe Lubin one of the biggest most concentrators holders of eth all the Ico treasuries big concentrate did Holdings of eth had to sell it into the bottom of the market to the few remaining community members who were the the still bullish on the future of ethereum and that has to be what's going on with Solana right now where you had the concentrated VCS uh you had the four seller of FTX selling soul into the market and distributing the the soul token to the last remaining people who are who are bullish Solana that that's my like snapshot of like where Solana is and so can is that a fair take and can you kind of provide your own like audit of the Solana ecosystem like how are people feeling when where are they where are they at right now I mean the a lot of like the stuff that's happening I think in in like that's pretty exciting is like development of new defect protocols data drift like folks building like new Perpetual markets and like figuring out how to use the chain for to like get to that vision of like let's replace trade five Runway above Solana and like have enough have like a competitive system to to nicely that's happening I think that's pretty exciting and those are really dedicated teams that are working really really hard um and that sucks because D5 has been like hurt the most uh on the network but I'm like pretty stoked about that um the nft community is like uh very thriving it's like I think arguably the second it's the second largest right and crypto would you guys agree with me it seems like by activity and by like numbers it's half about half the size of ethereum um that's very like I'm like proud of that like I didn't do it I didn't do anything but like it's awesome it's awesome to see that uh and like those folks are having fun and like building cool [ __ ] and like creating memes and like trying to build brands or whatever um there's always constant controversy because it's big enough to where that's just a continuous thing but that that is awesome um a lot of the mobile kits for the Solana mobile all the deaf kids sold out so we have like a very strong I don't know how how that's gonna translate to Consumers but there's a very strong like developer like uh psyth relief that there is like a chance for an App Store that isn't controlled by Apple or Google that's coming from from the folks in the community I think that's that to me is pretty awesome um I don't know if people are still like kind of down when they got are thinking about like FTX and all this stuff that maybe I don't know like I think that the bear Market was so bad up until that point that maybe this was like uh like bad news in the best possible time like it just happened the Band-Aid is ripped off now everyone's thinking about the future like my personal like Vibes are like um I'm a bit exhausted from like the negative news and I want to see like some wins I want to see people launch products and build cool [ __ ] um that that you can't really do anywhere else so that to me is like what I what I'm excited about well and it's only one of the things that make me really optimistic about the current state of Solana is Solana is the only blockchain in crypto after ethereum that has a second client and this is like one of these like things about crypto that makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills that no one cares about having a multi-client architecture about their blockchain it's it's insane that Bitcoin is like only one client and if there's a bug in it that is that bug is Bitcoin that's Bitcoin we're gonna run with that bug like that's insane that's crazy and so like I see a lot of like the fact that Salon is developing fire dancer I think in partnership with jump I think maybe you can go into the details but that's to me a huge photo of confidence that we finally have a second blockchain ecosystem that has a multi-client architecture so I kind of want to lead and open up this next conversation the last bit of this conversation is like the future of Solana as like what make us bullish about the future of Solana like what what's make it like entice us to like stick around in the community during the bear market and maybe you can also dive into the to the second client so I mean people are always worried about like scalability how's it going to scale where are you going to get more throughput if it's a monolithic chain with no shouting um then like fire dancers like uh the example of how you can use software to utilize commodity Hardware stuff you can buy off the shelf to move a lot of memory and a lot of signatures through these systems and like scale the network they've done demos that are like on the this is like the block producer stage that can handle like 600 000 to a million transactions per second on a on this is on commodity Hardware like do do dual CPU like Intel systems they're expensive but you can buy them and by the time you need that much capacity it's going to run on like whatever whatever desktop you can buy on fries the cool thing about it is that it's just performance optimizations there's not like protocol changes there's no like magic unknown science fiction that we need to build uh it's fairly straightforward stuff that like every database engineer like has gone through like when they need to go from like when they need to step level the the performance of the system um so it's going to get done it's just gonna work I'm like very confident that there's no like there's no magic that needs to happen um and it's a second client and why a second client is important in a high performance system like I think you can argue that Bitcoin is so slow that with 10 minute blocks if something goes wrong that the community has enough time to like maybe revert eight hours worth of blocks or something like that and that's reasonable what that means about Bitcoin finality is like a whole other topic but for a high performance system we need guarantees that the state is final and with two clients if they ever diverge Network Cults so at a gut level you're you're actually trading liveness for safety like if if humans wrote this code and humans they're failable and they wrote bugs and those bugs are catastrophic to where there's a state invalid State transition exploit then two systems written by two different groups of people in different languages different tools it's very unlikely that they'll have the same bug and if they ever diverge and the network has at least 33 percent on both clients then the network will health and humans will be like are needed to go figure out why now if you had four clients it's even better and I think the goal for ethereum is to have four clients right um so if you have then it's very unlikely that two of them will have the same bug so one of them goes down 75 percent of the network is still live and you maintain liveness now to get to four clients it'll take a lot of work but eventually the cool thing about what fire dancer is doing is they are also building a speck of what Solana is so it's much much easier to where like there's an agreed upon spec of all the definitions of all the protocols and formats um that's all in one place for somebody to get them go look at like okay this is how Labs did it this is how firedancer did it we can rewrite this and go or whatever and make it plenty fast now you can have three or four clients that's five years from now maybe like will be a priority but like these hero I think we need to get to second client simply because safety is Paramount like and then like what keeps me up at night is like the scariest thing in the world is a the code execution bug in the runtime that causes like tokens to be minted or state to be corrupted and like that's catastrophic that that's like the scariest thing um and like it's code written by humans you know like the best Engineers working on the Linux kernel sometimes introduce your days and that that's just really really frightening I think the other unique thing uh that differentiates Solana from any old uh evm clone is uh it's VM can you uh talk about the Solana VM and how it's Unique and differentiated from other VMS in the space yeah everyone that like used the ethereum VM just got a free ride which is smart because you're using a VM that's securing a very large amount of dollars right in you and that's a very large Bounty uh to find every possible bug uh but you are giving up a lot of performance like the like as I earlier described like the whole point of Solana is like we I'm we like remove the cap and bandwidth if the network has x amount of bandwidth it can stuff all of it with transactions it means you can have very large amount of throughput like hundreds of thousands of TPS and old-school one gigabit standards now the hard part is then like how do you actually process all of them and how do users actually take advantage of this throughput in a single state machine that's a it's very very tricky to actually write systems that allow for parallelism for on the at the user level so the runtime as this design is built kind of from the ground up with that idea like we built the system so when transactions flow through this thing they can be processed in parallel as fast as possible and um that's very different from how evm is constructed and that means that like we had to build not only just the consensus layer and like a whole and like the tooling and all this other [ __ ] we also had to build an EV like a evm equivalent like a touring machine equivalent virtual machine um if we didn't do that like you would basically see like kind of a slightly faster ethereum that could do maybe like 30 to 50 TPS like it would be very limited by how evm works and how Memphis work and a whole bunch of other stuff so and it's only um very much like ethereum I think in the depths of 2018 um some people out there maybe even a lot of people out there are saying Solana's not going to make it right they're not saying that about Bitcoin I still don't think they're saying that about ethereum I mean some people are saying all of crypto's not going to make it but let's put those haters aside all right different podcast it's not a typical Bank list listener but some people have doubts about Solana is Solana gonna make it through the bear what is your case for why Solana will make it through this bear Market out on the other side stronger Solana the token or the network let's talk about both the network will make it I mean like the tech is there like if it's it's just like go Fork it and run sold Solana new salon or whatever right like the code is there it's awesome people like using it so like I think in that sense we have enough traction and enough like devs that want to keep this thing going to where it'll keep going um the rest is like I think very much macro dependent I think that's like a big question for like probably all of the smart contract platforms except for ethereum is like are we gonna be in like a high interest rate environment for the next five years where everything gets all the like all the riskier bats get squeezed down and there's no traction that means that there's nothing for Solana to do that's useful to the world that ethereum doesn't cover even if Salon is 100 times faster right even if we do more transactions and all the ethereum l2s combined they're not providing enough value to the world in that environment if they're not that means it's not going to survive now that's like the big the big if and that I don't know like that's a big if for crypto what is crypto doing right now that is so crucial to the world that it can't live without it um how do you feel about Solana's chances then how do you feel about that pet I think um honestly I feel pretty good like I think the fact that um we have like this thriving nft Community which was built totally accidentally like neither myself or Raj or like nft gurus this just happened because the ux was better and it was cheap and fast and no one has been able to replicate that uh and like get the get that going I think to me speaks that there's something there in the talk that'll continue like derive value to the real world from from the Chan and if there is like companies like magic Eden or whatever and the long tail of like nft startups that have real world revenues they're actually like making money on the web that excludes the like ad Tech like it's not Google revenues anymore it's like web3 crypto weird revenues that are people like to have with like hundreds of thousands of users it means the underlying base layer will survive in some some shape or another and that that's awesome like this is like my bear I put on my like worst hat bear hat everything's going to [ __ ] interest rates are 10 or is like the web 3 nft business model survive I think so and if that's true I think Solana survives you got to feel better about your chances than versus 2018 when you hold started this whole thing right um I felt uh chances are I feel like way more bullish now than 2018 2019. like uh like people don't even I mean there's so much funding that's still happening in crypto there's so many like smart young people that are like not joining the big companies and they're like building awesome products um my guess is if you like looked at all the product launches from inception to crypto to now to what's going to happen in the next like 12 to 18 months the next 12 to 18 months is probably going to be way more than everything else combined up to this point and if people are launching products they're grinding for product Market Fair they're going to get users me and script was going to survive it's just like that's gonna happen and it's only uhola thanks for this conversation it's way more fun to have this conversation in the bear Market actually it gives us a chance to kind of take a breath and and um hear what's really going on and uh we're excited about what the Solana Community is doing so thanks for joining us for sure oh last question for you okay you said monolithic chain with no sharding is that still the strategy I'm just checking yeah sure about that yeah there's no way that sharding is going to get information faster around the world there you go this is the strategy use it still the difference and totally you said uh that uh if Solana can do more transactions than all the theory ml2s combined is that do you think that that's gonna happen that Solana can do more TPS and all theorem l2s command I'm pretty sure though yeah you got it gotta admire the confidence here and uh yeah brother it's uh I think this is what levels up the entire crypto Community as a bunch of Builders uh in competitive games friendly competitive games with one another uh Anatoly thanks so much for joining us appreciate you right bankless Nation we'll include some links in the show notes with some action items for you some further research you could do on Solana also on the multi-client architecture that and Tully was uh talking about that was called a fire dancer am I correct yes fire dancer uh we'll have links to that too as always gotta end with our risks and disclaimers you must Realize by now that crypto is pretty damn risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
