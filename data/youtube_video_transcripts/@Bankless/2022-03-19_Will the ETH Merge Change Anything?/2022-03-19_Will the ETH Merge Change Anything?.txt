we have the merge happening right reduction of eve issuance by like 90 say we are in the sideways kind of bearish 2018 time period does that actually have any effect on the markets or does that not matter when you're in a bear season it may not matter in the price for the short term but when the move actually happens it's going to matter a lot right because people will pick up on the narrative as soon as the price starts to support it so once proof of work goes offline the merge happens we're fully proof of stake the chances that ethereum is actually net deflationary consistently i think the probability of that's quite high and when you add something that has significant utility with the compute network of ethereum you put that together and it absolutely matters if i shoot to the future that's your ideal scenario right that that multi-year consolidation end up with some kind of chart pattern that everybody will talk about the ascending triangle on bitcoin it's going to 150 200k ethereum's going like 20k when that happens my conviction in that trade is very high my conviction in bitcoin being worth half a million dollars is not as high
