to like differentiate between trustwear and social awareness a little bit more trustware is code is law like it's on the chain and then social wear is like literally everything off chain would you accept those definitions yeah i sort of like the comparison of like a lemonade stand versus a venting machine like a lemonade stand relies on social wear of like you the vendor like are asking for payment and i'm agreeing to those rules whereas vending machine is like if i literally don't put the money in like i don't get my lemonade and i think that is the key difference is like the reliance on human coordination or humans to execute on the decisions that were made
