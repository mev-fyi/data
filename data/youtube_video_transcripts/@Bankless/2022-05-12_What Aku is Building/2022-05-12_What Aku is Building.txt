you're in this development process thinking through storylines starting to do some test scenes how long does this take i know you've got to hold things you're building out we're talking a couple years probably gonna hit me with the roadmap question everything we're building is building towards a film and so when we think about these environments you need scenes and i think about environments think about if you want to make a scene in aku's city you're going to need to make the city and animate in a 3d version of it that's an asset that could be used in virtual world you just do things very methodically you have to have a story bible to understand what the story is once you have that then you can do this all of a sudden the world starts looking like this and like this and like this i don't think the text there yet from the ability to create these immersive experiences in unreal might be a couple months might be six months maybe eight months right but there stays out there right now that we can deliver and ship to people that are engaging but then when the lights turn on to the space trade boom i got you because i also don't believe in high priced in-game assets i believe in accessibility of micro transactions i just don't want to take advantage of people and just and we build this this is like here you go man just have fun
