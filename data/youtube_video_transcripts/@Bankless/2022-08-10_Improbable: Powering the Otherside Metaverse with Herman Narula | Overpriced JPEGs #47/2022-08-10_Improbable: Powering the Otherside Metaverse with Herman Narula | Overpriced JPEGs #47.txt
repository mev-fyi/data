[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i am so excited about today's episode and our guest here on the pod i have hermann narula who is the founder of improbable whose name you might have been hearing recently because improbable is the company behind yoga labs is other side metaverse so all of that crowing all over twitter that you were seeing about how impressive it was that there were 4 500 people in an experience all at once interacting seamlessly that is all the work of hermann's company improbable we are of course going to talk all about that herman you are also the author of a book virtual society that is coming out in october do i have that right absolutely plugging your book for you here you know right right up front making me smile straight away i'm like okay let's get some let's get some book sales i like to make my guest comfortable you know easy into this uh so of course we're gonna talk broadly about the metaverse i think you have an interesting definition for it and different an interesting way you approach it get a little technical here really understand get under the hood understand how you're doing what you're doing for other side and the other work you've done it's fascinating you have done a lot of virtual world work for like governments and and militaries so i really want to talk about all of that before we do we have to hear a word from our lovely lovely sponsors immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9000 transactions per second

us a sneak preview of maybe what your highest order thesis for that book is i'm guessing that will get us into your maybe unique thoughts on the metaverse sure i think a lot of techies and thinkers and pundits that we've all heard from in the last sort of year or two and a couple books have even come out this year they define the metaverse as basically a progression of the internet and video games and the idea behind that theory is that we're all going to be basically spending time in some kind of interconnected network of video games and naturally that's created an enormous amount of skepticism and bafflement from a lot of people i think not least the people who make video games because they're like we already have interconnected virtual world you know i think if i were like done what are you talking about like what are you what are you talking about you know and some of the sort of quote-unquote metaverses that we've seen in the last year don't even seem like compelling video games 10 years ago right if not for the financialization of crypto you know a lot of these projects i won't name names but you know the sort of top two three crypto metavas projects have less than a thousand peak ccu on a daily basis something like that in some cases so there are actually more people that work at my company that let them play on a daily basis which was kind of crazy in in in you know in in in to see projects that are worth billions so then i guess the reason i wrote the book is because i think the metaverse is a much bigger more important idea than just the next kind of marketing direction for facebook and i think it also predates technology and even the internet in a really profound way and i might be wrong but my basic thesis is that we have always lived in in a sense the real world and these other worlds and if you're a big sports fan you probably know what i mean like sports is like this other world where the things that happen there really matter to the real world even though they don't really matter at all right it doesn't really matter who wins the world cup but it affects geopolitics it doesn't really matter who kicks a ball into a net but it makes global celebrities that then you know become pundits for fashion brands and style icons and other things culture music stories uh other worlds these have always been a really fundamental part of our lives so the first the first thing that i put forward in the book is that this isn't entertainment this is actually just an extension of the way we conduct our society and the things that happen in these other worlds they're actually important to the real world and this is why for me the metaverse is not an extension of video games which are a closed loop of entertainment and fun i love video games and you know my company supports many video games businesses i think the medivas is something different it's an extension of culture it's a collection of virtual experiences and a network of meaningful events people objects and things that extend our society and the things that happen in the metaverse matter differently to the things that happen in ordinary video games because they can come right back and affect you in the real world affect society and affect other experiences as well so this notion of the metaverse is a network of meaningful and fulfilling experiences mediated through the transfer of value between those experiences and between the real world makes it an extension of our culture and why is it a good thing why is it better than what we already have you know there are a couple of really exciting elements to it i think one really exciting element is it opens up the possibility for really interesting and powerful experiences which wouldn't be commercially or practically viable in video games but become very viable within the construct of a metaverse so one really great example is you know massive stadiums of people hanging out together socializing with a celebrity or with each other like if you're a sort of you know manchester united fan in southeast asia you've never been to a game i can put you in a game with all these other fans screaming and shouting and interacting together so these these mass scale social events and these more one-off or or persistent but more socially driven experiences which aren't traditionally games you don't necessarily win or lose them although they can have gameplay mechanics and which don't require retention that's a really important new opportunity that metaverse technology and interconnected experiences where value can be shared is shown off i think the other really crucial thing i would say is the metaverse and crypto are just like any sane vision of the metaverse deeply meshes in crypto and web3 and the reason is because it's all about the transfer of value in and out of these experiences that's what starts to make them viable how does that celebrity hanging out with their fans sell t-shirts that then mean anything outside of that experience how do i in the real world you know get bring the community that i created in in in kind of the men of us to have meaningful power in the real world and this is again how they're different from video games superficially you look at a video game and and people's idea of the metaverse and you're like hey it's like a video game but vr but worse but as you go deeper you start to see you know where it can go and finally with the book i go a little bit crazy um you know in the last couple chapters where i posit that you know as we as we get ever more fulfilling experiences ever more important and interesting things that happen in these other realities i think we're set up as a species to to really start exploring these other worlds and investing in these other worlds and enriching our lives with these other worlds in really exciting ways for the future there's a lot of doom and gloom about the future for a lot of reasons and i think part of it is that our society generates so much crap and consumerism that is really bad for the environment and doesn't necessarily generate a lot of value for people in in a very fulfilling way i'm hopeful the medivas is a much more efficient way of creating value for millions of people around the world without all that weight there's so much there to unpack just taking that last point you made i also think you know bad news sells so when we when we see news about social media it's always negative it's about all of the the genuinely negative consequences of the social media world we live in but how many of us if given a magic wand and asked if we would you know eliminate social media from the world would actually do that or how many of us actually wish it had never been created but we don't focus on the aspects of it that are enriching our lives we see the news every day about you know mental health concerns and all those things are super valid but there's always positives and negative negatives to everything you preempted one of my questions by by talking about how critical crypto and and i think nfts as an extension are to this new world we'll probably dive a little bit more into that but i want to push on this question around this is an extension of real experiences because i love that definition as somebody who's not a gamer i've never been particularly compelled by the idea of like i'm just gonna run around gaming all the time because that's not what i do right now in my life these social experiences feel like they're much more in line with what i'm interested in but do you think is there a detraction at all if you're hanging out with your favorite celebrity but they don't look like the celebrity you know like if i'm hanging out with reese witherspoon which doesn't look like reese witherspoon will that really be as as as popular or is there this psychological shift that's going to happen for all of us where we are so accustomed to those kinds of experiences that they feel just as exciting and just as compelling to us as a real world experience would so i think that's a really good question and it kind of is another version of the question is a virtual experience a real experience and i think what you can touch on is what i wrote my book in is the idea of self-determination theory i love this branch of psychology and i encourage everyone to check it out it's about 30 years old with research that has been pretty conclusive to be honest at this point and the idea behind it is that what we crave what we need as human beings is our fulfilling experiences these are experiences that involve us actually doing things and in those experiences we're usually getting fulfilled in one of three ways competence which is the feeling of getting better at something so when roger federer like you know beat somebody at tennis you know his feeling of competence improves right or autonomy which is the feeling of making meaningful choices so if you're like playing the witcher and you're making a decision about you know a particular path your feeling of autonomy is increasing right and similarly with relatedness which is not socializing it's the feeling of meaning something to other people and what's interesting is these are not optional these are not entertainment these are not things you do when you're bored if you do not get these things from your workplace from your life from the experiences that you have available to you real psychological harm happens to you you feel disaffected you feel like your life is meaningless you feel like you know you you're some people who feel like they're born in the wrong time or don't have the ability to mean something in this world and similarly there's no limit to how fulfilling your life can be to how profoundly meaningful your experiences can be so in order to give fulfillment to as many people as possible virtual experiences present a really really incredible way of doing that and what's interesting is that the parts of the experience that are necessary for them to be fulfilling are nothing to do with realism so companies like facebook are hyper focused on realism right how real does the world look and if i'm in vr then maybe it feels more real i'm more immersed actually that doesn't seem to be how human beings work while realism is awesome and i hope that you know they crack it and it becomes a cool part of the experience what's much more important is presence the feeling that your actions matter that the things you do mean something in the world it's no accident that some of the biggest games in the last couple of years fortnite minecraft they actually look a lot uglier than games made ten years before those come sacrifice graphics because they didn't they realized that people didn't care so much how it looked they cared more about the gameplay they cared more about the actual opportunities to have to take interesting actions and have interesting experiences in the world so when you look at things that way a k-pop concert in the metaverse which we put on last year with alexa who just won the american song contest and thousands of her fans it wasn't about the fact that they were they were there to hear her sing it was about the fact that she and them and those videos on youtube i encourage people to check out kind of connect in a way that they couldn't do in a real stadium you know everyone flooded the stage and jumped on top of her and she started laughing and like grew into a giant size and threw people around and identified people in a particular name you couldn't really do that in the real world you know you're just gonna be one person blaring like you know you're waving your phone from the back you know you're never gonna get the opportunity to interact so that back and forth interaction is really powerful you sort of see it a little bit with twitch streamers right now and youtubers who are a little bit more like back and forth with their audience but this can supercharge it to another level well it's also striking to me that what we've seen in the last i don't know i guess you could argue decade or something is this losing trust in institutions losing trust in the things that look super highly produced you know call it cable news stations or or anything that that feels really polished and arise in podcasters and people like sitting in their homes where there's this almost authenticity there you know i was thinking of that as you're talking about how like roblox is more popular now even though it looks you know less beautiful than whatever grand theft auto or whatever um how focused are you on the realism question it sounded like you're like kind of leaving that to meta well it's more i want things to look incredibly beautiful so we we do everything we can to make the that we're working on beautiful and you can use vr with our technology in fact our technology has been used more for vr games than people realize some of the biggest vr games um of the last year duplicate things like zenith started off on our old technology spatial os not on new stuff morpheus which other side is powered by so it's all viable we don't in any way limit the graphical fidelity of worlds and i think a lot of our content can be can be at the top end of what any engine can produce but i just don't think that's going to be the most popular content i think the most popular content is going to be the content that gives people in the most accessible experience possible like we went out of our way to ensure that um you could use a phone connection with just a 350 kilobits per second bandwidth to access our world when you download the client so with other side we did streaming but you can actually down with the client because i'm really keen that like i don't know i'm from india so the idea of like somebody who's like driving a truck in india and loves qriket could pull out their phone and just on a 3g connection for the first time in their entire life go to a qriket match you know with fans in the uk and fans in india speak with their own voice everybody's shouting and chanting they're actually having their voice heard they're part of this experience and that creates an incredible level of fulfillment that i don't think is going to become more fulfilling or less fulfilling depending on how realistic the characters around them look but it will be more or less fulfilling depending upon how much they feel like those people are real people who are interacting with them so graphics are important they're part of the question but the focus here is presence not immersion immersion is how real you think the world is presence is how real the world thinks you are and that's the most important oh wow that's that's the difference and so that's why this is also why people were like why are you doing large crowds why are you so focused on that why are you so focused on everyone speaking like i can't actually make out what that person one kilometer away in other side screaming at the top of the lungs is saying but just the fact that you know that you can hear them and the fact that you know that they can hear you psychologically changes your relationship with the experience how distinct are you all in in that being your focus it doesn't probably stand very unique in that focus uh relative to maybe other players in the space we have um you know and this is where obviously i'm kind of plugging us but you know i think i can be pretty confident with some of these statements um we've built a suite of at this point production tested technology that is the only platform that is actually consistently run large-scale events with you know thousands and thousands of people the metric to think about is operation operations per second i was going to ask you about that because so many people say i had a 10 players or a thousand players well if your players were just pixels you can have as many players as you like right because they aren't doing anything or interacting in any way shape or form what matters is the amount of useful information being exchanged in the world it's like a budget like a budget of experience and you can spend that budget on 10 characters that do very little or do a lot or a thousand characters that do very little right and different companies that are doing that our number at the moment you know something like fortnite does 10 000 operations a second which is pretty cool and they can support 100 players facebook globally with facebook messenger handles about a million messages a second now it's a very different problem but just the kind of numbers in scope and in scale we currently do a billion operations a second a billion operations a second we had to and that means whenever you increase that number everything has to change so we had to create our own machine learning based rendering algorithm that can custom render every character in different animation states at any distance from where you're standing we had to invent our own bandwidth compression technology we had to invent our own testing infrastructure we had to invent our own back-end systems to even be able to understand how these types of systems operate and run and so when people think of improbable they shouldn't think of it as one piece of deck they should really think of it as a collection of technology and know-how and we're not stopping there like you know our goal internally is 10 billion operations a second like i won't be happy until we have 100 000 people i mean we can support 15 000 people in a super rich environment right now i think at 100k there isn't a stadium on this planet there isn't like well there's some but you know there's very few things in this world that require a hundred thousand people to show up at the same time it reminds me of elon musk talking about how tesla is actually like 30 companies i don't think i think he's got seven companies or something in one because when you're sounds like what you're doing is having to build so much from the ground up like you know across different industries and we'll get into that because you've you've sort of talked about how building for the metaverse is different than building for the internet up to this point has been and i think it's starting to get at that like question of just how many things that have to be built but on this question of operations per second i wanted to throw an idea out there to you and get your reaction so from an investing perspective or or like a you know monetary value perspective what you hear about a lot is netcast law and the idea that you know the value of facebook grew exponentially as it's like user-based crew where you know there's some you know correlation basically between the the value of the business company network whatever and the number of users it has and it grows exponentially with each new user you're talking about adding new users but also the capabilities the amount of like spokes coming out of each of those users in terms of what they can do is also tremendously higher than in like a 2d social media environment does that take does that like exponentialize netcast law like when you think about the way value will explode it does yeah i think it does look we choose to live in cities for a reason right we choose to go through markets in the real world where you might hear someone singing a song or notice something you didn't imagine you know think of your favorite role-playing game or your favorite dungeons and dragons campaign it's all about serendipity and discovery and the interconnection and relationships between things like if there was one thing i would emphasize the most is that for a metaverse to be valuable and that of us is a network of meaning so it's as valuable as the size of the network yes but also as as the relationships between the things in the network right let's just take a difference between the travis scott concert in fortnight and the alexa concert that we did now millions of people showed up to see the travis scott concert but actually what happened was there were rooms of a hundred people all separated from each other in completely separate instances watching a pre-recording of travis scott or even if he was there he wasn't able to directly interact with with any of the fans it's still awesome i don't want to throw shade i mean it was an incredible event i loved it it was really really cool but it was more like watching a music video than going to a concert you know at a concert you know you talk about were you there did you see that crazy dude that was dangling from the ceiling and then you know like left to one side did you see the mosh pit did you randomly come across someone you know these moments these these grand gather gatherings of human beings they don't happen all the time in a great virtual world or a great network but the fact that they can happen is an incredibly important element in understanding its value there's also a very basic economic thing here which is so many businesses make absolutely no sense unless you can have large scale for instance um celebrities and sporting events which i focus on quite a lot you know if taylor swift is showing up and individually meeting rooms of 100 people she's going to be here till the age of the universe you know before she can hang out with with you know with with everyone so you need concentrated groups of people to kind of make this stuff work and one thing though worth mentioning when you talk about uh networks and netcast law is that we're also very focused on the internet of mata versus so we've called this m squared but the idea here is that other side is one metaverse among several other metaverses and by being the technology provider under the hood we're able to create levels of interoperability that have never been possible before so you can just take your avatar and instantly move from one world to another and it'll just work and you'll just be in a space that can that can operate the way you hope it do and that creates even more value because i can make my own business and my own shop and know that what i'm selling will be useful in many worlds and i think that's kind of been a little bit of the dream for a lot of folks i mean this is huge and this is a huge topic we'll dive into which is the the dream that those of us in web 3 have which is that this is a fully interoperable experience in the future and that's of course where the concern around meta comes in is that that will probably be a closed ecosystem or or just gouge you in in some capacity so and actually maybe let's let's go there i saw you react do you want to give me your your thoughts on meta and then we'll really dive into this interoperability question it's it's interesting because um there's we can talk about it morally and we can talk about it economically and i want to start economically because i think it's almost a stronger argument right which is the big closed platforms like let's say youtube or social media they work really well because the cost of making content is so low like pennies to put up a video or a tweet or i mean if if that like you know given the quality of some of the stuff right but that that cost um means that i don't care if 80 90 of the value is taken by the platform provider you know because in reality if they change their algorithm or ruin my business and my business is only really worth even at the top top influencer level you know a couple of million dollars a year you know you're not going to ipo that business fine we can kind of live with that loss of value but the metaverse is very very different in the metaverse companies you know we talk about user-generated content what will drive the metaverse is business-generated content you know those stadiums those sports those taylor swift swift concerts those bazaars those marketplaces those massive architectural edifices yes a lot of them will be made by individuals but a great number of those individuals are going to want to start businesses and seek investment in those businesses and the problem here is if you are building a business on someone else's closed platform that business is not attractive to investors they cannot give you capital because in reality your business could evaporate tomorrow it has a ceiling on its growth and on the value that it can capture it's not just about the fee the fee could be big or small and there are many viable options where that can work it's also about the fact that anything could change at any time so one of the things we've we've tried to do is take a completely opposite view to not just facebook but also epic and also roblox which is we're building a network where although we are providing some of the key technology the network outlives us and makes decisions eventually that we even even weak on reverse and it tries to guarantee as much stability as possible on the basic rules of the network the other thing i'd point out is that a lot of the big internet companies that that i come out of what i kind of call the dark ages of the internet which we're sort of leaving right now you know we have these feudal kings who basically like rule these areas and if you're not among one of them like you're kind of screwed these feudal kings they take a huge toll and as a result they depress the ability for new innovation to happen they used to be good for innovation but now they've become a problem for innovation so moving away from that model to more of a network where value can be shared and where very small fees are needed at the bottom all the value goes up to the top as well like a small um small anecdote i'd throw in as you know bill gates of all people famously and did not want a fee for an app store or for windows or for or for applications to run on top because he said the value shouldn't be at the operating system level the value should be in the applications it's funny how like now we're used to the idea of you know paying 30 to do an apple app store but when you think about it back in the day obviously things have changed now but back in the day the idea was to create like to kind of encourage the content creators to get as rich as possible which is a big part of how these networks need to operate so if you don't follow this model you have to pay everybody for content if you do follow this model people pay you for content and that's a much much better way to function i'm curious too how much you know you're saying we can stomach the loss of value that comes from you know because the biggest content creators are making millions but there are businesses that were built upon facebook or google and built upon their ad system and getting in front of those billions of people that are pretty big so i i almost feel like it's it's maybe partly that it was amount of business that we could feel comfortable losing but also just ignorance and we're not so ignorant anymore like like we've all now learned and you just can't stomach it moving forward to some extent yeah but a lot of those businesses ended up dying because the platform copied their features and used its dominant position to just absorb the business almost all the profit itself is sucked up by the platform like the the actual value being created by an awesome youtube creator is a lot more than the value that they can take out which means that they can't reinvest that value so yes there are businesses that have that have on the monolithic platform survived and prospered and some of these platforms are like multi-billion user platforms but when we're building the metaverse from scratch you can't really make that argument you know there's like two thousand people in sandbox into central land you know we're not at the stage yet where where we're gonna be where we're gonna you can have that kind of power you don't have to leverage these pop-ups facebook's main challenge is the hubris of imagining they can recreate what apple did and what apple did was only possible because of a confluence of luck opportunity and circumstance that led to that level of centralization like i just don't see that happening ever again um because of the nature of collaboration required to go do it and this is also why i'm such a big web three proponent right crypto and web3 forget all the consumer use cases like nfts and tokens and all the good and the bad that comes from that the b2b use cases are profound this lets businesses share value and share a platform's value much simpler than having one of us own it or another one own it that's the power because it lets all of us invest more in in what those and what those businesses could be let me see if i have what you're saying there right like the reason this is so powerful from a b2b level i just did an interview with um an svp at turner sports right and then he seems genuinely quite excited about the idea of really being in co-creation with the fans of the sport leagues that are their partners and that those fans will both get value from from that co-creation and then imbue value into the network is that co-creation and while on the surface that feels antithetical or scary to these historically centralized business models because it feels like you're maybe getting less value the idea is that tremendously more value the pie is going to be so much bigger that that everyone will end up better off including the centralizer you know turner themselves will probably have more value they'll get out of this because the pie is just bigger is is that essentially what you're getting at there i do believe the buy will be much much bigger and that'll mean all the services will do better but i do think some of the existing large tech companies are going to be very challenged including large game companies like so let's just take an example here right if you were previously in the position of just selling people skins and items which they could not resell or financialize in any way shape or form then you're making money from that that basically goes down when those people start being able to resell those items or even ditch the investment they've made in your ecosystem for a different one so it's not necessarily immediately good for you long term it's great because more players are willing to invest because their investment is safer they can take it from a player you know from one place to another so that's kind of an example the other small thing i'd add is um you know i talk a little bit about this in kind of the tyrant and the comments part of my book but these large companies are just databases in a sense their databases with a fee right like if you want to access the social graph of facebook you pay the fee if you want to access the buyers and sellers and products on amazon you pay a fee if you want to access just information on the internet you pay a fee to google and these databases with fees on top make it very difficult for companies to collaborate on building fundamental services but if web3 can let us take those databases and make them owned by everyone then the value doesn't accumulate in the kind of database gatekeeper it accumulates at the application level and that's what we should all be pushing for so i totally agree and love that and i think that's what we all should be pushing for you you were mentioning these like incredible opportunities on a business level and those seem uh like antithetical to one another right so that's what i'm trying to push at is to get a little more clarity on where you think the the value is oh sure i basically think sure so let's let's imagine that um you're a company that wants to provide um a marketplace for virtual objects right you have a really good idea of how you're going to buy allow people to buy sell and discover virtual objects you're going to help creators rank those objects and companies think about that in the way that we're architecting the m squared let's say before m squared that marketplace would just get owned by whatever company around the platform that's how it would work you know that they would just completely own every aspect of it and that's how it would work what we're now able to do is to go okay you know what the marketplace could be powered by an underlying database or set of sdks which are owned by the network and all token holders can share in the value of that and then anyone can build a marketplace and so marketplaces can compete right and the competing marketplaces they can innovate in ways that are not really possible when one company dominates owning that kind of that kind of element i mean maybe you or i could build a better version of a facebook messenger or a whatsapp messenger but we'd have to start from scratch yeah we've never been you'll never be given that chance they'll buy us out long before or litigate us out long before we get there and that's really dumb because actually all those all those messages all those users their hours you know those social relationships that information that actually is ours i mean in any moral in any moral sense i think the other big problem with the sort of tyrannical tech company ruling everything is you can this is kind of to be fair to facebook because they've had a really and they've made some mistakes obviously but they've also had a really been put in a very difficult position they have to act with the authority of a government over a group of largest largest countries on earth but they have no mandate to act on behalf of those people right because people have not voted for them or enfranchised them in any way shape or form so any decision they make is the wrong one because why do you get why do you get to make this decision networks with voting and dows and the opportunity for these networks to provide not just financial ownership but actually decision making power to create those merchants and users as we want to do with m squared that's very different like if 10 million people on m squared who are all working inside metaverses they voted on something like let's say in the fa in the future they could vote on you know how they feel a minimum wage might work for many of us workers right everybody kind of has to live with that even governments have to respect you know democratic processes involving millions of people there are countries in the uk that are smaller i mean in europe sorry that uh that are smaller than just a few million people you know so these can be very very powerful entities if you trust the community if you enfranchise the community coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform

morpheus can you explain those to their interaction and this will really get us to the interoperability stuff that i think is so so so critical so in order to um so morpheus is essentially a suite of ever-evolving tools that allow you to build really compelling experiences that are not possible today in traditional game engines or tools the big headline thing is yes you can have thousands of people all in one space but you can do so much more than that you can have physics with thousands of people and objects all in a dense environment you can use any streaming solution like we've got partners like google stream but you could use others too and stream out your world so a single link click lets you jump into the world you can download and operate a client on a mobile with tiny amounts of bandwidth you can have everyone speak with our voice solution you can render everything on screen with our rendering plugins that allow for this you can easily author content and build worlds or virtual objects using open standards that we're publishing that are going to be a key part of how you create content within this world so morpheus is all about empowering the experiences and why that's important is that if a medivas doesn't provide an experience i can't get in a video game why am i there right like why am i there and in the end like you have to have differentiated experiences m squared is different m squared is going okay how do we actually provide the key services that allow a metaverse to exist have commerce have identity have virtual objects have all of the data that's necessary some data on chain because it should be on chain some data off chain because no chain can really support running it yet all of that information in all of the sdks and tools that allow you to kind of build your own metaverse and plug in and also the um the kind of things that create the right level of governance and token economy around that that is m squared m squared is like our kind of level one internet of metaversus and it's designed to be multi-chained interface with all the existing chain ecosystems and it's designed to really bridge each world you might want to build with other kinds of businesses that could work into that as well so with m squared you know you could build your own metaverse you could build a business that serves metaversus you could build a marketplace you could do all of those things things that would traditionally all be owned by one company we want to encourage many companies to go and do really naturally open source you're it's exactly as much of it as we can um and partly to create additional confidence in the way that the way that the system operates and it's gonna it's gonna feel and be governed and be run a lot like um blockchain projects that are out there now to be categorically clear we're not we're not we don't think we need to actually focus on something like building a level one to support that there are already lots of great level one chains that we can leverage but we do need to create some higher level abstractions that make all of this make sense like how do i describe an object so i can take it from one game to another that's a big problem that we're that we'll be publishing on system i hope later this year actually so would it be right for me to say okay morpheus is this very specific set of tools that you know other side for example wants to pick and choose and a la carte which ones they think are really important for the world they're building in the short term and then m squared is like a set of standards and like a protocol essentially that it can exactly it's like a network of worlds and it allows you to buy sell and move virtual objects between worlds it creates consistency between those worlds and it's like a it's like an internet of meta versus that's how i would describe it and i heard you say something that struck me as really significant which is that all the partners that you're working with and maybe we'll get into some of the other projects you've worked on but um as part of working with y'all they are contractually obligated to say that that anybody who has a character or does something in that world have the legal right to take their items or their character out of one metaverse into another so if i'm in other side and something gets built i can take that into any other world that's within this m squared network exactly there are some really specific rules on it's almost a bit like the european union there's freedom of movement there's the ability for you to think things around and like so so that basically means that you can build a small world or an experience and have the confidence of attracting users from any of these big projects right and vice versa you might build something really cool and think you know i want to make that part of the other side you can do that too right so this is very very different from how existing um businesses in this space operate and we really believe in it because if people are willing to agree if the biggest partners are already willing to agree the smallest partners have to to kind of join the network and to be part of it so you'll soon be able to take you know from a sporting event into a concert into a game you know the same asset will there be how many winners will there be here and i say that like you know for from a consumer level to me the benefit would be that all of the metaverses that get built use m squared right so that they can all so i can do anything i want across all of the worlds is that how this plays out where there's sort of one primary winner because then all the network effects can accrue but again it doesn't feel negative the way it happens with facebook because it's open standard exactly that's what i hope for and when that happens it won't just be us that win in that every single citizen user business and person you know everybody will have access to for example tokens to share in the value the ability to build new businesses on top with the confidence of what that service is providing them it's a little bit like a government but one that's actually like kind of you know on on chain and in code and operating in a way that that hopefully really supports where people need to go so yeah those will be the winners and that's also why we bring a big fund um into the m squared found into the m squared entity which we happened earlier this year so that we can even support projects that want to kind of grow and be part of the network that's the idealistic to have it all in one do you think that's realistic or do you think there become two or three or like how many winners do you think emerge in this space so um one of the reasons that we are primarily focused on non-gaming companies right now we're focused on web 3 businesses like yuga um people within sport fashion music and beyond it's because they generally are building and want to build experiences that are massively enhanced by morpheus but also they want the freedom to kind of build their own businesses they don't want to be part of somebody else's platform they want to stay in that platform and they're willing to interoperate because they already interoperate you know a fashion brand already interoperates with uh uefa because i can bring my clothes into a football match in the real world right whereas trying to make you know trying to bring halo master chiefs machine gun into harry potter land you know you know it just doesn't make sense you know i mean voldemort can't deal with a machine gun it's not fair on him it's not fair on the whole school so you know there isn't really any notions it's just you know i feel master chief would have solved the problem way quicker you know let the kids figure it out you know it's what they were there for but anyway the point is um the point is um you know we talk about interoperability but it's much more than technical interoperability they have to be commercial and creative incentives that create interoperability and our real culture already interoperates right so focusing on those things is important now i do think games will emerge but those games will be pretty cool and unusual compared to the games of today kind of like the games people are going to build with the other side sdk because those games can be built from the get-go in an environment where all the objects and assets can be nfps can move between worlds can rely upon content and behavior from other spaces so you might see some really quirky new genres or formats emerging and i really believe that's the direction i think the traditional games industry honestly is going i mean and i should say this is you know we're probably the largest provider of sort of multiplayer expertise into the industry we have a service business that does that we work with 60 publishers we built um the multiple motor fall guys if people have played that um we work with loads of different uh companies in the space what we find is that they're amazing they know what they're doing and they're building great games but it's not really in their interest today to turn games into manifest experiences or to start involving crypto because all those things just create risk for them and they only create opportunities for value to maybe go into other systems and that's not the case with uh with big cultural institutions so i think sign up and work with the right partners here we might make a network that you know maybe it won't be the you know maybe it won't be certain to be the winning network but it'll suddenly be an important one what would the process be or need to be for those games to ultimately become more like metaverse experiences and more interoperable like will we get there and it's just a matter of time or you're not sure we'll ever get there i think it's like mobile you know there are still game developers today inside major studios who don't like mobile games or who don't like free to play games or who think that's not the way we did things back in my day you know the games industry is at on the one hand incredibly innovative and on the other hand it's as conservative as like a medieval blacksmith you know like we've done things this way for years and and for good reason because games are so much about risk you invest vast amounts of money and they often fail that conservatism is a good attitude when you're doing um you know aaa and high-end game development so i think we're going to need companies like the you know the supercells of web3 companies that start from the beginning with a mindset and a thinking that is built around the idea of building games and content in interoperable worlds here's one kind of quirky one for you right traditionally what matters is how many users you have and retain in your world it matters a lot less though when you're selling virtual objects that can technically be used in any world like let's say i make like a rocket league clone and i have a really cool set of skins that i want to give out to people it doesn't the skins are really popular but the game sucks right actually my revenue might still be awesome because people are using those skins in other games that's a mindset that just hasn't come into the games industry yet i think you're getting at something important there and tell me if i'm right on this which is the economics of the metaverse benefiting off of long-term engagement as opposed to like quick outrage culture it do i have something right there and can you speak to that because sure if that's true that feels like huge because i think such a central woe of our lives today is the outrage culture generated by social media and those incentives this is maybe the biggest difference in my sort of metaverse philosophy from folks um i have a lot of respect for example from matthew ball who writes really great stuff about the man of us but probably one of the bigger maybe not even differences but emphasis changes in how i think and he thinks and how a lot of people in the games industry think about the medivas is that we have to dig very deep into why people value these experiences this is something i think a lot about in my book these experiences are not valuable simply because they're entertaining they're valuable because they're fulfilling and fulfillment is the key to long-term engagement and fulfillment cannot be faked i'll give you an example right in order for me to get my feeling of competence when playing tennis let's say right i have to have a certain win rate if i continuously lose every single game that i play i'm just like i i don't actually know how to play tennis at all so if i were to go to wimbledon and lose every single game um it would be very disheartening and i wouldn't want to carry on playing tennis well the average person wouldn't want to carry on playing tennis unless you were kind of a masochist right game developers figured out that you need kind of a 70 win rate right you need to you can't win every game you certainly can't lose every game either you need to be in a flow state of challenge and what's really interesting about that flow state of challenge is during that that flow state you're you're learning your brain is actually working in a beneficial and healthy way that is growing your experience of life like nobody would say you know max verstappen is addicted to f1 they'd say he's really great at it and he's you know grown and can probably we'd love to talk to him and learn from him about like how he thinks about f1 right in various ways so the the beautiful thing is that in order to retain people to experiences that actually they want to pay for and they want to be part of they have to be provided with some sort of unique fulfillment or they just won't show up and they just won't pay the other really great thing is because we can charge for virtual objects because every business can tangibly charge for digital assets and this is the magic of the web3 revolution we don't need ads i mean you can still have ads but ads don't have to be the center attention doesn't have to be the center of the economy and that frees you from extremely toxic business models the other flip side of this um you know how the business models become better than i would that i would kind of throw in is that a lot of things become viable for individuals to do to make money that didn't make sense before like anybody can have a creative profession as a moderator as a content creator even as a player like playtime has gotten like um a lot of bad rap recently but i think people should take a look a little bit at free to play because free to play might sound good but what free to play really is is that the 99 of people who like let's say play halo infinite or play call of duty online those people have a job and their job is to be shot by the people who've paid money that is their job like if those people were not there then the people that pay money would not show up because there's no one to match make with so you're already doing play to earn you're just doing it for free right you know so you're already contributing to the success of games and if we can start to incentivize people then we can have bartenders in virtual bars who are actually there at certain hours of the day we could have gods in cities that you know actually catch the thieves at certain times you know and i think that is actually really exciting and grows the the complexity of the experiences and therefore their fulfillment that you know across the world of the metaverse i'm not sure i'm persuaded though that it will and maybe this wasn't ever the promise right but it's not going to entirely eliminate the the incentives that we still have in web 2 in social media say to like generate outrage because it it keeps people around longer to buy more goods even if it's not trying to keep people around longer so you can monetize your ad partner like you still want to be competing for people's attention and that can still involve these addictive notifications and it can still involve crazy headlines or crazy behaviors i i guess i mean i would say there's a there's a reason why we use the phrase rage quitting in gaming right because that's not good for the game developer right interesting you know retention is very very important in game design and in online game design and retention often requires the direct addressing of toxicity the other thing that i'd say is when two people are arguing over whatever it is you know american politics vaccines insert your hot button topic um you know on facebook their incentives are really just to create a compelling argument with one another when two people are on an adventure in a role-playing game and their job is to slay a dragon they have a tangible need to work together and are bonded together by that experience in a way that is very different from arguing with someone over something you know there's a reason why so many romances apparently i was reading start with people who like go on journeys together or end up sitting next to each other in planes or things of that nature like shared experiences whether adverse or positive they create bonds between people they don't divide people and social media just doesn't provide experiences really it provides content endless never-ending content you know and all it can really do is affect us in a very very superficial way yeah i was just thinking i wish more people rage quit social media well yeah wouldn't that be lovely we'd be like rage quit twitter i'm not going to send this mean tweet i'm going to ragequit no completely and i think i think social media is a great example where um you know while of course we look at a lot of the negatives there is being structural there are also it's also very important to mention that it didn't have to be this way you know there are other ways we could have constructed social media that wouldn't have resulted in this degenerate mess you know look at wikipedia wikipedia is a free service where everyone contributes content wikipedia is generally accurate it's generally good right and it has way way way way less budget than facebook so why is wikipedia able to prevent you know outright lies from showing up you know on a regular basis but facebook isn't it's not a lack of ability it's a genuine decision to create a platform that generates the most money by creating the most outrage you were speaking a little bit earlier to how strategic you've been about picking partners i'm curious how did the yugo partnership come to be and uh what excited you about that well i would credit uh gaia siri as the person who introduced it and he had the foresight to see that there was a great combination between the technology that um that we had and the vision we had for m2 and the vision that the uglabs team has nicole the ceo there is incredible and and you know gordon and gaga and all the founders they're they're they don't get enough credit for their vision which is so much more expansive than just building another video game you know they're actually trying to make a real economy of experiences which fit so well with what we had intended that we've actually ended up in a relationship which i hopefully you know seems like the community is happy with so far where we're delivering value together and building other side like improbable is kind of the game developer of other side as well as being a technology provider but we're also working together to think about the m squared network you know how should that work how does that help other side but also create value for other experiences in other worlds so they've kind of been a dream partner um you know to date and one of our most important responsibilities is delivering for them what are the biggest challenges they're going to face i mean it strikes me that they're they're balancing so many interests there both like how do you make sure that with this land and that there'll be resources on the land that one group doesn't end up with way too many resources that ruin sort of the gameplay experience and like of all of the various interests they're trying to balance making sure the land holders are happy but also presumably making sure that it becomes accessible for more people like what's the biggest challenge you think that they face and you face the biggest challenge um well let's first think about what they have going for them they have well we have together um the best community in web3 in my opinion you know in terms of scale just the sheer level of enthusiasm the incredible quality of derivative experiences that have come out of it as well so they have an incredible brand so much so that some you know many major brands are you know engaging in partnering with bitcoin they have a currency that's sort of even in the downturn sort of doing okay and holding up and has a lot of really interesting partnerships and possibilities that will power the world they also have kind of the only actual delivered metaverse experience even with first trip that remotely lives up to the promises and expectations that people have made in the space and i hope if you've if you've not seen it you should check out the videos if you were there even more awesome we're gonna try to get more people into them but the reaction from that has been okay i get what the metaverse is for now right i get i get why i want to be here and why i want to be part of that experience i mean they had live actors playing characters inside live world events for thousands of players for the first time in history they had thousands of people speaking for the first time in history they had a world where you could kind of influence you're saying they but it's really you it's like it's so we like you know the technology the technology and the game development services that we provide are important but i don't want anyone to downplay just how visionary the uk labs team are you know these are creative ideas we've worked on them together and we've learned a lot from them and hopefully they're from us but it's a collaboration a genuine collaboration on a level that i'm that i'm i rarely find uh you know we we kind of talk all the time and engage all the time but i will say um you know those things mean that yes there are problems in balancing they're going to be problems in managing the economy and keeping people happy the landmine maybe wasn't that you know the most you know the greatest thing ever but the the reality is that just so we're just so far ahead of other projects in this space you know there could be that there is an interest generally in building web3 out of us is maybe there isn't a market to the extent that we all believe there is but if there is one i struggle to see any other project out there that's even a dense of where aware of where they are and that combination combined with the unique community i think is dynamite is there a way for us to to to probe or test that what the appetite for this is other than investing billions of dollars to build those well i'll say look we've run we've run many events some have been less public than the first trip one you know k-pop concerts events in our in our game scavengers where we did scab lab we've done a number of other test events we've we've surveyed the crap out of thousands and thousands of people we've watched i've performed myself i've observed the behavior and seen it and i'm incredibly encouraged like people stay not just till the end of these things they stay well past them they react with visceral emotion to interacting with live performance at scale they also consistently say the same thing which is i can't have this anywhere else i can't have this experience anywhere else so i think it's only human nature to to be thrilled and excited with the idea of being present with lots of other people i think there's there's quite clearly a market for that and if we look at sports music all the other different already understood areas where this works bringing them into a web 3 environment can only can only be more compelling in my view still there's a lot to prove um you know it's not it's not a success still it's a success and i think there's a journey we're going on and i think going on that journey with the users in a very public way you know two months or three months from announcement do you can actually play the thing that beats most mmos by several years we only have a couple minutes left here so but i do want to just touch on as we think about interoperability so where else folks maybe who are a part of this other side experience could take their assets now or in the future and like what are the other projects you're working on and again you've worked with governments and militaries i'd love to just a little bit unpack what that means there are a lot of other projects that um were kind of a little bit um almost swamped now with opportunity which is so exciting but there are also other things in the works that we'd like to announce more um soon i can't talk about them until they're public but i will say there'll be a healthy grouping of worlds that hopefully will will create value for everyone um on the government stuff yeah so there's a um there's a separate subsidiary to improbable um which is focused and has been for a long time on really important problems that involve everything from like how to model climate uh related issues to coronavirus modeling to large-scale simulation and helping governments think about security challenges including some of the topical stuff in the world today we're really proud of that work and it is an offshoot of our early technology that is about making massive simulations but massive simulations that can actually answer questions about the real world we're going to be a lot more public about that later this year and there's some stuff out there but it's it's very very different and quite separate from our metaverse and gaming efforts but kind of comes from a common technical lineage that's fascinating to me and i know we have to go but i i [Music] i'm reading a book right now called the bomber mafia about like the first bomb site the northern bomb site which was built you know before world war ii and was supposed to make these really accurate bombs drop and it took the wind to pressure and the you know all the things and then reality it really didn't work that well because there was just way too many factors that you couldn't really predict or know that made it so that the technology really didn't work and like my instinct doesn't want to feel like how can you in dollar situations we use a hundred companies worth of simulations and models that are proven through breakthroughs in how you propagate like model accuracy and error we sped up coronavirus modeling in the uk by ten thousand times using the technological scale we're actively being used by governments in real security problems and issues today these aren't demos these are sort of production use technologies and the team have worked really hard to work with government over many years to devise this stuff and the need for this is just incalculable like right now today if you want to model an entire city the power grid the telecommunications network the way that people operate and you need to because if you want to electrify that city how do you know what the unintended consequences of doing it are in one case we did a simulation it turns out the whole power grid blows up if you have too many electric cars which is not true in another case we showed there were security vulnerabilities nobody imagined because the people that built the roads and the people that built the telecoms never really understood how the two things related in the way that they thought they did examples like that abound so these are known as kind of complex adaptive systems and this is the other side of the metaverse you know well which is no pun intended around you know the metabolism a little bit about fulfillment and entertainment but it's also a lot about you know communities and governments making decisions and choices together in a better way and we're going to do more later this year to cleanly separate the kind of communication and narrative around these two things because that business has also matured enormously it has its own kind of leadership team so you know we'd like to let that come out of the limelight a little bit more but yeah there's there's more to improbable even than the amount of sweat that people have had off okay well i have to let you go but will you come back because i feel like there was so much i didn't even get it to get to get into with you and uh this is so fascinating i'm sure we will get the opportunity so yeah it's been a lot of fun thank you very much awesome [Music]
