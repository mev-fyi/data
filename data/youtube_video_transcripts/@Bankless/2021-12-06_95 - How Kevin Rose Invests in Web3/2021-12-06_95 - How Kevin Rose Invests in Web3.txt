[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams and i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bangless david great episode kevin rose he's not all of mine i'm glad we had him on the podcast what a fantastic discussion what are some of the highlights two themes of this episode really stuck out to me one theme is that kevin is just a veteran of the growth of the internet we've had a number of these uh types of individuals on that have just watched the internet be born in front of their eyes and kevin was lucky enough to be able to both be a builder and then an investor in the growth of web 2. kevin founded the dig platform which is an early version of reddit which was a little bit before my time but i think that those experiences that he had watching web 2 grow really kind of allowed him to understand the role in community and people as the content creators and the value creators for these systems and the other thing that i think i really enjoyed was the transition from being a founder or angel investor into technologies or companies and instead in the world of web 3 being an angel investor into artists or creators and just the paradigm shift that that brings along with it as well and kevin i know is really just interested in seeing creativity blossom out of the web 3 platform yeah it's super cool i think kevin's got a great perspective so he was a builder in web 2 right it's like one of the first he was building a web 2 company digg.com before it was even known as web 2 right so he's kind of a pioneer in that industry and then he turned into a venture capitalist so he's seen that side of things and then he's also been like a media producer right so he's got sort of the hat trick of like builder venture capitalist and then also media producer which is super cool right up our alley right so he's got all of those vantage points that he brings into exploring the nft space and i guess a few things we got into the podcast is why he thinks celebrity nfts are kind of lame and have jumped the shark what he actually looks for in nft projects and the differences between you know something that's new and creative versus something that's kind of like you know trying to ape the last trend and how to identify the next big thing moving forward we've got an interesting discussion on the metaverse as well like how that is going to shape up what that's going to look like and overall it's really cool to just have someone on vibe with somebody who's i guess he does many of the same things we do david but is also like all in on crypto now like you got the sense with kevin like okay you're like us this is fully consumed your life now hasn't it right like you're all in now and there's no turning back and everything else is boring so this is also someone who i think intends to spend the next five years or so on crypto if not longer i always enjoy it when we bring fellow content producers on the podcast because they just know how to make good content so the vibe of this episode is just three podcasters in a podcast together having a good time so i think you guys are really going to enjoy this conversation with kevin rose so let's go ahead and get right into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave dot com that's aave.com bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest this is kevin rose he's an internet entrepreneur he's a partner at true adventures he was a builder in web 2 and is very much tuned into the rise of web 3 that is now going on he's also a fellow content producer so if you recognize that mic quality it's because kevin produces podcasts he's been doing this since 2003 he hosts modern finance which is a fantastic podcast as well as proof this is a newer podcast all about nfts and the metaverse kevin how you doing man it's great to have you on bank list finally oh you know i've been i listened to you guys this may sound odd but i have a sauna and i try to do that and i put you guys on the sauna and so it's it's weird to be on the show but it's uh it's so cool to see all the great content you've put out it's i think that this there needs to be more of this type of content so i always love seeing uh people that approach this space in a in a thoughtful way in a way that is not scammy i don't know if you've looked at some of the other uh cryptocurrency pockets scammy you two of them out there pump and dump you know so it's cool you guys are doing it right we we've tried to occupy that niche and you know um i i think that's what people appreciate it's like this is a journey for all of us and this is like a journey of self-discovery right so even this conversation every conversation we have with someone we expect to learn something new so i'm excited to uh to to learn something here today kevin you know what's super cool about you saying this is because this is like full circle for me because i first got into web 2 believe it or not on digg okay dig.com this is where i learned about web 2 like the power of web 2. uh i don't know dave david's a youngin you know he's like i don't know if he remembers the original dig but like i remembered it when it used to look like this wow remember that oh my god okay so that was actually my design that's how this is your design i know it's bad yeah i did that myself so i remember these days i also remember these days and for for those of you who weren't like around at that point in time like you're brought up in web 2 in the social web okay back in my day the web was not social all right it was like a one to one type relationship it was you in the website there was no notion of like a community it wasn't a like many to website type relationship and the innovation that dig brought which was absolutely uh incredible to me was like oh we can create the front page of this website like the front page of the internet all together it doesn't have to be like uh someone in a high tower telling us what content is good on the internet we can all collectively as a community create the front page of dig and it's similar to folks are familiar with reddit right it's like with digg you would dig things which is kind of an upvote and you could bury things which is sort of a down vote and this was like the og original website where you could do that was my introduction to web2 super powerful man and i'm honored to be talking to you today kevin because you brought me into you yeah well thanks for saying that it was it was it was a lot of fun you know it's like i was uh pretty young back then and honestly it was just like right place right time kind of fun new idea and um you know there was new technologies that were coming online at that point with ajax where you wouldn't have to leave a page you could actually interact with the current page you were on which today you know when you click on something and you see a vote go up or something it seems so you're like oh of course that's the way it works it didn't always used to work to be hard yeah you actually have to go to it when i first launched dig if you clicked on voting on something to dig something it would take you to another page so you go to another page and say thank you for your dig and then ajax dropped and that was the asynchronous javascript allowed you to do everything on page so you could see all that stuff happening in real time the numbers were going up in real time um it was it was a lot of fun but that was you know 2004. so that was a while ago when you started this in 2004 was the the term web 2 even invented like the social web wait no so meme arise yeah so uh jason kelly kanis who ran weblogs inc which was a collection of different blogs like engadget and a whole slew of them um he came up to me and he's like oh man and he's like dig you're you guys are or webb too and i was just like i was like do i do i need to run like a software update that i didn't know about like maybe i'd like i literally was like am i i'm missing something here what is this web 2 thing and um it was just this collection of different sites and technologies that were coming together that people started putting under that umbrella so you know they lumped in us and delicious and flickr and facebook and twitter and there's a handful of us that yelp and some others that were all kind of part of this you know web 2 founding crew so what do you think about this uh this web 3 moniker are you vibing with it do you oh i love it yeah so what do you like about it what does it add um i just i feel like um you know the promise of web 2 at least when we were doing dig was that you know we wanted to have this front page that would be a place where the community could come together and they could vote on stuff in the best content it was like a demo or um a fully kind of decentralized way of voting on in and and making up the front page but in in practice it really didn't work there was just a lot of spam there was just uh all different types of issues that we ran into to try and make that a reality and then you have reddit come and attack the long tail which is actually is why they ended up beating us in the long run is that they went after these niche communities and the aggregate of the niche was actually much larger than you know just the any any one front page that was dick we hit around i don't remember what it was now around 30 something million uniques per month um that's kind of where we tapped out and they just kept growing because of that long tail but in reality it was still you know these were like centralized organizations they were like being there were corporations that were vc backed and it was um they very much had a mandate to go out and make money i mean they had to obviously pay the payroll and all the things and not all of that is bad but that means that you know we collected user data and we did kinds of things that all companies do in this this ad driven model and um i just love this idea of the true empowerment of the individual to come in collectively come together to raise funds in different ways you know not having to go down the venture route if you don't want to and to decide and vote on things that are less about just what's happening here locally or in the united states but it seems like the web 3 audience is a much more international audience and people are collaborating in real time in unique ways i've just never seen before so you know the rise of dows is a great example of this um you know obviously the the open source nature of web3 and the collaborations happening around that it just um it feels like a maturing of this original idea that was the promise of web 2 but we're not actually seeing until now in web 3. yeah so chris dixon has this this this thing this tweet this mental model of course because he's you know chris dixon that's what he does uh webb won and he says read it's all about read web two read write web three read write and own and like i i simplify this as like web one is is links then we got to to likes and now we're on tokens do you think that's like i mean dig was all about communities and such but the communities could never really own the net results of what they were doing i mean what they could do is they could they could form whatever links formed the homepage but they didn't capture the upside in that is that what web3 is all about is it about community ownership in your mind you know i think that web three certainly that's a piece of it like there's no doubt that we're able to capture value and spread value in unique ways that we haven't seen before but that said i you know i lump nfts into web3 and and all the different things that come under that umbrella um so i would say that the ownership is a a big piece i think the organization of resources is a big piece um the way the kind of like grassroots bottoms up approach to building products is a big piece um but yeah i i really love this idea of ownership being now back in the hands of the individual contributors like that they're the ones that are providing all the value that's where the ownership actually should reside um but i also love this idea of brand building and company building being done at the community level like just this idea that you can get together and grab 10 000 100 000 people and go and build board apes and what that's turned into i mean that's just like a beautiful idea of like this like bottoms-up brand building you see it with cool cats you see it with some of the other nft projects um and i believe the futures the future of brands like actual whether it be clothing brands or you name it is going to be driven largely by community participation and community ideas and um that that's really exciting to me there's definitely a cohort of these web 2 platforms reddit and dig are the ones that come to mind where it really actually inspired some sort of um you know integration into a community right so you pick your very niche community in reddit and you see all the same people there on that one niche subreddit and you actually get to grow a name for yourself and having some sort of you weren't owning the actual like exposure to the upside but you had a you felt responsible for your community i feel like that's a decent number of these web 2 platforms really tapped into that like uh the innate human desire to own own some sort of responsibility to have responsibility for something and i think we all know in the web 3 world it's that even more so but i also want to think like kevin you're a veteran of the web 2 world and when we when me and ryan when we talk about web 2 on the banknotes podcast and really the whole entire industry we're talking about in this very negative way it's like oh yeah web 3 is going to come and eat web 2's lunch like web 2 will be destroyed by web 3. but i i i s as somebody who's intimately knowledgeable about both of them do you do you really see that antagonistic relationship or do you see how do you see web 2 also coming along and perhaps being inspired by web three and because like it's not this web 2 is just going to like go down without a fight right like web 2 web 2 is going to come along with it so how do you think these uh these platforms like that incentivize community ownership and community collaboration how do you think they're going to come along for the ride here it's a good question i i think in some sense you have to have you have to start realizing that participation like if you already own a big brand or you have a big web 2 property you have to understand that that it's no longer about a closed boardroom making decisions for the future of your business and it's about opening up um really everything to the community so they can have a look inside of what's going on and figuring out how can i incentivize these users to use my product in in ways that actually deputize them and really empower them to help me become a better product and help me move faster i mean if you take a look at what happened with discord last week or two weeks ago when they decided to um integrate ethereum wallets and then all of a sudden the gamers said no no no we don't want that and they rolled back that decision it was just like such a centralized move i was like that nobody the community actually really wanted a lot of the community wanted uh on the crypto side and the nft side they wanted this product to be more um well i shouldn't say less about gaming but more um kind of crafted and built purpose built for their use cases you know discord is is obviously the place where i mean you know this you have a bankless discord it's like it's a place where people go to have conversations to share off to share the different um you know either tokens they hold or nfts that they hold and it's really lacking like why there isn't a way for me to click on someone see their wallet see their nfts pin certain nfts to the top like really make it about this interactive experience in this web 3 world and they came back and said actually no we're not going to do that this is what we decided as a company um that just feels so backwards to me and i feel like if they're just setting themselves up for disruption and i think every company has to understand that they need to um start playing like they really need to start playing in this world and figuring out what can they open up and um start doing a series of tests it's a very it's a very scary thing when you have something that's working like to to to say okay i'm going to rethink my entire business model is is really um i am i'm skeptical that they can pull it off but i i i'm rooting for them if that makes sense and and then that said you know i and i'm when i talk about that i think i'm thinking of companies like twitter like discord like facebook you know meta like i think i think facebook is just gonna die a slow death i'm i'm sorry i think it's garbage i i you don't think they're going to be able to make this transition no i don't i i why so chris dickson said the one thing you could say about facebook though is it is still founder led of all the other you know fangs out there you know that one at least is still has mark zuckerberg the original founder at its helm i mean you could have said that about about about twitter until this morning right so it's i i just feel like but you know okay you said they're evil right it's like uh don't evil companies do fairly well right like is isn't the corporation kind of a they do and i think a lot of shareholders are going to be very happy uh yeah but we're flipping this right there's this world now where it was about optimizing um the outcome of your business should be optimized for the most revenue per user right and and now it's about really putting the community in the forefront of this and saying how can we build the best possible experience for the user and they will bring value back to us you know so in web 3 users as the product doesn't work anymore that's right that's right i think users users need to be the ones that are more of the decision makers and they're actually helping define the product but they're not what's for sale so that's i think that's where where this thing whole thing gets flipped if it works if it's the the issue we have here is that there's a lot of like um it's early days so i'll give an example you could not build twitter on any web3 architecture as it exists today at the scale they're at today it just would not work like even even if you want to say solana 50 000 transactions a second whatever may be it's not even close yeah it's just not gonna we need centralized um infrastructure right now so i think we're still a few years out from that dream happening but there there'll be bridges and to get us there um i'm a fan of this idea that there is going to be a hybrid approach and i believe that there are a lot of things that we should absolutely have be decentralized but then there are centralized organizations that actually do things quite well like you know i don't know that i would ever send my mom to uni-swap or sushi or something like that right like i'm just she doesn't want to go there you know but that said if wells fargo had a way for her to on-ramp into crypto in a way that she understood i would say mom yeah why don't you click that button that says allocate two percent of my holdings into crypto in a way that is just like she doesn't have to think about private keys right and i think that we have to remember that the there there's a pretty large majority of people out there that are never going to be comfortable holding their private keys and and i like their the idea they're being customer service for certain individuals when they need it right so i it's it's always going to be a hybrid there's always going to be a pepsi for every coke right there's there's going to be multiple uh winners out here it's not a winner take all market i believe that when it comes to infrastructure and um uh support services and also when it comes to coins i don't think this is a bitcoin or ethereum take all like i think there's going to be multiple winners here for different use cases there's many purpose-built blockchains that are more perform performant for certain types of activities right and i just i i just think when i think of like some of the nft stuff with flow or just um you know some of the stuff that solana is doing and others like i i yeah it's hard for me to be a laser eye i'm not a big fan of laser eyes i think they're they exclude too many people or too many ideas you mean that literally the meme or do you mean like okay yeah yeah yeah just like whenever i see the meme i'm just like you're excluding someone whenever you have a certain color laser eyes you're excluding something and for me this is all about being inclusive like how much how many people can we bring along for the ride and that doesn't mean i love ethereum and i love bitcoin and solana and i have a bunch of chains there's a lot of out there don't get me wrong like when i look at some of the stuff that's out there there's a lot that i avoid but i just feel like this is an expansive pie and we need to to think about how can we bridge and include versus exclude something you said you said the word the hybrid approach um and i want to unpack that a little bit and there are plenty of platforms out there that i think are particularly conducive to a hybrid approach facebook not being one of them discord definitely being one of them and we know that reddit is like really going full steam ahead with integrating tokens and even discord the way that discord is set up discord is already a token company like if you want to get into the bankless dow discord you got to have 35 000 bank tokens right and so like regardless of whether they actually formally put that into the application like discord is a web3 platform for the for the uh communities that have integrated them and so there seems to be a lot of these uh web two companies that have leaned in towards the community brings the value and we are here to incentivize the community and now that and like there's room for them to really just more formalize that and let the community start to take that in in their own direction so i'm wondering if you are seeing like a schism between the web 2 companies where there's the web 2 which is like twitter and facebook that are kind of not really they don't really have the surface area to do web3 stuff and then there's things like discord and reddit which do have the surface area to do web3 stuff but they're still web too so making maybe they're more like web 2.5 do you see like the the future kind of yeah in this direction it's interesting because you know you say reddit's full steam ahead on on their token but yeah i i would argue they've been talking about this for a while now you know it's been a year and a half maybe two years like i think a better approach for a lot of these companies is just going to say listen um almost like discord in some sense and that you say we don't know what you're going to do with this in the web3 world we have some ideas of what we might want to do you know jack had some ideas for integrating payments and doing some things inside of twitter but the best approach here is really just to open it up provide some apis and some sdks that allow you to go in and extend it in new and interesting ways like the only reason why you're powering the whole bankless access on discord is not because of discord at all because it got extended by you know a third party application that allows you to verify how many tokens are in someone's wallet right so i think a lot of the things that that the ways though that you can win as a web 2 company is to actually get power again back to the community to extend the product in in new ways and they'll be the first to do it and i think the most interesting innovation is going to come by tens of thousands of developers thinking of what to do with your product next not just the handful of engineers and product people you have you know working in your in your centralized organization it's funny that you say that it's like it's kind of like back in the video gaming world or how sometimes the mods become like better than the actual game itself like i remember like half-life 2 just like right back in the day and counter-strike was originally a mod for half-life 2 that you know somebody created right totally it was like a better game in a lot of ways right uh and so like you what you're advocating to for is like hey web 2 companies you don't have to be the center of top down innovation here you don't have to decide every feature just open it up so that the community can mod right it's like you know discord having the ability to like maybe add tokens as mods at its own metamask login as a mod this sort of thing is is how you think innovation how web 2 companies will cross the chasm to web 3. that that sounds right to me i mean it's our early days with all this but i mean that's what we've been seeing that's been working so far can we talk about your story a little bit uh kevin here with with crypto so i know you've um i you know you you've been knowledgeable about bitcoin since the early days right in the early days when it when it kind of came out um it it seems also that you've had a renewed interest over the last i don't know year or so 18 months or so maybe partially uh through nfts but just walk us through that so when you first uncover crypto and it's like i think a lot of people so if you're anything like me it took like two two punches right it's like a one-two combo punch first was the bitcoin thing i was like oh that's cool but what can i do with bitcoin well you can hold it ryan so i held it you know and that was it but then it really took for me it was like ethereum and d5 and understanding that world of smart contracts the second uh you know punch down the down the rabbit hole and then i was like i'm all in like it's over for me it's like bye bye hobbies bye bye life i'm i'm i'm crypto now this is what i do was your journey somewhat like that did you have kind of like uh you know two opportunities at it or uh has it been like i guess wearing it you gradually what's the story yeah i mean if you i think about when i first started getting into bitcoin in the early days like 2011-ish it was it was one of those things where um you know i was downloading the entire blockchain back then and running it on locally because that's what you did um and i was one of those people that sadly i mean we all have this story we bought we tripled you're like i'm out you know and then you went back out to fiat and then you're like oh wait i'm back in again this is gonna stay and then you rinse and repeat right do that cycle like five times and then finally something kind of clicks where you just realize that something is so big and has so much momentum that this is a snowball that's just gonna continue to roll down the hill and it's like you for me um it was seeing that and just kind of realizing like wait a second i don't have to sell during the next downturn i can actually just buy more and that's probably a better idea you know and you can only do that if you believe it'll last more than one day like more than one cycle right right and well once you see enough cycles it's funny when i see these little bumps in the market now they don't even phase me they used to really upset me i remember like waking up at like 2 a.m being like oh crap what's the theory matt oh okay yeah it's back down to 75 like oh no like yeah you know and and now i'm just like oh yeah so so what like okay a month will go by two months ago by maybe it's gonna be six uh it'll recover it it's gonna be fine because this is the future i always went back to like what go ahead and by the way if you're new here that is the goal like if you're new to crypto is do what kevin is suggesting become volatility proof that is like the best armor you can have learn to love the volatility learn to ignore it just like anyway go on kevin i just wanted to mention that yeah yeah i think that it's once you can kind of i think it's right sizing the investment for for yourself personally is a big piece of that just so that if you do see something get chopped by 20 30 40 you're not freaking out right like it's i have a lot of friends that have lost a lot of money because they put too much in and then when it got chopped they were like i'm going to lose my house that's not where you want to be right so it's it's just if you can right size it to where it's like you consider it like a crazy weekend in vegas and if it does go down 40 you're fine then um that for me was a big shift then like you i just saw um i guess it's it's there was this there was a thing that i i had to understand and i applied it to to private kind of equities initially where you should always invest in the inevitable right like what is the inevitable like what what is going to happen the next five 10 15 years from now and so that started with electric cars and realizing that or amazon with ec2 and their web services and how that was scaling out when people were going um uh cloud versus just racking their own servers and then you know i realized like this idea of there being blockchain and a digital currency like if you're starting a new country today would you go buy printing presses would you really would you like everyone has smartphones like no one's like how are the printing press company like the the there's only a few of them left i know that actually there was a winery that i was um i was i went to that they were buying printing the old printing presses for currencies to like micro print the winery labels to prevent like fraud but they're available like you can just like buy them like you can buy money printing presses yeah out there the old one yeah totally wow i think that would be like proprietary uh you know but i guess the old i don't know if it was usb yeah exactly it was some of the older older tech that was out there but uh it was just fascinating to me that they're obviously they're printing less and less money these days because people are going digital but just knowing that the future is going to be you're going to be able to move money you know internationally in a matter of seconds blockchain's not going away this is the technology that's here to stay and once you swallow that and then you start to see defy unroll and that the whole the whole defy movement when that kicked off i was like wow there's so many other potential use cases for this technology we're in like probably first pitch first inning here of just seeing where this is gonna go and that that's when i swallowed the pill and i was like all in so what's uh what's more interesting to you or what do you what do you what do you think made you go more all in kevin was it defy or was it nfts it started off as as defy and it was just you know a true ventures where i work as a partner over there we don't publicly talk about a lot of our investments but we do quite a bit in cryptocurrency so you know i'd say this year alone we've probably invested i'd say 75 million or so into new crypto startups and d5 is is something that we've been a big part of um whether you know it'd be the aves of the world or you name it over the last couple of years so it's something that we track internally quite closely and that was the big aha kind of big use case that i was looking for that was more than just a store of value and so when when you know there was a lot of different and there still continues to be a lot of different things that people are playing around with smart contracts and what can they do uh you know what can we fractionalize what can we you know there's all these different i've seen seeing home loans now that are fractionalized there's like a whole slew of different things that are happening that are interesting but i think the first kind of breakout i'm sure you all would probably agree was was that when defy started to break out that was the first use case outside of the store of value that i was like oh this makes a ton of sense it's just more efficient and it's it's getting you know all the margin is going away from big banks and they're going it's being delivered back to the individuals like this is amazing so that that's what got me really excited i want to like uh underscore your point here about the inevitability of this right you're you said as an investor you're always looking for you know technology trends things that are inevitable right because that feels like a rock solid investment to you i some people aren't there yet kevin with defy okay they're at the stage uh where they still think it's a a toy they still think it's got a you know a narrow set of use cases they still think it's just for a niche audience that sort of thing they'd say the same thing about nfts what gives you the confidence to think that defy and nfts are so inevitable well i mean there's one i would say this is that's a fantastic thing that not everyone is there because everyone is there it'd be completely de-risks and there'd be no upside for us right like it's it's awesome that we're in the early innings of this because that's where you capture the most upside you know when i was an angel investor in twitter or square or some of these others back in the day people thought it was like a silly little messaging platform when we were doing twitter they're like you just tell your friends where you're at with that thing like that's never gonna get that big and people laughed at it they always laugh at it you know they always say this is never gonna but but part of your job as an investor is kind of projecting out if this works how big will it become and and why will it work and so when i when i think about you know why people aren't there yet it's they don't quite see the efficiency that i think that this whole idea of smart contracts brings into the equation and just how much bloat there is you know i have friends that work at traditional and traditional finance that are like wanting to get out of it and get into d5 as fast as possible because they sit around there at their desks at you know goldman or morgan stanley and they're like what are these people doing like there's just so much like there's so much fat to be trimmed there and it's all going to go to d5 it's all going to be programmed it's just you know it's like the rise of ai like there's so many jobs unfortunately are getting automated away i would say unfortunately and fortunately unfortunately in that it's it's a shame because we're losing a lot of great middle class jobs i would say fortunately in that some of this automation is actually really helpful like when you can have ai go in and um analyze and detect lung cancer uh faster and better than an individual human like that's a great innovation right but that that kills jobs so i would say the same thing is coming to the banking industry and and we're going to see the automation and usage of smart contracts just get rid of all that extra crud that has been sitting there in the system i mean take a look at the balance sheets of these big banks they have a ton of money and they're just like they're making so much money because they're where is that coming from it's coming out of the that could be going back to the consumer and that's the promise of defy and when i think about okay as a consumer what do i want do i want the banks to have more money or do i want to have more money like it's no brainer consumers when the tooling is right and it gets easy enough for the average person to to take part in and that might be via square it might just be you know there i have this this theirs is going to be um again with the how to web 2 companies bridge to web 3 there's going to be um the risky way or the do-it-yourself way which is all of us we're like okay we're we're hardcore into crypto we can go in there we have no problem interacting with smart contracts we want that eight nine 10 12 percent and we're willing to to play that game right and then there's the maybe i just want five percent and i and i'm gonna do that via square the cash app and i'm just like i don't know but there's this high yield crypto savings account that if i tap two taps with my phone on my iphone i'm getting five percent and that'll probably be the on-ramp for a lot of people and then there's the do-it-yourselfers that'll that'll go the extra steps so i i think we're going to see a whole slew of different things and there's going to be the big banks that just don't get it at all and they're going to go kicking and screaming out of this market and they're the ones that are going to be the most screwed in in the long long run i think it's you're gonna see a lot of web two companies actually do quite well in the space because though there's there's still some innovation there versus them being big old you know multi-hundred-year-old banks so kevin you pay attention to a lot of things uh not just d5 but you're also into nfts but also just outside of crypto uh you're you're kind of the the tim ferriss type where you're also into like health sciences you're into a lot of different things so i blame tim for a lot of that but yeah too many interests um so but now that especially with nft has just taken the crypto world by storm how much of your day of your of your time of your mental resources are you allocating towards crypto has it kind of assumed your life like it's assumed ours yeah it's there been a flipping there's there's been a flipping for sure it's it's it's hard because i have two kids too so it's like i gotta balance that as well but i would say um you know for my day job as a venture capitalist it's it's been interesting in that um it started off really focusing on um you know layer one chains and then kind of some of the d5 related projects and some layer two scaling solutions that are coming to ethereum and then um we did a lot of investing in and around those arenas and then nfts just kind of really hit me hard at in january of this year and um i went i i like went all in and so that is where i spend the majority of my time nowadays and i do that because um we invest in that area i can't i'm trying to think about how much i can actually disclose with the stuff that we're drawing over true but you know i'll i'll come out and say we are going to as a venture company hold nfts on our books like we will hold cut in custody actual nfts and own them as um digital assets for our lps wow so um that's that's happening and so that's that's coming very soon we already you know i left every single person around an nft is like oh which one which one is it kevin which one do you own well it's funny because we have to be really careful so i'll give you an example like um let's just say you know our fund is 750 million right now let's say our next fund is a billion plus um let's say we earmark 50 to 75 to 100 million dollars just for nft purchases like i don't want to crush the individual investor here so i have to be really careful when i and tread lightly when i go into these markets like i'm not about lifting the floors here we're not about flipping pieces when we buy and hold an ft we'll do it for a decade you know it's like what this is um about being patient capital like that's the way that true's always operated and that's part of the reason why i do love the firm but i think we're gonna go and and we'll probably buy up a lot of the you know blue chip nfts at this point there's a lot of like you know that whether it be the auto glyphs or the crypto punks or now board apes i put in that category um there's you know some of the early kind of artists that were whether it be the um you know hackathons or x copies or you know just a lot of the really early um individual artists so those will be one of one works um so it's it's a it's a little bit of everything but in a in a responsible way that doesn't crush the average consumer so let's say that there's a new pfp project that is really interesting and i'm not a huge fan of pfp projects but every once in a while i'll i'll get the bug and i'll go in on one we're not gonna go and buy a hundred of them right we probably go in and buy you know five and and just do that a lot and and not crush the initial launch but more just either buy um from individuals at a later point in time so it's it's it's tricky but then again we're not deploying all this capital at once either so you have to imagine that when you do get that big of a budget you go out and deploy that over a couple years uh maybe two and a half years or so so nfts are really really new and there's we have so much to talk about with nfts uh and and so you're talking about going in and you know putting nfts on the balance sheet as like a treasury asset as an investment but they're so new what makes you think that they are actually like maybe nfts as a concept is here to stay forever but the whole thing about like the nfts industry is that there isn't any one specific nft that represents the whole industry it's always like moving they're kind of like fads so like it makes really a ton of sense for investors to invest in the long term but why do you think nfts are actually like the long term thing like maybe it's just like people's attention move from nft to nft to nft what gives you the conviction that it's actually the nfts are actually going to be the cool nfcs that we care about in five to ten years how do you know kevin you're not buying beanie babies right yeah yeah it's a good question i i think there's a couple things there to unpack um and obviously nft's as a term is a kind of a blanket category they just encompass so many different projects right so there's like a and it's just a token standard yeah it's just a token standard right so they can be utility nfts they're used to unlock and gate access to certain things um there's a thousand different things that this type of token standard can be applied to uh i i would say to answer your question though there are the initial projects that are the first like the first to have done something technical and i think that historically when we look back on some of these projects um you know whether it be 10 20 30 40 plus years from now there will be value in the people that have pulled off something technically interesting for the very first time so you know when um crypto punks launched they kind of really helped there was no erc 721 standard like there was no there but they helped define that right so i think historically that's a very important project and same with autoglyphs being the very first kind of on-chain fully on chain nft like there's there's um these types of projects i believe will always hold their value if not continue to rise from where they are today so we will be thoughtfully going in and and looking for these first like who are the the early artists doing really interesting things in the space and holding them as kind of more of the blue chip nfts and i would say that applies to artists as well so in some sense you know i think that there's a lot of froth in the pfp 10 000 market you know when you take a look at new projects dropping every other week you're that is not sustainable that is beanie baby land that's where the beanie babies live is all in that because it's it's basically um you know it reminds me of the ico craze do you remember the ico back in the seo days it was like how can you forget yeah yeah so so okay i'll give you the ico playbook fantastic landing page some cool looking graphics uh white paper link of course got to have that list of the team there uh and where they went to school or where they've worked at previously hopefully somebody either worked at google or had a cousin that worked at google it didn't really matter but it had to be on that page right and and then there was a token sale that happened a countdown timer and get in now percentages of the future yeah 86 yeah filled yeah right mm-hmm exactly so that was the playbook and that's kind of what we're seeing with the the pfp side of things as well there's a road map now with pfps there will you'll see we plan on doing this with them we're going to do commercial licensing we're going to do comic books with them we're gonna do who knows what like it's just like that's there's a backstory and a lore that has to go with them now so i think they're these little business units right i am less bullish on those because there are so many of them and it's it's the same in that that playbook is getting pretty tired again who are the ones that did that first you got the board apes the crypto punks the cool cats some of these earlier ones that i think will always have that that that staying power because they were so early in that space so those are the ones i'm a little bit more excited about um less so about the new ones that are dropping every other week because there's just a lot of noise in there but then i think i i go back to like you know who are the artists behind some of these projects so i'm more interested in the individual artists like the ex copies of the world and some of the other like really well-known artists and more so on the genitive side as well i think we finally have seen the emergence of a new art form not that generative art hasn't been out for for for many years it's just been a really hard thing to capture there's never been a way to capture gender of art back in the day i remember going to art installations like in the early 2000s in san francisco that were generative and they'd be like hey look at this like my computer's doing this really cool generative art and you could actually like buy the little computer and like have it and as like a one-of-one or whatever and then like of course the computer dies or whatever right so you gotta like get a hold of the artist and figure out how to recreate it and it was there was no um lasting way no durable way to actually capture this and so i'm i'm pretty excited about some of the early generative art and that it can actually be captured on the blockchain for the first time and stored and transferred so that's really exciting so i i guess i would say there's no easy answer to your question i think it's it is but you have to be in it all the time and kind of pay attention to who the emerging artists are um what they're doing that's unique and novel and then back those individuals so sometimes that means buying their drop sometimes it means commissioning one of ones with them um you know and so that's kind of what i've been paying attention to is is really less about the the insert animal character times 10 000 with a funky hat and more about individual artists unique stuff on the genitive side unique stuff that's coming on the music side like mike shinoda from lincoln park has a really interesting drop that's coming out here in like three days on the on the music side that's that's generative um i i just i that and the idea of being able to break up rights and and have those as nfts so that i can own future royalties uh for some for some music or other things that are happening in nfts like it's all just so new and it is scary it is it is there are certainly going to be beanie babies in this whole mix but there's also gonna be some really lasting breakouts that that i don't wanna miss so i'm gonna play the game and i will absolutely get burnt in the world of venture capital we expect about eight out of ten investments to go to zero and that's kind of what the game i'm we're playing here as well in in nft land is the vast majority of them are going to go to next to nothing but there will be some some some big players that emerge i think i just uh made a connection here this is this is kind of the you know the one of the dots i i felt like was connected for me this this episode um is going going back to true right you know uh you guys are a venture capital firm and so some people might ask you know why why are you investing in collectibles that'd be like you know your venture arms saying yeah we're gonna you know go buy some picassos but but also we're going to invest in like you know the the new york emerging artist space and find the best like paintings in the market and kind of double down on that it's it's very different than investing in a company right you're investing in a collectible and um you're not investing in a cash flow a future cash flow so on the surface it feels like it's it's kind of a different thing but here's the the dot that was just connected uh for me is venture is all about finding individual unique entrepreneurs and their teams and investing in them and something you just said there about nfts that you're interested in kevin is we find the artist we find the creator and we back the creator we back the artist absolutely that to me is the common denominator because what does venture do the same thing that a good nft curator investor does is find unique individuals right and invest in them whether it's an entrepreneur or a creator in crypto in web 3 they're kind of fusing to become one and the same and so that's what you're doing the same kind of thing that your venture firm has always done you're just bringing that from entrepreneur to creator and finding the artists in the nft space right do you see it that way too ryan you you absolutely nailed it because we've always said internally it that we find the best entrepreneurs and we let them lead us into new markets so they're always the ones i would say like probably 80 plus percent 90 plus percent of the new deals that we do at true are just founder referrals going back to us and so we're we we're watching our founders moved into crypto moving to d5 moving to nfts and you know it's it's both um how can we support and back the platforms you know so our investment in art blocks right on the generative side um and then how can we support the individual artists because they are just entrepreneurs and then also providing them with resources you know like for a lot of these people it's funny i've probably interviewed over a dozen uh pretty well-known nft artists now on proof and i would say that um the vast majority of them this is life-changing money for them they have never experienced anything like this in their life and they're they're they're kind of like blown away and scared and freaked out at the same time and there's mental health issues that go around this there is just a there's a rollercoaster of emotions that come with this whole new world including like i had a artist friend that just doesn't understand key management and lost fifty thousand dollars right after they did a sale and it was because you know they're artists you know they they don't they they haven't been trained up technically so it's like when we think about this at true it's like we have to provide the same way that we've always provided additional resources the way that you know a lot of other venture firms do like for our entrepreneurs like we have to provide it for artists as well so we have to figure out what is the product it true that we can build for them to help support them on on this journey so that's that's part of the part of how we think about it how badass is it though that the creators for a change the artists for a change get to be the rock stars of this movement right it's so cool and they're getting royalties and it's baked into the smart contract it's so cool and they're getting paid over and over again and then they're going out and they're backing other artists which so we're seeing this kind of renaissance thing that's happening um i i believe this is lasting it's here to stay uh but like with any new market like we saw with the ico days or anything else there's going to be some some i wouldn't call them scammers but there's just going to be some fad to it you know baked in and it's a it's kind of a a rush to see how quickly someone can launch a new project and just it's it's buyer beware you just really have to say and close your eyes and say does this team have what it takes do they are they in this for the this quick sale or are they going to be in this to build something that's that's lasting and durable and that's um that's a hard one to answer one of the my favorite experiences i've had recently was uh when i was at nft nyc and i went to an in real life nft gallery where you could actually like meet the artists and and talk to them and they could talk to you about their art as if it was just you know the normal art world which now this is the normal art world uh and so i i met this guy and i bought uh i like uh like swept the floor on all of his like he minted ten ten one but one of ones and i bought all of them and then i met up with a guy the next day for for like breakfast just to get to know the guy uh because now i'm an investor in this artist and so i wanted to get to know him like i wanted to get to know the guy that i put a bunch of my ether i gave him a bunch of my ether gave me a bunch of a bunch of the art and like i was just like blown away by some of the same language that we use to discuss things with some of the same language that venture funds when they invest in in businesses or projects would also use and so he he was talking about uh well now that i have these nfts that are that are out there i have some sort of like responsibility to my investors to keep on producing more art because i they want me to blow up right like they want me to become known as an artist and it's the same thing as when like you you bring on angel investors into your into your startup idea like the angel investors they it's like an advisorship they want to help you also blow blow up and become very very successful and then they were talking he was the the conversation was really just the the dividing lines between what is a financial startup versus what is an artist startup is like becoming very very blurred and the relationships between early seed investments or just you know buying art from an artist they're starting to become the same things you want to see the artist succeed uh you want to do your best to help those artists succeed because you are now have financial exposure to these artists uh and like the parallels are are almost they're almost the exact same thing yeah absolutely and then you add in dowels on top of that which you can join those are just big collections of these people coming together around a movement or you know i'm in a nft dial called flamingo dao and we we basically um you know have these weekly calls where we get together and talk about all the new and up-and-coming artists and who we want to back and um you know how much do we want to allocate for a new project and it's just a really fun process but everyone kind of collectively comes together to support and help uh increase the awareness of these new artists that are coming out and this very much feels like the the ethos that we've been hammering about crypto from day one is self-sovereignty right like we don't need some top-down platform to support this economy we can do it ourselves like we don't we don't need to have this gatekeeping about like who controls like spotify controlling all the music musicians we can figure out how to connect the investors and the artists and in the same space at the same time using the same new money uh and have these economies be bootstrapped by themselves have like the the you talked about how the artist would receive life-changing money and then they would go by other artists art right and start to generate this flywheel of some internally native economy yeah yeah it that's that's happening and then the other crazy thing though and this is funny because i'm a vc and i'm saying this is like in some sense vc's have to be very careful because they could uh go away or quite a few of them could go away because you have these dowels that are forming up that are better at fundraising they're faster decision making and they uh are really powered by the people versus it just being a handful of unknown lps that are backing venture capitalists right so it's kind of a a new way so we're kind of you know true we we're always thinking about how can we reinvent ourselves and so for us you know we've done some things we never thought we'd do one we've invested in dowsed directly which is crazy we didn't know that was even going to be a thing for us here just a couple years ago we've backed anonymous founders now which is nuts like we backed somebody by the name of shade which is like the shade from a tree like we've like had anonymous founders that we've given money too um but we have to think about also how to be you know there was this old model in dc where you had to come in and you would try and buy up 20 of a company that was kind of like you know all the the big vcs that was kind of their target ownership for for most companies i many times i push back on founders and say you do not want that much venture capital don't muddy the waters here like have involve more dows less vc more dows right and let's let's figure out how we can get that community support behind you versus it just being a handful of small vcs that may not even have the sway that you want in this new world right so in some sense it's like if you're getting a project off the ground do you want five vcs that barely understand what you're doing to invest or would you rather have five dows each with you know hundreds of members that are going to be your best brand advocates and champions right yeah and so uh twitter armies yeah so so we're we're we're treading very lightly we want to make sure that we don't own too much so we actually try and dial back uh you know when a new net like we're buying into a coin uh you know sometimes when i see these vcs that own you know 10 20 of a coin and you see this big chunk you see that pie chart when you go into you know like yeah ether scan yeah and you see they're like oh there's there's so and so vc and there's a massive chunk of the pie and it's like it doesn't feel right you know so uh we always like we talk about single digit percentages like if it's a new network launching it's like oftentimes like two or three percent not not not getting greedy and really trying to put actually have a more diversified ownership than than less so it there's a whole new world out here and a whole new way for vcs to think about this and i think a lot of them just aren't going to get it and they won't adapt and um it's it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next few years yeah there's that double student invest in facebook in order to get exposure to the metaverse yeah exactly i i just think to myself that double digit pie chart you know just screams kind of buy my bags right it doesn't scream like i'm here for the community it's just you know it sends a different message but uh i want to go back to uh you know nfts as an investment and your breakdown earlier was pretty helpful kevin were you talking about like pfp nfts and then one of ones um and par part of what you said is like hey you know your investment style is to you want to own the blue chips of the previous revolutions right you know the things the the projects that did something new for the first time right but then you also want to look for what are the next revolutions going to be and so i think that's where we are in the nft space it's like we're figuring out what we do next with this nft this erc 721 standard and we've done some pfp things we've seen one of one arts what what's next in your mind do you think it's like utility access nfts there's been some buzz around that maybe we could define it and get into it what's your take on celebrity nfts do you think mainstream is going to jump in here what's your take on the next big thing to get excited about in the nft space oh yes yeah there's a lot of time back there i think that on the celebrity nft front um i worry that those are probably the best the worst investments that are out there because it's i there's a lot of it's funny i was talking to uh to to bring up mike schnotta um from from lincoln park i was talking to him uh on my podcast recently and we're there's we're talking about celebrity nfts and one of the things i respect about him is he didn't jump into this even though he was like way on the stream almost before anyone else but he didn't jump into this because he saw it as kind of like the the obvious thing like the obvious thing of your celebrity is just to slap your name on nft right and he's like that's not interesting to me that's the obvious thing and and oftentimes sadly it's not even the actual celebrities that are doing the artwork so they'll come in they'll work with and they'll commission some artwork to be done and then they'll put their name on it right and that's not that that's just a collaboration with someone that's not really that interesting to me it just it just smells like a grab for quick cash and so i i tend to avoid that type of stuff the more interesting projects are are the ones that you know that i'm seeing that are around what can we do with nfts in terms of them being a more kind of dynamic entity versus just a static one so you know some people are working with multiple nfts to combine them and burn them to create new original works of art some people are trying to figure out how can i pipe in kind of live data into the nfts themselves so that they change and evolve over time um based on you know it could be environmental conditions it could be a whole slew of different things that gets piped into there so just looking at the artists that are willing to say i see this as something that's programmable and and what can be what can be done here so that's the kind of stuff that i get pretty excited about is some of those mechanics um and that's not to say that you should go out and just because something is is being done for the first time you should go out and and buy it but it does kind of grab my attention and and it makes me consider whether or not it's a project worth uh that kind of further investigation um i've seen some really interesting stuff like tom sacks did something recently like well-known artists that are coming into this space that say i already have a following in the kind of trad art world but i now want to embrace nfts but not just to make nfts but do something new and so when tom sacks came out with his rocket factory are you guys familiar with that nft series at all i've no i i think i've heard of it but i can't even visualize this so why oh so yeah this is a really fun one so you know traditional artist has a great following sells you know plenty of artwork on the more traditional art side came in and said okay i'm gonna make a rocket factor so what is a rocket factory so you have to made all these individual kind of cones like the top of a rocket all these individual different bodies of the rocket and those different tails of the rocket so these are three separate nfts there you go kevin that's it so you probably you may have seen the news where budweiser actually bought one of these rockets oh yeah so right that's why i heard it yes right so yeah you claim the different components and then you merge them it burns the individual nfts and creates your final rocket now the question is do you want to keep your final rocket as an nft or do you actually want to schedule a launch for your rocket and if you schedule a launch for your rocket they actually turn it into a real physical rocket and then launch it and then they uh actually film the whole thing it comes down on its parachute they ship it back to you and now you have a tom sachs like original actual physical piece of artwork that is the rocket sitting in your house so it was just a yeah it's just a fun different take on like how can we uh play with this idea of digital and physical kind of interacting another great example here is if you see with these different rockets um you can do a franken rocket which is a different like a mcdonald's nose a nasa body and a tiffany company tail that's a franken rocket a pure rocket would be like all mcdonald's up and down or and of course they didn't get any of the licensing so all this is done on the like this is it's not it's not shady they're not getting sued for it but you know tiffany and company did not endorse this yeah exactly um but it's just a fun way for an artist to say i'm going to play with this world of nfts that that in a new and novel way and i like projects like this you know um it was it was just a it's it's just some uh trying out new and interesting things that haven't been done before so we'll see more of this done from traditional artists it's it's a fun thing to to track so so the formula here is you have kind of a mainstream artist from from trad art by the way i didn't know that was the term trad art but i love that i'm using that uh and then you combine that with like some novel thing that you can do almost some utility uh some something that is much more innovative than the like copying all the projects that came previously and that to you is sort of a recipe for success is there like a utility element to any of this too right it's like um you know uh you know some of his some of his nfts they provide access to conferences um you know they they like you you get surprises in the mails all sorts of like other artists have have talked about um access to discord for example yeah do you think utility is going to increasingly become an important part of the nft experience yeah but i think this is going to be the future of monetization for creators with their communities i think the utility side will really shine um you know so for example uh you know just to talk about my own own bags for a second so i proof you know we're going to be launching a utility nft that will allow you access to just as you said like a you know podcast with no ads which i already do know ads anyway but it'll you'll get the podcast early you'll get access to the private discord in person meetups um collaborations i do with other artists like it's it's just going to be a whole slew of different things that as a content creator you just add on value over time as that creator i mean it's some very similar to to what you all are doing with with your dow you know it's like how can you take something and and put a fence around it and say if you're really a true fan um this you're doing it with tokens though right 3 500 you have to own is that right yeah 30 yeah there's different tiers yeah and that's this is kind of separate it's kind of like um you know our concept was like launch a dow with the community we have and see what they make you know uh and so it's just it's totally the communities and it's got a mind of its own yeah it's got a mind of its own which is a little bit different than i think if we were doing like um nft of the type you're describing which gets you additional access to things yeah but but tell us more about it and one other comment i think i'll say i'm curious your perspective on we found the tooling to do what you're saying i don't know how it's been with proof but like very rudimentary like that's right it's just it's hard like there are no shrink-wrapped packages to spin out an nft token if you're an artist and to create a token gated community and to like add features your fans like everything is bespoke and it's difficult uh well it's getting it's getting a lot better so that's that's the cool thing is every i i have you heard of unlock protocol yeah i've heard of unlock yes yeah so if you go to unlock dashprotocol.com like this is basically a way to take nfts and and and put various things behind these kind of locks that you created so it's like managing membership around nfts so you know this will this will allow you to do that some of the integrations that you were talking about like where you you block off certain certain content on your blog and but you're right it's like really early days for um for these types of uh this type of tooling to be done but you know i imagine it's just going to uh it's it's certainly going to be here in the next six months like there's so many different entrepreneurs that are working on on kind of creating this um it's it and it's very doable right all we have to do is look into someone's wallet and say do you hold this nft if so you have access to this resource so for me i'm going to be doing a bunch of you know there's a i'll probably um you know have a small gallery in new york or la that moves around and travels around if you want access to the gallery you bring your phone and you use the app to unlock access with your nft you know like to get behind that door just by holding this nft it's going to be uh something that we all do i was talking to mike shinoda about this like you know if he's if you're if you go to 10 of his concerts do you get a special nft that allows you early access to the 11th one on forward like um this proof of attendance uh i'm sure you all have heard of is really interesting these popes that people are collecting um this idea of once you have enough cred in a certain within a certain organization um you know certain things start to happen um certain resources start to become available so i'm i'm really excited for for nfts as they're as as gary was very smart to kick that off and say this is about providing extended access to all the things that i do through through these nfts the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes staking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access staking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless i want to highlight another thing that i'm noticing kevin in your approach to investing this space is like you're actually going out there and experimenting and doing things right so like if you have a thesis that every creator with a fan community is going to have some sort of token gated access some sort of fan token whether it's in your c721 an nft or whether that's another token the best way to go figure that out is to like your content producer so you try and experiment with what you're doing with proof and like that gives you a lay of the land of okay where's the tooling in terms of maturity what's missing what does an artist actually need to think about when they're launching one of these things to their community and you kind of learn by doing has that been a key part of your your crypto journey and your success today 100 i think you just have to go out there and play and experiment um as not even just as a creator as anyone one of the main things that i talk about on my podcast is you know there's there's so many times when we mention these things and you know you just you think about playing in this world of defy or this world of all these new things that are that are happening and um one of the biggest mistakes that you can make is just to listen to podcasts like you have to go and actually install the software and and put in put in 500 bucks 700 bucks whatever it may be even even if it's consider education and and go test out and and it's unfortunate because gas prices can be so high that they eat up everything but just go try it on polygon or like some other yeah you know i gotta go kick the tires exactly and and you'll you'll probably lose some money but it is it's like it's like buying the best textbooks like you're just going to learn so much by doing that so i'm a big fan i know that when i launch this proof nft i i purposely didn't promise a ton outside of just a couple basic things because i know that over the next three years i'm going to probably launch a good dozen or so things that you know half of them will fail but i all have been the first to have done it and it'll be like why not let's just try this what happens if we if this works you know and then also trying to over deliver yeah exactly exactly that's it i mean you guys do this quite well with with all the the great content that you put out so by the way i don't know if i ever told you but i i subscribed to your newsletter as of like maybe a year ago or something like that i started paying for your newsletter it's it's good content oh geez i appreciate it oh gee right appreciate it yeah do you have the the bank list i don't if you if you if you pay for the newsletter you get the pen you're banking with yeah amazing i didn't know that it's awesome yeah we actually have one every single year so yeah you can have the 2021 and we'll now now you would get the 2021 one uh oh that's awesome yeah the idea is of obviously just like marking attendance like how long have you been around uh and right as for just like analytics for our customer base like it really lets us know how much they really care right like oh you've been around since 2020 you've collected it's it's 20 25 you've been around since 2020 you have all five co-apps like oh man you are really committed and it's just a great way to have insights into who your actual community members are yeah and we don't really know what else we're gonna do with it it's right it's kind of the interesting you don't have to know right yeah that's the cool thing it's like start right maybe five years from now you'll decide to do something really cool with it for people that have been around with you that long you know exactly it's definitely an option on the future so kevin there's nfts are insanely fun because of how much surface area they have they have all of the surface area that's what they are non-fungible tokens means they're going to be super unique but a lot of people are can be bullish on nfts and not want to like expend the mental bandwidth to like have the upside to them how how would you if somebody came to you and was like i want exposure to nfts but i don't want to have to pick and choose between any of them how how do i get exposure to that do you have an answer to that question it's a good question you know in some sense um there is the game like that you kind of alluded to which is the person that pays attention that is like oh that is buying the latest bfp drops and they're flipping and they're so actively in it that that's the game that you have to give up like half your life to or more right yeah and so i would say that the thing that's really tough is that all of the stuff that we know to be good stuff that meaning that we can look at it and say gosh wouldn't it be great if i was able to afford a crypto punk or a board eight because they're just they're so massive now that they'll just go down in history as as being these these firsts right that we've been talking about um the only way i know to play in that arena is and this is i was talking to my sister about this actually it's just like go and fracture buy a fractionalized nft so that that's that's what a lot of folks that can't afford a crypto punk are doing is they'll go on like fractionalized.art or there's a there's another one i know that's actually not out yet but i can talk about it in the next few weeks but um there are these basically these smart contracts that go in they take a high value nft they lock it in the smart contract and they create a token that is um associated with that nft and then you can buy that token and then you know people buy and sell it it's liquid it's you know they add liquidity um to unit swap for that token and you you can go in and just own one one thousandth of a zombie crypto punk right and so if you in your head are thinking like okay this is something that i believe is going to go up over the next couple decades but i can't afford four hundred thousand dollars for a crypto punk right now today then it's the it's the easiest way to get some exposure to some of these high value assets without actually having to go and you know putting up the cash for for a whole one so that's the only thing i can think of other than that it's just really about um going in super deep and just understanding and trying to identify who the next you know x copy is going to be before they blow up and i think a lot of that is happening on tezos actually it's that whole hen ecosystem and all of the i don't know if you've you've paid much attention to everything that's happening on on tesla's with like object uh and and hen and these these sites that are just like so many people are minting on tezos because and it kills me to say that i'm not a huge tesla's fan but um primarily because it just they're having skilling issues like everyone else and when it slows down it it kills me but um people like it because it's green it's proof of stake you know which obviously ethereum's going there very soon but they a lot of the up and coming artists when they can go on tezos then they can mint something for five dollars like that's a that's a win for them versus having to to go out and deploy their own smart contract or meant for hundreds of dollars right so you see a lot of scrappy up and coming artists that are on on tezos that are minting on tezos so um that for me is kind of where i pick through the up and comers and try and find you know really interesting unique artists uh on on that platform so that that would be the place where i would say to spend some time for sure that that's some good insight and definitely some good alpha i mean some people are asking like are nfts really for everyone right when like gas fees are so high and it costs so much to mint and uh you know every transaction like they're they're so the existing ones are so expensive so having these like playgrounds being able to identify the next big thing is super important but i want to zoom out and ask another question because you know par earlier in the podcast we were talking about facebook right which is now meta this is mark zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse right now we've just been you know spending an hour or so talking about crypto and nfts with you here kevin and um i want to know if what we're talking about is actually the metaverse like have we been talking about the metaverse we have the entire components of the metaverse okay sure well what is the metaverse then how does it come together how do these components form to create this thing everyone just started talking about in 2021 which is this digital reality david and i think of it as very much like digital property rights for the individuals but there are other definitions of this thing what is the metaverse in your mind so many people like to think of the metaverse as like this vr experience that is just like oh you have to own oculus to participate in the metaverse you know and and for me i i would say that i've always been known as a hater of vr i've always thought it was like very remember when the wii came out we all got super excited about like swinging and playing tennis and doing bowling for a little bit i remember vi like or vr sort of uh platforms like i didn't did sony ever have one at one point in time was there some old janky version like it's been the promise i feel like for every five years it's always been yeah it's just three five years away it's a great wow factor a demo is quite well right like everybody everyone can agree that we all can have fun in vr for the first couple hours and then the question is does it have that you know is it sticky enough to beat out just a couple of friends sitting on a sofa you know playing call of duty you know just with their their standard traditional way and the answer at this point is no um so somebody who's put in 50 plus hours into an oculus headset playing golf in vr with my friends i'm going to go ahead and take the other side of this argument i think it's very much the social element that is really what vr really has optimized for it's not really the games it's playing games with your friends and if you're other friends playing games with you vr is pretty tight i get that that's i get that that is a very fun experience i think that you are in a very small group of of people like how many how many people are doing that what what what is so there's three people i do it with are in a vr startup so they're in the industry yeah right see that i've seen in terms of like uh concurrent active users in vr it's like in the tens of thousands like it's not it's not big like but that said you know i i've played some awesome boxing games i've done a bunch of these drawing things with friends like i i too i have i have the latest oculus sitting upstairs and it's because i want to give it a shot like every two or three months somebody'll be like you got to try this out right but it still hasn't replaced you know a standard playstation or xbox just sitting there for me but i i hear you like there's the you know and i do believe at some point in the future it'll be the right combination of price form factor battery life all the things like the nausea stuff like they'll figure all that stuff out but in the meantime i think the metaverse really today for me and everyone defines this a little bit differently i think of it as more uh components reusable components that have a defined open source definition that we can move around to different experiences and platforms and they could be 2d they could be 3d they could be oculus they could be whatever but i i believe that when i look at what's happening with some of the nfts and how they're getting wired up whether it be like the 3d kongs or the me bits and how they're creating actual models for them so they can be used in these kind of metaverses um you know cryptovoxels or whatever it may be or sandbox um it's it's i i don't believe there's going to be kind of one winner take all here where it's going to be like oh of course it's just facebook it's it's that's the metaverse i think it's going to be a bunch of different experiences on different platforms that we can take our components own our stuff and bring it with us and move it around our property exactly so if we have a really cool me bit that we like from larva labs we can move it into five or ten different games um and seamlessly it'll just be connecting our wallet and it'll come with us and i i i believe and i hope that is the future of these these digital assets is we can just quickly and easily move them around through these different worlds um but it's it's really early days reusable components you can take with you from environment to environment right it's like owning your own inventory there's almost in the gaming world these are like items uh how important do you think is decentralization in that definition kevin i think it's a pretty pretty big piece is it like fundamental is it like so i mean someone might argue from facebook might argue that hey like facebook can provide you all of the items and guess what we created this standard and it's a world adopted standard it's the facebook uh 721 the fb 721 and you can port it to all of these other ecosystems because they've also adopted this standard is that the metaverse or do you think decentralization has to be part of it because without that individuals don't really own anything for your thoughts well it's it's a it really depends on how facebook approaches these digital assets and i don't think they've they've yet kind of shown their hand here um you know there was the old school microsoft way of of saying hey we're look at us we're we're like we're friendly we play with everybody but in reality it was kind of like still trying to lock you into their walled garden um i'm probably dating myself but that was the way microsoft used to operate and i i worry that facebook is kind of kind of optimized for more of that type of world than they will a truly free and open world so we'll we'll see i i think it's on us as as individuals to to push the agenda and to say this is what we demand that it be something where i can take my components elsewhere and i think it's going to be really difficult especially for some of the large larger game manufacturers out there where the bulk of their revenue comes from selling skins and it comes from selling these assets why would they want you to bring your own like into their game like they're just missing out on revenue so i think there's a huge opportunity here for indie developers to to come in and kind of really do some some work here that uh embraces this new tech like it's gonna be web three native folks that are gonna get it right it's it'll be the older ones that already have this is part of their their revenue stream they're going to be the last to want to to adopt it kevin as we come to a close here we want to throw some rapid questions your way and we'll kind of just hit on a number of different subjects you ready for them yeah let's do it all right question number one are you ever gonna go bankless um that would be very difficult for me because i believe in a diversified i still believe the equities kind of you know play a part in my overall portfolio construction and so in some sense i have to have centralized uh i guess i could request the stock certificates and put them in a vault somewhere or something well hey we're bankless maxis but we're ryan and i are also convenience maxies too so but neither we have a wells fargo account yeah neither of us have actually officially broken up with our banks yet yeah i mean there's certain things that that like you know you just have to i i'd imagine that for me to be to get rid of my checking account is probably another decade out and i but i think that will come through um a new modern form of that i don't we'll see totally do you think one chain will dominate over the others or do you think it's like a purely multi-chain world there will be thousands of chains what's your take it's a great question i i believe that um there are chains now that have enough traction that it's going to be hard to unseat them um just like some people still use oracle databases i think that there is there's once there's enough around something it tends to stick around for a while there will be use cases that emerge that specific chains will address better than others um and you know for example like are weave for file storage right um that's that's a really interesting play on on file storage that sticks around for several hundred years right um i ethereum's not going to tackle that anytime soon right so i think there'll be a very specific use case i i do believe that with speed um we will see new blockchain use cases so i would love to throw a question back to you because i've never i don't believe i've ever heard you talk about in the show i know you guys all have i mean you got the ethereum poster hanging in the background but i'm curious on on the solana front like i i believe that type of performant tech will unlock um very interesting use cases in d5 that you wouldn't normally see even on a layer two world so um yeah i'm i yeah that's a long way of saying i believe it's going to be a multi-chain world but i i just want to hear that the 30 second from both of you and what you think of solana yeah i was going to say i don't know if we can i don't know if we can wrap that up in a in a rapid fire uh type format but i guess my tldr would be um we very much agree that high throughput chains i guess or low transaction fee chains will unlock a massive amount of use cases so totally with you there new use cases things we've never seen before we also think that um chains like monolithic chains like solana or like polygon proof of stake or something like that they also have their fit right they're net accretive to the ecosystem and so they're bringing more users in and that's fantastic and users should go use whatever chain they feel like they want like they want to there shouldn't be dogma about it like oh i have to pay ten dollars because then i'm an ethereum sell it right um further though we also believe there's an episode we put out around modular versus monolithic block chains we actually think the monolithic design that solana is optimizing for is kind of and ethereum in its current phase this is yeah and so we're very bullish on um layer twos and roll-ups and um actually maximizing the the base chain for decentralization or the consensus layer in a modular blockchain design for um for decentralization but this is a whole topic can of worms and something i want to i want to listen to that episode what was that check out that one episode it's called um is it ultra scalable ethereum modular versus monolithic uh we'll include as a link in the show notes too and so just so i can uh just summarize a little bit you're saying give me security at the base layer make it more modular get the and and that is better than having less security but more performance at the base layer yes because so just like what you were saying with how many different chains will optimize for very many different use cases ethereum the l1 needs to optimize for decentralization so it can sell that product which that product being decentralization to other blockchains and with these other blockchains we consider these l layer twos and so there's a lot of use cases that decentralization is really an afterthought but you still want decentralization and so if you want to make an application specific blockchain that optimizes for execution and throughput you can do that you just tap into ethereum and you get ethereum to give you its decentralization and these this is roll-ups right and so just like how like solana is optimized for execution ethereum is optimized for decentralization but it does mean that ethereum's going to have this weird sort of puberty type era this awkward phase era that we're in now where the actual usage has to transition from the ethereum main chain onto layer twos right so like ultimately in this modular design ethereum main net is actually just a a chain for other chains to settle on top of it's a settlement hub and users should get it it's weird that we're there off yeah and it it's weird that we're in this hybrid place like like we're very much uh we don't think gas fees will go down sustainably over the long hour they can't like they'll just go up and so ethereum's in this awkward phase where like users are still kind of stuck on the new machine they especially because they have to bridge right now and bridging totally like when i think of i always put my like hat on my consumer hat on and you know we've all done the the crazy you know matic over back and forth and through the woods and it's terrible it's horrible yeah nobody's gonna do that like i have a hard time doing that i'm just like why am i doing all this it's like 10 like hurdles just to get to an uh yeah you can't but but we do think that like bridges will come from centralized exchanges and this will all get easier in the future but anyway okay it's back to rapid fire kevin because we still got some questions uh why is dogecoin still a thing this just goes it speaks to the power of community i mean one of the things that um i'm a believer in is that we have to start thinking about you know these pfp projects of 10 000 um these any time you community is actually part of the product right and so even though there hasn't been any technical innovation going on there people want something to rally behind i mean and this and doge is i mean i was buying in in playing with doge i actually had the founder um jackson uh on my show on my podcast um gosh i guess eight or nine years ago eight years ago something like that yeah cause he quit he's out now right yeah he's out yeah and he he hates it now but uh he had a pretty long rant on that whole thing but um i think one of the things that i really loved about my initial conversation with them that long ago was that he was all about understanding that this community could can come together work together and do amazing things and they were sponsoring nascar back then they were doing all these really crazy things um and they feel like they're owners in the project um and this is theirs to like own hold and and it's it's a game that they want to play partially and it's partially because they think of it as like that well at least back in the day is there was their tipping currency so i it's a brand at the end of the day it's a brand and i think that any modern project also has to be part brand you know so kevin let's fast forward 10 years into the future nfts have exploded everyone's got their own nfts that they like layer two ecosystems vibrant crypto gaming is blossoming where's bitcoin in this world um this is the hardest one yeah yeah it's this is a oh god i want to hear your guys the answer on this one um i want to hear david's you know it's funny it's a weird thing in my head this sounds so odd because it's cryptocurrency but in my head bitcoin is like bonds like i like have a little bitcoin because i'm like that's my little safe nest egg over here to the side you know i don't think of it as anything kind of like sexy and innovative but i think of it as something that is just going to give me a nice reliable long-term store of value slash return over the next couple decades and you know with the happenings happening every four years i i can't imagine it doesn't continue to at least track the market if not outpace it so i don't know i'm i'm not a seller because of that reason i mean it's the og it's like in some sense you have to kind of pay respect and and always hold a little so is it the crypto punk of cryptocurrencies almost in some sense it is you know so i i am not i'm never gonna say like i i'm not a seller of bitcoin but i'm not buying any more if that makes any sense it's just like it's my safe it's my safe crypto as weird as that sounds no it seems like a very very reasonable take i i think it's like the the east btc ratio which a lot of people are looking at right now and you can it's a fractal right you can go down the line uh like solana versus eth like avalanche versus eth all like eath versus btc goes up in bull markets and down in bear markets and then the same thing with all coins arise in bull markets and all coins die in bear markets if we are bullish on this as an industry everything else is therefore going to outpace bitcoin because that's what happens when this industry grows um right but bitcoin also never actually goes away itself either right a lot of things do go to zero versus bitcoin well and there's these purists though that are on the other side of that that are that i i feel in some sense i have a couple of these friends that are i won't call them crazy but i i can say i won't call them crazy and that makes them sound a little crazy um they they're like these people that they're obsessed with like this trial this craig wright trial and like they're like they're like they're so they know every little intimate detail of everything on the bitcoin side and and for them they don't care about like programmable money they're not really interested in any of that they're just like give me give me basic crypto i want basic crypto you know right uh and and so i feel that that is always going to have its fan base right it's like you don't have to figure anything else out there's no funky how do i get to a layer two and back it's just basic crypto and so i i just um i i i imagine that stays around for quite some time yeah i i i totally agree i i can say this confidently bitcoin will appreciate relative to fiat so that i am pretty certain of um kevin this has been fantastic to talk to you man really enjoyed this i gotta end with this question because you are totally dialed into the crypto space uh it's obvious you spend so much of your working time there now in the kind of the web 3 world so what's next what's next for kevin do you got some projects are you excited to launch what uh what can you hit with hit us with at the end of this conversation yeah i mean i think for me um i really do want to start exploring how we can embrace community and so with app proof just on specifically on the nft side and so you know the proof is going to be called the proof collective that i'm coming out with it'll be launching in december um yeah and folks can just sign up for my newsletter at proof.xyz and i'll do the announcement on there um but that's gonna be a way for me to play and test out different ideas um a whole slew of different things that i have ideas around that i want to play with and it's going to be a fun nft to do i'm going to do a thousand of them basically um and there's going to be the most hardcore kind of nft collectors that that hold them and then these thousand people will have access to all these crazy experiments more or less and um yeah there's a there's like i'll give you one like one fun one that is just i've been toying around with and um i think this is applicable i'm talking to a few different artists and i think that there's something here basically uh let's just say you're you have this this utility nft right and this utility nft gives you access to a special i wouldn't call it a club but just a special actual physical space that you could go to um have you ever been to like soho house in new york or any of these kind of places right so say you have access to this place where you can go in use your nft to check in and there's a gallery you can check out other nfts you can even display your own as you walk in into different spaces so just figuring out how you as you walk around through physical spaces your nfts kind of follow you around would be interesting um and then having live artists kind of perform there as well so you can imagine there being let's just say there's a night a musician comes in does a live recording there in front of the however 50 75 100 people that show up that have that specific nft you then take that live recording and instantly both press it out to vinyl i give the option to either press it out to vinyl or also send it to you in a nft form that you could then destroy and get receive one of the vinyls in return um but just of that actual attendance that place that you went on that specific occasion and so i'm just trying to figure out i mean it's just one of a thousand little ideas of how can we bring more of this experience into real life environments for you know holders of this type of thing i believe that there's interactive real world when you're a member of something like this you will then be able to participate both in terms of enjoying something new and also when you walk in bringing the environment with you if that makes sense yeah totally that's awesome man i do think there's something special about the nft community um you know at this point in time where you get a bunch of them together holding a common nft and who knows what you can do with it yeah absolutely and then other artists like getting together to actually create artwork live would be a ton of fun like how cool would it be if you could actually go to a private event and you watch people make a live artwork in front of you up on a projector and then you walk out with that nft because you were part of that live event like that's freaking awesome like that would just be so much fun so i think that that's the cool thing about amt's is it gives you this this like open license to just go play and experiment because it is so art driven that that you can you know just try anything and just see if it sticks yeah playing experimentation that is the name of the game in web 3 in the nft space kevin rose you were my guide to web 2 that's how i first uncovered it on dig it's
