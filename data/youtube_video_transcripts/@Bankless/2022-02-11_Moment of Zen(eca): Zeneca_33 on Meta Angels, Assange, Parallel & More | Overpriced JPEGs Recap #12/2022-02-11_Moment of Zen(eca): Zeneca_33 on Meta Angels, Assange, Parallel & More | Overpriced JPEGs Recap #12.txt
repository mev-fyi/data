there are a lot of outcomes that are not the future that we're envisioning and so it really is important that we work towards building the future that we're all thinking that we're actually building [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley it is another moment of zenika episode you know what that means it means we have zenika 33 back on the show to talk about what's been happening over the last week two weeks in crypto most importantly we get into the projects that we're excited about the projects we're looking out for projects you might want to go look up see what's happening in those ecosystems might be good investments not financial advice i don't know i'm just saying maybe and uh we talk about some of the news that's been coming out of the crypto world lately too like the larva labs v1 punk situation and the yuga labs being doxxed situation and punk 6529 i believe it's that's right um the fund that he's launching so if you haven't been keeping up with some of those big sort of news pieces in the web3 space check out this episode we break them down we give our opinions and just generally shoot the [ __ ] i have to say very grateful for zedeka for hopping on this one i think i say it during the episode but he actually we like had this conversation at like four in the morning his time which isn't unusual zenika like he will dispute this but i'm convinced he does not sleep um and so it was like 4 a.m his time it was also like 9 hours before he had a flight to dubai so a lot going on i appreciate him very last minute hopping on to have this conversation i think you will enjoy it despite the fact that it was a little bit more last minute than we usually go for these but i still think there's some valuable alpha in

carly riley and i am joined today by our favorite recurring guest for our favorite recurring segment zenica33 for a moment of zenika hey zenika hello and thank you am i your only recurring guest though because quite literally my only word but i'll take it favorite is good i'll take it it's like you know i have a favorite mom you know it's the one that i have yeah yeah yeah i hate being uh i don't know there's probably somebody we've had on the pod twice and oh well sure for like our predictions episode we had betty from dead fellas on again so like you know we've had a couple guests yeah yeah yeah back but you sort of had john rogers on twice that's true we did like a clarification episode that got more heck than the initial thing we were trying to clarify because that's how that always goes yeah um but that's true yeah we've had a couple recurring guests but none like you uh let's dive in obviously want like the overview macro what are we looking at but i also kind of wanted to ask you i don't know if this is a weird question or a fun question like if i were to say like hey what's the biggest thing that happened in crypto over this last week that's something that ryan sean adams i feel like texts sometimes or like tweets out sometimes like i feel like it'd be different depending on who you ask in this space because we sort of have our filters on different things what would that be for you like what are the biggest things that happened in your mind and in the space in the last week like what were you paying attention to i mean the biggest thing in crypto it has to be the hack for the the sole eath bridge for like 80 000 eth or something that was just ludicrous but like i mean that's sort of again like kind of out of my wheelhouse and not nft related so out of my real house too so let's not talk about it all right that's not talking saying something stupid um let's see it's been kind of a quiet week market's been a bit like down-ish i have like recency bias the the pixelmon drop where they they sold out basically at three eth and sucked 70 million out of the ecosystem that's a pretty big thing that that's happened yeah tell me more about this i have not been tracking it that closely i like saw people saying things and then never closely followed up so like teach me on this yes i mean i'm not fully on board like i didn't get involved with it in any way really but basically it's a it was is a mass it was a massively hyped project they're talking about building a game i'm pretty sure the team's fully anonymous but it just had infinite hype and they were giving her mintless spots and people were crazy going crazy about them um and then they decided to do a dutch auction for like the public sale before the mint list because but i mean same as azuki method i think where you could buy it half of whatever the dutch auction ended at or something like that uh and they started the three eth and they just sold like 80 or something in in 10 minutes and uh subsequently like they didn't sell out all of it and there was this weird thing i think happening sorry if that you can hear that as my dog there's a weird thing happening where yeah they didn't sell out fully so then people were panicking like why aren't other people buying it 2.8 2.7 2.6 and then so the people that bought it three started listing lower and lower and the floor price kind of tanked really quickly like it sold out of three and within maybe an hour it was down like 1.5 and so just a disaster let me check where it's at right now but um yeah i mean that's that's what that's what happens when people ape into projects at three eth with such a high supply like if you're yoga labs and you're dropping mutants sure you know that's perhaps justifiable if you're not yoga labs yeah i know it was a different time and all that but yeah the floor price is one eighth now so well it's also reminding me of of the lives of asuna which i know you also haven't you were saying you haven't tracked too too closely but have some thoughts on but it strikes me that there was sort of a similar thing happening where it was like i guess like super over hyped without people necessarily buying in because of some like they were so fundamentally bullish like crazy on the project and so then you have this thing happen where it rapidly spikes to three and a half eighth and then like rapidly crashes back down to half an eighth and then the community's freaking out and you know i actually was feeling bad for the the project founders and that i can say say on that but like why do you how does this happen like why do these over hypes on these projects come about like and then what makes in your opinion like an azuki seem to last and maintain the hype whereas a mecca verse or the lives of asuna or pixelmon like collapse and not maintain yeah there's a lot of factors i mean pixelmon again i'm not intimately familiar i think what caused it was like the whole market was bullish and people saw and i'm sure they were sharing good sneak peeks good hype tactics people are excited it's a gaming nft people like that kind of stuff and then it was just there was just so much hype that it happened and then i mean i don't know why it crashed i mean i don't know why i didn't maybe because it was a doc's not a doc's team maybe because they didn't have anything ready to go afterwards maybe because they shouldn't have sold it three eighth they should have sold lower i mean that was that's cleared the answer um liza vasuna is an interesting one because it is not an anonymous team one of i mean the artist behind it is very well known and respected like they've sold pieces for 40 50 eth so it's like that's got a lot going for it plus it's like an anime project in this meta where it's kicked off with azuki we're seeing a lot of anime projects doing well although now all the nazuki ones are sort of not like yeah zipsies had a dip and yeah zipsies went to like five or sixteenth now it's like between one and two lives of asuna was hovering between like 1.5 and three eth for ages and then like the post reveal happened and then it's down like 0.5 so i i guess i'm i'm more familiar and bullish on a sooner versus pixelmon but probably just because i'm not very familiar with pixelmon so um yeah it's just it's a crazy time in the market when it's very frothy you know projects can sell out ten thousand at three you know there's lots of projects selling at ten thousand and one eighth or point five point two five point two min prices ten are seemingly going higher and higher as projects are realizing hey we can raise more money um but the fair market value or like the actual value is not at that level and i mean i'm a fan of dutch auctions but not for everything i think there's something to be said but for having the min price low enough so that there's people willing to value it higher and secondary market goes up and people are happy and there's activity and yeah yeah dutch auction i feel like is is helpful for price discovery i guess what would be the what would be the factors obviously you mentioned yoga labs doing it right but like what would be the factors that you would make you advise a project like yeah go the duck auction route versus the more traditional route i think that what most projects do with dutch options is also not great like they start too low three it's realistic it'll sell out at that point and if the goal is to raise as much money as possible then that's probably fine but like in terms of market health and true price discovery i think started like 20th no one's going to pay 20. and then you actually see at what point people start saying hey that's a good buy i want one of those nfts at one eighth point six and then i think that's what more projects should do and that to me is like an effective way to run a dutch option art blocks does it pretty well now with their drops um they start very high and then they drop and then markets decides when to apn i would say for less hyped projects it kind of makes sense to do i don't know what do i know i'm an idiot [Laughter] none of us know anything very much not none of us know anything i mean that that's right i do think your point is well taken though right which is that if you if your goal is actually to sell them at three eth like just sell them at three eth or or i guess here's really what it is like sell them at what you think they're worth right if you think there's a chance they're worth three eth and you can sustain that market then fine maybe dutch auction it's starting it there or or whatever right like i think um we we mentioned him somewhat regularly i feel like when we talk but garyvee did a dutch auction for his many of which ultimately sold at like the floor price that they went down to but i feel like that was an example where that's somebody who genuinely believes and seemingly rightfully so that he can sustain the highest price he started selling them at so it wasn't it wasn't really a risk for him to sell it highest if they all sold out at that highest price great fine yeah you know he's going to be able to sustain that kind of evaluation and so it's really thinking about what is the risk if it sells at that higher end price do you as a project feel like that's a legitimate valuation for for where you're starting where you're starting out um i do feel pr feel bad for projects like mecha verse and and lives of asuna my impression being that it's not always not the teams we're trying to create this massive massive hype for the projects going forward like i didn't see anything that said oh you're trying to overhype this project yourself you're trying to hype it up just like any other project is trying to market theirs but sometimes these things take on lives of their own and like it puts the team i think in a really bad position because what do you if you see it getting pumped up to three four or five in the case of mecca versus it got up i think it's like 10 eth yeah what are you supposed to say and and asuna put out a um like a memo or you know a medium post i think recently to explain everything that was going on and they were like it was overhyped like we'll be blunt like it was over hyped and we feel comfortable saying that because people believe in our fundamentals but like it was and it's so tricky because do you say that while you watch it happening and like get people mad that you're almost driving the price of your own project down do you say it after it collapses naturally and everyone's pissed like it's a really tough position i think for a team to be in yeah no i think you're absolutely right most people don't think about it from the team's perspective and some teams definitely do hype it up themselves and really go aggressive with the marketing tactic and and i'm not a fan of that uh approach just because it it adds fuel to the speculation fire that is already rampant in this space but there are definitely like just teams who are just building doing their thing people find out about the project think it's cool because it probably isn't great and then you know it just blows up and then it's just like they may have been selling it at 0.18 and thinking that's a very fair and reasonable price all of a sudden it's at three eth and people are buying it on secondary three eth and then a tanks and then now they've got people who bought into their project at three eth who are really upset and losing money and it's it's a stressful situation for project founder and we've joked of course about you being the anti-marketer with your own project you were like basically actively like yeah really think about why you're buying this and you know you put out recently you've had really i think a nice healthy steady growth on the price of the zen academy token which i think is a testament to just like actually delivering quality and doing literally zero over hyping of your own yeah that's that was yeah i mean i just didn't want to hype it at all yeah yeah well your your discord is great i always i feel like hype it for you because i'm a a big fan of of being a member of zen academy um let's talk about projects that we uh are excited we know more about yeah we know we know something about meta angels you definitely know this project better than i do it's been on my like want to research this list for a couple weeks now i think i think allison downey who's one of the founders had tagged me on something about it or somebody tagged both of us like been one of those ones that i'm like need to research more have started to a little bit but you are into this project so i am so in love with this project it is i mean i am literally the largest holder of the project i i have 33 of my own and then i bought 73 on the zen academy account oh my god i've gone big so full disclosure up front and i'm very well might buy more because i love absolutely everything about this project it's fantastic it like the art is phenomenal it's by an australian maori artist uh sarana haita uh i may be mispronouncing her name um the three co-founders allison downey uh alex and max are just fantastic humans i had a video called the voice yeah a call with them like two three weeks ago just to connect i think they they i don't know we wanted to do something with zen academy or something they're just excellent humans which you know is just a good starting point they're very well um accomplished they've all had successful careers in you know business and tech and launching companies and all that working with startups which is basically what an nft project is um so that's a plus they know how to run a business and all that and then the actual project and the the vision of it and what they're hoping to do is i think like a noble good cause so the the premise is that so they come from like a background where they've had access to like exclusive clubs in the real world like whether it's um y combinator or like you know incubators and like the columbia university alumni you know all that kind of stuff which 99 people have no access to and but it gives them a huge leg up because it's like tapping into a network connections if they need to know someone like whatever big company all right everyone knows that you know connections and networking is valuable and they were thinking how can they like democratize that a bit and make it more accessible to everyone excuse me and then so they saw that these membership model things were happening in the nft community and they thought why don't we do something like that and just sort of try and create a network use our network and bring value to holders of our nfts now obviously that if that is successful the nft price goes up and then again it becomes inaccessible to new people so they came up with a lending system which i believe is a first of its kind but uh i think it was also ben from curious addies who did the actual coding of it but effectively they've into the smart contract coded away that anyone can lend their token to anyone else whether it's like a a mentee student a community member in if you're like part of a discord a friend to say hey take this use it be part of the community get some value um and and there's no risk so i mean you could you can lend it to like if you're an nfp project to your um community members and not worry that they're going to go sell it on the secondary market um if the price does appreciate you capture that upside because you hold the token and it's just being lent and used by someone else i thought that was really interesting and cool i love that that that's definitely what caught my attention when i first was starting to kind of dig in and i still have more research to do but do you know functionally like how that lending works like is it how does it actually like is it a sort of a separate nft technically that functions is it rap like how what is it i i don't know technically held in escrow yeah i mean so i'm pretty sure the night that ben heard about this from allison and the team or around that time maybe he had the idea himself we we have like a discord chat and he very excitedly was like look at this lending thing and he has this way where he'll just like vomit 400 messages in a row so he told me about exactly how it worked and i do not remember but it's some sophisticated mechanism um i my suspicion is that it is something to do with creating a new nft so like you lend it and like creates like a copy of like on the polygon network maybe a ghost token that expires after i said i i i'm just i don't know anything this is what happened i would like to say for anybody listening um who's laughing at our uh persistent insistence that we know nothing it is 11 30 p.m where i am it is what does that mean 5 25 am where you are zenika and you have a flight to is it dubai dubai and like nine hours yeah yeah so like you know we usually record these podcasts zenika never operates on sensible hours but in general we usually record these podcasts at slightly more sensible hours and uh he's flying somewhere so we weren't able to so god bless him was willing to kind of do a last-minute thing and so like about an hour ago two hours ago we were like let's just hop on and talk in two hours so uh yeah less prep than usual a little chaotic here yeah less prep than usual i will say funny enough as you were speaking i just got a discord message that meta angels is now closing their discord to new members because they're getting a lot of attention on on the drop i guess so i'm actually disappointed because i feel bad we're talking about i was going to say one of the things that's exciting to me about talking about this project is that it actually still is at a somewhat accessible price point public sale hasn't even happened yet it's just still in pre-sale so you know i feel like some of the projects we talked about that we're excited about have already kind of pumped but uh by the time this comes out on friday i don't know where things will stand i think it'll still be relatively sick still be accessible the market is like not crazy at the moment and i think it's an awesome project but it's not like it's not some mega hyped project that everyone is going crazy from so and it's one of those projects where i think a lot of the value will come long term um as the team continues to deliver so it's a team that's that's worth betting on seems to be the the the basis and they're doing cool stuff the lending piece i i will dig more into this and tell y'all about it uh in more depth if i can find it because i i i'm really interested in this and in the whole concept of like um i mean lending putting funds in escrow like all of these things that are very common in the traditional financial system that we don't see right now a whole lot of in um like current nft defy world i'm really excited for the growth of all of that so then we can actually really kind of imitate the banking world i think it's like financial primitives i was reading an article about it a while back and and the different ways that people are thinking about how to how to do all sorts of other kind of primitives beyond just like buy sell um so anybody who's innovating in that way is exciting to me yeah so what the the meta angels team said specifically is they're trying to focus on obviously their minting process which is going on right now and there are a lot of bots important impersonating the team and they want to be able to be more responsive to the team member to people in the community who are like pinging them so they're closing down the discord so that they can kind of focus on the the crew they have there answering questions and worry less about new bots coming in and spam and all yeah that makes sense makes sense and testament to them hopefully it's open again by the time folks are listening to this or intrigued by the project but it is a wonderful discord yeah yeah it seemed great well it reminds me too so i don't know if you've been following this whole bff's uh project or or drop it off yes yeah this was a um brit marin who founded oh she found britain co some of my my lady listeners out there might be familiar with britain co it's like an online website and kind of lifestyle and curation and whatever and she did this whole like live stream essentially on youtube with a ton of women uh lisa mayer from boss beauties was there mila cunis talking about uh stoner cats was there gwyneth paltrow was there like it was like randy zuckerberg i mean it was it was kind of a star-studded cast and among other artists and things and the whole thing was geared towards bringing helping new women like new people to the space but women in particular like learn about nfts why this is exciting you know how it generates wealth and and why more women should be involved and at the end of the live stream they like gave out a phone number and we're like you know we're going to airdrop the first whatever 1000 people or 10 000 people or something who who uh text us we're going to airdrop them something so i was a part of that airdrop the thing has an offer on it for like over half an eighth the floor price on this thing is like point seven all with the promise that it's going to be a mint pass to an a pfp project they're dropping i think in a month or something but i'm like sort of debating i'm like i don't know it's hard i'm like that i take i'm like bad at not taking money i'm like i just want the money it's like free profits there but i do think the project is is cool and reminds me of meta angels in the sense that there's this very like let's help each other out um fundamental premise to it which is like mentor people uh do good for for other members of our community like it's just a very the ethos is very centered on helping others um yeah one more thing with meta angels that i really love is it's so they're so conscientious about being inclusive to absolutely everyone so alison wrote this fantastic twitter thread on why lists should be called gold lists or mint lists and not white lists and and or breaking that down and the art is um intentionally basically gender neutral so like for many pieces you can't tell if it's a man or a woman or male female it's like it's a lot up to interpretation and it's sort of like it they did they didn't want to say hey we're going to be a women-led project and like a women focused project and have like only female traits they said completely gender-neutral and credited to the artist like there are so many pieces where it really makes you think and two different people may have two different interpretations and the art is just exceptional like there aren't many pfp projects where i think i would like to have the art on my wall i think this is one of them which is yeah yeah that says a lot if if a project resonates and makes you feel like that that's always a really good sign to me like that was me for for ep heroes i don't know how to pronounce that where it's like oh this is just [ __ ] cool you know and i was like i have no idea and i i said i like cause i was talking about it publicly and i was like i have i really don't know that this is something that's going to make people money in the end right it's so personal to me the words i used whatever right but like i was just like i love this and i was like i don't care if this ever makes money like i'm buying this because i actually just resonate with the thing that's happening here which actually leads me to the other the project i was sort of tracking this week which was the the pack julian assange drop which also was a word thing i really like words i don't i feel like we're talking about this last time where i said it in my podcast last time like i've always been like music and lyrics like i kind of resonate with words more than art or like visual art uh and so some of these projects that are now starting to have this sort of written word component to them like the epo heroes piece this pack drop like there's something that that hits me in a different kind of way um you have not been tracking this as closely it sounds like no i had a couple people message me about it i was i went to the website i know basically nothing more so tell me yeah i mean assuming you're you're familiar enough with julian assange wikileaks he was a you know very famous whistleblower essentially and and released all sorts of documents about you know civilian deaths that the united states had been involved in in various wars and you know a general kind of whistleblower against the government he'd been living in ecuador for years as far as i knew he was still in ecuador but was was looking it up and he actually was kicked out of ecuador essentially and is now in a british prison uh and so this drop partly went to fund his legal case and actually out of this drop sprung something called the assange dao which is has raised like 50 million dollars for to fight for his his legal rights there's not a commentary on assange or you know i tend to be pretty pro whistleblowers but people can can have their own feelings around that um but the the drop itself was pay what you want so there was no set price on it so you know you could it was incredibly inclusive from that standpoint and you you typed a word and then it it crossed it out right and it was this commentary on censorship and what you kind of cannot say and i saw people have really interesting interpretations of that like somebody was was listing like uh where there were atrocities so like auschwitz and you know other places where there had been sort of terrible atrocities committed in like a never forget kind of a way like what what what do future generations need to make sure to remember and so i i thought it left lots of room for interesting interpretation i mean pac in general for folks who don't know like very renowned kind of artists in the space mostly for a very avant-garde like work that tends to follow the pattern of like maybe this is super deep or maybe it's nothing and then it sells for a lot of money um so anyhow i thought that was um interesting and and again it made me think which is always a a sign of real art if it gets you i think it's closed yeah it sounds just like something i would love cooler it was cool again another one of those ones where you're like i don't know this will ever sell for anything because it's sort of personal to me but a fun experience and feels like you know hybridgens are harbingers of what could come in this in this space polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming

like they've been doing pretty well lately kind of highlight uh i'm a big fan of the rebels it's um for those that don't know so they launched about a month ago i think um it's a like a metaverse fashion project it's a pfp project but like uh so it's it's called the rebels by house of kalinkin house of klinken is a fashion brand accompanied by robert klinken who is a famous person in the fashion fashion world um and yeah so their story is super interesting so it goes back to about 2013 where uh i believe an artist created who is who is part of the team um created some ads for you know uh robert uh lincoln and house lincoln and these ads were like you know people in jeans with comments like um jesus or like mother mary like oh gosh you know oh god and and like just very mild to my mind religious tones and they're based in lithuania um and yeah so this court uh so they released these ads with you know religious undertones and then like the i guess pro-religion catholics in lithuania where like rahrara you can't have ads with you know anything like that depicting jesus and it's so you know casual whatever and then basically got the ads taken down you know they went to court they ruled in favor or against the the rebels and house of lincoln um and they took it all the way to the court of human rights the european court of human rights so it took like five years and eventually at the highest court the ruling sided with them so then they were just vindicated basically and from that they sort of like that's how the rebels were born and so this pfp nft project this fashion project has such a a rich history and a bright future i think because like i'm i'm bullish on metaverse fashion i think maybe we're a little too early for it but 2023 2024 it's going to be huge and the projects that are positioning themselves now are going to be in a great position there um yeah i mean honestly and the art is really fantastic as well it reminds me a little bit of the um the meta angels art really lovely um inclusive yeah and the team i mean i'm a huge fan of the people super sweet uh nft tourist i think she goes by on uh on twitter the taurus that's what it is and uh yeah big fan on in every interaction i've had with her so uh yeah i love highlighting it i mean metaverse fashion it's making me think we didn't talk about talking about this but cult and rain did you end up minting uh i did i saw it thanks to you actually so you mentioned in the alpha chat in uh zen academy that they were i think like they opened up the pre-sale to the discord or something like that because there were some spots left and yeah i mean i thought it was cool i wasn't on the mint list and uh yeah because of that i minced it too and cool i love it yeah i ended up minting one too i have to thank the group chat that i'm in for alerting me to it i like hemmed it hot because you know me i hate spending more than like 0.18 on anything but the quality they're delivering something very concrete that for folks i'll give a little context here which is also metaverse fashion specifically those sneakers this is a brand called and rain i think they're i saw i read an article where they were saying if if um artifact is supreme they're looking to be balenciaga so it's a really i was really sold by the team who have a a deep history in fashion george yang is the lead designer he's designed for a bunch of big fashion houses and so they're they're you know a sneaker metaverse project where you have both a digital sneaker but then anybody who means in their genesis drop will also get the physical sneaker i think it's made in italy like the highest quality um so i went for it the physical comes in this really cool hexagonal display box i think they were saying it's cost the box or the packaging is two hundred dollars and the sneakers i think it's like twelve hundred dollars in terms of the production costs for the sneaker the the packaging and the shipping and yeah so much of the money goes to that so like you you as opposed to most nfts whereas you're getting a jpeg you're getting tangible value you also get the nft and like i'm presuming i'm pretty sure that they've said this like future utility and future drops and stuff like that it it isn't expensive yeah they've partnered with artists too and i think it you know at reveal you'll kind of find out i think which artist you have an association with depending on which piece you have and then that'll allow list you to not use the the other term i i agree like you know for for drops for those artists depending on which level of rarity you have like it's a kind of complicated system um yeah i was like reading the website like really trying to get my head around it but um but yeah they have like pop-up fashion shops they're planning and you get access if you're older so i honestly for me this was a play of like i want more exposure to metaverse the metaverse fashion world i think i'm with you i think it's an interesting space obviously artifact has done just incredibly well have no exposure to artifacts so i was like all right you know i'm willing to take the risk and and sort of follow this and felt like the team was was worthy of uh taking a bet on them so um cool okay not project related but i feel like big news uh i don't know sure we'll call big news right you have like yuga labs getting doxxed oh yeah uh you have larva labs in hot water for the punk's v1 situation and then there was this punk uh 6529 thread that i thought was interesting maybe we we just kind of run through those three we'd love to get your thoughts if you have them we'll start with the the hugo labs situation any thoughts on that yeah i mean we hate buzzfeed they were already seemingly irrelevant now they're just like they got another two minutes in the sun and they'll fade into irrelevancy as web 3 takes over so basically what happened was a a buzzfeed journalist um air quotes there doc's yeah sorry it's podcast doxxed um the one two i think of the co-founders of you labs um docs me like reveal their personal identities which was not public they were like trying to keep their personal information um private which is an acceptable thing in in the nft space in the crypto space um there are real like privacy security concerns if someone knows that you have this much wealth this much influence you know you become a target for kidnapping and all sorts of you know it might sound like wild and out there but there have definitely been instances of people yeah who have whatever bad things have happened and you know if they wanted to remain anonymous or pseudonymous because you know some people knew who they were it should have been up to them to reveal their identities but i in my opinion other people think that anyone involved in such an enormous brand it should be fully doxxed and all that but i think let their actions speak rather than their identities anyway that happened and then the whole labs team revealed themselves over the last few days and now yeah there's pictures circus yeah circulating on twitter with their faces and their identities and i mean aside from the shitty way that it happened it's really nice and lovely to see them i think yeah yeah well i'm embarrassed to say i did not really realize hugo labs wasn't doxxed i think like i like wasn't that wasn't super on my radar you know i tend to not i didn't be hesitant to invest in projects if i don't have a strong sense of the team because the team is so important to me so i tend to be with you which is like speak with your dollars right like if if we decide as a collective community that it's really important that people have skin in the game and have accountability from the standpoint that like they have reputations they could lose which in general i do think is gives me more faith in a project right like if you have your own reputational skin in the game like you're gonna probably fight a little harder for this um you know then then that can play out by what projects we ultimately invest in um and i think that's that's how it people should absolutely be allowed to maintain their anonymity if they so choose with that being said i think this is a perfect example of why intention with things matters because like nobody said anything when beanie was doxed because the intention there felt so clearly to protect the industry and to say hey by doc we're doxing this person in order to show a bunch of other endeavors and schemes he's been involved with that have clearly hurt people or been to the disservice of the community and the intention there felt really like we want to honestly protect the community and and do right by people whereas docs and yugo labs and buzzfeed felt so clearly like trying to get clicks like there was nothing about this other than buzzfeed thinking about buzzfeed's earnings and like hey we'll get a heck of a lot of clicks if we do it and that is such a dishonorable reason to tax a team in my opinion and it felt like this whole like oh these people should be accountable which like you can make that argument but that was just a front for what this was really about which is we're a dying news organization yeah we don't do good work and we're trying to use these people who haven't done anything for the you know for our own gain and so um you know i in general think that intention matters with things and and i feel like this was a clear case of like the reactions were very different because what was trying to be achieved felt so clearly very different um and yeah lava libs larval labs yeah one labs for another yeah well i'll give the quick overview here as far as i i uh understand it which is you basically had an initial round of crypto punks back in the day that had a faulty code in this the smart contract was faulty so they basically scrapped it reissued the punks on new smart contracts and now you have folks who have gone back to those very original v1 buggy crypto punks wrapped them in new smart contracts and started selling them and you had larval labs basically disavow those v1s and say hey no we don't these these aren't real we're going to sell them but two days prior one of the co-founders had already started selling his v1 punks and it seems like people who are upset are upset because they're like they feel like one of the larval labs co-founder kind of front ran the announcement that larval labs would be selling them i don't know that's my understanding of it is that correct what's your take pretty much yeah i mean my understanding was that they said from the beginning that like they didn't really think they were real and that they were going to sell them and then use the money to buy real punks um and then like a couple of days later as the v1 floor it hit like 15 16 eath at one point and punk's floor was like 70 88 so not insignificant then they were like oh we made a mistake oops we shouldn't have sold we're going to dmca them and take them down from openc so they had sold some of their punks and then and you know made some money and then you know bought one cryptid punk said they're going to pay more i think they they sold 210 eats worth of the v1 punks um and then you know this massive secondary market had been alike for a few days people were spending one two three five ten fifteen eight hundred plus eth on the rare ones and then after a few days after having sold some they were like yeah you know what dmca time oh that's a string another in the string of such bad decisions in my opinion in most people's opinion yeah well and they keep like the funny thing here is like they keep stepping in the same controversy this is like just even more dishonorable like the crypto funks thing i understand where the debate can come in there right like this is like less uh sympathetic in my views right right like i understand the debate with funks this i'm like oh come on y'all like you're basically just screwing over a bunch of people who like just want to be a part of punk's like what you know what are you doing um yeah and they sold them first it's just like it's ludicrous to yeah well and i do think that one of the co-founders had actually sold even before made the announcement yeah then they um they they did their piece the thing that was honestly where my head went with this with the co-founder piece in particular with him selling them before laravel's announcement like how can he possibly like how could money even mean anything to this person at this point like literally like yeah i would be floating on an island like i wouldn't even remember i had these things i don't know it just feels so like ludicrous to me in general the idea of like them trying to prop it off anything other than just the you know everything they've already profited off of but it's this consistent issue or persistent issue with larval labs where they're they're not clear really on what punk's rights are and it's not even clear on their website like it's it's really um for such a meaningful project in a space in which ip and ownership is like the backbone of it it's kind of incredible there's not more guidance or more clarity around it and and um what people are allowed to do with it uh okay in i think lighter news i think is where i think the the community as a whole all very excited about this i'm excited about this the punk 6529 fund and his i think it's he is he doxxed i'm assuming thread about uh what's you know his sort of vision and what he's doing uh you want to give the overview for folks no you please i'll give the overview okay i've heard about the thread i did not read the whole thread okay punk six five two nine i'll start here i think in the summer had given a long thread about the metaverse and the importance of an open interoperable metaverse i'm giving a summary here so like you know i read this thread a little while back so if i'm getting pieces of this wrong you can come for me but um the the the gist of it was like we are going to be attacked from all sides right like industry corporate money is going to enter this space in droves and they are very much going to be fighting for a centralized metaverse world and all we have is like our heart and our brains you know it was like kind of sweet and sappy in that way and you're like yeah well um there's a lot of vc's in here too but whatever and so um and and i'm sort of like i'm i want to fight for this like i think this is important i'm going to do everything i can to try and make this happen so fast forward now to this past week uh and it seems like sort of part one of that plan of how i'm gonna fight sort of the big institutions that are coming to centralize this has been put in place and that's this this fund that he's starting up uh to invest in artworks it's got this very long time horizon it's like a 10-year they're going to buy this art they're saying for 10 years um and then he's got interesting ideas around you know ultimately maybe you fractionalize and tokenize the funds to give more people access to that you know really to to to do this in a decentralized way and be really transparent with it all um the notable thing for me or the thing i want to highlight is it's accredited investors only because you're having to kind of deal with u.s security law and this is something that i've thought kind of a lot about and we'll probably continue to think a lot about because while on the surface i think the accreditation laws here in the states and you're not here but would still love your thoughts like are meant to protect quote unquote like unsophisticated investors which functionally just ends up meaning poor people which is right it seems insulting yeah it's like you're unsophisticated but it's really like the measurement is really just how much money do you have it's not like you have to take it to get accredited you don't like take a test showing your financial literacy you have to show you have like seven figures right like it's it's kind of weird so it feels like in practice rather than actually just protecting on sophisticated investors it actually protects rich people and allows them to access to like right the best investments um so i'm hoping that that's a conversation and the conversation around accreditation is something that's that's really kind of split open by the crypto world and the nft space in general um i think it's starting to happen but yeah i don't know long rant there what are your thoughts yeah i mean i've been a huge fan of punk 6529 ever since the the twitter account basically came up out of seemingly nowhere and then within a couple of months just infinite followers and just because they wrote these incredibly detailed in-depth valuable thought-provoking threads like 40 50 60 70 150 tweets in a row about things like um an open metaverse about things like um the sanctity of of you know true ownership and what we own and keeping it very famous for saying don't let the institutions take you take our jpegs steal our jpegs and and now it seems like they're fighting for it in a more real way with a fund that is acquiring pieces with a long-term time horizon um it's exciting and yeah very much going to be wanting to follow it closer over there yeah and i'm excited there it seems like the other pieces to this there's this fund which comes but but they were teasing like education like other parts of this sort of broader plan around you know how do we fight the institutionalization for lack of a better term i guess of this space and um and i think they they were sort of a realist in that i've seen in their threads like they're like the odds are against us right like like ultimately yeah meta and by that like i mean like facebook right like their will power to you know cr to centralize and own this whole thing and their the incentives for them are so high and all it takes is like a little bit of apathy on the part of web 3 for it to go the wrong way and so it's sort of like a constantly needing all of us to like not be apathetic because yeah zuckerberg's not going gonna be apathetic about this um and and i think that i i was reminded of that reading some of their 6529 threads so yeah it really is uh reading their threads is just a constant reminder of of how when we're in the thick of it it seems like oh this is great this is never going to go away it's going to be like perfect forever and you know we have a weird this decentralized utopia but there are a lot of outcomes that are not the future that we're envisioning and so it really is important that we work towards building the future that we're all thinking that we're actually building like we all have this view of the future that's you know decentralized largely you know opportunities are there for everyone the creative economy all around the world and there aren't yeah in reality it could go many wrong ways or poor ways with gated communities and gated decentralization which is not really decentralization yeah okay my last thing parallel drop i think it's still on for the 26th the 27th uh parallel cards they're doing a pack drop i'm super excited about it i'm really hoping i get a pack they just released they're like parallel prime something which is like a long document laying out a whole bunch of more information about the ecosystem um if you're sort of tracking parallel loosely go check it out and and you know if you're checking it closely you probably have already checked it out um but excited about about parallel and uh the upcoming drop and so wanted to put it on others radars as well what's the uh mechanism for getting involved with the drop uh like is it just a raffle or yeah it's it's first come first serve so my understanding is you basically have to be registered on the website beforehand but all you do is you go into the parallel site and like make an account and it's super simple and then uh you'll like log in there at the time of the drop and it's first come first serve and that's crazy good luck which is crazy and you know i i haven't i haven't taken part in one in the past um but i don't know so i don't know what the gas for situation has been like historically but these packs are not that expensive right like you're talking about um like really accessible price points i think and so yeah it almost doesn't matter the gas becomes kind of more negligible because you're not even talking about something that's hundreds of dollars do you have a collection i've done one parallel drop and it was like eight months ago or something wild and yeah it was first come first serve then and even then it was like it sold out in a second so it's crazy to think about how it would happen now i know if i remember correctly it was first come first if you click on it and then you like you have it reserved for 24 hours or something so then you can buy at without the gas war uh that sounds correct there's yes there's a reservation piece so that makes sense and because i was seeing somebody was like giving giving hot tips like reserve less desirable packs to up the odds that you actually get to reserve them not to give all the hot alpha that i'm gonna try and use myself but um you know yeah so yes you are probably absolutely correct that that is how it's going to work yeah but yeah i mean yeah i don't think that mechanism great great project cool you know yeah amazing yeah um excellent okay well i think we will put everyone out of their misery on this one and call it a wrap uh thank you sanika thank you for hopping on last minute i joke but it's always you're always amazing it's always lovely to have you
