know where that idea is coming from because it seems like on my feed you know twitter is never perfect for getting engaged with what's going on but it seems like some 10k pfps are sort of getting a revival i mean crypto punks for one like sure you can talk about the floor but i think it's more just like seeing more people that i know change their pfps to punks i mean one of my co-founders for devotion psyduck he changed to a punk he had been this one of one cool cat before and we were sort of joking and saying like obviously it's not the most important thing but do we want a pfp change as we announce this project and he was like you know i think i should go with a punk and then i saw a bunch of other people changed to punks recently um it's sort of interesting um whenever i shout out a smaller project i'm always like should i do it you better sponsor me if i do but disclosure like i don't work with them but um nft inspect is this thing that lets you see who the holders are for a given community through twitter it's like this chrome extension and you can like click on a board ape and see like the top influencers or top people with the most followers who have a board ambassador profile picture and i think one of the things that always stands out to me is whenever i click like punks and apes uh or doodles or cool cats you know if i change my profile picture to like a cool cat or a doodle all of a sudden i'm like top one or top two or top three for that project and for me it's like weird because i'm not a celebrity i'm not some necessarily famous crypto person but i can just make that my pfp and all of a sudden i'm there at the top which is sort of strange because i hear so much about all these different celebrities big names coming in you see all this volume but are people necessarily turning that into their identity or is it something they hold because they see value in it and i think to me that's the question of whether 10k pfps are alive it depends how you evaluate it is it the number of people holding it is it the volume or is it the number of people really leaning into that digital identity and making it a core part of their you know their experience in web3 and i think we've never necessarily gotten to the latter part i think that's kind of how i feel i don't know if that's a hot take it just seems like the number of people who have really made a punk enter their identity and revolve things around it has never been that high abe seems like a lot but really in terms of raw numbers out of 10 000 it's never really been that high i feel like we talk about digital identity as the first step of 10k pfps and some of us feel like we've moved beyond that i feel like we haven't even really gotten there yet we haven't really even explored what does it mean for a critical mass of holders to be using it using their commercial rights right writing books making movies creating you know new things new art based on that and if that potential is still there i think we haven't actually gotten to see pfps do you think that potential still there like do you think that's still where we end up um i think it's going to take a lot more time for us to get there because at some point it's not just the image it's the whole brand around it it's the in real life activations it's whatever utility air drops are going on it's whatever it means to be a part of this and knowing that there's such a limited supply you talked about this when you had zenica on to talk about doodles right doodles moving onto flow for part of their collection supposedly i'm trying i'm still i'm like i feel like i hear that as a definitive but then i'm like i don't i don't know i've heard jordan say he wants to settle on ethereum and i'm still hoping that they go with a layer too okay so so we don't know but this idea of this pfp is trying to look in terms of not weeks or months i think most people struggle to look beyond days but years and when you think about a few years from now if everything's still here which i i hope it is for for most good projects then i think at that point then we'll really see the potential of pfps become unlocked like pfps take up this tiny real estate on your twitter profile that was never truly designed for nfts i mean twitter has nft integration but it makes your pfp hexagon like great um so i don't really think we've even gotten there to properly evaluate if pfps are dead so we have to see i interviewed eric cauldron snow fro founder of artbox recently i think that episode just came out and we were talking and i was saying i feel like i really understand why artbox is having a tremendous amount of success right now and i would say it's the same reason that i think punks is having a lot of success it's funny because of course punx is a 10k pfp and you could argue obviously kicked off that entire trend but i think of them more as collectible art and i feel like what we're seeing is art doing very well in this time which doesn't surprise me because i understand that analog like i can explain to my parent or my grandparent even like hey generative art is a growing movement it's gonna have more prominence in the broader art scene in x number of years and these are going to be the picassos and the annie warhols or whatever of that movement and so just like fine art today in the irl has a ton of value so too does this i have this open question which i'm curious a few thoughts around if if we even know if if value from like an ether fiat perspective will even be held in these pfps these other maybe the ones that aren't categorized as art even if they fulfill like the wildest potential like if these brands become totally mainstream if doodle's brand becomes wildly mainstream and there's movies and everybody recognizes as powerful ip will these nfts still be worth whatever uh you know fifty thousand dollars or will that be some great success for doodles but but the nft itself still won't won't necessarily hold that crazy value uh it's a really open question um i think for me what's driven so much of the volume in both pfps and art like art art like art blocks has been having a really strong narrative about what the object itself means but then that relationship to the holder i think pfps do a really really good job of saying what that relationship is to the holder but don't always do a good job of showing what it means like for the object itself like what does this thing actually mean so most people doing pfps will say hey if you're a holder you're going to get all these benefits we're going to give you air drops we might give you a token we're going to let you into this party that's for cool kids um we're gonna give you a companion collection you're gonna get more things and more things and more things and i think at some point a lot of people will realize like there has to really be like value behind those things that are given yeah at some point you see the same things being given over and over again and it's like that discussion on land scarcity in the metaverse right it's like there's no reason it has to be confined to so and so pieces right why don't we think more outside the box and i think pfps often run into this issue where they're trying so hard to say hey if you're a holder here's what you'll get and at some point that might become a little bit boring or a little bit played out um you know there was a time even last year when airdrops were kind of a new thing and people are really excited about it but then once that becomes the norm you have to raise expectations and do something even better i mean my co-founder psyduck says this he kind of has drawn out this like 10k pfp death spiral on twitter where it's basically like because the uh because the goalposts have changed when like a year ago you could announce hey we're doing an air drop everybody would go crazy you could even say hmm we might have some alpha for you and then you would just see the floor fly it was like the easiest thing to trade into you all knew it it was like this very obvious thing but once you get to this point now where we are pretty much in a bear market if you have an announcement that you think is going to move things and it doesn't it's horrible because it's almost like dealing with like you know if you like like a certain drug or a certain food like i love mcdonald's when i haven't had it in a long time but when i have mcdonald's two days in a row i feel absolutely sick so i have to step it up with like more i need to get like larger fries i can't just get diet coke i need to get like um a mcflurry and then i just have to keep on like leveling up mcdonald's exactly for me to feel something and you know at some point when you're running this utility you have no more to give because it takes time it takes money it takes creativity it takes that spark it takes the right time and place and you know going back to the idea with art being that object in and of itself that can say why it's valuable um i think that to me maybe explains in part why our blocks is sort of having a run right now it's not easier but it's almost more interesting and you can be in your own lane when you're saying why your thing is kind of valuable in and of itself right i mean i know uh snow fro he talks a lot about how with art blocks they have to be generated like on the spot at the point of minting and that's interesting because you could otherwise generate like a trillion things and pick the thousand best ones but now you have to make sure that all a thousand look really good um tyler hobbs when he talks about fidenza and his work he always says you know it's not just about the code it's about systematic thinking that goes behind the code how do i get my inputs really good so that the outputs are awesome and when i see that it's so much easier for me to fall in love with that narrative and know that that narrative can still be relevant years and years from now compared to pfps knowing that people are fighting this death spiral and you may burn out at some point because art can speak for itself and you can speak for it uh with pfps a lot of people are speaking on it and telling you what it is uh and that can be tough so the latest meta feels like it is like free mint plus cco plus maybe a little sprinkle of trolling and i think goblin town obviously really kicked that off but we've seen it with projects like wizards which i i is interesting i don't know if you have thoughts on on wizards as a project or i've been tracking that um but there's been others i think nf god hates nfts the project that came out of the fake protest that happened at nftnyc is an example there's there's a number of them uh and it it has that cco freeman combination which i'm curious to get your perspective on that but i also think there's like almost an immersive storytelling element that you're starting to see come in with some of these that i think are doing it better like goblin town or wizards so what do you think of this this current era we're in and this uh this current version of how to launch an nft project yeah you know i like that you brought up meta because i think a lot of us only talk about the macro right now and macro is important right anything from interest rates to war right and then thinking about like what happened to celsius and three errors capital but i think to me meta is just as important because they're very related to one another right part of what makes a meta a meta is not just because the macro allows for it to happen right like it makes sense in a way for there to be free mints or cheaper mints at a time when people want to hold on to their liquidity as much as they can but it's also that meta can sort of move beyond because it gives you the opportunity to sort of innovate out of it and do something that's really interesting that catches people's attention and of course there will be copycats people who try to ride those coattails but there are there are also going to be like pretty insightful things that come out of it um i like to think of it as like a constraint right in the spare market you can't sell out pixelmon for 70 million anymore thank god see right you have to think of different ways around it to me like there is this like you said this performance art to things like goblins and to me it makes me think about i think the closest comparison would be like reality tv in the 80s so reality tv got big in a way because i think it was under reagan right you like something with like all the like networks you kind of like made it a lot more free market for people to be creating content and so production cost skyrocketed essentially so then all of a sudden you couldn't have the money to pay for all these shows so you went for reality tv it kind of came out of that era because reality tv is cheap in some ways right you can just film it with a camera you can follow someone around right this sort of very indie you know in the moment on the ground type of film beyond that you don't have to pay the actors very much right the actors are kind of like happy to be there and i make that comparison because goblin town was sort of like that it was like let's make a free mint and let you take it and make the memes out of it we will make it possible to meme like we're gonna use our own language we're gonna be silly we're gonna make the art right like ugly but on purpose and from all these things we're going to make you do the heavy lifting for us and to me that's interesting are there projects you've been eyeing and or buying during this period you know funny enough i haven't really minted much in the last two months outside of buying my friend's work um sometimes i fall into this trap or i know my friend is having trouble selling work so i'm like yeah we're like getting drinks yeah i'll buy your art like promise and i'll like dab them up and then i'll like think yeah it'll probably be like point two or point three and then i go on openc and it's listed for like two eth oh my god well i said i was gonna buy it now i have to buy it um but i but i think it's been more fun because it can be very stressful to follow everything that's minting in every project um i think part of why nfts can be so stressful because people were stressed out a lot in the bull market even when they're making money because you have to make so many decisions every day like it really ends up being like hundreds if not thousands if you think about it this floor is going up do i sell or do i hold those are both decisions right do i see this long term or short term do i tweet about this do i tweet about that should i look at other projects right should i sell some should i hold others right you're like always thinking about the infinite regret that's the zenica line it's like it's infinite regret when you have that many decisions to make you can't time the market you're going to sell it'll go up another east or you buy and it goes down and you just are living in a constant state of feeling like you regret a decision you made it's like every decision you make at least see you feeling like two ways because more things will happen in that timeline it's almost like it's like the multiverse where like you can go to another dimension and like kill your parents but then you wouldn't be not born because you killed them in a different dimension so like you're okay in your dimension but it's like this tree right it just like keeps getting bigger you've broken my brain on this one i need to watch more rick and morty i think i was i was watching a video essay explaining all the different kinds of time travel and multiverse is actually the simplest one i can't wrap my head around the simple one that's that's definitely no the simple one basically what i'm trying to say is like i'm trying to like cut down on all these parallel universes where i'm asking myself what i could have done yeah i want to reduce the number of decisions i make to things like when i wake up am i going to create something cool today am i going to talk to a friend call my parents you know on board somebody am i going to buy my friend's artwork when i think she's like really talented but hasn't done the marketing right and i really want to support her i think cutting down on those decisions ultimately make me both someone who i think is appealing to a lot of people in the space because i'm kind of like that catharsis for them and i can also see myself as being disliked for that reason because i'm in a place where i'm not necessarily making people money because the decisions that i'm making when they're like a dozen decisions a day are probably not the decisions that you could make or would be making were you ever good at like or are you good at flipping like were you good at making money on the quick flip game no not at all anyone i think maybe that was a myth i think nobody was gonna there are a very small number of people who got in at a specific time who made money i think like you know i don't think i'm a good flipper and that's okay i actually think that plays in my strengths because maybe this makes me like a kind of like bad person but i i get envious and i get jealous when i see really good projects because i'm like not that i want them to fail but i'm like you're amazing like you're so cool to think of this great idea i felt that when i saw goblin town i felt that the first time i saw cool cats when i knew barely anything about nfts my first thought is like i want to be like you i want to figure out how to think the way you do learn from you so that one day if i'm doing something or if i'm teaching something or if i'm discussing something you'll have helped me in some way like i can't see myself like trading everything because it feels like in some ways like i'm putting myself in that zone where like i'm driving volume for a collection but i'm just getting money out of it i think there's so many more things besides money to get out of it to me like i think it is easy to get rich when you are the person you're meant to be you're being your best self you're doing really cool things and you've met really cool people once you set those things up you know it seems like it would be easy so i guess it's a roundabout way to say i much prefer to invest in myself then invest in others unless they're really really really great or if they're really funny and i want to have some fun and buy a meme project i am going to ask you a very personal question and maybe that can bridge us into some of your story how do you make money you know i think i i had probably a couple good trades like a year ago and i've sort of been writing that i mean for me like i think i'm just coming out of college like since a couple years ago i'm very much good with just hanging out in my apartment ordering some food cooking a little bit doing the simple things um i think i've been writing that for a little bit you know i am with uta now and i think they've been trying to solve that same issue it's like how do we make this kid money how do we make sure he survives so that he stays in the space and keeps doing his thing you know i think it's a misconception like i don't take money for spaces um so i don't make money from that i think to me those network effects and that reputation in the community is worth something later on um you know i i do different things like for the longest time i was tutoring kids and helping them with writing it's actually fairly lucrative and that at times has also carried me so you know side hustles little things um get one good trade write it out for like four or five months and i feel like more people than you'd think probably do that at least maybe i've found those people well i think there's this perception that if you have hundreds of thousands of followers and you're in the crypto space like you must be rich and there's plenty of people who i i think probably are or or were before the market crashed you know but that's that's not always the case and it's funny we'll cut this out if this feels like inappropriate to share but i i happen to know you're a very honorable person i don't think that it's necessarily wrong to take money for spaces so long as you really believed in the project as well i mean i i have sponsors in this podcast i don't feel guilty about that right but um but i know you don't take money for spaces and i also know that uta has put a lot of potential deals in front of you that you have turned down and turned down the opportunity to make a lot of money because it didn't feel right so that was sort of why i'm curious like what uh yeah what your situation was so you mentioned earlier you were like i don't you don't think of yourself as a celebrity or a you know whatever but you're you've a certain amount of fame certainly within our industry and again have hundreds of thousands of followers how did that happen like take me to like when was the moment when you started with their moment you started to get like tens of thousands of followers and your name was known was it cool cats what was the impetus for all of us hmm i think i'm really around the one year anniversary mark still of really going all in on nfts um i think about a year ago nba summer league is either just ended or is still going on it might have just ended that was like a big watershed moment for me because i just had a few thousand followers then and top shot was still big at the time and i had heard about how dapper labs was sending these like influencers or whatever to check out top shot in vegas and i was like well i'm not a top shot influencer i just have a few thousand followers but i was like well look in ether terms it's like an eighth and i can go for the whole week do some fun things document to people like what i'm up to and it's one eighth so i was like should i send it and everybody's like yeah send it it's an eve so i sent it i went to vegas had the time of my life i did things like um remember i was in my uber ride to the stadium to watch summer league and basically the driver was like you know like what are you doing are you here for the basketball stuff and i was like yeah i'm also here for the nft stuff he's like what's nft's i told him about it he's like listen you take my number i want to join you at the stadium i'm going to leave my taxi in the yard and i'm going to come see you and i posted this picture of us hanging out and like i like onboarded him to nfts he was like smiling this like taxi driver and people seem to like that it was not me trying to create something for content you know there's this joke of like going around for homeless people and saying like hey like i'm recording you with flash like here's this water bottle and and for me it was more just like i was doing all the things that just feel natural to me if i like something i tell people about it but i started documenting that for the first time in my life it was almost like like vlogging is and people seem to like that um i wasn't posting my trades all the time i wasn't saying i made this much money or i think this is the next big project i was sort of just living life and i think a lot of people at the beginning were following me for personality i think soon after that you got it you kind of got into the bull market and i'm sure people followed me because they thought i could make the money but and i i'm sorry like if i let you guys down um i'm sure you made some people money yeah but it was just like thinking like i've always been a shy and anxious person but i've seen myself as somebody who can shine in the right moment if i'm on stage or if i have to make a speech or if i have to do something big like i pick my moments i'm not someone who's good at being on all the time but it seemed like people wanted me to be and i kind of explored that that's come with its benefits and challenges right being like on and being a personality as much as i can but the saving grace has been that i don't have to try to be somebody i'm not just trying to be myself as much as possible and hopefully hopefully that reaches people i think the authenticity thing is just it is the most critical piece that you can have if you want to have a long career you know like you can be really inauthentic and get a tremendous following in the short term but i don't think you can sustain a career that way so it was about a year ago so you started on top shot that that was sort of your initial foray in all of this yeah i would say like i bought my first pack in january got a person i didn't like and then i quit for like four months and at that point you were recently out of columbia journalism so i didn't drop out until um later at the end of that or in the fall so i was starting journalism school and why i was doing that was because i felt like i wasn't doing things right as a journalist i was not making any money um i was you know destroying myself to write what i thought were good articles just to make a couple hundred dollars um you know like alpha like i'm chinese and like and this was a time when on on the news there are a lot of news reports of like you know asian like elderly people generally speaking like being attacked in urban places like in you know new york where i live and to me that was unsettling because i grew up in houston texas and he had a pretty good like suburban upbringing but it's really interesting um my parents my mom and dad would like bring my family over from china and like put them up in places because they were lifting everybody in my extended family out of poverty um really like respect them for that and so they had put my great uncle up in a place near us maybe like not as great a part of town but you know giving him a place and helping him get his feet on the ground uh you know he's a real blue-collar guy worked as a repairman and yeah basically like he was he was murdered when i was young and what we think uh was a hate crime uh given the information that we have and so for me that that kind of cut deep seeing what was happening how old were you when that happened um i was about like nine years old and so seeing what was going on again i was like oh i need to write about this because it's important it's last year when you had when there was the stop patient hate movement yeah because of all the murders yes and so i wrote about this and i said this is the most important piece i will ever write because it's not my take on politics it's not a meme article which i've done for money in the past it was like a real serious thing that cut deep and you know i wrote an article talking about how you know i've been through it but i want us to come together like i said before the show i'm not always a guy with a lot of hot takes i'm like the guy trying to spread peace and positivity because it's maybe just how i'm wired or how i was raised and so i wrote it i think i wrote it well it was a hard piece to write and when i put it out there i could go to the kiosk outside my apartment and read it but online the comments were just vicious like nobody cared people even joked about him which was really horrible to me and that's just for the washington post this was for the washington post right it's a really good reputable organization you know relative to i think everything in the field and i was just like whoa like am i stupid or did i choose the wrong industry or is the industry just broken or are the people that they serve broken and this kind of all of the above maybe above right and kind of like sent me into this spiral and i think the worst thing was you know i always get my hair cut i get it faded like really nicely yeah and i have reasons i can get into that later but um yeah like three weeks later i was on my way to my barber alex and on my way there i just got a notification that i had 300 deposited into my account and i kind of just broke down on the street crying it was 300 for the article that's what you've been paid yeah and it was just this thing of like i went through so much and it's not about the money when you do something like that it never is about the money but the money was almost like an fu because that's how it felt to me at the time and i was like wow like i either have to go to school or i'm never going to do this again so i decided i was just going to go to school but i was obviously spiraling going to a dark place things got worse when i was playing pickup basketball at the gym [Music] in in midtown uh it's a cool gym like lebron plays there harden plays there it's like a really fancy gym but i went there and maybe it was the universe telling me that i could never be like them because one of the first times i played i got hit in the head really really badly and i had this concussion that went on for over a month and so you can think of all these things compounding trying to do the thing i thought i was meant to do which was right can't do that trying to play basketball which i like can't do that i'm stuck in bed every day can't run can't eat well can't get exercise i have this blanket over my head um that i cut a hole in so i could kind of like watch the nba playoffs through the little slit in the blanket why do you have a blanket on your head because the light sensitivity when you have a concussion like light is just like it's like you're a vampire like when you see it like it actually like burns like oh it burns and so i was watching these games and throughout that time i discovered top shot i was like wait well we should say rediscovered because i kind of like thought about that thing so what month are we in now you bought it in january didn't get a clear you like to quit and now we're in and then we're in like may okay and i'm really starting to dive deep into it again i'm trying to learn a little bit about nfts but this was still like the ramp i feel like i really really got in on technically july 2nd 2021 which was the second day cool cats was released but because i stayed all night trying to put a deal together for the rarest cool cat i consider it still the first day because i didn't sleep until i bought it at 8 a.m then i had the best sleep of my life so my true true genesis it feels like july 2nd well i really want to talk about the cool cat thing because that's when i first i feel like got to know who you were but do you feel like your experience in the journalist industry and i'm really curious like had you just randomly submitted your piece to the washington post and they accepted it or how would that come together because i i've had a piece published in the washington post and i didn't get any money oh there you guys where my channel go i got infinitely more than you i'm curious about how that happens yeah washington post yeah well where's my check we're gonna find washington post yeah especially if they do i'd have teachers oh i will someday give my true thoughts on media i've already given some of them i will flood it any day anyway but so how would that come together and then and then i have a question about that that gets us to nfts yeah a lot of news publications have rules that if you're pitching an article to their submission box do not send it to other places for me i'm like that's yes right like when there's such a low hit rate anyways i don't care i'm gonna send it to a hundred places and if two say yes we'll figure it out from there but i'm not going to send it to one place wait weeks not get a response i was so nervous about that when i submitted my thing places i was i was like oh my god i don't think i think i followed the rule because i was an idiot being like oh i don't want to get like de-qualified unqualified but so was that had you pitched the concept for the story you would submit it the story and then it got accepted so i sent it to a bunch of places um you have to kind of change up the page a little bit or no this was a pitch to like write the article for them i think for the washington post they wanted a full draft okay and that's interesting too the idea of like doing all this work for it to maybe not get published yeah i think i have so many like i have this like file that i have this like file on my computer that's just like all the stuff i never got to put out um but i had already done the work for and i was telling my girlfriend at the time um i was like they're not gonna respond to me it's the general submissions portal and then they're actually the only ones who got back and wanted it so it was a nice little surprise but um it was a cool cool moment that didn't last that long do you know what their monetization structure is like were you given an explanation for why it was 300 um it was more like a surprise like we're also paying you type of thing wapo where the heck is my money i was happy at the time when they first told me i was like well this is important to me um if i'm getting paid like a dollar is better than zero dollars yeah but then later on i realized that 300 was like even more of a nephew in some ways uh i don't know why did you later you realize it was even well it's like thinking about like how many people it reaches but then i think it also goes to the idea that like look i can see it i don't think like news publication models are necessarily that lucrative yeah right you're subscribing right to like get news in the mail or to get it digitally and i think a lot of industries thought when they were going digital because they were like hey more people are on their computers tablets phones this is going to be a big revolution well it's still super annoying right you're getting you're getting like badgered every month to like keep going with the subscription or like have you considered this other thing and it's kind of just like all right i pay this with my credit card every month yeah um nfts are totally different for obvious reasons like having a piece of the pie getting air drops getting utility having some sort of like real recognition for your loyalty things like that and having that all recorded on the blockchain i think not saying news outlets should do that necessarily um i think time has explored it but i just think they don't make a lot of money so part of me understands that but it's also the value of the work relative to what you're paid for well it's a very labor-intensive industry right media companies are not not working on big margins because every new output required heavy labor it's not like software where you can let it run on autopilot at a certain point so i understand that and also it's an area where market dynamics are broken as in a number of other places right because they can get content for free easily because the cachet of the washington post means that there are tons of people waiting in line to get something printed there and would do it for free simply to have the cachet of being able to say you're published there so this leads me to how much of your initial attraction to nfts or when you're looking at cool cats for example right after all this goes down is a recognition of the potential to fix this broken model and the ownership and the royalties and the getting creators paid and how much it was purely oh this is cool and then the understanding of all of that came later i'm gonna be honest i think it was almost a kind of selfish motivation of wanting to be like this doesn't work for me like after that i'm gonna go do something else and that's why by the time i started journalism school in the fall which i'd applied two months prior i was already kind of half checked out i was in classes like trying to secretly like use my phone to look up nfts when in college i was that one kid who never was on their phone even if i was in like a big lecture hall no way you were right i was that person you know like when you're in a class and there are people not paying attention and you like stare at the teacher yeah to make them feel like you're really paying attention so like balances out somehow okay i did that too though more i was definitely a kid who would also be my phone but i would feel bad when it became so abundantly clear that like the class had the teacher sort of lost the class and nobody was paying attention i would feel bad for the teacher so that was an empathy play for me not because i actually was a studious as it sounds like you were but yeah but you know for me why i say cool cats was my real like day one is because it was almost a selfish motivation to want to do what i saw klon the artist of cool cats doing um so again it wasn't necessarily like oh we're going to broadly change all these systems initially i'm sure that's part of the big part of the appeal now it was like these are cool cats it's like is that was it like the collectible piece what was the underlying thing that made you say i'm already checked out it was a nerd i'm an nft it was a narrative and i think to me that was what made cool cats so special to me on day one and that would be my question for it now like is it still able to deliver on that narrative and that promise um you know just to share that real quick it was me coming from a place where i just felt really bad almost humiliated by the work that i was doing and i jumped into this discord channel called origins for cool cats where klon the artist talked about trying to freelance for years and years falling in love with this thing he had been sketching it in classes like on the margins doodling it and you see it kind of takes shape over months and then years and then a decade um and you see like every year he has like a little post for it he's like here's what i did this year here's a little fun thing that happened here's when i was in this little shack selling my work for 15 and it rained but it was kind of fun and then you see him like he obviously gets older during this time and at a certain point i think it was 2017 he basically got into an argument with his family and i was like this is stupid why am i doing this i'm not making any money the people who follow my instagram page are like they have like a fetish for cats it's like it's like i'm not drawing cats for you i'm drawing cats because they're cute they're adorable not because i want cat fetishes so you know all like both the funny and the serious things basically let them to think all right i need to move on from this and then you see him go darkness being the agency work and and sort of creative work and include also including his side work like he was he wasn't doing his side passion work anymore because he was right he had given up on it yeah and he talks about having this aha moment a few months prior to launching cool cats where he's like wait i could bring this back as an nft and he looks at this collage on his wall of all these different cats right with like different hats different faces and he's like wait this works for nfts so i'm going to give myself this second chance by doing nfts and i hope you'll be on this journey with me for me i saw that and i was just enchanted by it because to me i needed a second chance right to this day like i think some of the best people are people who really really failed the first time but decided to pick themselves back up and say i am giving myself a second chance even if it doesn't make sense even if i'm not perfectly inspired even if it means i have to do the things i hate as if i love them i'm going to get myself up and try something again i was like really down in the dumps when i saw cool cats um but it was like forty dollars and for me to buy the rare school cat it was ten thousand dollars which was to me like humongous at the time and maybe in the bear market it's trying to become big again whereas in the bull market i was like take 100k here 100k there like take all my money 30 e fight come on but um i wanted to do what he was doing i couldn't look myself in the mirror and say that if this dude drawing cartoon cats is doing this writing his own story that i'm going to sit here and wallow and not do my thing so is the upside down cat the most expensive one it is the most expensive one um to me you can debate me on this my co-founder psyduck has another one of the one-of-ones i will come out and say my cool cat is rare than all of your cool cats and the reason and the reason i'll give a good reason for it okay not because i own it but because it's not just the upside down cat it is the naked cat and the naked cat means that it is the cat that klon has drawn all those years because you're drawing the one of one over and over and over thousands of times again it's always naked you might throw a hat on every once in a while you might make it look like mega man or shrek another time but at the end of the day you have this naked blue cat um and that's what the upside down cool cat was it was it is the only shirtless cat in the collection i mean maybe it has pants but we'll never know it's like schrodinger's pants yeah yeah but um but you know for me seeing that like that's the true ip it's the ip that starts before nfts when klon was a kid and feels good owning that how many cats did you buy at the time you bought the most expensive and then i bought the most expensive then i bought a few more and then once i went to journalism school and i couldn't bear to be in that classroom i dropped out got the tuition refund and swept the floor of cats so it was just accumulating lots of cats i i never got to like that whale status but it felt meaningful of where that money was coming from and how i was writing my narrative with it this goes back to investing in myself people wanted to know what's andrew's story this kid who dropped out of school and is now buying these different nfts and trying to make a living out of it i think people almost had a kind of like voyeuristic curiosity like do i want this kid to fail do i want him to succeed can he surprise me what's he going to do what do you think of cool cats right now do you advise them at all or you know in canada and i said this to you before we started like it has been this funny thing to me where it felt like cool cats was the biggest thing for a little while and that they had the time you know partnership which i think you were involved in and and and again i i saw you from afar talking about them and being a part of them and then it felt like they just kind of quietly became not relevant almost and there wasn't some tremendous fall from grace i mean i know there were delays to the game and this and that but they just feel like kind of quietly to the side and that surprised me what is your take um i think memory again is very short term in the space part of what made cool cats really exciting at the beginning was that that was on everybody's minds and when something's on your mind you can dig deep and really not only find things about the project but write narratives around that project so in terms of finding things you know i remember one time i saw this cool cat and it had these stripes on it and i was like clown like what is this like is this hobbs from calvin and hobbes and he was like dude it is like bill watterson is like my biggest inspiration for like being an artist and like you know i love what he did with calvin hobbes and like the same way that like hobbs is calvin's companion the cool cat is like my companion and when he put that out there you could not buy a tiger cat it went up to like a billion dollars right or people started memeing with the frog cats and the frog cats were all listed at 69 eat um things like that that kind of organic like diving into things writing those narratives about what cool cats could be about what it is you get that when you have people's attention for a long time i think it's also part of the reason why there's that whole like sport apes racist thing going on right it's because partly i think because board apes have been in the spotlight for so long people will just dig and write their own narratives and sometimes there might be a degree of truth hood to any kind of narrative you write but it is also really just your thing so i'm not giving my opinion on that whole fiasco controversy but i'm saying that that is a result of people spending a lot of time with what is otherwise an image and its airdrops and its utility there's all that speculation there's that narrative writing and i think what hurt cool cats a lot this is my opinion like i hope i'm not like crucified for this think the game heard cool cats a lot because when you had the game come out fewer people were thinking about klon's story which is so so special it's so precious it's so rare because you can't be some anon rugger who like hires a fiber artist to make that art you have the proof that he had done that for a decade and you have brought it into nfts in a smart way i think that plot was lost and fewer people were writing out what that narrative meant um i think that's probably where like i appreciate not my journalism background but having wanted to be a writer for so long because it involves trying to flesh out these narratives and say why something is important and i think when you had the game people were evaluating cool cats based on what the game delivered what the utility was what was the value of milk what were these coins doing right what does feeding the pet do how much work do i have to put in is it worth it how are the tokenomics is the rarity of cats relative their to their price reflective of the tokens gained from it and once you got into that narrative it is hard to climb out so i hope that they do um it's a challenge for everybody right now but i think especially for cool cats to not only get back to that narrative of the art and the story but to kind of reinvent yourself at this time never easy but if you can give yourself a second chance you should be able to give yourself a third chance yeah i say this all the time this this is a space at least historically that rewards ambiguity and punishes specificity we like to be able to fill in gaps about what the bright future going gonna look like without really knowing and then once somebody presents something really clear like hey here's a game we tend to penalize that to your point because then you can very clearly evaluate oh is this amount of money worth this particular thing and board apes has seemed to avoid that but you know their approach has been different they've had these obviously quite different approaches um okay let's get into what is next for you i'm really excited and i'm already hearing the seeds things we're talking about here i i think are really gonna those threads are gonna going to be tied into a bow in some extent in this next phase before we do that we gotta hear once again from our lovely lovely sponsors immutable x is the layer two

crypto all right so you announced devotion which is the next phase in your web 3 career what is it you know i think a lot of people might say we haven't announced everything yet so i can't talk about much to me i feel like things like the mint date pricing who we're working with what exactly we're doing that's really only like 10 of the puzzle i think 90 is the concept and why why now what does this mean and for me i feel like i can talk about just about all of that i think on a personal level it's me wanting to come out as an artist i'm trying to say hey when you're an nft is long enough and not only do you learn about the technology and what smart contracts can do what royalties mean right but you spend time in communities so you know what it's like to cultivate a strong community because you've been cultivated by strong ones to being around so many artists right to a point where you're not just consuming their work visually you are talking with them they're your friends you're seeing them at events you're discussing art and blockchain and use cases with them you are investing in their work and when you invest in somebody's work like that it's almost like a different feeling at least for me i'm not somebody who buys something and then just holds it right i will buy it and then i'll like dig into it i'll find out as much as i can about it i will look at every pixel i will look at every other piece in the collection because there is something to be learned or inspired or made to think by these artists work and for me i was like all right i've been in like this hyperbolic time chamber for a year where every day i'm spending like 14 15 16 hours getting hit by all these molecules right i've been building up all this energy what am i going to do with it am i going to use it to trade well it helps certainly when you understand an artist's work you understand the space you understand community but for me i was almost like i'm better served trying to make art myself because i've always wanted to and i've learned so much from people um in this past year i think a lot about this bukowski quote where he basically says you know it is preferable to do a dull thing with style than a dangerous thing without um and if you're able to do a dangerous thing with style that's what i call art and to me all of crypto is dangerous all of nfts is dangerous right we've seen these wild swings things go up and down things moon things plummet one mistake can kill a project it is always dangerous but it is often dull as well and oftentimes not everything is done with style i would say i think we need a bit more of that i think when you're trading a lot of times you are doing a dangerous thing but when you are following your alpha group and what you're told or you're just getting some sort of inside information or alpha there's no real style to that for me i think style with trading is like buying the art blocks bottom like that's stylish because you are making a statement when our blogs loses like so much volume right we say like when something like moon's harder it crashes harder like that style but i think trading on most things in the space there's not much style involved and to me you know i wanted to bring a little bit more of that fun that spice take all the things i've learned from the people that i've learned from and to show you something that looks really different and is art that raises the bar of the space ideally right like i love devs because they're so cool when they write a different contract right when they reduce gas costs and then it becomes a standard yeah like i want to put something out for everybody to use and i think oftentimes you know art can do that art can be the best medium to do that to do something that nobody's done before you know how abstract art everybody's like i could do that i could draw a line on this canvas right i could be jackson yeah i could be rothko like jackson look at this like i'm jackson pollock but it's always a question of like well one there's probably more going on there but two and very importantly then why didn't you do this right and i want to show people i'm not going to ask myself that question and not do it i love that now here's my specific question okay so is devotion a platform a gallery a series of artworks made by you a series of artworks made by you and others i think the vague response to that is devotion is not a gallery is not a studio devotion is almost like a church a lot of times um i think we compare crypto to a kind of religion and i'm not a religious person but i'm very fascinated by it and i think web 3 very specifically more than anything is about learning to organize people in different ways whether you're incentivizing them with tokens whether you're building out a dow right whether you are giving people airdrops if they're holders whether you're building in game theory like you should burn this to get this or you should spend time on twitter um you should build up your following because it's important for these reasons or you know here's how as a community we decide this is a rug versus this is a field project it's all about organizing people in different ways and for me i've been wanting like a more intimate experience which i think these small physical places of worship have always been able to do which is bring people in and really speak to them i think that's where the religious part really ends for me because you know i don't want to go too deep into that but i think the more specific answer is that i'm going to be making art with my co-founders backseats and psyduck it's a really great team psyduck has a really really great design background he's known as like this whale cool cats traitor right that's how people in the cool cats community know him but i found out that he's this crazy designer and he knows business really really well and it's almost like his second phase the more specific answer about what devotion is is it's a place to experiment it's a place to go into both of my co-founder and i's minds to say like what are they thinking about what excites them about web3 and nfts is it artists doing new things right is it the technology like we can upgrade it in some way we can improve a smart contract in some way backseats is often like he writes in our our group chat i invented something and when you hear that you just get excited yeah right we've been in web 3 so long this guy wakes up and calls you and says andrew i've invented something like that's what i want to be doing and it's this idea of like we're all coming out as artists in our own way because there's so many ways to get into art from a web 3 perspective i can't paint like my hands tremor a little bit when i when i raise them i've always thought like oh i can't be a painter because my hand shakes and it looks stupid um there are so many ways to create art in the space i mean thinking of artists who work with ai for example i think their work is super super awesome and with dally giving commercial rights to people as of today i think that'll be super exciting to see where that goes but for me it's us three coming out as artists and knowing that we can do dangerous things with style and i would say another specific answer is there are artists that i want to work with and there are artists who i think we can experiment with and do really fun things with and i think it's a way to make the space more delightful for somebody would to wake up and not expect what they saw yesterday because we're doing something new we've innovated something small or innovated something big and when you see that happen and you know it's done in an intimate setting where we sort of deliver that and deliver it in an epic sonic way where you know that over time it's like here's episode one and then here's episode two and each one is meant to delight to possibly cause controversy to make you think all of that i think is doing justice to my experience in the space which is having felt differently because of someone or something i want to ask about this episodic piece what does it mean in this context when i think of episodes i think of television right and so there's a full narrative and then i tune in next week to see the continuation of that narrative based on what i've heard you say about this so far it sounds like there may be that narrative storytelling piece there will be a thread that binds drop to drop it obviously i don't think is like full television show style it's going to be a little bit maybe more abstract but i've also heard you mention the erc998 standard which i'm not entirely familiar with but i'll do with composability so it sounds like there may also be some sort of interactive component for audience members to i'm fishing here for uh reactions on your face how warm or cold am i to what you all are thinking about well i think it's like when you introduce a tv show to a friend and they're like do i have to watch an order and the answer is like who asks you do i have to oh like do i start from the newest one like oh yeah black mirror right like you don't have to watch it you don't have to watch the office in order but if you do like you will get something okay out of that order yes um or a black mirror you'll be like no you can just watch whatever it's literally an anthology yes um or love death and robots do i need to watch an order no but there might be a reason why they put it in that order to give you a certain feeling at a certain time okay i think without saying too much i think we're sort of of that latter perspective where these episodes will be delightful and fascinating on their own and they will all do something new and will never do what we did once again but if you could only get exposure to you know just that one episode it should be able to affect you in some way it's not just like this leads to this leads to this leads to that but it's also not just you know jumping around and i think without saying too too much i think it gets to this idea of there's so many expectations in the space and oftentimes they turn into obligations when they shouldn't right i think that's why i feel so attracted to art when art blocks comes out you don't expect them to say hey if you're holding a fedenza right like you necessarily get another thing like maybe in some cases the artist can say that but when you meant art blocks like you get this feeling of like i'm getting this thing and it's art and it's part of our blocks which stands for this vision and does things a certain way like i talked about with snow fro but it is a piece in and of itself and i think for me i always want to eliminate that kind of infinite obligation it is both a blessing and a curse i want to be dedicated devoted even to something without running around and scrambling just to give people what they want oftentimes people don't know what they want i think giving people like what they didn't know they wanted is better than giving what people want like right off the bat it's the forward line of if i'd asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses and then he gave them cars like i'm a big guardians of the galaxy fan but everybody wants dancing in the moonlight by top loader and james gunn is like i'm literally getting like threats about putting in dancing in the moonlight and for some people listeners out there you know that that's one of my favorite songs but i understand where he's coming from because it is too obvious for guardians of the galaxy and there are more songs to show and more scenes to create based off of that you know that soundtrack um but i i think if there is any alpha to give i think i would look at who andrew was really fascinated by who does he love and i don't want to say anything about like i'm working with this person necessarily but i can rattle off the top of my head who has taught me things in the space just do that right now right tyler hobbs has taught me how to think systematically even if i don't know how to program all seeing seneca who drew the board apes has taught me that right like you should give yourself a second chance right even if you're known for one thing you can be known for another um klon taught me that as well uh drifter shoots i've climbed with him i saw that photo did you go up and climb somewhere really high and get your picture feet picture taken oh yeah where where i risked it all where were you um was this like a free climb or do you get like hooked in this it is always a free climb this is making me so clammy i really hope you watch this episode because she doesn't know that i did that um yeah i i climbed with drift and a dear friend of ours um toby lasso but uh i don't want to introduce interrupt keep telling keep listing the people who are impactful to you but i didn't i wanted to ask you about that drifter shoots thing i want to go back oh my god i want to go back to it i mean after after drift you know drift taught me a lot about freedom right and what it means for the the body to not be free but the mind to be always free um you know tom sacks uh tom sachs is special to me because i mentioned my uncle earlier in the episode tom sacks worked the same jobs as my uncle and part of my greatest regret with my uncle was i resented that he was a blue-collar guy when we were these kids in the suburbs trying to you know look like all the white families try to you know live the american dream and here was a guy who didn't look like it at all who didn't speak a lick of english meeting tom sachs who worked all the same jobs as my uncle but became one of the greatest artists ever and being able to like cry out all my tears right on his gray sweatshirt telling him about my uncle knowing that they're in some ways cut from the same cloth to see in some ways an example of what my uncle could have been had he live longer had he had a different revelation about his life and what he wanted to do tom sax's revelation is when he worked as a janitor and he worked a literally shitty job as he says and he was like a ninja because he did his janitor job better than every other janitor who worked there and he said it was because it was a job that breeds a lot of resentment and he said one day he he looked in the toilet and he told himself i can either resent this toilet or i can make it shine and when he decided to make it shine that's when he became an artist that's when nothing could stop him and that's when he became destined to be one of the greatest artists ever seeing that story in tom and being able to imagine it in my uncle and then myself saying like it doesn't matter where you come from it matters what you learn from it and what's important is to get over whatever resentment you've had you know to be the person you're meant to be once that seed is planted into your head there is nobody and nothing that can stop you from reaching that seeing that reflected in tom that's what tom taught me so knowing artists like that in the space in some ways i feel like i've like i have not beat the game of nfts i have not traded as well as most i have not made tons of money um i do get thrown into drama and controversy even though i try to avoid it maybe i'm kind of a drama queen in that regard but i have almost like beaten the game of life because with my uncle that was something i thought i would never get over it would just always be a chip on my shoulder or you know a little crack in this glass that i could never fix and tom helped me fill it with gold right that whole idea of kintsugi like i felt that i had filled that crack with gold instead of trying to turn it to pretend it doesn't exist having met artists like that again not saying those are the artists i'm necessarily working with but this kid who a year ago was going to give up being inspired by so many people that was the idea planted into my head and at some point i just couldn't avoid it i couldn't not look at it any longer i found two co-founders who have felt the same way about their own lives that's why i chose them and not another influencer or not someone with a big platform or necessarily the person who like is the most known in the space i needed to work with those two because we have the same feeling um so i hope that gives a little bit of insight into why devotion is important um it's it's this feeling of like i'm learning to be devoted to myself and my story most of all my co-founders feel the same way about themselves and their own lives so we're coming together to work on cool things experiment explore where this mind can really go when we have this awesome tech of web3 and then deliver that to you to hopefully set you off on that journey yourself which is i think what great art should be able to do what has been the reaction from your community from the audience to you shifting into really being an artist i think they understand i think a lot of my friends i often get asked by my friend emily she's like i have a tenth of the followers you do and i get so much anxiety about my dms people asking me for things i cannot imagine how often you ask for things and like yeah i'm asked for things a lot you don't see it on the surface because i either try to like be nice about it or i i try to find another way to help them that doesn't involve like marketing because i'm not interested in that um but i think they understand that it's going to make me less anxious and less busy and then they're going to start to see a better andrew come out um it's been a pretty good response it hasn't been a response of people saying like oh like this is going to be valuable how do i mint it it's more like good for you for doing that you know good for you for making art like somebody's like i was wondering when you do something like this and when you hear something like that it's like that is a very special compliment what's so interesting is it feels like clearly the seeds for this have been here all along the fact i've never thought about being a painter i have absolutely no interest in being a painter the fact that you're like oh i can't be a painter because i shake indicates that you had at one point thought about that when i hear you you've mentioned it here i've heard you in other conversations mentioned like jealousy being jealous of clone or feeling jealous of things jealousy is an indication of what we want in life right and so clearly you've you've had and maybe were even drawn to the industry in in in the very beginning because you wanted to do something like this or or be an artist maybe do you agree with that when was the moment you were like i think what i want to do is be an artist i think i always thought it would be at like my worst times you know a lot of times when we talk about a leap of faith you take the leap of faith when you have nothing to lose but i think equally important is taking that leap of faith when you have a lot to lose when things are going well when you have a system that works and is established and has benefited you and benefited others right there there are times when i've wanted to be an artist when i felt bad an example of that is you know these are the story about my friends but um when i was at vcon in minneapolis um a lot of my friends are really incredible artists and i remember going to the ferocious paint party and we got there and a lot of people were excited to see us because it was me danny cole from creature vinnie from letters and jasty and everybody was like vinnie draw something danny draw something and they're almost like superheroes they're like yeah i got you like pull out the pen right like vinnie always you know goes for the black first and then danny gets these fun colors and they just start like vibing and jamming on this canvas and i'm standing there by myself like holding my beer like i'm so glad i have this beer in my hand because then it would be glaringly obvious that i'm the only one not picking up a marker to jam and do cool things and at that moment i felt like a bit humiliated one because i know how awesome my friends are but it was that feeling of like i can't do this thing with my hand but maybe i can do something else but then there are other times when things are working out and you know i seem to have found my stride but it feels like i could do more and i always ask this to my friends like to be your best self do you need a chip on your shoulder do you need an enemy do you need an attack think about this right do you need your opposite your antithesis right this like person that's out to kill you i always wish i were a twin because i would hope that he were evil so like being more evil like you know you're trying to be a twin you want to have an evil i want to have an evil twin because my evil twin would show me what i am not to make me realize what i am so i envy the twins out there especially the ones with evil twins because like that evil twin drives you right because if you're not more good than he is evil your evil twin will like be cooler than you and like you can't have your twin be cooler than you like that would be devastating and and so for me i'm like do you need like a big constraint like that yeah um and you can think about what it is for various artists i would say a glaring one just gonna put it out there for seneca it's yuga i'm not saying yuga is her enemy but i'm saying like that is something that you know is is present in her story um and might not be sunshine and rainbows all the way through uh for drift it was the law being in jail for six months right even when his work was selling for so much that court case was still ongoing right and he had to win which he did but then it's the question of you know if you have an enemy i felt like i had an enemy when i was first getting into nfts it was easy to say this industry is messed up it's the people reading my stuff like i hate them i resent them why can't you be more empathetic why can't you be more nice why can't you be more more thoughtful like why can't why do you have to be this way but i feel like i i conquered that with my uncle like why does this happen to me right like why does everybody else get to have this but i don't get to have this why do i get nice things in my life like my parents make you know good money they're able to send me to a nice boarding school afterwards i don't have the same connections as people but i'm able to get into good school and get an education but why do i have this one thing that looms over me and why do other people not have to deal with that i think tom sachs helped me over that and so i've like vanquished these foes it feels like but then it makes me ask like my life is a lot better because i've been able to do that do i need to find another enemy yeah i think i'm kind of of the view now that like you don't need that enemy or that humiliation you just need something that you need to improve upon or something that you need to get past a barrier a hurdle it doesn't have to be a wall i much prefer to see a hurdle because there's a path to get over that hurdle you have to learn to jump the right way i always try to do a hurdle analogy because i was a hurdler in college in high school but uh it's this idea of like it doesn't have to destroy you it doesn't have to ruin you it doesn't have to make you depressed it doesn't have to drive you to the edge of insanity or depression um it can make you want to lift your body up to get over my fiance and i talk about this because to an extent we're both like wow we have this happy relationship and i'm in love and i'm gonna marry this person and like for so many years i think for a lot of people right there's this drive of like part of the chip on your shoulder is like death drive yeah but it's also like finding a person you know what i mean like uh i you know a lot of us do a lot of things to to put it crudely to get laid right and this is like that's like sort of a motivating thing and then you find your person that you're spending forever with and you're like god like what what motivation like did i did i beat the game like is it what so it's like finding new things from which to draw to really you know to push forward and also i mean there's other chips on my shoulders but but i i totally get that what is your art style do you feel like you have one yet or you're in the process of honing it or determining like what your artistic expression is i think really for me it's trying to solve problems in the space and seeing all the cool ideas that can come out of it for me like when i did relief when i co-founded that we like bootstrapped it in like 36 hours i was like onto material sorry mom so i wouldn't have to sleep and i'd be focused i really wanted to do this thing yeah basically we raised like over a million dollars in the first drop in like 30 seconds um and we donated that all to ukraine to get past some of their issues like with their national bank putting like really really strict withdrawal limits crypto helped us get over that network with the right people instead of necessarily buying guns we could get money to hospitals help people get out of the country etc etc to me it was like i was in some ways like the only person who like wasn't an artist but i also was in the sense that the artists submitted art they drew things they put it together the dev was an artist because he came up with a really awesome smart contract in a day and it was totally smooth it worked nothing wrong happened with it but for me part of it was thinking like here we are building something where it doesn't matter if you're a bot it doesn't matter if you're a flipper all that money is going to be donated so we build a model that incentivizes it because we are making sure the art the value is going to be above the price of what it costs to min and setting up something like that to me is a kind of art i think to me right now i'm thinking a lot about game theory um really fun for me to think about how i can simplify the decisions that people have to make but under the hood it's like super super complex and all these things like market dynamics what do things have to do how are people prompted um one of my co-founders was showing me this like what do you call it it's like like yes no type of thing like decision tree yeah for sending a notification like to your phone when someone like sends a message and apparently like you would think it's just like they send you a message send it to your phone but there are so many qualifiers that would make it so that like you wouldn't get that notification or you wouldn't get pinged on your phone and to me that's fun and i want to you know one of my other co-founders psyduck says this a lot when you see an iceberg like floating above the water you don't see all that's under you don't see all of it but also what's important is like it helps you can kind of imagine like how big it must be to be able to like hold up like that right for it to not be like floating around like because if it really is just the top part that thing is gonna melt right that thing's gone that thing's gonna like float around like a polar bear can like swipe at it and it's gone but for it to like be there still you know like the mass it's going to take underneath and i just want to like build out all that mass so the top part is like stable and you kind of get a sense of it but um but to be clear you are also doing visual art stuff for sure for sure for sure but i'm just saying like like the conceptual stuff is so fun yeah because i'm finally understanding i think a lot of what goes into modern art which is having a very very powerful concept and all the under the hood stuff who are you studying you obviously name some of your influences are there others you're studying from an artistic perspective i think you know i do have a little bit of an art history background the main reason is because i had a really really big crush on my art history professor in college okay and i i wanted to to impress her and get her i'm telling you this is the just she wanting to get late not to but like you know it's just like the driving force behind society if she's like this maybe it's wrong for me to say but like this like beautiful and like talented italian woman and i remember one day she was showing us like caravaggio on on on a slideshow because i don't know where the original caravaggio is but she was telling me about how like you can tell from the way jesus's feet are like he's like not actually dead but he's alive he's like like tears are streaming down her face and she's like like i'm sorry like somebody like please tell me like what you think about this uh andrea i mean andrew andre and i was like you can call me andrea and and whatever you want again like that was like that was like a lot of the motivation to get into art history but i think for me i'm starting to revisit that starting to revisit a lot of the um you know classical work i am spending more time at the moma i'm going back to the met i think that really old really inspires me as well um even from like michelangelo talking about you know liberating the statue from the marble all those ideas if not represented on a visual level have strong concepts and for me i just want to carry those over because i have this feeling that if the concept is really strong the visual part will almost write itself so i would say a lot more conceptual art but not too serious too i feel like when we talk about that old stuff we think it's going to be like super serious cafe or something some of it will be like fun but you know what's what's like both stuffy and not stuffy i think when michelangelo was making the uh david i'm pretty sure this could be a complete lie i'm pretty sure he had this like patron who like wanted to pay for it and michelangelo was like boom like here's your david like what do you think this is like drunk history i feel like i'm doing that now and the patron's like um like very nice but the nose the nose is not perfect the nose is just a little weird and michelangelo's like granted like you're right let me fix the nose so he gets the ladder and then he climbs up on the ladder but he has like some like marble dust or like salt in his pocket and he like takes it out and like pretends to chisel on it while sprinkling the dust he's like voila like i fixed the nose and the guy's like voila like now it is perfect but it's just you know it's just like you know even those guys had had a bit of fun and i think it's gonna be really cool and serious at times and inspiring but it's also going to be a lot of fun yeah and that's what excites me keeping your options open not pigeonholing yourself as like i am this person and nfts i think that's what nfts are so good for and have fun with it you had a line about like art that changes but also art that changes you and it made me think of danny cole who i understand is like a friend of yours and he was the first person who really helped me understand this concept of like nfts can can allow art to be immersive in a way that you can't do in the traditional art world because you can have a piece of art change based on inputs you have right so he's like that he did things right where you could have the smile like you could go on this journey and then there would be a smile on the nft based on the fact that you'd gone through this journey yeah i have a lot of thoughts about danny cole he is a really weird kid but he's also one of the most amazing people that i've ever met yeah i think what made that interesting was called creature's second journey yeah what was interesting about that was ah he answered the question of why it had to be an nft and that to me is a really strong concept because i could like get a piece of paper right now and i could like draw something on it i could take a picture of it and i could mint it as an nft and have i answered the question of why it had to be an nft maybe like the royalties um putting my name on something you see something like that and like you know like it's not andrew's best work it's like it might be up there uh in terms of what he's put out there so far but um it's this idea of like has he really answered why it had to be an nft or utilize the technology to its fullest potential maybe not but creature's second journey was trying to do that in some way the idea of like the way you came in is not the way you will come out it's this idea of like you know you can't step into the same river twice because the river has flowed differently and you're a different person each time you step in he was sort of doing that with creatures second journey and one way to read it is you change the mouth great but another way to read it is you've answered the question of why it had to be an nft this is a really cool use case that's out there it may not be the first but it is definitely to me a clear-cut example of why only nfts could do this because if he painted it for you you can't really do that um i mean van gogh there was like a hidden van gogh self-portrait in another painting van gogh painting that was x-rayed recently so i guess you could put like another like creature on top of the canvas but like for the art itself like it felt new and it felt different and to me it's about aligning the strength of concept with what draws you in which is oftentimes these visual markers or something that's compelling or familiar or nostalgic or fun or new or different when you bring both together i think you have a winning formula it reminds me i don't know that he said it in my conversation with him recently but i think in my prep for interviewing snowfro i heard him say like that was one of the conceits around artbox was how can i find a use case for the blockchain that like couldn't be done any anywhere else like that it has to have the blockchain to to function the way it does which is how art blocks part of how art blocks was born um and i think danny was achieving something quite similar with that it was funny when i interviewed him he was like his sense of humor is such that like really going over the top with what this thing was going to be which ultimately ended up being the mouth change is like very he that's his sense of humor which i also think is hilarious when he was really spelling that out for me but i i think it like caused some pushback in the community um with people being like what is the mouth change but when you really understand the concept behind it yeah it it actually is really amazing and cool and again that's why with the art world i can totally see how this stuff all has tremendous value in 10 years in a way that i maybe can't even see for some of these more community based concepts because there's clearly there are connoisseurs out there who pay tremendous money for something novel or special or whatever in the in the art world um okay let's bring it back to drifter shoots okay so walk me through where you guys were and how this went down okay so i think perhaps you don't know drifter shoots as a photographer super talented and his series that he's probably best known for where my vans go or where my vans go and it's his feet high in the air like photographed against these landscapes that demonstrate he's high in the air so he free climbs that's nuts okay it is pretty nice and so you joined him on a free climb and got your feet taken in the photo i did which is badass i was at the beginning very scared and by the end of it strangely very very calm i think one of my favorite movies is christopher nolan's the prestige and don't tell me the ending i still haven't seen it i won't i won't i think i know part of the ending i will tell you the beginning okay which is when they explain how magic is done okay they say magic is done in three parts you have the pledge which is when you show somebody something that seems ordinary but of course is not something is about to happen and then you have the turn which is the second step which is you take that ordinary seemingly ordinary object and you manipulate in some way you make it disappear right and then finally the most important thing is the pledge which is it's easy to make something disappear it is much harder to bring it back and the whole narrative behind that process of magic is that if you know something is not ordinary right like if i have like you know those magic balls like those red like poofy balls like you know like that thing like it's so easy to like make it disappear like move it and stuff you don't actually want to know how the magician does it you want to be fooled you want to be uh you want to buy into the magic and and that's part of what makes magic magic and for me i was worried that when i went on probably what was a more difficult climb with drift that i would have that magic broken that i would see like does this dude just take the elevator i was so worried i was so scared we would get into this building and he'd be like alright guys check this out and then he would press the elevator and we would just go up um no of course that that would be discrediting drift for his narrative and all that he's been through um but what i mean to say is like i don't think it's important to necessarily say everything that we did i did get a kind of under the hood look and it was tough it was physically demanding i could probably say it took over an hour to climb the building because we were climbing it by foot so you climbed a building as in like you did you walk upstairs i would say one of the sections was walking up the stairs over and over and over and over and over again but there were other parts that might have required you know some physical ability like more scaling maybe and then do you end up on like the just the roof essentially of this building and put your feet over the edge yeah so you know it's not like you just like look i think it's like his process to to talk about it and not mine drift drifter drift or shoot stretch every call him you are welcome on any time right but um what i what i will say is i think a lot of people think that this is about getting up and being like hype and i can almost like buy that if you're getting exposure to his work for the first time like here's this daredevil who does it um i think you always have to qualify it with something the new york times actually did a good job they said drift was quote a cat burglar who stole only the view and that was almost like a rebuttal to the people who saw him as a criminal for quote-unquote trespassing and not making art but but for me i think what surprised me about that climb um we also climbed with toby lasso who both of them are veterans who have struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder um when they got up they weren't hype like i was probably the most hyped person up there but quickly i settled into it it was almost this feeling of peace of calmness of meditation you can feel the anxiety melt away you can see that creative side come out and it's not like all right let's run up there and let's like throw our feet over and like get dangerous and take a photo in some ways was the furthest thing from that there's a video of me on twitter talking about what that experience was like and why it kind of humbled me and that to me is is exciting and not only being inspired by drift's visual work seeing where my vans go and being an owner i own a shot of the queensborough bridge which is like my favorite bridge in the city because it is the spider-man bridge it's where spider-man and mj go to kind of hang out to get away from the world and i love the last spider-man movie because that's where they were in the opening scene um but i also like spider-man because like it's that whole like dead uncle thing i don't know i have a huge mural of spider-man in my childhood home that i will never take down it is floor-to-ceiling it's the scene where he's trying to save gwen stacy jumping down the clock tower and shooting that web and trying to catch her before she hits the ground um but i own that piece by drift and he took me to a building where i would have an aerial view of the piece that i owned wow so like how special is that being able to get that experience and when you have something like that it's like that is something that most people in their lives won't get to experience and i always think about the andrew that had stayed in school that had done everything he was supposed to do had never taken this leap of faith he and isaac would have never met isaac is his drift he would have never climbed how did you meet isaac with another climb it was it was easy mode i feel like this last one was more media mode the first one was easy mode um it was the last nftnyc long story short i was going to go to this party that i'd been invited to and as i was trying to get in the bouncers were being complete to this guy i hope it's okay that i that i say it and i was like wait that's dk quan like the dk kwan the destiny dk quan like the like one of the greatest animators ever dk kwon and i'm seeing these people like be mean to him i'm like you know what like at that like i'm not going to this party like this party's dumb like it just became uncool um that's awesome and i was just chilling out there with dk and then i get this text from a guy saying hey like what are you up to i didn't see the number i i didn't see the name attached to the number and i was just like i'm chilling like i was gonna go to this party but i might just go home and he's like meet me at this address in times square and he sent a black heart emoji and i'm like no because drift uses the black heart emoji so i was like is drift hitting me up and i was like i was like dk i love you bro but i'm out and so so he so basically drift hit you up randomly one day duo like a client i think i had like given him my number at some point because we had talked a bit on twitter uh obviously i already um own one of his i think yeah i think i own one of his pieces by then um but he just hit me up randomly because he felt it again it was that magic i get to times square i get to this building he's wearing all black right he has his backpack with his camera and his equipment and i get there and he like flashes this card this key card and he's like i commandeered this it's again with the prestige like i want to know like how did you get this but then i don't want to know i want the magic to be there i want to do this climb and we had a really nice long chat up there and a few weeks ago we leveled up again so i'm amazing so are you gonna go for another one at some point i'm ready to climb by myself i will say like be careful if you're climbing um yeah i got caught basically that's what i'm trying to say i was caught on one of my climbs and sometimes you have to take l's right to get to your ws um it's fun i think i'm hesitant to just go more and more extreme because drift inspired me and for drift it's not about getting as extreme as possible i think that's a misconception that's actually not too common because he does a very good job of explaining why he does what he does um it's not about being a daredevil it's not about risking your life and being stupid it's about solving problems and finding peace and finding a place where you feel creative and in that process you know achieving it and so for me if i'm really inspired by drift it's not about trying to find the most extreme thing or like quote unquote a legal thing to climb i don't want to incriminate myself on a podcast but i think to me it's more about what did it mean to do this climb what did i get out of it and if i'm doing something else what can i expect to get out of it and how might i evaluate that process into in deciding if i want to climb something out uh else like i'm not going to do it just because it's crazy just because i can get a crazy photo it would be for what inspired me to collect his work in the first place before we even climbed his story and and what it does for him emotionally and creatively last question any book recommendations book records or like what are your favorite books ah you know i think for me i oftentimes will read a book and pulled just like one thing out of it i think i went to a college where we had to read all these greek authors and like the western canon so just because of my exposure to that that's something that inspires me i mean even this ring that i'm wearing it's my my school ring and i wear it because where did you go to school i went to columbia i uh i transferred there was the only school i got into and i found out i got in after getting into a car accident that just wrecked me and i was on my way to the hospital when i found out we have this building called the butler library where it has all these like classical greats on on the freeze it goes homer herodotus sophocles plato aristotle demosthenes cicero virgil like these great greek and latin writers poets like epic authors and of course like there are so many ways to like subvert it like i had some friends put up the names of uh important women authors like maya angelou and tony morrison like over it so like you can play around with it but but i think for me like i'm inspired by the idea of like a canon of these greats i would say one of the biggest for me and i actually have it on the inside of the ring i have like the words of the freeze in it because i think it's kind of cool um i love that like adventure stuff i would say nietzsche like books by nietzsche are really really big for me um nietzsche to me was like the first like self-help writer um he basically has this book called beyond good and evil where he talks about how like for most of history it was just about whether you were weak or strong but then at some point the weak started seeing the strong as evil and created this conception of good and evil but ultimately what it's about the the real self-help part is saying that there are a lot of people who are resentful in life who think one day right those who are weak will like be the strong because they're good and what he basically says is like dude like make your life what it's meant to be right that resentment can only help you take revenge but it might not help you lead the best life that you're supposed to live uh and to me that's like self-help in a lot of ways and it's the basis of most self-help it's it it throws me harkens me to the tom sacks comment you made right like it's so easy to get resentful working as a janitor and feeling like you've been dealt a bad hand but if you turn it into something else and it's not about in relation to others or in relation to the work it becomes a superpower exactly like if there's one phrase to represent my whole time in web through an nft so far is overcoming resentment and what follows from overcoming resentment is imposing meaning on the world changing the world changing yourself doing what you're meant to do so of course if my first year in adoptees was overcoming that resentment now it is time to create and you know i'm in this chair right now uh nietzsche has this other thing where he says look like most people spend their lives sitting in a chair waiting for something to happen feeling like they weren't dealt the best card in life um best best hand in life and what he says is like for a lot of people you might not get that moment that makes you leap out of your seat a lot of people say like one day my time will come and like a volcano like i'm gonna erupt and like get out of my seat and do this amazing thing become rich meet the love of my life do what i was meant to do but oftentimes that day never really comes and sometimes that day comes but you're too late which is almost like the worst thing um like when you're in a bathtub long enough your hands start to get pruny when you sit in a chair long enough your legs start to go numb and it's this idea of like if you wait for that time to come and it comes too late you'll be like all right like here's my time you try to get out of the chair but you can't because your knees have gotten so weak from sitting and that sucks i don't want that i don't want to feel that way so like crypto and nfts and webview are so fascinating to me because especially in a bear market i can tell myself i no longer need to wait on that time and that calling the calling has already come right it's within myself and i have to get up and you know find discipline find creativity find that emotional you know availability to put myself into this different world and hopefully you know help write a small part of it and if i've done that then i've probably succeeded and everything we often talk about you know wealth status connections most of all happiness will probably follow from that i'll have you know that when i asked danny cole what he reads he informed me he absolutely does not read he hates reading he read a book in high school and vowed never to read again and then later he mentioned something and said oh no i don't want to say that it might encourage people to write so i appreciate your answer look i'm not a great reader either i think i had a lot of people who sat me down and said you need to read you know what you should read and sure um i gave i mentioned this book multiple times in the podcast and i mentioned it to fewocious and feels just like oh my god i read that when i was younger and it changed my life and it's like made me the artist who i am and it is the war of art the war of art the war of art it's short as you're beginning or continuing your creative journey like if you are creative you need to read this book anyways you i think you'll really enjoy it and it's short and it's like an easy read and it's kind of funky in the way it's laid out and fubocia stands by it so and i will say i had somebody come up to me at vcon and say your podcast changed my life because i read this book because i heard you mention it on your podcast so anybody who's like in a creative pursuit or really like it applies beyond that should read the war of art thank you danny green i try to shout you out because he turned me onto that book okay andrew this was a blast two hours one of the longer ones oh my gosh sorry i didn't know what that don't apologize that's why i booked it for a long time and uh i can't wait to run into you again and have you on in the future and see where devotion goes and just really appreciate your time
