thank you station welcome to another state of the nation very important topic a topic that is top of mind for I think everyone in crypto right now did macro kill crypto can crypto recover as crypto investors what do we need to know about the macro environment is this going to be like 2008 all over again maybe something worse what happens to our risk on assets like crypto when are they going to recover all right so who's our guest today David the guest on the show today Ryan is this guy named macro elf who runs a macro Focus newsletter called the macro compass and he has produced some of the most just well reasoned and thoughtful macro analysis that I've seen in the last six months or so and it really to me answers the question what does it take what does what needs to happen for risk on assets our precious crypto assets to reach all-time highs again what needs to happen before that happens and the answer Ryan is kind of a lot of things and so we go through that in the show today and like all of the things that we need to get past in order for us to accept risk again as like not just like investors in the crypto world we already accept risk but what does it take for the rest of the the world to also accept risks because that's what it's going to take for them to come back and pay attention to the crypto industry and so that's really what we're diving into here on the show Ryan that's awesome and before we get into this episode we got to tell you about our friends and sponsors at earnify ernify is the ultimate airdrop Checker you could search for uncleaned airdrops to get notified when you match new ones David I found a lot of money using air uh earnify over the years I and I know you have too because I think you're the person who first told me about this tool yeah so uh I I previously have been a chaotic user of many many ethereum addresses I've been known to just migrate ethereum addresses over and over and over again and so I found earnify especially useful to just go and historically look at all my um all the all the money that I can go like dust sweep using earnify so you just plug in your ethereum address it tells you all of the things that you can go do with that whether it's collect airdrops claim a PO app get an nft it just tells you all the opportunities that you have available to you so uh go go pull out all of your old ethereum addresses and make sure you're not missing any money in the couch cushions yeah we're serious like every every bankless listener should have this app should be using this app because it's a it's free money over there's been over a one billion dollars in earnings that people have found in the country I have I found four unit swap air drops uh like three months ago because of earnify this is crazy and what I love about this is uh too is uh it's it's zero spam I mean they really focus on the quality drops here and and Skip all the fake drops so go check that out there's a link at the show now bankless.cc slash earnify you spell that e-a-r-n-i-f-i you can find out more about this all right so David we're gonna get into this episode what should people pay attention to as we talk to macro elf so this episode with macro elf is one part macro elf telling us the current state of macro markets which is useful but it's also one part a classroom uh and so I learned a lot while doing some my research for this episode with macro Alf and he's just a great educator that is simultaneously teaching us about how the macro World works as he's also telling about telling us about how it is right now and so listeners should just kind of pay attention and like be prepared to get your learn on about you're going to learn about the structure of macro markets and you're gonna you're gonna be able to understand the answer to the question what will it take for the world to go risk on again because he talks about the economy as a as a pyramid and how the bond market is at the very bottom of the pyramid we really need to make sure that bond market does okay if people if we want people to go risk on and so listeners should pay attention to that like there is a structure here in the way that the global macro economy works and macro Alpha just really lays it out what that structure is and what the state of that structure is and how how it's going to change in 2023 and 2024 and one day it'll finally change in our favor but things need to happen first so pay attention to all these details guys let's uh level up on macro but before we get into the episode we want to thank the sponsors

excited to introduce you to our next guest elf macro elf that is he is the former head of a 20 billion dollar Investment Portfolio is a passionate Global macro investor and he writes a free newsletter which I think is the best in the game in terms of keeping up with macro it's called the macro Compass it's available on sub stack publishes every week elf thanks so much for joining us at bankless today hey Ryan David nice to be here thanks for inviting me uh Alf I think we need some help here okay because uh we need to learn a little bit more about macro on Bank list we've done a number of macro episodes people like Lou grama and Lynn Alden Jim Bianco Etc uh and uh macro is actually a focal point I think for crypto right now and I'm wondering if you could elf help us through some of these some of these topics and these things but also put yourself in the position of a typical bankless listener so someone who's maybe a macro novice but dangerous no some of the terms is kind of financially oriented but doesn't know all of the details of how bonds work for for instance they're going to have some assets in crypto right because they're listening to bankless and how can you not they're also going to have some traditional assets maybe they're worried about the future right now things seem uncertain got all sorts of things going on politically uh globally 2022 has been a tumultuous year and maybe they're worried about their portfolio worried about their money as well so can you start us with the high level here what do bankless listeners need to know about macro what's going on right now so Ryan what they should know is that macro is long-term trends and cycles that intersect with these trends and people shouldn't confuse the two so right now we're in the middle of a very strong cyclical Slowdown long-term trends we can debate about those later but first and foremost right now the cyclical macro environment we are will dominate the trend for the next year or two and the cycle I'm discussing is a cycle that is diametrically opposite to the cycle we have seen in the second half of 2020 and in 2021 who are both Financial money and we will Define money later on but Financial liquidity as it's mostly called by commentators was thrown at Financial actors at an unprecedented pace and the fiscal authorities made sure that real economy money the one that reaches our bank deposits actually was also increased and one of the fastest spaces ever recorded under my my metrics that was the Dual real economy money and financial economy money that was thrown at the system at once at a very fast pace and that led to the very sharp nominal growth increase that we have seen in 2021 and inflationary pressures we are seeing now upcoming in 2022 but remember Ryan David and the listeners macro cycles and money generally works with a lag and so as 2020 and 2021 has has happened and we now see the lagged effects of those what's happening today actually we'll see it's like the effect happening in 2023 and 2024. some of those lag defects are already happening and what effects am I talking about I'm talking about the effects of reversing the extreme money inundation financial and real economy money that we have seen in 2020 2021. so bear with me for a second you have when it comes to real economy money when is the last time that the US government sent checks at home to people that's April 2021. it's been a year and a half since we have had the last meaningful fiscal impulse in the US I can say the same for Europe if you look at China they're leveraging very very aggressively at the moment so the bank accounts the real economy money of the private sector is now not growing anymore not nearly as it was in 2020 2021 what about financial economy money well the Federal Reserve and other central banks are in the process of making sure that that shrinks too and that's quantitative it's the process of removing Financial economy money or also called liquidity from the system so now we're going to be seeing the lagged effects of this double tightening of real economic money and financial money in the second half of this year we're already seeing that and then in 2020 2023 and 2024 that's a cycle we will be in going forward so I think that's a really interesting way to parse apart the the two kinds of money in the economy you're you're defining two different kinds of money the money that we as individuals might interact with and the numbers that we see in our bank accounts the cash that we keep in our wallets uh and then uh what you're calling Financial money which is I think just like perhaps like a larger institution money bank to bank money things inside of what we call like Financial system TM and you're saying in 2020 to 2021 the the Paradigm was uh those both of the supply of those two kinds of monies were just like going up bigly that's what the Paradigm was and now they're the new paradigm is the inverse of that where in 2022 to 2023 we got to pull that the the leadership Financial system has to claw that money back so we're doing interest rates uh the money's gotta got a deleverage the system and you're saying that there's a lag time between what is happening versus what effects that that will take on the economy is that a fair synopsis of of what you just said that's a perfect summary David and the most complicated part is understanding that there are these two tiers of money the money that people use the money that corporates use is not necessarily the same money that financial institutions use Bank use Pension funds use asset managers use that's a financial form of money 2020 2021 was a combination of both tiers of money going through the roof right now we have a combination of both tiers of Money Getting effectively destroyed or at the very least the amount of money Creation in both tiers actually is lowing down very aggressively and if you give it 9 to 12 months 15 months in some cases growth slows down earnings slow down inflation slows down risk assets have a problem and actually if there is anything that works in those environments it's mostly cash or very defensive assets and that's effectively what we have been seeing in 2022 right that's just the beginning I would say of the lagged effects of the double whammy monetary tightening that we are seeing since the very beginning of 2022. so is it fair to claim that because we saw inflation come in with a lagged effect uh we had money issuance money distribution and then inflation 6 to 18 months later you're saying like well that same effect of lag time will also happen for deflation so like really the the already high level takeaway is that throughout up to maybe throughout the 2023 and Beyond we're going to be in a deflationary environment I would expect that there is no valid reason for which cyclically Speaking David and Ryan as we have seen a nominal growth pick up so real growth and inflation both picking up in 2020 and 2021 and 2022 we shouldn't see the reverse effect happening where both real growth and inflation at the same time slow pretty aggressively in a disinflationary trend going into the second half of 2023 and 2024. remember you always need to face in a lag some of these things work with the leg the typical example is the housing market and inflation so if you look at the housing Market basically in 2021 the second half especially it was incredibly hot and that's because mortgage rates were very low that's because people had received the Boost to their income on top of that so they had a lot of Firepower to go and boost these house prices later on rents also started increasing very aggressively that was a story of the first and now even second half of 2022 when this rent inflation plays into the overall inflation measures that the Federal Reserve is tracking now guess what happens mortgage rates have gone to seven percent incomes are not growing anymore as they used to in real terms especially they're shrinking which makes the housing situation completely unaffordable so what will happen is that again with the lag going into 2023 2024 house prices are likely to fall housing activity will fall jobs will be lost rents will stop going up and therefore also the housing related component of the inflation basket will start going down so again it takes a little bit of time for this monetary phenomenon to feed into the economy and in asset prices but ultimately with the lack of generally 9 to 18 months depending on what you're looking at they do feed into real economy activity and asset prices and you're just using the housing market as a microcosm of many other Industries as well right like maybe maybe it's an easy narrative to explain in the way that like okay housing market was once hot now it's cooling down and as a result of that cooling down we're going to have like a drop off in the housing labor market and that's going to impact the economy and I think you're just using this as a story that is probably true of many other Industries as well and perhaps the global economy yeah that is correct so the reason why I'm using the housing market is because it's gigantic it's because it's intuitive it's because it's leveraged and it's because it's on everybody's balance sheet at the end of the day either via rents or via mortgages or owning a house so it's something that is very familiar but the housing market represents roughly together with these ancillary activities in the US around 15 percent of U.S GDP it's a relatively large sector because of its very you know relevant nature for everybody and because of its leveraged nature 87 percent of transactions in the US housing market are backed by a mortgage which means that interest rates moving up or down Financial liquidity moving up or down have a very immediate and leveraged impact on the housing market which is also a large portion of the overall economy that's why I've used it debit but in principle I could have made similar assessment for European corporates or Chinese corporates or anywhere else the principle Remains the Same if you throw real economy spendable money out which means you increase the amount of Bank deposits that we own that corporates own with a lag will be inclined to actually spend some of this money boost nominal economic activity make earnings go up make the economy grow which was the story of 2021. now if Supply is also bottlenecked then inflation obviously goes up because the demand is artificially pumped up cyclically while the supply can't be pumped up and so you also have inflation but now we are reversing that and we are reversing that very aggressively not only by stopping the real economy printers so government deficits in the first place but also by removing Financial liquidity from the system and that's job that not only the Federation but also the European Central Bank is now keen on doing it's really interesting elf so so I think a lot of people um they're scared to kind of think about macro or talk about macro because it seems complicated but what I love about the the story that you just painted is um it's pretty damn simple all right so just to kind of recap we had this money creation period both real and financial money 2020 to 2021 and then 9 to 18 months later we pay for this type or the ramifications of that sort of money creation event start to show up and we see that in asset prices going up uh home prices going up inflation going up and that has been the story of the last 24 months we've seen the effects of that money creation Now we flipped and we're in a money destruction period where real and financial money is uh being destroyed not being created it's actually being destroyed and so what can we expect on the other side of that houses price house prices to fall asset prices to fall jobs to be lost uh incomes going down uh and also inflation going down as well will this be the remedy for inflation do you think yes secretly speaking I don't see any major reasons why such a withdrawal of accommodation from the system shouldn't result in the same move down in inflation and Ryan this is when I I want to stress out that I'm talking about cyclical slowdowns and cyclical pickups remember at the beginning when David asked me about macro you asked me first question about macro I made a distinction between cycle cyclicals and long-term trends right so we're talking about the cyclical Trend here I would argue that we saw cyclical upswing in nominal growth and inflation we're going to be seeing a cyclical downswing now in in inflation as well when it comes to long-term trends we might open another discussion and also when you obviously when investors look at crypto look at other asset classes at investment decisions their time Horizon can be very long especially if they're very young and they want to invest in something for the next five to ten years nevertheless risk management through micro Cycles is very important so I always want to talk about both I want to make sure that people have the right frame of thinking When approaching macro so the trends are maybe a different story but cyclically speaking I do expect inflation to slow down yes in 2023. and now this money destruction period it sort of started happening would you say at the end of 2021 but definitely into 2022 is that the case and so this is why you're saying like we can expect to pay for that like now and for the next you know 9 to 12 months 9 to 18 months into 2023 and 2024 is that a rough timeline of this cycle so Ryan I build a metric that encapsulates and proxies the growth in real economy money so Financial money is one tier and real economy money is the other so I try to measure whether us as the private sector and corporates are actually getting our bank deposits pumped up or not or to which to which extent is this acceleration of your economy money there and under that G5 so the five largest economies basically pull together that credit impulse metric basically peaked in the fourth quarter of 2021. now very punctually if you ask me nine months later so roughly by the half of uh this year the first half of this year already we started seeing the first signs of forward leading indicators actually slowing down PMI service went down the first cracks appearing a bit in earnings some companies were more defensive when announcing earnings now we have seen in these earnings releases that Amazon and other large companies are starting to to see some hits when it comes to earnings right those are very large companies systematically important global companies you are seeing very evident economic slowdown already now how long does it take for inflation to slow down that's next lag and near Ryan people should understand that in in macro there are forward leading indicator coincident indicators and logging indicators now credit impulse is one of the most forward-leading indicators of all it tells you whether real economy money is being printed or not and that peaked in Q4 2021 and after that it's been slowing down six months later survey for leading indicator BMI service ISM service other service actually start to decline 12 months later so roundabout now you start to see earnings declining next leg to fall is going to be the labor market the labor market is a coincidence indicators companies will actually first try to cut discretionary spending and only later on adjust their head count if they see the economy is lowing down it's not an immediate process so the next shoe to fall will be the labor market somewhere between next quarter and the quarter after that at the beginning of 2023 and only when the labor market cools down Ryan you can have wages cooling down which means the nominal spending power of people also goes down they'll need to be more conservative they'll spend less the demand side of the economy will get a bigot and inflation will slow down too also the housing market will have its loan by then which means that with the lag rent pressures will be slowing down all of that I expect to happen in the second half of 2023 until to the point where in 2024 I expect federal funds rate below one percent and remember we'll be picking at roughly five percent more or less at the end of this year beginning of next year I expect fed funds to be below one percent in 2024. wow that's a big change uh I I want to actually share this um metric that you were just referring to the Global Credit impulse uh metric and um you know one question about this cycle so again we're still we're still talking about the cycle we're not talking about the long term we'll talk to some of the talk about some of the the long-term implications but what I'm now showing is um macra elf's Global Credit impulse uh cycle and one thing I notice here which is kind of a question about this cycle specifically elf is um it seems higher the high seems higher and the low seems lower than previous Cycles so this chart goes all the way back to 2004 if I'm correct and I want to ask you specifically about this cycle um has have the uh polls the extremes the um the rapid upswing and the rapid downswing on all of our numbers been far more I don't know I guess the word is maybe volatile than previous Cycles what is unique about this cycle compared to the last is this cycle different it's a very smart observation Ryan and this cycle was unique for two reasons the first was the combination of real economy money Printing and financial money printing at the same time which was something that rarely happened in in modern history after World War II and the second thing that made it very unique is that there was an exogenous shock which was the pandemic that basically made the foundations of our leverage system tremble and it that trembled because of an exogenous shock which effectively led to a response which was not very easy to measure the United States printed over 5 trillion dollars in real economy money this is government deficit which means that the government blows a hole in their balance sheet and it throws money at the private sector without taxing them that's what it means it's unfunded money spending and it ends up on the balance sheet of us it's money that's been spent for us five trillion dollars Ryan it's 25 percent of GDP this is like a this is a war-like fiscal response and even even like a large War I have to say so effectively the exogenous shock uh was an event where policymakers couldn't really measure the amount of stimulus that was needed and so they ended up doing too much in certain jurisdictions the US is a typical example where this ended up overeating the system and we saw if you the chart you pulled up there have you seen these Cycles These Wings right you pump up the system and then you drain this money creation have you seen what happens to earnings so those those orange dots or these blue dots on the chart were actually earnings per share in the S P 500 so how much the companies are actually growing their earnings year over year lagged by 9 to 12 months so again give it a little bit of time give it 9 to 12 months to see the effect of this monetary expansion earnings grew by 52 in 2021 this is just gigantic now obviously when you withdraw now very abruptly that stimulus what happens is that you should expect economic activity to slow down at least proportionally also the other point is that our system becomes more leveraged as we go on and now we move to discussion a bit to the trends right because so far we talked about Cycles but the way that our system works is the following we after the 80s we are not able to engineer organic growth anymore and how does an economy engineer organic growth is via having more people participating to the economic growth which means labor force growth good demographics we have a lot of kids entering the labor force we have a young population that produces or and or this population is very productive so it's the productivity your labor and the productivity of capital if you sum up labor force growth and productivity you obtain what's called potential growth which is the organic growth that an economy is able to generate without cyclical boosters just by its own means now in the 80s potential GDP growth in the U.S according to my estimates was roughly four and a half percent every year the U.S would deliver four percent of real GDP just by its own means why because demographics was good population was young productivity Trends were good etc etc now after the 80s there has been a massive decline in this trend demographics has turned against us the population ages we have much more referees than new people entering the labor force in many jurisdictions over the next 20 years the labor force will shrink think about that it's like the pie of people contributing to economic growth will become smaller how can you expect an economy to generate organic growth year after year if there are less people contributing to economic growth via productivity maybe yeah sure we have had some productivity pickups but as technology has already widespread pretty aggressively through many sectors the marginal productivity increase every year becomes a bit more complicated to engineer we still grow in productivity every years but we have already done the bulk of you know penetrating technological advances to our sectors which means that if I take Germany German potential growth real growth just looking at demographics of productivity is roughly 0.7 percent a year which politician will accept an economy growing at 0.7 percent a year that's like a Japan stagnation kind of environment so what do we do well we give it a booster we give cyclical boosters to our economy which means we create credit we create debt we basically lever up our spending power today borrowing from the future we lever up our balance sheet we go to a bank and we ask for a mortgage a bigger mortgage a bigger and bigger mortgage to be able to afford a house that otherwise with our means we wouldn't be able to afford it's credit creation is the process of leveling up the entire economy balance sheet and now if you sum the public sector and the private sector balance sheet if I if I take total economy debt in China in Germany in the U.S in Japan everywhere I look we are anywhere between 300 and 400 of GDP because we keep doing the same we lever up at this round and then we make leverage cheaper interest rates are lower at every turn and now borrowing at four percent allows you to borrow this much but borrowing a three percent allows you to borrow more and then borrowing a two percent allows you to borrow more etc etc etc so this is the process we have been ongoing for now four years and this process is just there to make sure we can supplement very poor organic growth with cyclical boosters and that also explains Ryan why you see these Cycles being every time having a higher higher top and a lower bottom basically because you're trying to lever up the system more and more at every iteration Alpha we definitely want to talk about the the longer term theme here because it does seem like maybe the the plane is running out of Runway right I mean we've tried this act a few times I I also want to talk about kind of the um the Precision of the the cyclical analysis that that you're presenting us because I like the Simplicity of it but I also like the kind of um the cause and effect nature of it it's we did this thing right and then this is the cause and we see these effects on the other side of things and so um when I hear a lot of people talk about macro it's all it just much of it seems like very probabilistic like this could happen and this could happen but like you're kind of saying No this is this is sort of an inevitability I'm picturing like a python eating a rat or something you know for its breakfast and it you know it bites and then you know the rat has to like travel through the rest of its body and that process might take some time but that is exactly like it has to get to the into the Python's body and be totally absorbed by it and that's just an inevitability and that's what you're presenting um as kind of the cycle I I guess maybe a question to you though is is there any way to avoid this sort of cyclical outcome like this talk of soft Landings right um is this just fed speak is this just Banker speak or it's the plain speak reality that maybe if if Central Bankers didn't have to put on an act uh maybe they'd just be saying look we did some things uh and we created a lot of money and now we have to absorb the rat basically and this is the inevitability of what's going to happen let me ask you is this totally prescriptive or can we get around this somehow can we get a soft Landing no we can't it would be my answer now the issue is of course I also think in probabilistic terms Ryan and what I describe might come across as inevitable but I managed a very large investment book I've been proven wrong plenty of times and therefore I am very aware of having to be receptive to the fact that your base case probabilistic scenario might not play out right so um what I say is what I what my macro models and indicators actually tell me ahead and I assume that to be the base case and that's probably it's coming across as very very strongly opinionated base case because it is when it comes to central banks speak that's another of funny experiences I've had the chance of of going through when I was running uh this 20 billion dollar book is that when you go and talk to policy makers to be honest try and all they want to say is what the prescription tells them to say and the prescription is to come across as very balanced preserving the status quo and preserving a controllable outcome that's what they want right so if you think about it I found very impressive that Powell at the Jackson Hole speech in August he went outside this normal prescription I'm quoting him now a top of my head he said something like um the pain that the households will need to go through to bring down inflation is an inevitable consequence of the process of tightening monetary policy now he's talking about households experiencing pain that's not Central Bankers Jurgen now Jerome Powell who's rumored to have reducted his speech completely a few hours before the Jackson Hole speech it's a very strong indication of how uncomfortable policy makers are at this stage because not only this is not a status quo environment anymore not a controllable environment anymore not only that but actually it's Way Beyond any comfortable Zone area which makes them want to move even more than proportionally aggressive they need to act and put themselves in front of the curve to try and regain that little credibility left before it's totally lost which makes them wanna you know act very very very strongly I saw you put up a screen with the with this exact words I'm not sure I quoted him perfectly but the the gist was that one Alpha a lot of listeners both Ryan and I are are millennials and so we we remember when we were younger going through 2008 and that was my first experience of like oh an economy is this thing that can be bad sometimes uh and I think that's just like the a memory that a lot of bankless listeners have uh when we say that there's this coming era of deflation and depressed Market activity and less growth uh the only frame of mind I have to compare this to is like 2008 and like the years after that well it took like years and years to recover and produce a normal economy again how when we use that as our Anchor Point like how uh and we talk about households going through pain how much pain we talking like how are how are people going to feel uh how's the average U.S economy worker uh going to feel over the next like two years I expect the U.S to lose about two to two and a half million jobs next year that will bring unemployment rate up to roughly five and a half to six percent which is a pretty high unemployment rate for the us but if you think about it in historical terms it's not Skyrocket High nevertheless we're at three and a half percent now to move up to six in one single year it's quite a lot of pain uh the historical parallel that I like to draw your debit is uh for the older listeners it's late 2000 beginning of 2001. I wrote an article on the macro Compass um it's free for people who want to check it out um which really Compares today with that period I see a lot of parallels now bear with me for a second in 2000 we saw a.com Mania anything that had a.com after its name was growing you know whatever it was basically doubling in share price in in few months can we say the same about the excessive risk taking we have seen in some of the tech stocks in some of the altcoins in some of the more risk intense risk-taking corners of the market we might want to say the same right we have seen Arc for example dropping 80 percent now in in basically a few quarters as the result of that Stellar increase that Arc or any other I'm using Arc I could use any other high beta risk intense asakas out there second thing inflation back then was over four percent for five quarters in a row now today it's much higher than four percent but it gives you the idea that inflationary pressures were persistent and way above the fat Target which also limited the ability that the FED had to accommodate in case things got worse because inflation was way above their mandate we also add at the end of 2000 the first quarter where earnings started to wobble does it remind you of anything with a lot of earnings downgrades we've seen today in very large companies we have seen meta we have seen Amazon um you know we have seen some of these earnings actually starting to wobble now what happened in 2001 because now if this parallel Works we're basically looking into 2001 like now we are looking into 2023. what happened is that earnings dropped very materially 10 to 15 percent in 2001 that's a pretty sharp drop in earning in earnings unemployment rate shoot up and inflation started dropping only later on in the in 2001 which also allowed the FED to cut rates by 150 basis point in six months pretty decent cutting cycle right so then what I did is I looked at asset classes performance I looked at okay what happened when the economy was the weakening enough that bad with labor market losses with earnings dropping that it forced the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates what happened to asset classes now Equity markets dropped another 15 percent the dollar kept appreciating even if the Federal Reserve was cutting rates that makes me think that this this fed pivot that we often hear about that has been so misplaced this year when and if it happens it happens probably because things have gotten so bad in the real economy that there is nothing to be happy about about the fact pivot in the first place now there will be a point when the FED is easing enough and economic damage has already been done and Incorporated that we will have a very good buying opportunity for risk Assets in general another cycle where to basically pick up this lack of what's been left on the table but I don't expect that to happen anytime soon and I think I definitely want to get into that that conversation with with risk assets and their future but in order to get there I kind of want to start with the bond market um because all things start with the bond market and doesn't it uh and there was a tweet that Ryan and I talked about uh on a couple like Friday weekly Roll-Ups ago that um the the Tweet was about uh it was a graph that compared the volatility of Bitcoin to the volatility of the 10-year treasury uh and for the first time ever Bitcoin is less volatile than the 10-year Treasury and uh I mean crypto right now is actually very very just like volatile volatility depressed things are kind of flat right now so we're in this unprecedented flat moment but still the point still stands when like the 10-year treasury is more volatile than Bitcoin that's definitely like saying something and when I when I first interpreted this tweet it was uh kind of like a Victory lap for the crypto industry it's like look our our industry is becoming more stabilized it's becoming more mature like we always knew that crypto would become less and less volatile as it got bigger and we're seeing some of those first signs of that and then after reading your are articles and consuming some of your content I would then realize that perhaps a Victory lap of celebrating the volatility of the 10-year treasury market is not actually the the thing to be happy about Alf could you walk us through the significance of volatility and spreads in the bond market and kind of what it means for everything else the vital question for the investors right now David the levels of realized volatility in the treasury market are the highest since the great financial crisis effectively and let me walk you through what does this mean for asset allocators now I always like to think in Big Picture terms so try to picture with me a pyramid and the pyramid has several building blocks all the way up to the top and The Bays the very base of the pyramid the the layer which is supposed to be the most stable is actually the bond market with the underlying repo market and all the money markets behind those are the very bases of the pyramid now we are shaking this base very aggressively with this high level of implied and realized volatility what does this mean okay who are the whales in the market the wheels in the market are institutional allocators Pension funds Banks you have asset managers the Black Rock the PIN codes the large Pension funds The Sovereign wealth funds you need to think about those they have us on the management of several trillions dollars trillions of worth of dollars okay so these guys have anasta location mandate they can buy bonds they can buy equities they can buy credit they can buy commodities the bond market is bonds are are often a decent allocation of these guys and and there are structural reasons why so if you're a pension fund imagine that on on the liability side what you need to do is you need to you have this dispension premiums pension contributions you need to service in 20 30 40 years for your clients right which makes you prone to interest rate volatility you have these fixed cash flows you have to service in 40 years in the meantime there will be a lot of interest rate volatility and you have some returns to make on the asset side to make sure that you can pay these pensions over time now so therefore you need to generate returns and you need to hedge some of these interest rate volatility that happens to hit your liability side an asset that generated returns and hedges interest rate volatility is a bond a bond allows you to generate a certain fixed returns to fix the new income instrument and also allows you to hedge this volatility over time now that makes a pension fund a natural buyer of bonds it's a big whale that naturally will be buying bones a bank same story by regulation Banks need to own liquid assets liquid assets are assets can be liquidated very quick or repoed in the repo market and transformed in cash very quickly so if depositors come all of a sudden a withdraw their deposit very quickly Banks can service these deposits it basically limits the risk of Bank runs effectively it's new regulation being put after the great financial crisis which makes Banks big buyers of bonds because the regulator has told them that they need to own liquid assets okay so this basically they will be buyer of bonds Naturally Speaking over time what happens if the asset class they count the most on for fixed returns stability low levels of volatility what happens if that asset class becomes very volatile what happens if the base of the pyramid becomes very volatile the second third layers of the pyramid are credit corporate bonds they are mortgage-backed securities equities they are riskier tranches of this pyramid I just discussed if the base is very solid it's very stable Pension funds banks will be looking for additional returns they will be looking for taking a little bit more race coupler pyramid because the base fulfills all the basic needs and as that is stable and volatility is very low they can buy credit spreads they can buy equities they can buy mortgage-backed Securities but now make the base Shake when the base Shake obviously what these investors will do is they will be forced mechanically forced to divest the riskier investment at the top because if the very base is becoming shaky imagine what happens at the top of the pyramid David so what happens is a a natural risk inclination that brings this large rail large institution to dispose of their investment portfolios that are the least close to their mandate their original mandate is to secure risk-free returns and to hedge interest rate risks not to go and buy some fancy clo or or weird structure the housing market bond to generate a little bit of yield on top that's okay when volatility is very low but when volatility designed the bond market they pair back their risk and I've been there I've had the CFOs I've had Risk Managers stopping on your shoulder when things are getting shaky and saying do we really need that Chinese bond that you bought to make eight percent we don't need it anymore sell that so then what happens is a cascading of events where the big whales dispose of the risk assets puts pressures on price puts pressures on other investors to dispose of their risk assets etc etc etc and is this what the words contraction or deflation seem to just resonate really hard here where like if we're if we're talking about a pyramid and the foundations of the pyramid are shaking and everyone gets scared everything is just Contracting everything comes down from the top uh and so is it this is the same conversation as like when we say an economic contraction or an economic deflation these are the same words yeah basically yes so you need to imagine that if the base of the system is shaking um the edges the fringes of the system are the ones hit first so very leveraged companies emerging markets that are very reliant on external funding hey nowadays not even Emerging Markets you can say the same for the UK or Europe have you seen where the pound or the Euro went so if you shake the very core of the system what happens is that the most exposed the most fragile the more the more leveraged fringes of the market tend to suffer first and that's what we have seen the second thing we haven't really discussed about is that you can move the base of the pyramid in two ways really you can make it shaky make it very volatile or you can literally withdraw some of the Bays from the system like um have you seen one of these games where you can just withdraw a single stick of wood from one of these towers and yeah still keep it in Balance yeah I don't remember the name of the game yeah but right now what we are doing is we are withdrawing small pieces of woods from the very base and those pieces of woods are Financial money we are making sure that the the Federal Reserve balance it shrinks but most importantly that Bank Reserves which are money for banks money for the financial system is getting withdrawn from the system so bear with me for a second so the bond market is shaky and banks have less Bank Reserves which are money for banks now these Bank Reserves which shrink effectively when the Federal Reserve shrinks their balance sheet there is a lot of monetary Plumbing into that that we can cover if you guys want but simplistically speaking If the Fed shrinks at balance it normally Bank Reserves will shrink too and when this Bank Reserves shrink what happens is that banks have less money for banks these Bank Reserves are used to settle transactions with other Banks to do repo Market transactions between Banks to buy and sell things between Banks and these Bank Reserves do not never enter the real economy system never it's just a separate tier of money but now you're reducing these reserves so banks have less liquidity for banks which means obviously at some point there will be less Keen in engaging with a lot of liquidity providing transactions because they themselves have less liquidity for for banks right so why would I want to share this liquidity with markets why would I want to lubricate the repo Market why would I want to be very liquidly providing towards others the more you shrink this base the more banks will become more risk-averse and more prudent with their liquidity providing exercise what happens when you dry up markets from liquidities that you increase systemic risks do you remember that 2019 repo blow off that was mostly because Bank Reserves were dropping very very aggressively as the Federal Reserve was ongoing with quantitative tightening we reached the breaking point where Bank said I'm sorry but I don't have much liquidity bank money for myself so I'm gonna completely stand back and not provide liquidity not lubricate the repo Market which if you remember is one of the base layer of this pyramid so we are not only making it shake when it comes to price volatility but we're also making it less lubricated effectively by removing the amount of Bank Reserves from the system arbitrim1

here so I think the crypto World sort of sees the base shaking right you have the pensions the whales they're looking at their bonds and they're like these yields are terrible I am losing a lot of money on these things and so the crypto fantasy is that rather than buy more Sovereign bonds for example uh they switch out the asset and they start purchasing Bitcoin they start purchasing ether they start swapping into a crypto based assets that aren't backed by nation state economies right this is like a whole fantasy story hasn't really happened yet but this is I think what the crypto World hopes for um maybe not at this stage but at some stage in the cycle elf you've been in this position is there any hint of realism uh to this type of a scenario well they start to look at other assets that aren't based on the bond system something that is maybe a self-sovereign type of bond or a commodity type of money uh at the moment there is none Ryan to be honest just a fantasy just a fantasy let me give you let me give you an example um as a friend of mine would Define it Bitcoin for Boomer switching which is gold that's the definition it would give to Gold Bitcoin for Boomers and gold is something that everybody is familiar with in the policy making circles everybody knows gold we've even had a gold standard I mean it's it's really something that people are familiar with in that Circle in the regulatory policy making Circle right gold sits on most large central banks and Ministry of Finance balance sheets all over the world as a reserve asset everybody's familiar with gold right now if you're a bank and you want to own gold as a form of liquid asset instead of owning bones instead of owning Bank Reserves you would decide again to go outside the system and say I'm gonna own an asset that is a form of money that doesn't belong to that Financial system in the first place so that Financial design in the first place well that would be something that I guess people would be okay with when it comes to an idea and again gold is a concept that policymakers and Regulators are familiar with yet gold is treated like can I swear on this podcast it's really like dog by Regulators so if you're a bank and you buy gold you get treated extremely bad from a regulatory liquidity standpoint so you do not meet your ratios The Regulators are not friendly towards gold as an asset and on top of that you cannot even from an accounting perspective get friendly treatments that banks are looking for when owning these very large amounts of of liquid assets and we are talking about gold again something that is Regulators are very familiar with now try to think about ethereum or Bitcoin in this context now right now ethereum or Bitcoin are basically seen as so-called Mark to Market assets for banks which means yes you can buy it nobody forbids you from buying a future maybe or an ETF that tries to replicate that exposure but you're you are going to be basically treated as if you're gambling on this asset this will be treated with no regulatory friendliness at all no accounting friend unless nothing and there is no concrete um signal that this is going to change anytime soon wow so you're saying this doesn't even start this doesn't solve the problem for that base layer of whales because they can't they're not even buying gold misneros so to think that they would buy Bitcoin or ether uh is just like a completely unrealistic yeah but the way you need to think about this is the following the system is regulated and built around um let's say a financial system we have designed and used for now hundreds of years and that system looks basically makes use of bonds and makes use of financial Plumbing that includes the repo Market Bank Reserves Shadow banking etc etc etc that's the prevailing system we have had for uh at least 100 years what would be the incentive scheme from regulators and remember these Regulators are the same guys that I talked about before when I said they want controllable outcomes they want status quo they want something they feel comfortable with what would be the incentive skin for them to cause a revolution in that system there is no incentive scheme and I'm not saying it's the right thing to do to completely ignore this but again in macro investing it's not about what we want to happen is about the cards we are given with to play poker with my mentor always said off it's not about the hand you wish you were dealt with it's the hand you have that you have to try and maximize and right now we have an incentive scheme from regulators and policy makers that completely prevents them from looking for Creative Solutions to this to these problems you are correctly identifying yeah it's an interesting juxtaposition where all the theory of like crypto Bitcoin ethereum is that we want these things to become the New Foundations the new bottoms the new base of the pyramid but still in reality they are at the very tippy top of this like like scale of risk uh and so maybe it's just a little bit too idealistic a little bit too soon and Alpha I just want to like check my reasoning about one thing we've been watching the dxy just climb climb climb super strongly that is because the dxy is a measure of the dollar which is at the base of the pyramid right and so the dollar climbing to new new strengths is indicated that and while ether and Bitcoin are going down in price like that's because the Dollar's at the base and Bitcoin and ether are at the top of the pyramid like that's correct reasoning right you are so right we talked about the base of the system looking at it from a very domestic system perspective if you broaden your perspective to a global pyramid and you look at the base of This Global pyramid you still will find repo markets the bond market and you will find the dollar at the very end the center of this pyramid in the building block our system is built around the dollar another way to think of it is that the dollar is the denominator of the good stuff and of the problem so let me try to explain what I mean the dollar accounts for 10 to 20 percent of global GDP and World trades that's it 10 to 20 I didn't say 80 only 10 to 20 percent though when you look at how much the dollar accounts for as a share of cross-border payments effects transactions bonds issued by jurisdictions not in the U.S that want to borrow in a foreign currency the dollar accounts for anything between 60 and 80 percent of these transactions so what I'm telling you is that let's take Brazil as an example Brazil the exports stuff we need soybeans Commodities oil they export a lot of stuff right now to grow their business with the world they basically decided together with everybody else to use the dollar as the denominator of their of their transactions soybean contracts are in dollar oil contracts are in dollars everything that they export basically is denominated in dollars now think of this for a second if you're a Brazilian corporate and you want to level up your business you want to produce more of this stuff you want to export more of this stuff you probably will be wanting to borrow in dollars you're borrowing dollars you can boost your dollar spending activity and you can then export more stuff in dollars okay this is actually what we have done emerging market that denominated in in dollars was roughly 2 trillion somewhere like in 2000 and it's now six or seven trillion dollars so we have went 3x on this dollar denominated emerging market that that's all fine and dandy as long as dollars keep organically flowing towards Brazil but what happens when growth slows down and you know developed markets don't want many of these soybeans or oil anymore because the economy is slowing down all of a sudden Brazil comes sell stuff denominated in dollars anymore to the same extent it could before wait a second they have liabilities in dollars they have incurred in that denominated in dollars so what happens then what happens is that you go to the core of the pyramid which is the dollar the dollar becomes the denominator of the problem and everybody wants to get their hands on the dollar to make sure that they can pay off their debt the nominated in dollars because they're not getting these organic dollar flows anymore so it's a dash the dollar it's a deleveraging episode where the denominator becomes the problem everybody wants it everybody needs it and so the dollar goes up in value and the fringes as you said that with the extremes the things that are the farthest away from being the very core of the system are the ones that suffer the most in that environment that's exactly what we have seen in 2022 we have seen economies slowing down we have seen the Federal Reserve making dollar access more tight more expensive and we have seen all the fringes and and with fringes I mean even the UK even Europe has become vulnerable to currency depreciation because they are maybe closer to the core but they are not the core the epicenter of the global pyramid is the dollar the dollar bond market and the repo Market so it doesn't sound like as as an investor who lives at the top of the pyramid if you will like most of my net worth is crypto assets it doesn't sound like crypto assets risk on assets the fringes are going to reach new highs until like we get over this like new paradigm of the market like we are the if we want like new all-time highs in Bitcoin ether all our risk assets that most bankless listeners have uh we need to wait for this bond market to stop being so volatile and for spreads to to become smaller right and we're just going to be probably sitting on our hands until that happens uh how long how long are we sitting on our hands for so what's the trajectory of bond market volatility so we're talking about Cycles now again David we had a nice discussion about Trends and structural drivers of everything we go back into Cycles so if you look at the timing there you should expect that the basically the the double whammy money contraction Place its lagged effect through the economy in a way that people lose their job I'm gonna say that very openly so unemployment rate goes up inflation slows down and the Federal Reserve can accommodate and make sure that it lubricates the system again and that the government as well can become a bit more lenient in their fiscal stance all over again and then you're again back into the moment where both layers of money actually are thrown to the system not withdrawn but they are thrown to the system once that happens you allow a little bit of a lag and risk sentiment will be building up again so these Cycles generally take roughly one and a half to two years which means you are already in the cycle itself you have seen Bitcoin ethereum all major crypto and digital assets take a drawdown which was to be expected and it's easy with hindsight but if you follow the line of thought and the double whammy monetary line of thought I just followed was to be somehow expected now you are in the middle of it most likely you will get I would say another lag of weakness upcoming once that is cleaned and the bond market has stabilized that should happen roughly in the second half of next year I would expect that the labor market has already taken a large heat enough and inflation is slowing down enough that the Federal Reserve can be more accommodative so when that happens as you go into 2024 you will have a completely different setup you will have also what I call the tourists of an asset class being Flushed Away people that are in the asset class because it's a momentum thing it's not something they really understand or they are comfortable with it's just a momentum play those would have been completely washed out and the set of macro circumstances will look much more favorable for risk Assets in general including digital assets at that point but unfortunately I can't see that happening much earlier than late 2023 unless if I'm proven wrong the Federal Reserve decides to stop tightening the screws much earlier than what I expect but that would mean that inflation has already slowed down or that the Federal Reserve is happy with inflation at six percent or at five percent and I don't think they will be happy because it doesn't fit their mandate it doesn't make regain any credibility to the central bank itself so I think this fits into the broader conversation of like when pivot fed like fed please pivot so my assets can go up up in price what I heard from you is 2023 it was just going to be a year of flat maybe down um but like it kind of you kind of painted a picture of like well there is a timer on eventually the quote fed will pivot what's going to make the FED pivot though like what are the indicators that that we're really going to be looking for so there are two ways to Pivot and neither of those is a good one uh which is there is a systemic liquidity crisis that will make the FED pivot between Rockets if the base of the pyramid is at risk of being destroyed then the pyramid wouldn't exist anymore and nobody wants that policymakers included so they make sure that that doesn't happen now that kind of systemic risk means a blow up in the repo Market or treasury markets being completely dysfunctional or the repo Market blowing up we haven't really seen any major evidence yet the treasury market is becoming a bit more illiquid it's a function of volatility if it's so volatile how can you expect it to be very liquid as well were not to happen the Federal Reserve will need to intervene very similar to what the bank of England did when the UK pension fund industry was about to blow up as well uh but that means we are witnessing large systemic risks liquidation and risk assets people need collateral they will be liquidating any asset they have first in a panic mode until the Federal Reserve intervenes which means that probably risk assets will have to have a drawdown before the Federal Reserve intervenes so it's it's a delayed fat pivot that doesn't really help price action before they actually get there and the second way to Pivot would be if the labor market gets it so bad that inflation starts to slow down and people are losing their job and they can't spend money anymore and the Federal Reserve is like okay maybe we did enough damage we can slow down a little bit and that would be translated into you know better risk sentiment six to nine months ahead now that I think is the most likely path ahead which makes me want to think that we're going to see some pain through the real economy and risk assets still between now and the first off of next year and then you know going into the second off of next year I think the set of circumstances will be more friendly for the Federal Reserve to Pivot credibly pivot not because they want to rescue some asset class I'm sorry they don't care about where the equity Market is if it's a three and a half or 3.9 actually they care negatively care if it keeps rallying because it defeats the purpose they want demand to slow down how will demand slow down if people see their 401ks going through the roof there will be probably spending more so they need the labor market to slow down risk assets to be really contained in order for these lagged effects of tighter double whammy monetary withdrawal to fit through the economy and only when enough damage is done they can credibly pivot back the picture you're painting sounds like the FED is only going to Pivot at the last available moment and not a moment sooner than that Imagine David they are they're driving their car um looking in the rear view mirror instead of looking in in the front window and that's how they're driving their car they're looking at the moment when inflation will slow down well inflation is the most lagging indicator of all available I swear I mean I rank them by Leading coins and logging inflation is amongst the most lagging of all which means basically they're driving and they're looking back rather than looking in front that's by Design that's because of their incentive scheme and their mandate is to slow inflation and they've been so wrong that they cannot accept and in once anymore they'll be like I don't care I know I'm gonna make damage again quoting Powell households will need to go through some pain those are the unfortunate consequences which means I up now I need to regain my credibility and I will be driving looking in the rear view mirror I hope uh Powell can drive this economy like James Bond then because uh it's pretty difficult to drive that way um Alpha let's zoom out okay so we talked a lot about the cycle but I want to get back to this conversation that you mentioned earlier of like hey we've been doing these Cycles these kind of oscillating debt cycles for the last uh 40 years um and we we don't live in the 1980s anymore this is the 2020s and with real productivity declining across kind of the the modern world where is the next leg of growth actually going to come from and I want to bring in you know another analogy that that we've seen in the macro World which is you know Ray dalio's long-term debt cycles and this concept of you have kind of this 80 to 150 year period of of time where there is some established monetary order like a new world order the world order that we're living in is kind of like the the post-breton woods post World War II new orders set up in like the 1940s in the late 1940s and then you had this era of prosperity and you had debt cycle and then a big wealth Gap and debt burst that's kind of the peak on the other side of that you get printing money and credit revolutions and Wars a lot of political instability debt and then political restructuring and then New World Order and then it then it plays again the shorter term cycles that you're talking about you know dalio describes that well these shorter term Cycles kind of just oscillate around this uh long-term debt cycle and so I I guess my first my question is do is this kind of the the rough uh mental model that you use for thinking about uh the long term and then like so how many more Cycles do we have many cycles do we have until this full debt cycle plays out and we have to go all the way back to the base layer and establish a new world order very good questions Ryan and yes I think along the same terms but I visualize this a little bit differently instead of this bell curve that you just saw showed from dalio as a long-term Trend I tend to think of growth and inflationary long-term trends and so they look like a straight line up with an angle of growth that really depends on at which point in the structural long-term cycle are you in and so this this was a very acute acutely sloping positively sloping long-term line in the 80s because structurally we're growing very strong and we discussed about demographics and productivity and now the slope of this curve is kind of flatlining very aggressively all over the world right and then around this line you have Cycles you have cycles that dictate the macro cycle we are in and those are interplaying with each other but they're really a separate thing one lasts roughly 12 to 18 months while the slope of these long-term lines actually changes maybe over a decade not earlier than that so right now I see the long term Trend basically for growth and inflation being nominal growth in general being pretty flat right and the cycle surround being now a downward cycle now the problem becomes when the long-term trending line for nominal growth becomes effectively flat and that's basically I think the road map is Japan for that so Japan had a very upward sloping curve good demographic good productivity until the 70s and then demographics started slowing down on productivity too and they started printing money and credit like there was no tomorrow and that was the real estate bubble in Japan in the late 80s beginning of the 90s when the Imperial Palace of Tokyo was worth more than California okay so just to give you an example of how much that bubble was was going fast now that Bubble Burst and what happened then you would expect right Ryan is that you go towards dalio's low end of that chart which is a restructuring of some sort you need to you add you need to have social unrest basically that leads to a restructuring of some sort have we had one in Japan not really we remain stuck in that printing money and credit kind of thing forever over and over again and it's been over 30 years that Japan has been in that situation if you think about that the U.S or Europe or not Japan for a bunch of reasons so there are also cultural things that come to play here where in Japan people are coming out of retirement and trying to work more hours to make sure that they can contribute to economic growth and I can't really imagine the us or Europe going towards the same um cultural cohesion kind of path right so the situation is much more culturally fragile in the in the western economies it's very hard to predict exactly when but social unrest I do agree with dalio there is one of the thing of one of the indicators that something is brewing under the surface where people are becoming tired of these iterations because we're talking about iterations we're trying to fix a slope that is becoming flat by iterating the same cycle all over and over again and as you correctly pointed out before sometimes it's a higher stop and a lower bottom which makes people very uncomfortable with this cycle in the first place and the wealth inequality makes them feeling not particularly rewarded by this cycle in the first place and so social unrest there have been plenty of episodes already happening I can take Europe as an example where at every um at every election you get a more extremist government being left or right you get anyway people voting for something new something that sounds a new promised land that will break this cycle so far we haven't reached the breaking point but the more you proceed ahead especially in Western economies where there is less cultural cohesion towards sacrificing its own good for the public good let's say maybe a bit like Japan does it makes situation more inherently fragile and it's hard to say exactly when but we are definitely working towards that that path ahead of us with social unrest I think being one of the most evident signals that that's already happening is this where kind of the probabilistic analysis comes in of like what's the probability that we get one more of these kind of Cycles before everything breaks and there's a big reset or two more or three more um that's probably impossible to say precisely in the way that you can more accurately predict the the shorter term Cycles but um it does seem like we are uh I don't know it's 10 p.m two hours till midnight kind of thing like the clock is ticking and it's getting later in this cycle would you say this and then also elf like how do we get out of it is there a way to actually transition peacefully or is this just not the way of of human beings there is no New World Order or nutrient or transition to something that doesn't exist that involves power because that's what we're talking about we're talking about transferring power from one source to another and there is no transmission of power that goes on in a very friendly way in history that I'm aware of right so that is by definition and the last comment I want to say is that there is one thing of the engine that suggests to me that we are relatively late in that kind of long-term cycle clock that is the fact that in order to make this cyclical boost boom and bust basically uh small Cycles within a long-term Trend you need credit to be cheaper at every iteration you need that to become accessible at cheaper rates to everybody at every iteration think about the housing market if salaries are not growing and you want the housing market to grow 10 a year the only way to do that is by making the new mortgage actually cheaper than the old one so you borrow the two percent was worth five hundred thousand if the next guy can borrow at zero percent all of a sudden that house is worth much more simply because you lowered borrowing rates not for any other reason salaries has haven't really changed right this iteration tends to stop when you go when you reach interest rates at zero percent so Japan hasn't been able to engineer this credit booms anymore because rates have been at zero forever so the next marginal buyer doesn't have more power he has exactly the same borrowing rate that the guy before him had and so house prices in Japan in real terms have grown by zero percent for basically 10 years so this wealth generation effect this cyclical credit boost uh Booms that we do become more difficult when interest rates are pinned and you can't really lower interest rates for the next borrower to feed these cyclical credit upswing now we have gone very close to that point in Europe and in the US and now we have a room where rates are are very high because we need to fight inflation I do expect fed funds right to be below one percent in 2024 which will make the new credit iteration the new credit uh new credit cycle marginally more difficult at every iteration until you reach a point where yeah you want to generate credit but rates are already zero percent where are you going to bring them which makes the new borrower less powerful on the margin let's say so so this cycle tends to become a bit less powerful than it was in the past and this might be a Breaking Point actually and if I'm right on that I think the next decade or two might prove to be more difficult to engineer with the same model than the last 40 years were well for another um I guess crypto utopian perspective is the potential and the promise of technology I mean we are big Believers obviously in the technology to drive Improvement um I remember reading uh listening to a podcast from Tyler Cohen who's an economist in the US and he wrote this book called stubborn attachments really makes the case that in order to have a peaceful Society um that exists or a democracy of any kind you actually need growth because if you have negative growth uh everything fractures people start talking about how to split the pie rather than grow the pie and you have political divide and you have division which leads to Wars the Civil kind or Wars or the other kind countries in the election of autocrats and everything that falls from that so growth is an imperative and as you look at kind of like the the true productivity levers when in sort of your your macro exploration how do we actually generate productivity in a world where we've got uh declining demographics for example I mean I some pockets of the world have better demographics you know Africa some Emerging Markets certainly so maybe there's hope there but uh in the in uh kind of the the fully emerged World Western democracies and such is our way out technology is that the only way we actually achieve positive real economic growth and is there a story there is there some hope that you see in the numbers from this yeah so there are two ways one would be uh a 2022 industrial revolution of some sort where instead of Industrial Revolution you basically have a new discovery that all of a sudden changes the the productivity slope completely like like it was for the Industrial Revolution for example and the invention of the motor back then now the today I mean what's the probability of that I don't know it's a one-off event very low probability high impact event that we have a discovery of some sort that boosts productivity all of a sudden the other way to boost productivity growth over time is to make sure that technology permeates as many sectors of the economy as possible and today the economy is service based for roughly 70 percent of our output which means that the technology has most likely already permeated a lot of the services sector I mean look at us you guys are in the US I'm in Europe we're having a chat over I don't know whatever Riverside we're using but any any 1080p high def Fidelity yeah it feels like you're sitting right across from yeah there you go so that kind of Technology one might argue has already decently permeated the service sector not all the service sector but to a certain extent yes which also when I hear that technology is going to increase productivity I'm like where is the marginal gain going to come from you will be increasing your productivity yes you will every year productivity in the US Grows by roughly one percent more or less maybe a bit more if you want a productivity boost that more than offsets the population decline the demographics headwinds we've ever had of us we need some sort of one-off boost which might happen but I find that to be a low probability event high impact event that is very very hard to predict Alpha is the internet such uh you talked about the Industrial Revolution which is beyond the obviously the um the age here A Time range of anyone listening but how about the internet that is a major innovation did that show up in the numbers of increasing productivity it could it could especially if it would unlock some potential that is for sure um yeah unfortunately very under topped and underused especially in certain parts of the world that add not much access to productive internet over the last decade so that could be actually one way to untap some some productivity growth which haven't been there I only wonder whether those will be systematically important to offset the basically certain demographic edwins that we have ahead of us if I look at labor force growth over the next 20 years most western economies and China included by the way who left their population their working population decline so the pie when it comes to people contributing to economic growth that pie actually is getting smaller so we not only need productivity but we need fast productivity to more than offset that working population drop and that's going to be quite a hard task I think lots of headwinds ahead for us elf uh but I think there is hope while we remain uh building and while we have these open conversations about these these topics and stay educated I mean in previous events like this throughout history uh very hard to find someone as knowledgeable as yourself to actually talk about these issues so it's a big step in our ability to actually keep ahead and be educated on topics like these now if I want to thank you for making some time for us today I guess do you have any closing thoughts for bankless listeners anything you'd summarize for us yes I would say macro is important for investors in all asset classes and 2022 has proved to be exactly a very clear example of that and macro might sound scary I know that I understand that it's full of Jurgen it's very complex but it's beautiful you need to get your hands dirty into monetary mechanics how money Works how economies interact with each other and understanding macro is an exercise of basically trying to put together an a never-ending puzzle it's always a discovery it's a learning Journey effectively that will make you a smarter investor whatever as a class you're involved in including digital assets I think macro is so important and has been so underrated for so many years I'm happy to a certain extent that this environment has been so macro volatile that voices like mine but not only mine there are plenty of good guys out there and girls are now getting to share some of the knowledge that I have or we have accumulated when especially me working in the institutional setup having the chance to talk to prime minister Central Bankers understanding their thinking talking to hedge funds being a portfolio manager myself I encourage every bankless listener to try and get themselves more into macro because it's um it's it's the place to be to understand really what's going on and getting an edge also in the digital asset space 100 agree I think bankless listeners you got to add macro to your portfolio of skills in the space and I'll thank you for simplifying some of these contexts for us today we appreciate you it's been my pleasure to be here thank you guys some action items for you Bangla station number one you gotta check out macro elf's blog that's at the macrocompass.substack.com we'll also include a few
