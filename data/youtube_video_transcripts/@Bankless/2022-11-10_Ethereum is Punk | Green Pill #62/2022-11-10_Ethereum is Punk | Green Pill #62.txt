foreign [Music] ation how you doing this is the third episode in a three-part series that we are doing about cypherpunk solar Punk lunar Punk and Tara Punk which one of these things is web3 which one of these things is ethereum which one of these things are other blockchain networks is uh are the networks that we're building and the world they're going to create a more solar Punk world is it a more lunar Punk world is it a more Terra Punk world is it a more Cypher Punk World um this episode I'm uh I'm about to show you a talk that I gave at Devcon this year which basically tries to summarize all of the different types of punk that web3 is and try to create a pluralism of of of different Punk Styles so basically I think that ethereum is solar Punk ethereum is Cypher Punk ethereum is lunar Punk ethereum is terrapunk ethereum is a mirror that allows us to project our values upon it and build systems that reflect our values and so trying to integrate a few of these methodologies in the Devcon talk and and this is the end of a three-part Series in which we are talking about the different types of punk that ethereum is so um I think that this this talk that I gave at Devcon is kind of the perfect Capstone to the series that we've done on solar Punk lunar Punk Cypher Punk and and terapunk and I think you'll enjoy it so without further Ado I'll give you my Devcon talk from this year 2022 ethereum is punk enjoy [Music] foreign the title of my talk is ethereum is punk and I think the first category of punk that ethereum is is safer Punk so basically a cipher Punk is anyone who is advocating for strong privacy and cryptography and especially sovereignty in their digital systems and this serves as a route to social and political change decentralizing power into the hands of the individual ethereum is cypherpunk and if you want to know about the roots of the cypherpunk movement you can read the cypherpunk manifesto which is a canonical piece of text from Eric Hughes is a really very prescient considering it was written in the 90s the second category of punk that I think is really interesting and has only really developed over the last couple years is this idea that ethereum is solar Punk so solar punk I think is our alternative to doomerism in a world with Rising coordination failures like climate change Rising autocracy misinformation breakdown of the international order we now have a transparent immutable programmable and Global structure for coordinating we just need that key that unlocks the ability to build new institutions Humanity coordinating at web scale and that is how ethereum makes becomes solar Punk so if we want to make ethereum good for the world first we have to do no harm and I'm really proud of the merge and the fact that the network is nearly carbon neutral I think we have a little bit of work to do to get rid of the rid of the scams on the network but from there we can use this programmable substrate to build better coordination hyperstructures that can do things like track carbon credits and start to solve climate change but also can track impact on any other Vector so ethereum is a coordination substrate that it gives us the ability to coordinate at web scale and a lot of these problems can be framed as coordination failures I also recommend that you read the solar Punk Manifesto this one's not nearly as influential as the cypherpunk manifesto but uh there's a but there's a few different solar Punk manifestos basically solar Punk is a movement in speculative fiction that imagines what the world would look like if we solved our contemporary problems around sustainability and coordination failure so solar Punk is an art movement that envisions how the humanity might look if we've succeeded in solving our major contemporary problems with with coordination with an emphasis on sustainability and things like climate change cipherpunk is the uh the value system of sovereignty and privacy and there's a blending of the two that has really been developing a lot over the last couple years so ethereum is punk ethereum is solar Punk ethereum is cypherpunk and since these things are not mutually exclusive ethereum is also lunar Punk so lunar Punk is regarded as The Sibling aesthetic of the solar Punk aesthetic uh has more Universal properties such as like with witchcraft futuristic design nature renewable energy and you can kind of think of like uh it being solar Punk with an emphasis on sovereignty and privacy or cipherpunk but with an emphasis on solving coordination failures a middle ground between the two ethereum is lunar Punk and I would really encourage you if you're looking for a canonical piece on lunar Punk to check out this video Lunar punk in the dark side of the cycle that went viral about a month ago I think that lunar Punk is good because it's solving coordination failures and it's blending our safer Punk values in our lunar Punk values there's another interesting alt of punk that I I think that many of the room haven't heard of I only know about it because I get tagged in every Twitter conversation about this stuff um and it's called terrapunk so basically the idea behind terrapunk is uh is taking solar Punk and looking at the art and realizing that there's not a lot of humans in it and uh and basically if you look at solar Punk and you assume that we're going to solve our contemporary problems with coordination with it then you're going to uh then are we going to do that in an accelerationist way where Humanity continues to scale along with our economies or are we going to do it in a way that you assumes that 90 of humans aren't there and so I don't necessarily agree with this interpretation of solar Punk but I do think that terrapunk as a way of expressing solar Punk but with a more like high growth High human way of doing solar solar Punk is kind of interesting um I think that what I get from all of these different variants of punk and what I get back from the tweets that I that I sent out is that ethereum is a mirror and what we build on ethereum is an expression of the programming capabilities of ethereum but also the mirror of their values looking back at us through these systems so ethereum is all of these things ethereum is a coordination technology and it's all coordination all of our human systems and meeting our shared needs involve the coordination between people in these systems ethereum is a shelling point for the hopeful a transparent immutable programmable Global substrate for finance and coordination and since we can program our values into our money ethereum is going to be a shelling point for people who are creating new coordination systems using web3 we can build new coordination mechanisms that leverage collective intelligence to solve some of Humanity's most pressing coordination problems through my work at git coin which leverages quadratic funding we have become an uh Aqueduct for funding within the space and we do three million dollars worth of funding to the communities in the web3 ecosystem using the magic coordination technology that is ethereum and also the quadratic funding mechanism that distributes value to communities so far Bitcoin has delivered 69 million dollars worth of funding to our digital public goods this graph is an expression of the community's preferences for what they're funding so every Edge in the network is a transaction and every node is a grant or a user and this is a mesh network of the preferences of the ethereum community and which public goods they care about so we're building coordination Technologies to fund the public goods that we're that we care about our vision at git coin is to hopefully take ourselves to the quadratic lands a place where we've Rewritten the laws of economic gravity to support public goods and prevent coordination failures and to do it in a privacy preserving way ethereum is a mirror that reflects back to us our values and this is our vision of where we want to go you can kind of think of how much we're able to realize our values as a heuristic function in a fitness landscape and we're executing the search space asynchronously and all together of finding the global Maxima of how much we can realize our Collective value realization using collective intelligence to allocate our Commons resources we were building hyperstructures institutions in The Ether that are able to meet our shared needs and um and are deployed on Smart contract technology and the sum of all of the hyperstructures out there are they form a meta hyperstructure which is a a set of hyperstructures that all interoperate with each other in a modular way and help us to realize our shared values so what I'm saying is ethereum is cypherpunk ethereum is solar Punk ethereum is lunar Punk ethereum is also Terra Punk we are the ones who we've been waiting for regardless of whether whether of these Visions you believe in so let's coordinate and let's build the world that we want thank you [Music]
