i think a lot of these stable coins will probably look something like fractional uh algorithmic like frax's model the question will be like what collateral ratio right like well is it something that's very conservative fractional like 85 86 percent or like right now tara is moving upwards a little bit i think there's 10 to 20 percent btc let's be real like both fracture right now and uh maker have exposure to usdc right and so maker has like 60 57 or something like that the reason that's there is because it's really hard to keep an exchange rate to a dollar even if you have two dollars of other stuff but we actually are doing a lot of stuff to lower usdc exposure in fact don't quote me on it right now on the spot but i think we have significantly less usdc exposure than than die this is really cool decentralization maxi and me likes the on chain words yeah same here i might be getting frax pill right now
