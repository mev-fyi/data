all three of us here have a pretty good level of confidence that eventually Society will ultimately become coordinated around crypto protocols that future state of the world will align with the values that I see embedded into these things so it's a little bit of just like a waiting game for adoption to slowly win out and the nice thing David is because it's opt-in we only get that adoption if we deserve it right people have to choose crypto yeah yep like that that's what makes this a noble cause is that none of it is based on coercion no one holds Bitcoin who doesn't want to hold Bitcoin it is not forced on any person they opt into it and they can opt out just as easily at any time if it doesn't further their interest they can leave that's what's so cool about it and that's what puts it in stark contrast to Fiat if your idea is so good that you have to force people to use it that might be an indication that it's not that great and crypto never has that it has to win every single user
