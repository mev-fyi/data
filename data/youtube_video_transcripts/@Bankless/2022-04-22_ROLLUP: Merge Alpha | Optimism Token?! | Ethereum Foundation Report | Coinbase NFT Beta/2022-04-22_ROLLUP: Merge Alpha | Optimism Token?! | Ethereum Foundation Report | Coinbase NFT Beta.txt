all we know is this this space is going up crypto bitcoin eth they are going up and to the right over the long term time horizon bankless nation it is the third week of april david is in amsterdam i'm in the u.s uh and we are getting ready to present you with the weekly roll up david how are you doing man how's amsterdam going ah dude amsterdam is absolutely man majestic uh something that has complete consensus with everyone here is that amsterdam is a great city uh it's so walkable it's so pretty the the weather is beautiful uh sun is out but it's cold and crisp there's canals i went on a boat ride yesterday it was also 4 20 in amsterdam yesterday so uh a lot of some people got up to some shenanigans that's like the 420 capital of the world too right that's exactly right yeah that's cool man uh so but what were you there for it's like a crypto conference right dev connect oh yeah maybe that's relevant devconnect yeah so this is an ethereum and the ef's uh basically what they did really genius model is they hired uh they rented out the uh convention center in the middle of the city uh and it's now just a co-working space and so the everyone who signed up can just co-work there so i've just been hanging out there and that's all that they did on theme with a modular structure all the ef did was was rent out this center space for us to converge upon and then many many many other entities made other uh like short-term like day-long panels or day-long talks or day-long events uh so there's the shelling point from kevin owaki i was at obafest from colin myers there was also uh what is it trust x where i had a uh i was on a panel with uh some gigabrains danny ryan preston van loon dank rad uh and so it's just like everyone is attending their own uh conference their own day of talk so it's kind of like an unconference right where everyone sort of just you know creates their own event and brings their piece to the party uh so um is this like a mini dev con then would you say i'd say so yeah yeah it's it's it's a it's something brand new um all of the core ethereum researchers like the client researchers they all got into a room and pow-wowed uh and so like actually made some progress uh and that is actually the big theme i would say of this particular uh event where like people are busy like people are getting work done uh and so like it's not like the it's not like nft nyc or it's not like uh like eat denver which was more of like a festival like we're here building we're here to build right and you can actually see that in some of the nightlife where people are going out to parties like like 10 p.m but then the parties kind of shut down between midnight and 1 p.m because people got stuff to do the next day builder culture badass that's awesome well uh we'll talk more about that because i want to hear if you've got any updates on like ethereum research like when merged david can you be the when merged guys but of course i will tell you what people have been saying about them towards the end of the show that was i actually met justin drake for the first time and so i got a beer with justin drake and uh he was just like lovely to hang out with and of course we talked about the merge um so more on that at the end of the show okay merge alpha we'll see what uh drake thinks about the merge of course we've got some other topics of the week because crypto can't stop won't stop sneak peek into the coinbase nft platform launch we have the beta we have our hands on a copy i've given it a trial run i want to hear what you think about it too david we'll go through that also north korea apparently was the attacker of the ronin side chain that massive 600 million dollar plus exploit that was actually north korea that's what the us government is saying so what does that mean we are now nation state attacked blockchains after a fashion also arthur hayes bit mac's ceo founder thinks we're headed for a bear i think we have to talk about that in the market section see if he's right see what the bear case is for crypto right now uh andre cronier also he's a d5 developer of course he had some spicy takes this week david about regulation in d5 it seems to be the anti-andre move and he wants to incorporate some regulation and defuse we're gonna weigh in on that and there were also some spicy takes about his spicy takes a lot of people called called some bs on andre cronie's take uh uh article very short article so that was uh very hot in the twitter sphere this week so we're going to talk about all of those things uh one thing talking about conferences talking about dev connect and a builder conference another builder conference that you absolutely should attend must attend is graft day this is happening in san francisco it's going to be a four-day event june 2nd through the 5th day one is the talks right that's where you listen you learn you get educated but the remaining three days of this four-day conference it's all it's all pure hackathon which is amazing for builders so if you are in a builder if you are a builder you want to get into the web 3 space like the graph protocol is basically indexing everything about the metaverse everything about crypto they are like a data layer for this whole universe web3 universe that we have delved into so it's a fantastic place to meet other builders to actually participate in the hackathon earn bounties for yourself uh and get into the space maybe you're looking for a career in the space this would be the event to attend look at these uh speakers david it's stacked it's stacked yeah cammie russo is going to be there rhys lindmark one of my personal heroes is there ava baylen uh yeah it's check out the lineup and in the talks i'm sure gonna be fantastic and of course if you're a hacker they have money for you that's what a hackathon does and so if you want to compete for some money and you are a hacker who wants to hack on things sign up to join the hackathon go get your tickets now if you use the the code in the bankless show notes there is a 50 discount for you as well um all right speaking of discounts are we are we discounted on bitcoin and eth this week let's start with the bitcoin charts as we get to markets what what's bitcoin looking like oh we are certainly not discounted this week ryan we started the week at 39 700 just below that 40 000 number which we do not want to be below at and we are currently above that number at forty two thousand six hundred and forty dollars up about seven percent on the week amazing look man uh last week i said i was bullish i didn't exactly know why other than like a guy you're claiming victory right i'm not look man yeah i'm claiming victory i was right from last week to this week i would never claim uh when i'm wrong but when i'm right i'm happy to claim that david i'm short-term price action but seriously guys don't listen to me on anything short term price related all we know is this the space is going up crypto bitcoin eth they are going up and to the right over the long term time horizons speaking of up and to the right ryan ether started last week at three thousand dollars it hit a low of twenty 2 900 we do not like that 2 900 number we want to be above that 3 000 number of which we are currently clocking in at 3 150 overall up 4.5 on the week so bitcoin takes a week for this week is bitcoin this week look bitcoin outperformed eat this week it hasn't done that for a while and that reflects in the bitcoin ratio that's got to be down this week yeah down about a percent and a half down to 0.074 um down a little bit down a little bit are people getting bitcoin bullish off of bitcoin miami do you think or why do you think why do you think this happened we just can't read too much into this data yeah one part noise let's not read into it too much but also one part if we are bullish like it is traditional to let bitcoin go first as is tradition after you after after you let's take a look at the total uh crypto market cap and can compare bitcoin and youth to that so looks like we are up on the week for total crypto market cap but not by a ton what's that up on the up five percent brother 1.96 trillion last week to 2.07 trillion this week but bitcoin outperformed total bitcoin performed yeah it hasn't done that in old old man bitcoin yeah but outperformed the the market by like three percent and ether underperformed the market by point five percent oh proud of you bitcoin well done yeah that's right we'll see we'll track it next week i i make no more predictions i'm just uh you know but one thing to watch i think in the backdrop of this crab market whether are we in bold territory are we in bear territory we're kind of somewhere in between is the dxy which is the dollar index and the dollar's been breaking out man so this is kind of weird it's like when when we say breaking out it's appreciating right relative to other fiat uh coins cryptocurrency strength yes dollar strength relative to other fiat not not relative to crypto of course and it's up like look at this chart man it's up to like above any level since uh since covid and people are like wondering maybe why does the dollar go up when we are uh being faced with eight and a half percent inflation uh just like the dollar went up in value in the early days of of covid if you recall and i think the reason for this largely is the dollar is still a flight to safety asset and people aren't certain they don't know what the fed is going to do they don't know how that's going to affect other asset classes and so what do they do temporarily they retreat into the dollar for a while wait for other assets to fall and then redeploy their dollars into those assets it's kind of like what you know traders do sometimes you and i might do this if we're rebalancing we might um rebalance back into stable coins out of crypto for a period of time wait things out and then buy lower what are your thoughts on this well okay so the general correlation is that as the dxy as the dixie they call it goes up crypto is correlated inversely correlated so crypto goes down crypto didn't go down too much i mean it's gone down since like january or so as the dxy is gone not like covid the other time the dollar was on a terror like crypto died yes yeah what i'm saying ryan and maybe i'm just spinning it to talk my own books but when i see the dollar going up i just see more for it to fall so david not bullish on the dollar long run um no no but this is kind of the the big question arthur hayes the ceo of bitmex who is a you know big crypto trader obviously monitors these things from a macro perspective he made the case that a crypto correction is uh incoming this is a he said crash ryan he's gonna crash in his article did he i'm gonna say i'm gonna go search the word crash yeah no it was yeah it's a crash well no he said that nope yeah crypto crash helmet yeah put on your crypto crash okay colorful language uh love arthur um you know in in his predictions and basically his rationale was crypto is correlated with tech stocks he gives all these examples of of how crypto is correlated with tech stops stocks lots of charts tech stops stocks are going down right it's like do you see netflix this week by the way big lost 50 billion dollars right netflix subscriptions are down so tech stocks going down as a result of the fed policy tightening and so what does that mean yeah arthur is just putting one in one together and he's just like well that equals crypto is also going down crypto is also classified as a risk on asset just like tech stocks so if tech stocks are going down of course crypto has to follow it and uh put on your crypto crash helmet is what he's saying here that's the bear case yeah it also got way more nuanced nuance than that though he also talked about the central bank of japan and the japanese equities market as like a canary in the coal mine as well um some really big brain finance economy stuff that i'm not capable of reiterating so if you want to learn more uh just read the article that's in the show notes but the summary tl dr is that he will he believes that bitcoin and ether are crashing to the low low prices of thirty thousand dollar bitcoin and twenty five hundred dollar ether which ryan like i'm kind of yeah that's not a confused helmet man we saw that we've saw that this year right yeah and like yeah like that's fine like i also need a helmet for that that's just like okay you need a bid for that yeah did you say a bib bid oh okay okay i think like a bib like you're drooling or something i don't know but okay i could say that too yeah yeah so i don't know you know the interesting um i guess opposite case is coming out on monday's podcast with dan moorhead so dan moorhead does not think that crypto will remain correlated with tech stocks and if you want to hear why listen to him he is the cio um co-founder of pantera capital and a lot of good macro takes here so you can see the bear case put out by arthur and kind of the bull case but even arthur is not very bearish when you like boil it down to pricing so yeah that that's just a bad week perhaps a really bad week but that's not that's not like blood in the streets level no way that's not crash helmet level for sure let's put on your bibs guys that's all you need um optimism this is fun yeah okay so this is the talk of the town right now at devconnect everyone is talking about optimism uh and we've got six indications that optimism is interested in a token uh and so this is the first interesting or imminent interest of deploying a token yeah perhaps more of the latter ryan okay uh and so there there there's some breadcrumbs being trailed perhaps and and everyone at devconnect is like oh yeah those those those are big breadcrumbs so here's the first one uh on april 19th a few days ago optimism tweets out optimism's story thus far by the numbers saved 1.1 billion dollars in gas fees for its users onboarded 30 300 000 unique ethereum addresses secured 900 million dollars in value and facilitated 17.4 billion dollars of transaction volume and also generated two 24.5 million dollars in revenue that revenue is impressive that's a great revenue number yeah uh 24.5 million dollars from the the sequencing of the transactions these are how rollups make their money and then they finish this off with a new chapter is near let's take a minute to reflect on the path thus far a new chapter is near so ryan they're talking a lot about financial chapters like money numbers and then they say new chapter is near what could a new chapter be that's clue number one but you said you had six six oh yes what's this what am i looking at these uh this is uh this is the uh red dot there's this is a red dot emoji there's like some dot emojis with the underscore with a red dot emoji and this is generally a a meme that many communities have uh and this is now what optimism tweeted out as like okay here's here's our community but all the other communities ryan have tokens that do this optimism would be the first community to do this that doesn't have a token hmm that's kind of playful okay clearly very playful very community generation wait this what is this i have no clue what this is but like everyone is like the optimism team their sense of humor is very indie and and kind of uh surreal i would say um absurdist humor i would say and so for the listeners this is a cat with its paw on a bunch of watermelon but the watermelon are all red and they're titled oops are they plush toys yeah maybe they're plexus um they look like watermelon uh but like they're all circles right they're all like token-ish uh and so with op written on them and i guess it's kind of absurdist humor but like everyone's like i don't know how or why this makes me think that there's a token but it does clue number three all right what's number four uh okay this one's a little bit more explicit ryan kind of blatant yeah this is territory of a leak yeah coinbase shows price page for optimism suggesting a token could be on the way this might have been an accident by coinbase but they added a token page under the title of optimism uh and so this is all happening all at the same time thank you internet sleuths friend covering that so is that number four that's number four that's number four and number five is that i'm at devconnect and everyone is talking about it uh and so that's the other thing that's you're talking explicitly about a token everyone's talking about oh yeah have you seen the the hints that optimism is leaving on the table uh i was listening to a panel where all the layer twos were uh talking about layer two stuff uh hosted by anthony cesano i saw my best friend he was great gave him a big hug and then he hosted a panel and i watched that uh and of course his final token his final question is when token as a meme like when token you don't have to answer that but then ben jones from from optimism immediately grabs the mic and he goes all information about this well it's viewable on our public website uh there's no information on there but like yeah the exuberance of grabbing the mic to say that i thought was interesting so that's number five ryan and number six are you ready for number six are you watching you know i'm ready but i just want to interject one thing so like optimism releasing a token to me kind of kicks off layer two summer layer two twenty-two that we've been saying right the big thing they've got the traction they've got the the value they're generating the revenue the next thing layer twos need is a token to accelerate all of this so with that what is the sixth clue the sixth clue ryan is just where is this gonna straight up ask them on the stadium nation on tuesday they're coming on tuesday because that is when they are scheduled for so optimism is coming on the state of the nation on tuesday and we are just going to ask them what their plans are with the token well uh hopefully you were a user of optimism in the past you probably saw them in our airdrop guide that we published on bankless back in october and you know we'll we'll see we'll see what happens we'll see if this is imminent it would be very interesting if they were one of the first major layer twos besides like polygon and that sort of thing to release a token i think that's a great news for retail who previously hasn't had exposure to to many layer two options investing options and there is a spicy take that in addition to we'll talk about this later in the take section but uh in addition to l two two two coming uh l two two two right is going to be spicy you know how how spicy the alt layer one wars were yeah there two ones are gonna be the same thing brother you're talking about like layer twos against layer twos yep yeah why do the kids have to fight david kids are gonna have to fight ryan come on i don't know like i just we're all on team ethereum are we not yeah this is true we're all on team ethereum but you know you got to compete for the users there's only so many users and so much tvl to go around well i want to talk to you more about that later but uh let's keep moving for now so in other news ust that's the tara stablecoin just became crypto's third largest so they'd just overtaken binance usd so it's probably just tether and uh usdc leading and then and then ust now go stablecoin enters number third what do you think about this yeah um i mean you gotta gotta do the tip of the hat to the growth strategy of tara uh the scalable blockchain scalable uh uh stablecoin uh when you add those two scalable things together like you get a bunch of scale uh and so tip of the hat to ust to becoming toca sable coin number three don't screw it up guys please don't screw it up please don't screw it up uh share of the nft market this is fantastic from andrew steinwald who is a nft investor saw this a long time coming in fact predicted nft season long before on a bankless podcast long before it came anyway put together a fantastic report through through his crypto fund his nft fund on total sales volume of nfts and it's divided into four categories art collectibles gaming and the metaverse as a percentage of dollars and what's interesting about this chart david as you can see kind of the squiggly lines how um the different categories ebb and flow so we had a massive sort of art season at first and these would be probably one of ones uh in you know 2020 2022 and that has kind of teamed down as a percentage of market and what's really it's going to be our block season right like that's yeah that's good i think something season yeah now we got collectible as a big category in metaverse anyway it's interesting to track these different categories of nfts over time because even within the nft sector some categories of nfts can be bullish and others can be kind of bearish and new ones are emerging all of the time some other broad metrics uh i think are pretty useful for you guys if you want a chart of what the nft market share looks like but click on the second graph yeah yeah i'll just blow this up here oh okay it doesn't doesn't actually yeah look at that man so from it start really everything nft related started kicking off it looks like in june of 2021 and that like total sales volume the volume of nft sales has just had a very strong floor ever since then like huge spike in like august of 2021 but ever since then like nft volume it looks like it's here to stay forever here it is uh we're at uh almost 10 billion in total nft sales volume from the beginning of this year that's just the beginning of this year so there's hope there's hope for your underwater nft guys like there's still volume out there thank you you tell me turtles are still gonna be a thing david turtles might still be a thing uh you know david we're gonna talk about some more things that could be bullish for the nft sector in particular coinbase they just released their nft platform but before we do we

only for a subset of users this is the coinbase blog gm coinbase nft is now in beta david i know you've been super busy this week have you had a chance to take a look at this or absolutely not you have an invite though so did somebody have an invite yeah coinbase the coinbase nft platform invited me but i was like i don't have time for this yeah i saw uh they dm me from the coinbase and they said here's an invite code and i was like what is this a scam and it looks like it's legit from coinbase and uh turns out i got your trusty click yeah um i have an invite to the beta platform this is kind of what it looks like so if you guys are viewing this on youtube you can sort of see and what was interesting about this and this is from our conversation with brian armstrong is how social networky it actually is right so look at this this looks like a timeline you might find on a social network see this timeline accounts to follow which makes sense because the nft ecosystem moves forward in time very very quickly right like the fads move very quickly so it makes sense for a timeline structure to be that way well it has an account like you can go follow brian armstrong brian the new tom of the coinbase nfc platform who's he following he's not following me yet brian armstrong please follow but he's got a thousand followers right and you can see what's in his wallet um i could actually like see everything in my wallet i'm not logged in at the moment and then of course there's the openc shop capability right so you can actually start to buy some of these things um i don't know man look mark zuckerberg talking about the metaverse right last week we talked about his plan was to do a 50 commission on any nft sale do you think he sees this and is like in his pants right now you think he's concerned about that tax is real then he has to like how that's completely unjustifiable anyways yes yes yes is your answer to that yeah it's just uh look coinbase is is becoming more of a social media type brand with this play and well i like it personally i like it i think there's a lot of potential here it's fairly simple right now but i'm excited to see it uh expand so this is in beta now it'll go generally available i'm sure in the kind of the weeks to come of course coinbase is attending the commission permissionless conference and their vps over this are going to talk more about it so if you're attending that you can you can get the scoop but also it did something to uh 0x token price david what's that about yeah so 0x the 0x network is a relaying network for messages about trades uh and so they said they the coinbase mt platform platform announced that they are using the xerox network to facilitate trades uh and as a result the xerox token is up thirty percent so congratulations to the e zero x uh network the zero x's dow and zero xerox token holders um they claim the very strong gas efficiency efficiency and also cross-chain messaging for cross-train chain sales which i think is i don't know how that would work because you can't like buy an ethereum nft on solana but maybe you can pay for an ethereum nft and get your ethereum nft using solana tokens or something like that yeah this is just kind of going multi-chain like being able to view it yeah but i'm not sure how the trading works whether they're bridging from change of chain if that's what you're talking about but uh right now the coinbase marketplace nft marketplace is just um ethereum only so that's where they're starting but i'd imagine they'd expand to other chains as well so pretty cool launch we'll see we'll see how this goes hopefully this mainstream's more people into the nft world right there's like what 40 40 million or so maybe 50 million users yeah exactly so and they had a lot of interest for this too uh another thing that happened this week i guess in the releases section is the ethereum foundation finally released their financial transparency report what's the significance of this david yeah this has been long sought after by from the general ethereum community to ef tell us what your bags are uh the ef is a non-profit that got spun up at the very genesis of ethereum it had part of that genesis allocation of ether from the very beginning and they've been slowly selling that ether over time to fund stuff developer salaries things like devconnect and devcon for example but there hasn't really been too much transparency into the actual financials of the ef uh and largely the first like two years three plus years of the ef was very very chaotic and so like getting all the ducks in there almost went under water like they almost ruined the water yeah yeah right yeah but like things are really shaping up around the ef and then they finally release a report that describes what is actually in the ef treasury and it's a lot of money ryan i think it's over a billion dollars um and 80 yeah 1.61 billion dollars in ether uh excuse me 80 of that is in ether which is if you are curious that is point three percent of the total circulating supply of eth uh and also they hold 11 million dollars in other cryptocurrencies probably bitcoin because they uh took the ether like genesis sale the pre-sale in bitcoin so they've probably been holding some of that bitcoin for a really long time and then probably the rest is in dollars as well yeah i think it's pretty cool that's right so you said it's a lot 1.6 billion dollars is a lot of money 80 in ether but think about it from the perspective of total supply it's tiny it's so tiny it's 0.3 of all ether supply compare that to the other centralized bodies that are um creating clients on some of the other alternative layer ones that like own 10 15 15 20 yeah sometimes way more yeah sometimes way more massive amounts so this is actually a modest relatively modest amount good of course to see that they're holding it in eath i imagine they'll stake like you could basically create kind of a perpetual funding for something like the ef if you just take a large portion say a billion dollars of your eth you stake you generate a four or five percent return and then you kind of fund the protocol for what it needs i wonder if that's what the plan is long long-term yeah we instead of having block rewards funding which is extremely contentious uh but also very very sustainable like proof-of-stake yields from a billion dollars that can fund a lot of salaries for a large amount of time yeah and that's a billion dollars at today's eth price right when he hits 10k he gets 20k when he hits the 30k as it's going to be fulfills it's manifest destiny that'll be a lot more so uh that's good and look they're spending about 48 million dollars per year right now so they do have a fairly high burn there's a breakdown of that too good to see some additional transparency here it's it's bullish um david another release this week we're still on the releases an nft product from index co-op it's called jpeg jpg what is this yeah it's designed to provide liquid access to the top nft collections through a single index token uh and so in order to be included in this new jpeg index a token must be a claim on or be collateralized by or provide currency for nfts basically it's not an index with nfts inside of them it's an index with erc20 tokens that are related to nfts so there's fractionalized crypto punks for example there's the jenny dao there's the socks token for the unisox there's also the dog currency out of the doge ecosystem from pleaser dow and a few others as as well basically it's a if you are a token that has financialized nfts in some way this is an index for that cool i'm excited to see that grow with some other financialized erc20 assets as well also volt rolled out this week this is like a cpi-adjusted stable coin designed by like the tribe ecosystem the creators of fey to me when i read this david it seems sort of similar to what we were talking about with sam which is um fraxes cpi ingested stablecoin which is basically like inflation is eight and a half percent per year you can hold your money in stable coin dollars but why not create something new and create some sort of stable coin that doesn't degrade at the rate of inflation so it keeps up with cpis you could hold it in this asset and uh not get that 5 8.5 inflation rate they do that with an on-chain oracle that that measures uh cpi what do you think about this yeah i'm actually kind of skeptical about these whole cpi adjusted stable coins um i guess they're good for holding but when you break the peg of the dollar you lose the dollar standard right and one of the reasons why stable coins have so much liquidity is because they're all interchangeable with each other dye tether usd usdc and there's a lot of liquidity there yeah use like the unit of account right right breaking the unit of account loses a lot of network effects uh and so like can this thing be super liquid like tbd i could totally understand like if you are interested in just holding your savings in dollars then this would be a good thing to hold it in but then are you going to be able to yield farm with this thing as much as you can with dollars in d5 like kind of unsure about that one uh and so i i'm a little bit skeptical as to the adoption of this thing yeah it's like a different standard it yeah one thing i'll say it's super cool that crypto can produce something like this because this is not available in like the quote-unquote tradify real world but uh yeah i i kind of agree with you like my my my idea about like you know storing wealth is i'll store some in dollars right but then i want to store everything else in like eth i don't want this mid in between thing that is just protecting me from uh cpi inflation i'd rather just have some state some dollars over here and then eath over here that's providing the protection and kind of the the middle uh part of the barbell i just don't really care too much about but we'll see that's just me i mean inflation was 8.5 percent reported like 10 percent plus actual again dan moorhead podcast gonna be a great one uh and so like i guess if you can't yield farm more than that then it makes sense um but like you can you'll farm you can get your yield from return it's pretty high um yeah so well it's gonna be a tug of war here yeah it's cool uh by the way look you mentioned the dan moorhead podcast that's coming up we just released the spring lineup for the bankless podcast let me tell you is this a banquet this is a bankless release we're fitness in the releases so uh read out what's coming what's common down the the pipe for bankless dan moorhead coming on monday but followed by steve aoki steve aoki the entrepreneur who's into nfts who also throws cake in the face of his fans uh he's coming we're recording him on wednesday ryan i bet you didn't know that steve aoki is known for throwing cake at people i didn't know that no yeah yeah he's known for that yeah uh jim o'shaughnessy he's coming on the podcast followed by raul paul and then kevin o'leary mr wonderful uh he's coming on we're gonna live stream with him uh getting the other half of the chart of the crypto shark tank um and then ryan i think this last one's so great mark andreessen and chris dixon mark andreessen comes back to comes to the podcast for the first time the andreessen of a16z and then chris dixon coming back to co-guest with him as well um yeah that's awesome man look andreessen doesn't do crypto podcast this might be his first one i'm super excited to talk to him okay they're stacked there are so few people left for the bankless podcast and those people are elon musk ray dalio and that's about it so yeah when he gets in he needs to buy his nft first so if you can get us access to ray dalio we really want ray dalio he needs to come on bank list uh and also elon musk elon musk will come eventually um but ray dalio is the one we're really what's actually on my list david is elizabeth warren i want to have that talk with with elizabeth yeah i bet you i bet you do things um all right let's go to raises man raises so the sandbox which is a metaverse platform they just geared up for another raise this is a four billion dollar evaluation they just raised 400 million dollars crazy what's this next one david framework ventures van spencer he was our first big episode on the podcast ever the bold case for defy they raised on 400 million dollar fund with a special focus on blockchain and gaming uh so congratulations to the team over at framework ventures i've met some of your guys uh here at devconnect yeah it's a really talented team super crypto native uh an indian crypto currency exchange called coin d uh cx just topped a two billion dollar valuation 130 million dollar funding interesting to see every one of these nation state geographies have their own sort of set of exchange uh players and uh india is certainly one of them so it's um onboarding more indians to crypto which is uh fantastic what's this next one yeah epns the ethereum push uh notification system service uh raised 10 million dollars at a valuation of 131 million dollars this is like push notifications for anything that's happening to your wallets in case like i don't know you get an airdrop you can get a ping on your phone uh 101 30 million evaluation congratulations guys that's cool uh speaking of mr wonderful coming on the podcast live streaming kevin o'leary uh his backed platform called wonderfuy just acquired coinberry for 38 million dollars coinberry is a canadian cryptocurrency exchange that's where kevin's from canada so it looks like he's uh wanting to um get in on the canadian market there with with crypto uh that's pretty cool as well david did you have any jobs talk this week at uh in amsterdam are there are people hiring the the joke was uh bartek uh

hiring it's just like this jobless is only going to get longer some people have their their snow dance when they want snow to happen they have their snow dance i have the i want bankless listeners to get a job dance join us join us uh let's talk about this news time um one of the big news items of the week was a meta mask hack exploit okay don't don't freak out it's not every metamask account of course but this is an interesting security hole so one metamask user just lost 655 thousand dollars worth of crypto a lot of these were nfts using metamask on mobile what happened well apparently if you have your settings set up to do this on your iphone metamask will actually upload metamask private keys to the icloud apple's cloud as a backup right to help restore metamask if you lose your phone or something a backup nice nice friendly backup well this user had his uh icloud account compromised and so some of those private keys were compromised and so i think this is sort of a psa this is what my public service announcement if you're using metamask on mobile if you have an android if you have an iphone in particular and you are uploading that your backups your private keys to icloud like don't do that anymore turn off that setting go check your phone right now uh we'll include a link in the show notes where you can find the exact setting to disable under profile icloud backups just don't back up your private key keep your private keys on your phone if you're using metamask in the in this setting name a worst duo private keys in the internet don't don't make a cloud yeah don't put them in the cloud guys um good private key management good reminder uh david there's another exploit this week i'm wondering if you talk about this and maybe we should start with the bean price chart because that's where the exploit was this token called bean it looks like it's up 100 but it's not it's not actually on the actual front page it's actually down very very big uh yeah so there was a exploit for to the tune of 80 million dollars 24 838 plus 36 million bean token uh all right what is bean it's a decentralized algorithmic stable stablecoin i think it's got uh reminiscent it was reminded me of empty set dollar a while ago uh when price goes above a dollar they create more of these tokens to bring the price back down and then when the price goes down below they attract new buyers by issuing credit uh and you know very risky very experimental uh seem to be going well if you like yeah look at that market cap market cap was going up and to the right really really fast uh and then it went to zero uh because of an exploit uh there's zero basically to zero uh and so the exploit was pretty interesting actually it was a flash loan governance attack that enabled the attacker to drain all of the money in the in the treasury i guess uh so there is a bip what i can imagine is a bean improvement proposal 18 was flash loan approved by a hacker and once that eip was merged on chain i think this is how this works uh that enabled this exploit to happen and then in that same transaction uh the attacker approved the governance proposal and then drained the and then drained the treasury and was going to all the funds 80 million i've never seen a chart like this david look at this man this is just falls off a cliff right this is what happens when an elgo stable coin gets hacked uh you go from a hundred million dollars in market cap all the way down to like five million in the space of like 24 hours like uh 96 97 loss boom yeah five million dollar market cap ryan is essentially zero right okay as well yeah and this this hack was interesting you know what i think we've been talking a lot about algorithmic stable coins uh recently and a lot of the concern about them is sort of de-pegging risk right if it's not backed there's a kind of a the run on the bank and then everyone tries to cash out there's none left liquidity and the price crashes right that's definitely one way an elga staple quinn could could die in a hurry but the other way is it just gets hacked this was an economic exploit so issues with a smart contract code essentially led to some flaws which allowed the flash loan governance attack and this also kills the algo stable coin so a lot of risks when we're talking about uh these types of stable coins yeah especially when like algo stable coins are inherently faith-based right anything under-collateralized it's a remaining remainder remainder collateralization is therefore faith and this one had zero collateral uh and so it was all faith and so if once the economic incentives break uh and then and it goes into faith and if there's not enough faith there to back it up because it just got exploited it just goes to zero the bean community is still trying to resolve you know uh trying to come back from this i don't know if they'll be successful or or not certainly some of the other stable coins that have just evaporated never came back like empty set dollar basis cash they're all in the dustbin of history so we'll have to see reminding you that these algo stable coins in particular are incredibly risky and experimental uh david we said this in the intro north korea was actually responsible for last month's massive sidechain ronin theft the fbi is now confirming this what's the story here yeah um i actually don't know how we confirmed that it was north korea but this lazarus group which uh has been associated with north korea is apparently known discovered to be responsible for the the hack so north korea now owns 625 million dollars worth of eth i tweeted out during that hacks like hey if you steal like 600 million dollars from an exploit you have to pay taxes on that and it turns out in this case they don't because it's north korea wow uh and they're actually cycling a lot of this through tornado cash or some of it through tornado cash to try to try to wipe the slate clean that confuses me because like what does it matter they're in north korea they're not hiding from anyone then they can then they can change it like they can cycle it into i guess another asset and sort of cash cash out because right now you know the the east that they stole is uh is kind of blacklisted from a lot of exchanges from the rest of the world but the whole country is blacklisted ryan i don't know i i don't know you know what is interesting to me and this was not quite a this is more like a um a multi-sig attack where again someone like validators were keeping their uh private keys in the cloud which again like do not do this especially if you're a bridge or a side chain right so that that's the way it was hacked but it also reminds me of like something we talked about a long time ago during the earlier days of crypto is this concept of being um having sovereign security resistance so like the bitcoiner concept of one day the nation-states are going to come attack our blockchain and we have to be ready for that we have to be resilient against those forms of attack we're not exactly sure how they will do this but this is now kind of a nation-state operative group attacking crypto assets in after fashion attacking chains so we're at that point in history where blockchains are getting attacked by nation states and uh that's why security matters i think more than ever particularly at the base layer so somewhat interesting security is type we like security this is this is cool too maker is integrating stark net what is uh what's happening here yeah basically they are they are deploying multi-collateral dye they're deploying maker dow onto stark net natively and so that's that's the news so congratulations to makerdale 10x improvement in gas costs of course that is the big big carrot that these protocols have for moving to layer two uh david let's talk about this in nft news so punk6529 has just released something called om what is lm yeah om i actually don't know what om stands for my guess was open metaverse but the name actually isn't whatever that stands for isn't out or maybe it just means om om is a digital museum uh and so 6529 has a fantastic nft collection he's a collector of collectors and so he's building out this om museum to display his nfcs in like some sort of like it's also a digital land space and so there is it's kind of like i think a hub and spoke model where there are actually 10 museums out there and this is just the first one and there are going to be i think sales for the remaining amount of land people can come and check out all of the nfts in the gallery probably with some sort of like virtual reality uh but probably available on your computer as well uh and so uh all of his first uh the first district they were calling him districts was going to display 2000 nfts from different collections including uh including uh 6529s as well as some others uh board aviat club cryptopunks all the all the art blocks and then over time uh these different districts ten self-governing cities he describes them uh will be unveiled unveiled and slowly rolled out in what is being called the alpha mode version of this metaverse museum this is pretty stunning i love these visuals this looks great do you think this will catch on do you think like the future of nft museums is not physical going to a museum in person and seeing like a digital display but actually going to the metaverse and displaying nfts in somewhere like this i i certainly think there's room for both but i definitely think that the product market fit behind a digital nft museum i mean it's the same thing like so many more people see my crypto punk on my twitter avatar than they would if i displayed my crypto punk in my apartment although people do see that because it's in the background of my weekly rollups but still people see that on twitter more and so a digital metaverse a digital museum is gonna be much more accessible than a physical one do you know as cool as this is david it does also feel a little skeomorphic right because we're sort of replicating the museum this is the first phase of of crypto uh display where we're sort of replicating the museum experience but putting that in the in the digital world and i wonder how much more we'll unlock right it's kind of like the early early stages of the internet where we would just take a physical magazine we just upload that basically and then we found out no website design is much more fluid much more dynamic there are way better ways to display this content than just porting the print magazine format to to the digital world i wonder if we'll see that in the future as well yeah i think that's a good take but in order to get to the internet ryan you still had to start with putting a magazine on the internet you have to go through the skeuomorphic phase no matter what absolutely that is the model um this is cool warner music group just partnered with poep the poep practical protocol to mint shared memories as nfts we've talked about poep in the past this is now a record label partnering with poep to do that what do you think this means yeah i think they're just going to be integrate nfts in the same way everyone else loves nfts and they're very they're huge at conferences uh ryan i saw actually out of the poep team credit card sized credit cards i guess rfid chips right and so i can hand you my credit card and you can put your phone on it and then boom you can mint my nft or my my pillow i mean yeah yeah so like the cool thing is and say like i have all these stickers i have some of them here in this bag like this is the boomer phase of poeps where i've been handing out these stickers a qr code on the back yeah and then we'll throw like then they get the qr code and they can swap the sticker somewhere but then this one is just like a card like you hold in your credit card wallet and you can just like place it under somebody's phone and then boom into poep uh and so uh you know this mine is the you met david hoffman poe app uh there is uh with the with um warner music group uh the rapper kevin gates here's an example of how this is gonna get used kevin gates never heard of him um is slated to integrate poeps into his kaza tour making one available to fans who up who attend his upcoming show at red rocks you go to it you go to a concert and you get a poe app like right like that's that's perfect like i was there i was there like no no and you get these hardcore fans who i i went to ten i went to twenty i'm touring i'm i'm like basically going with this band all across the country all across the world i'm collecting these co-apps and then maybe on the other side of that now the creator has like an airdrop list a list yeah i want to see who your a thousand top fans are well it's people who have the most po apps right and so what do you do with that right super cool totally yeah it's uh use cases yeah they they sure seem to be and yet at the same time we do have these like top signals maybe some 2017 vibes in the nft world this is a an influencer shill price list and so people aren't aware there are a lot of nft influencers in the space and they actually get paid to promote things okay so like crazy be aware of this this is um this is for if you want an nft influencer to retweet your nft retweet something or do a shill tweet to their followers this is this is the price point for that um you can get lindsay lohan david how much is lindsay lohan tweet going forward to shill our nft a lindsay lohan tweet uh a shield tweet is twenty five thousand dollars a retweet is twenty thousand dollars and then you can get a package deal for two tweets plus one retweet for thirty five thousand dollars ryan so something else that's going on is compound the lending and borrowing protocol one of the the kickstarters of defy summer and the yield farming movement they might actually ditch yield farming no longer issue tokens to those supplying liquidity to the protocol and uh this comes i think on the back of uh down bad for comp token right like it's been bleeding relative to dollars but also bleeding relative to eth everything and well as all tokens have all d5 tokens have but particularly the ones that are giving a lot of generous yield to those that are farming them those that are basically providing liquidity to them because that acts as a a supply drain right so what are yield farming farmers doing they're taking their their tokens they're saying thank you very much and they're converting that to dollars or or uh ether bitcoin there's just selling it market sell so the holders of comp in the governance are saying hey this is not a sustainable strategy let's no longer do that and there's some governance proposals in the work to stop yield farming from the originators of the yield farming movement what do you think yeah it's nice to see one it's nice to see the comp governance actually doing something comp hasn't done anything in a long time my compound has just been the way that it is which is why people appreciate it right generally considered rock solid uh but like also you guys could have done this you guys could have seen this coming forever ago like comp has been yield farmed to death for like oh you it was it's kick-started defy summer uh and now it's killing the whole it's killing the the thing that has started like almost two years later uh yeah um i mean when when the token price is down bad people are like hey let's stop issuing that's natural they should right this is why these tokens need to be governed and the holders need to be economically like incented and they certainly are for token value appreciation uh some other people like teddy from notional finance think it's a very bad idea um saying that what'll happen is your liquidity will dry up and your yields will dry up and people will stop using the compound protocol right like what would happen is if you removed comp rewards your um your interest rates on dye would move from 2.7 percent to like um 0.7 0.72 right and so like are you going to be able to sustain the liquidity after token uh the token rewards dry up that's the big question well they should be able to because as demand goes up yields go up as well and so is there enough dye to borrow it's not like compound is a is an exchange that needs to have like liquid markets it just needs to have ample supply and if more dye gets demanded out of the protocol the yields do increase so i'm not concerned about that yeah i do think all token communities start thinking more about their economics during the bear season right certainly um ethereum is no different like bitcoin's no different they all do this um let's talk about this david so crypto as we talked about before is funding military defense look at this this is from ukraine i think these are these vests these are no they're they're bulletproof plates yeah so they slip into a vest so it's just kind of nice to see the evidence of all the crypto donations we're 200 sets of ballistic plates of class four four class bulletproof vests don't know what that means but i'm sure someone with military experience does um but yeah crypto buying bulletproof vests cool crypto funding military defense like it's kind of it's kind of cool it's also a little dystopian maybe i don't know how i feel about it but yeah it feels like guys yeah welcome to the 2020s this is what we're doing now um guys we will be back with the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value

nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free all right guys we are back with the takes of the week this is one from lee jan why don't you read this out david yeah lee jane previous podcast guests about uh the creator economy she says do things that make your friends and family worried about you which i definitely appreciate it what do you think she is she means ryan uh i think i think she's being like like her parents her friends her family are probably saying are you sure you want to like dive into crypto right like to this degree go all in it seems risky uh we're worried about you is everything okay um i don't know what kind of reaction did you get from your family when you told them about your crypto shenanigans oh yeah i kind of added that my own take down to her take right below it you can see it and i go to my mom from my mom about my career choices throughout 2018 to 2020 and she was like well he's happy so it's such a mom thing to say amazing what does she think now though it's like 2021 2022. what you know for me my family is like uh had no idea what i i was really doing but then like mark cuban came on the bankless podcast and they were like oh it was working my god mark cuban right that was the name for them that really stuck out i'm like mark cuban's cool i like mark cuban but like we had vitalik on okay that should be a big deal to you but no they were unimpressed by vitalik really excited about mark cuban for my family it was hester purse my family's like definitely like political and engaged my sister works in government so having sec commissioner hester purse was like a big deal legitimacy legitimacy yeah and then and then also andrew yang because they knew i was a big yang fan they're like oh yeah dave dave's climbing all the way up there that's pretty cool do you think your family was always before like hester purse came on the podcast like i don't know what david's doing it seems a little sketchy when then you get an sec commissioner yeah i i definitely explained it to them so like oh dave's doing what he really really likes uh and but it was just like a normal job back then uh and now it's like yeah the the leading podcast in the crypto industry which is a little different of a story well he's happy david's he's happy he's happy big smile on his face that's awesome man uh andrew cronier we talked about this in the beginning somebody who's not happy he's not happy um basically a line from his medium posts cryptoculture has strangled crypto ethos so he went through this whole blog post called the rise and fall of cryptoculture crypto is dead long live crypto i think the tl dr of this post is basically we need more regulation i now more than ever see the need he says or even necessity for regulation not as a mechanism to prevent but as a mechanism to protect it's like a child trying to stick their finger into the electric outlet you stop them before they can learn why they shouldn't one day they will understand but not today andre the father of many d5 protocols and sort of the i i guess one of the the main architects behind that like um ship fast break things yeah that's like his strategy like i test in prod remember that was the line coming out of uh you know 20 20 20. and now is saying we need tighter controls more regulation more oversight of this industry what do you think this is ridiculous dude he was the guy that incentivized this behavior he like he became andre cronier because he gave the apes fuel he gave the apes things to ape into and now he's like you know what this industry needs less things for the apes to do it's like dude you're the reason why you're making the complaints in the first place like it reminds me of like the the quick like there was this guy i can't remember who it was but the bit license in new york was made by like this federal regulator or something and made the bit license which made it very very hard to actually like spin up a big a bitcoin or crypto company in new york new york and you know what he did after that ryan after he made that he made the bit license no he started consulting for how to cow to get approved for the big license and it's the same he wants to become a regulator well i don't know he but first he's like he's like oh dude all of this ape culture is terrible but he got rich off of ape culture he got famous off of abe culture he's got like extremely well respected by his populist following because of ape culture and i was like well i don't like ape culture because it needs to be regulations they're too ap it's like dude you created this yeah testing pride kind of does that to you this is uh this is another take from a critic who i think shares uh some your points you want to read this out yeah it goes a man who makes nine to ten figures building multitudes of coins and projects thanks to crypto's lack of regulation then quits the space and now advocates for the biggest meme of all investor protection and regulation welcome to the crown clown world yep that's a that's and this seems to be consensus by people that i've that i've talked to i uh i would like to actually talk to andre at some point about this take and uh hear how he explains it's actually been a while since he's been on the podcast but maybe we'll just let this blow over for a bit and see what happens david you had another take about uh again this is this is sort of about mfr's which i think mfrs are really cool these these nfts that uh work off of the creative common license so anyone can create a derivative of them anyone can essentially fork them and create their own version of those and there was an air drop to all mf holders on 420 all right there's these awesome uh crazies they're called mfrs that were just airdropped to everyone who has an nf uh an uh an mf yeah yeah and um like you just got it automatically and there's like psychedelic derivative mf's that look pretty awesome and you have to take about this what's your take yeah i said mfers are the new money printer because mfrs are like the og of the mf or ecosystem but there's been thousands what seems like thousands of derivatives right some error drops some just randomly minted some you get to claim if you have an mf or some are completely different but it reminded me of like the era of um bitcoin fork and fair launches where people would fork off bitcoin uh and then make their own like new blockchain using the bitcoin uh state and if you had bitcoin you had all of these new tokens because it was a fork off of off of the bitcoin network so if you had bitcoins you had tokens on this new chain and so bitcoin was the the brand for bitcoin at the time was bitcoin gets all the upside of all these derivatives because you can always bitcoin cash bitcoin diamond bitcoin satoshi's vision whatever right so if you sold all of your bitcoin forks you would just get a lot more bitcoin right and so like i'm seeing the same thing play out because mfrs are so easy to make derivatives of the ogmfers are like the og bitcoin right you get all the derivatives like you just get the money printer uh and so that was my take mf's are the new money printer but for nfcs this time that's cool it's openness can be a competitive advantage and a competitive strategy certainly and that's what uh creative common license provides for uh for mfers also i have a lot of mfr so this is me chilling my bag here well full disclosure there then um i only have one david yeah you probably have more but now i have some derivatives too man should we get into it what are you excited about this week well ryan we still have all the rest of the week for devconnect uh so uh today's there are some parties tomorrow's gonna be some even more parties and then on on sunday there's rave so i'm excited to finish up dev connect but one thing i noticed is that during uh the layer two beat the layer two amsterdam uh uh two day summit of sorts uh there was a you could get a very silic hint of what's coming down the line during l2 season and then we kicked off the the first dank rad opened up about a very well informed talk about what is left in the la or two ecosystem to really the boxes that need to be checked right uh very good talk to get up to speed with layer twos and then followed by bartek from layer2b talking about his risk framework saying like okay like we got we have like upgradeable contracts that's something that needs to be fixed we have centralized sequencers like over time that needs to decentralize and like he in layer 2b does a really good job of like showing all the weaknesses and all the different l2s that need to be patched and he used the arbitrary 12-hour sequencer downtime that happened like last september as an example and actually we reported on this ryan like oh yeah in layer twos if they go down you can just exit through the ethereum l1 you can just exit through the main chain and yes that is true in theory about layer twos in their very mature state but that wasn't true ryan about arbitrarium at the time and a lot of people didn't actually know that uh and so bartek was uh talking about the and this is what he's trying to get known by the ecosystem is there's a lot of lacking of standards and definitions that we can't really talk about like what is true and what is not true without this risk framework so that's what bartek is working on right now uh but it got really spicy ryan because he was talking about yeah like little did people know you couldn't actually have gotten that l1 transaction through it wouldn't have worked because there's still a lot of gaps in the armor for these layer twos but you could hear i was sitting the arbor trump team in the arbitrary i think this was the ceo unconfirmed was sitting behind me and you could hear them rumors like wait a second that's not true that's not true that that's wrong uh and then basically they got really frustrated and the arbitrary ceo i think said just loudly said that's not true and made made bartek stumble uh and and like got really spicy in the room some tension some tension in the room right uh and so then i then i went to a couple of the after after that talk were like wrapped up i went to a couple other the l2 teams and talked about that moment because they weren't there in the room and they were like well actually no it actually was true uh but the point is is exactly like the reason why we can't come to consensus on what's true or not is because white we need definitions precise standards exactly exactly arbitrary is right under their definition and other other teams are right under their definition but i guess the takeaway here is you're saying there's like the kids are fighting there's something they're claiming they're trying to clamor for like legitimacy and they're trying to clamor for just like you know they're clamoring people are clamoring uh and like we got the hints of the optimism token coming soon and so that's gonna kick off you know what tokens do is they just they just uh add steroids to everything you're doing so if you have a little hint of tribalism just a little hint of like our layer two is better than yours which is only natural right they're all competitive environments add a token to that and your tiny campfire becomes an inferno right and suddenly you have like tokenized communities who uh just are just meme armies like on all sorts of different communities and battles back and forth and we get what we already have in the alt layer one world which is all of these communities fighting with one another and then people go and shaking their heads and being like why is cryptic so tribal it's because the incentives make us very tribal don't they that's exactly right that's exactly right so like for better or for worse ryan this is coming and competition is always good for the end user so i think this is really going to accelerate the development of layer twos l222 is just around the corner you can taste it and ryan that is what i'm excited about well i am sort of my position is kind of the i want all the kids to get along and the whole family to get along i want us all to scale uh decentralization on us all to scale ethereum so i am excited about all of these various experiments i think many of the all of the layer two teams almost all of them are just legit like passionate doing this for the right reasons just fantastic but it kind of reminds me you know we use the nation state analogy for like the united roll-ups of ethereum it's kind of like the the us and the states are the various roll-ups and ethereum is kind of like the federal government uh it's almost like california kind of wants to get in a fight with texas a little bit right and take like west coast east coast yeah it's a little late yeah biggie versus tupac i don't know north versus south something like this uh florida versus texas california i don't know it's there's something like that and i think that's coming too so we will of course have to navigate that but uh can i like just just to tie off the devconnect conversation wait wait before we do though uh yeah we all know the crypto industry runs on attention and what is going to make have more attention than a bunch of layer twos fighting with each other like bullish fighting bullish questions but i don't want to fight all the time david no it's coming ryan let's go buckle up guys uh i i just kind of thought maybe some of the lt's would just um i don't know band together the common mission they are going to be bridged together by the bridges so at the end of the day we're all one big ecosystem at least we're not separate layer ones ryan we're all added to the worst alignment that's the worst one yeah uh all right well just to just to tie up dev connect then what are your big takeaways from devconnect and we we promised a little bit of alpha you're just in great conversation so uh what did drake tell you what was one merged david yeah so don't give us a date we were getting beers right and we wanted to uh we were asking justin this and and we were joking about all right we're gonna put all of our empty beers in front of justin and give him the last full beer and then we're going to take a picture of justin and justin says we're going to emerge tomorrow we ended up not doing that obviously but he said a few months and so the consensus has shifted amongst a very small set of people at this table uh to sometime to august to october august to october is the new point of time question mark um but the the core devs were all locked in a room together kind of like how you like got to lock all the politicians together if you needed them to come up with something but they are making they're doing a ton of progress they're doing all these ghost forks again this is not some sort of like new york mainnet consensus coindesk consensus conference is getting done right now at this conference and you can actually see it uh the bar text talk for layer two is about here is the check boxes that the layer twos need to get done we need to work on this that same thing i want to watch that yeah yes yeah i also had a fantastic watch talk talk with a lot of the core teams uh danny ryan dank rad uh preston van loon uh a few others uh really good talk as well uh i'll i'll try and find that and link that in the show notes as well uh just so much information being passed around so we're all syncing our nodes about what the state of the industry is is in so we can progress forward um again the vibes in the uh the co-working space the shelling point where everyone goes to hang out which is where i'm going next after this uh are just fantastic i'm meeting a ton of new people also seeing a ton of all my friends oh it's just it's just great man that's awesome how's uh how's cesano doing oh suzanne is doing great uh he led the layer 2 panel uh you know and yeah it's great to see him great to hang out that's awesome man oh very cool good stuff progress gets made when if the eth people all get together yeah i mean there's a lot of doubters on twitter right now saying uh yeah you're just hedging and uh the merge is never going to happen or if it does happen it's certainly not happening in 2022 so um the only way you can quiet that is to actually ship the thing do it so i think we're getting close yeah devconnect is a yearly thing so i'm looking forward to doing this again next year yeah ryan what are you excited about my man uh we just bought bankless.com all right yes we did so last week it was the trademark uh this week we got bankless.com we've been on the hunt for this for a while uh and um you know we found we found the person who was selling it did a private transaction so that is in the process of getting transfer that's not my story though okay like that's what's exciting but my story is about like sometimes i like to torture myself we still have to have a bank account for certain things so when you buy a domain name you have to like transmit funds to an escrow service right so it's all fiat there's the service called escrow.com so the only way david for us to get money from our fiat bank account which again we have to have for certain things i can't pay for this thing with usdc or uh or eth for example is uh to use our bank account okay and like a couple years ago actually before you know how uh vitalik started ethereum because you know the joke is uh his warlock and wow got nerfed right okay i partially started the bankless newsletter because i was pissed because bank of america shut down my bank accounts my business bank accounts all right like true story it's just like kicked me out just received a dear john letter within 30 days you and all of your assets have to go bye-bye see you later uh and why the reason was because i had a cryptocurrency transaction a withdrawal from coinbase to my bank of america account coinbase and that flagged me oh it must be shady so booting so we've had a for bank list we've had like a credit union which are generally more more friendly like the cannabis industries experience this um little banks instead of a big bank tiny banks right with like they know they're community managers part of the community and they don't have these big risk assessments anyway uh we're trying to transfer funds why are funds i have to show up at the credit union in person present my id they ask me like what i'm doing with the funds like just you know are you buying property yeah after a fashion digital property is a domain name and you know got that process through anyway what happened is uh the wire did not get transferred that day and apparently this got escalated through the credit union um because they looked up bankless and they saw that we were a crypto podcast in the crypto industry and there were internal meetings and it was deemed risky and so yeah you're just hearing this because you've been in amsterdam so i have multiple conversations with like the bank managers at the credit union trying to explain what we're doing like we're a podcast we have a subscription service like we're legitimate and they were like but you're issuing a token what's your token i'm like oh you're talking about an nft because if you are a bankless premium member yes there is a poet badge that you can get it's an nft are you familiar with what nfts were the guy i was talking to is just hilarious right because he was like oh i'm totally down with nfts i just i love it i just have to convince these guys these other guys right like this younger uh bank manager i guess having to talk to the three to five old guys in the office and convince them that they should not kick us out of our credit union bank they should actually process we almost got unbanked oh totally dude they were this close right this close to being flagged yes and so okay that story right i just you know it's not i'm not we're not being super persecuted whatever we still have crypto rails it's just kind of an inconvenience it's annoying but it reflects on me that if you have a money in a bank account you don't actually own the money right you want to move that money out imagine because this is what really happens you ask five guys in in suits in some office somewhere if you can move your own damn money please sir can i move my money from one place to another please will you allow me to do it no because you're in the crypto industry or no because we don't like your political perspective or whatever it is right uh so it just drives the point home that this is why we need to go bankless david uh you know this is we need the ability to exit the existing system and we need the freedom to be able to move our funds from one place to another that is a civil liberty for the digital era for the 21st century and if you have your money in account you don't have those liberties you don't actually own your money in a bank account you know what the cherry on top of that story is that the escrow service that you're yeah we were sending the money for it could have just been a smart contract totally totally like this could have been done like that smart contract oh and if it's an ens domain boom right both parties deposit done probably for less money too yeah i mean like inside this minutes one gas fee like no five dudes and ties you know take time out of their day in a building and like in a cocoa building i talked to like three branch members i had to go in person like say hello somebody paper filled out the wire transfer information copying it from digital to it like it's just so inefficient people consumed gas in their car to get to that building on that day like that's taking up space that could have been housing for people like you know you got to go bankless right like people people could talk about how much energy like uh bitcoin is consuming what about all the unnecessary ridiculousness of the entire banking industry that could be automated they also talk about how crypto ux just sucks and it has like yeah sure parts of it but like no that ux sucks i just try to get money from one place to another and i can't do it without talking to like five different people showing up in person presenting my id arguing my p case almost getting kicked out of my bank account that sucks that's bad ux so there was there was one time i had to make a wire transfer that was like over the limit of like 15 000 or something and i was not home i was in san francisco at the time and i couldn't go into a wells fargo branch and so i call them and say hey can we just like ignore this 15 dollar limit because i gotta i have to do it i think it had to be done like that day basically and they're like uh no like we can't do that like in order to do anything about fifteen thousand dollars we need to send you like a pgp key or something like one of those little usb authenticators and i'm like okay but like i need to do this a day so it's not gonna happen fast enough a pgp key they wanted to send me a pgp key so i could usb it into my computer so i could verify my identity that's just a boomer uh hard hardware wallet right i don't even understand how how do they know it's you who they're sending it because because they send it to they would send it to my address and then i would have it and they could have like i don't know i don't know but it's basically a private key they're at they're asking me for have a hardware wallet except it's a pgp key like google auth and a usb it's a hardware wallet they just women have a hardware wallet it's the same with extra steps and it's worse than physically mailed to you yeah oh it's so broken dude it's so broken it is broken but you know you got to use the banking system every once in a while to uh to see how far we're coming into like it always reestablishes the crypto vision for me i'm like oh yeah this does suck don't give me this crap and tell me like tradify is fine as is right dead end yeah crypto ux definitely has room to improve but at least you get to do it from the comfort of your own home anyway we're not kicked out of the bank account good news is they didn't kick us they finally processed the wire maybe they listened to a bankless podcast in the process i don't know they definitely looked us up so we still have our credit union so uh you know we're on the path to going bankrupt but we still got that credit union for now thank you congratulations okay thank you congratulations for taking care of for getting the the bankless.com thank you for taking care of that awesome the alpha is
