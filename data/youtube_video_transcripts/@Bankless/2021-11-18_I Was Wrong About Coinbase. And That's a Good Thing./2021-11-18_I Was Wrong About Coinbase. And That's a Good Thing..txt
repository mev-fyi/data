crypto is evolving i was wrong about coinbase and meditate through this dip with me all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on everything that happened in the bankless world last week and as always they're going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so before we start i want to shout out our sponsor opolis opolis is a co-op type dow thing that uh provides employment infrastructure for crypto workers so that means if you're a freelancer for a dow you can get health benefits payroll stuff etc uh all done in a more crypto native way and also there's a bonus 1000 work tokens and thousand bank tokens when you enroll by the end of this year um nice check it out at bankless.cc opolis so the title of this episode of tldr is why crypto is maturing actually it's probably not like i change my titles right before i post them uh but let's go with that anyways and if you're paying attention to the space uh the maturing of crypto is is really really clear and that theme kind of stuck with me all week and it started with market monday which talked about how within crypto like you have different sectors and different communities emerging and it's not really just one monolithic crypto space anymore um there's an investment side to crypto with new vehicles for institutions and big money there's a cultural side to crypto with nfts and the metaverse on the rise there's the philosophical or political side to crypto which leverages daos and other coordination tools around public goods and in among in between all those things there are like countless subdivisions and combinations of all of these different fields and i firmly believe that there's something in crypto for everyone and maybe that wasn't the case you know five years ago and maybe it wasn't even the case one year ago but the entry points into this space from all different directions are exploding so all of these things are you know happening in parallel often interweaving and doing so symbiotically so as i go through the rest of uh our coverage for this week like see how the crypto space is maturing in different ways and in different sectors brian armstrong came on the podcast this week and for the newly initiated uh he's the ceo of coinbase and this episode like really blew my expectations away um to be totally honest and i'm not really sure exactly like where i got this from but up to this point i just kind of thrown coinbase into the like soulless tech giant bucket uh i saw it as this necessary evil to get to the good stuff like the good stuff being decentralization self-sovereignty whatever um but i walked away from like listening to this episode feeling pretty much the opposite i'm now really convinced of coinbase's long-term values and its crucial position in this space um brian is really refreshing as a founder ceo with a really clear practical vision i don't like the idea of there being a coin based chain i like their id the idea of chains being much more decentralized than that now if we also thought about okay well could we help make a more decentralized chain that truly we didn't control and maybe we contribute engineers to it but whenever we kind of looked at that and we got a little closer to making something i kind of looked at i was like well that's kind of what the existing chains are doing i don't know if the world needs another chain at this point it probably needs one or two of them to just keep making progress on their developer roadmap you know look you could argue that coinbase would have another 50 billion on the market cap or something if we had made our own chain but again i'm not in it for the just to like print a bunch of money or something i want this to be adopted globally and last you know hundreds of thousands of years as the future of money and so i don't want us to get too into the centralization of any one chain i was definitely happy to see you know fundamental alignments between the crypto native space and this centralized bridge role that coinbase is serving um all that said coinbase has a lot on its shoulders facing the pressures of both the traditional world and the crypto native world on the traditional side uh coinbase is in the regulatory spotlight with the sec strong-arming the coinbase lend program and shutting it down even after they asked for permission and then on the crypto native hand well coinbase holds a really significant chunk of defy assets and with that comes governance responsibilities um the crypto space whether it likes it or not is putting a lot of trust in coinbase uh but after this episode i'm starting to think that this trust is both necessary and also in good hands so dc investor joined david on layer zero and i feel like i've kind of gotten to know dc like by proxy after following him on twitter for a while and watching his like five appearances on bankless uh and i can see why we keep bringing him on like time after time he has a measured consistent approach uh to crypto and investing in the whole space um and he took a bunch of lessons you know from his experience as an investor in the early days of the internet and he learned how to be a good investor and as crypto has emerged uh dc was ready and applied his skills and developed a number of really sound theses about the space most recently he's fallen into the world of nft curating and collecting and he's amassed an insanely impressive portfolio of nfts and the value is there in the in the collection for sure uh but dc has these for the long term and that's a vision that you have to respect so ens launched its token and had an airdrop and you probably got it if you were a bankless premium subscriber and had access to our ultimate guide to airdrops wink uh and ens is a fundamental piece of this whole ecosystem i mean it's definitely a public good and now it's really becoming public uh it makes ethereum more usable creating a simple unified namespace to access this network you know from a human perspective like the same way that dot com revolutionized how we navigate and surf the web ens is doing that with dot eth so you can sign in with ethereum fill out your address books with your friends ens addresses and so on uh creating these standards has been no small task but ens has matured to the point where it's ready to hand over the standard to the community and i'm fascinated by where all this takes us your wallet is your passport to web3 it's your resume it's your identity uh and i think this eventually evolves to the point where your wallet is kind of your avatar where you have this irl physical version of yourself uh and then your dot eth name is that is the portal it's the ready player one headset into the metaverse and also you know thanks for the tokens uh we also had a live defy 2.0 summit which i was really stoked about and we had on five liters of some of the coolest new projects out there and i think this ended up being just like an epic episode that summed up our exploration of exactly what dfi 2.0 is and what it means for crypto more broadly so we've covered all of these protocols individually so rari tracer tokamak olympus alcomix but i think when they all came together um i think what we learned is that d fight 2.0 is just about being defy native i think it's just the natural result of these larger og d5 protocols codifying and suddenly you have all this new space uh where you need these new novel ideas out there on the front lines taking on more risk and with that catalyzing innovation on the space one of the favorite quotes that uh i believe amin solomony one of my heroes in the space said about smart contracts risk is it's kind of like the steam engine uh it blows up a bunch of times and then at some point we figure it out and it just works and overall defy has been blowing up less and less and less over time uh and we've kind of been figuring out this whole smart contract thing and maybe uh hopefully in five ten years from now we're just looking back i'm like oh yeah remember when we didn't know about how to do smart contracts that was that was a fun time when everything blew up along the way d5 2.0 has shown itself to be this composable social layer of dow to dow activity most of these protocols are already like interconnected with each other in some sort of way and what you get is this values aligned like really efficient ecosystem where liquidity and market creation are just being optimized uh i don't think that any of this would be possible without a mature set of primitives that have already bootstrapped themselves into both adoption and resilience but now there's a new design space on top of that a new floor of money legos and the experimentation thus far has been super encouraging and exciting ethereum's roadmap is also really exciting the proof-of-stake merge looks like it's going to happen within a year and that's a pretty conservative time frame from what i've been hearing uh data sharding within the next couple years and the building out of the layer 2 ecosystem happening all along i mean look it's ultra scalable ethereum modular blockchains once again as promised consensus on the beacon chain data availability in the shards and execution on layer twos there you go we also covered staking your eth with rocket pool and now there are just a lot of different ways to validate the ethereum network under proof of stake you can run your own node you can stake with a centralized exchange like gemiini or coinbase and you can try out decentralized options like rocketpool and lido there are valid strategies for whatever your bags look like or whatever your risk tolerance looks like cool uh we also launched a new show uh overpriced jpegs with carly riley she had an interview with betty from dead fellas and is generally covering the nft metaverse space and if you haven't checked out those episodes they are awesome so please do uh and finally [Music] the price action this week might be ugly but i am still beautiful bullishness is a choice and today i choose to be bullish someone on twitter told me that i'm not going to make it but that does not define me that does not define me so with that i want to quickly shout out our sponsors arbitram ledger matcha and alcomix these projects in a way define me uh anyways this video wouldn't be possible without them so thanks a lot and finally none of this is financial advice either is risky d5 is risky but we're headed west it's the frontier it's not for
