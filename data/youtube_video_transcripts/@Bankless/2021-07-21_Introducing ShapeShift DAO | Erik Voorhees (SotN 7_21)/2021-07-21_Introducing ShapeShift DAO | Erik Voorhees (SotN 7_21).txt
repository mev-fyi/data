[Music] hey bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation episode we've got a hot episode today with eric voorhees who is the ceo of shapeshift shapeshift is now dalifying that's the story here david great conversation with eric lined up i know we've already had this conversation with eric we're pre-recording it because you are in france right now what were some of your takeaways my gosh eric just knows what's up in this industry he is and i think one of the reasons why eric has always been so successful is he his skill is that he can really separate what is signal from noise uh and what gets me really excited is that eric really thinks that the dao is the logical next step for the progression of his own company shape-shift llc he thinks that it should become shapeshift dao and the fact that he has ownership and and you know he's the the leader behind this llc and he still thinks that he wants to give it to the community the fact that he still thinks that i think is phenomenal and is really illustrative of the power that lies in and it's eric eric voorhees wants to tap into that power and that's what we talked about today yeah super cool i know you're using the term llc because we often do it's like a swiss corporation same difference though like from nation state you know meet space org to uh crypto native org that's the transition here um i i just have a ton of respect for for eric right like um his ability to pivot um but while staying so true to the core values that shape this industry as you said no wonder why he's been so successful in this space and my favorite was probably near the end um we talked about lots of dowel type things but then he gives some advice for people it's their first cycle uh and he has some words for for those that are worried about this uh this recent crypto price drop that i think are pretty timeless so super cool anyway guys stay tuned for that i want to talk about what is new in the bankless nation david you are at east cc this is an ethereum conference i know i think you're going are you going into day two it's a day three by now this is day one uh day one okay yeah and tomorrow will be day two so yeah and end of day one it's my evening time your morning time right now uh and the reason why we aren't live streaming this is that my airbnb doesn't have the capacity uh to livestream this so we're just pre-recording it and releasing it um and man i am just the energy in france and energy at ucc is absolutely insane i've i've heard just a ton of people on crypto twitter who aren't at ucc talk about all of the fomo that they're having and i've got a bit of david yeah it's completely justified absolutely you are genuinely missing out yeah you are absolutely missing out yeah i've i've seen so many different people here and i'm doing actually a podcast at ecc so doing like 10 to 15 minute quick interviews with all the big names that you know and love did a quick interview with aya mayaguchi of the ef uh i'm doing one with vitalik tomorrow and kane as well and stani from ave uh and so if you are feeling the fomo from ecc you totally should and then you should listen to the podcast that comes out this following monday which is going to be the ecc experience allowing you to feel the vibes and feel the energy of what it was like to be at ecc i'm ho i hope i can deliver that to at the bankless nation and hopefully i can do a good job conveying the vibe around ecc because the vibe is hot david i can i can't wait man like i want to i'm really looking forward to listening to that not only are you dropping the fomo on us but you're also dropping the antidote to that fomo so we appreciate that again you and then giving you the cure yeah it's perfect thank you guys if you're feeling the fomo for missing out on eath cc here is a conference you can attend this is the chain link smart contract summit it's coming up august 5th through the 7th david you and i will be there we're doing an uh eip 1559 panel which i'm super stoked about but this is like a a fantastic almost like a defy conference meetup uh they're going to be talking about oracles of course but they're also going to be talking about automated market makers and layer 2 and mev problems so if you want to get up to speed on the cutting edge of d5 come check this out this is going to be like 200 plus or so d5 projects nft projects and leaders from those projects speaking jam-packed event i attended last year it was a blast a lot of fun this is free did i mention that my god i didn't mention that it's free and it's virtual so if you are looking to level up on defy uh check this out no excuses make some time for this and uh and and and learn about everything you can with this free information all right david before we get into today's conversation gotta ask you the question what's the state of the nation today the state of the nation is shape-shifting and eric actually got to this joke before i was able to but i had i did have it line up for the right for the record i did have this joke lined up but shape-shift is eric's company and it has progressed and evolved and shape-shift its form into many different things into the future and that's really what i see a lot of d5 apps doing and and ethereum at large you know ethereum is going through a shape shift with eip1559 and then proof of stake you know we have uniswap v1 v2 v3 uh we had balancer v1 v2 we got maker single collateral die shape-shifting into multi-collateral die but now we are seeing it with an llc shape-shifting into a dao and so the state of the nation today ryan is that we are we shapeshift as an industry and shapeshift is shape-shifting very good david i like you look that's great man and evolve or die i think that's that's the idea behind this podcast um and this is the next evolution for shapeshift and it's super cool to see super cool to see an established company entering the dial space too because as we said in the podcast we're all learning how to down together the more of us on that journey the faster the tools will get built out the infrastructure will get built out and the learning lessons will come about we'll all get better together so super excited to have shape shift on that journey so before we get to the conversation with eric we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the d5 apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrarium is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitram if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrarum and join their discord all right bankless nation super excited to have with us for the third time eric voorhees eric is one of the earliest pioneers of this industry one of the earliest to go west to go bankless he believed in bitcoin before it was cool before our industry was an actual industry what i love about eric is he is known for being a huge bitcoin believer but he's also totally bullish on defy and the non-bitcoin parts of the crypto industry which is why we like him so much uh welcome back eric voorhees to bankless for the third time it's great to have you thanks guys super glad to be here david i don't know we called nick carter recently our favorite bitcoiner but uh i might be doing eric some dis justice here because i feel like uh eric is one of my favorite bitcoiners anyway you just call whoever's on the show your favorite bitcoin we don't we have more interest we have more integrity than that here on bank list um but you really are i think um you know you stand up very well for the values of the space and always have and that's why it's it's really exciting to talk about this next chapter of what you're doing with uh with shapeshift um yeah maybe we could start with kind of like what's happening and i'll give bankless listeners the tldr in case uh they haven't heard and then eric we'll we'll get into kind of the the discussion here but shapeshift is in on-chain exchange that you founded uh six billion in lifetime volume 150 000 monthly users 500k wallets 2.5 billion in associated assets and if you're to run this by fintech measures right something like revolut where they value things at 2k per user shapeshift would be worth about a billion dollars right now so like by any measure a successful organization a successful company and yet the company is choosing to dissolve you are launching tokens to your users employees and founders you are becoming a dow let's start with this question why yeah well so yeah we are decentralizing we're we're converting shapeshift from a normal vc back to you know shareholder company with a board and an executive team to a dow where the governance and the value accrual ends up revolving around the token instead of the shares um why we are ultimately trying to build an open source multi-chain self-custody crypto platform for the whole world and to do that we have to be decentralized we have to uproot the the shackles that keep us tethered to you know normal court the normal corporate world um we can't violate regulations so we have to not do anything that is regulated and corporations by their existence are regulated and so one way to avoid that is to no longer be a corporation ultimately this is about aligning shape shift with the ethos of crypto generally which is open immutable and borderless we believe that best happens if we ourselves are decentralized so we are starting on that process eric uh the the story of shapeshift has been one of uh just uh evolution it has gone through a number of different you know phases in its lifespan that is really a story of both keeping up with the industry but also trying to be a product that maintains its resonance with the ethos of the industry at large maybe just for the listeners who aren't as familiar uh with the shape-shift as you or we are could you just walk us through the history of shapeshift as it got started in 2014 and the various pivots that it's made up until it's the most recent pivot and turning into a dao yeah um certainly the name shapeshift has become very apropos for what we what we are you guys have shape-shifted yeah i wish i could take credit for having planned that all out from the start but um no so yeah we started in early 2014 uh in the wake of the mount gox catastrophe and um i saw two things that i thought were important one was i didn't want the world to have to use centralized custodial exchanges because of all the danger of that you know mount gox almost destroyed the whole industry back then um and two i saw a burgeoning ecosystem of digital assets you know this was pre-ethereum but the trend was pretty clear that people were creating new digital assets for different use cases and with different technology and so i wanted to fuse these two things and basically create an easy way for people to convert one digital asset into another with as little friction as possible and without us ever taking control of user funds or having deposits of customers so that was just to cut in there i actually find that the early version of shape shift extremely resonant with uniswap where unit swap is just you input one token get out another token there's no centralized exchange there's no custody and it was really una swap before there was defy it was really the earliest version of unit swap possible yeah and you know that's this is a little later in the story but when i first used uniswap i had this feeling like holy crap they they've rebuilt shapeshift and they've done it better than us using tools that didn't exist back when we started i must learn how they've done this and we should potentially go down this path so unit swap was absolutely an inspiration to us and if any degree of us inspired uniswap you know that'd be kind of poetic um and also anyway that was it just to cut in here again uh just an illustration for for the users it's shape shift you would go there and if you wanted to trade you know bitcoin for ether you would be presented with a bitcoin address or a bitcoin qr code and then you would also give shapeshift your ethereum address and you would send bitcoins and then shapeshift would shape shift it into ether and you could do this for many many pairs right so you would send them bitcoins receive monero send them monero receive bitcoin cash uh and so it was it was a centralized exchange but it was it felt atomic right you just input one token and then receive the other and shape-shifted all the magic in the background exactly yeah and it worked across chains which is which was really key so to provide that service which was cross chain we ultimately had to be the counterparty to the trade with users so when someone sent us the bitcoin we received that into our own hot wallet we had an inventory of ether and we would send that out to that user so that made for a great user experience it was very fast and simple but by the time we got into 2018 uh we had grown fairly large we were 100 people um making lots of money everyone loved the service you know it was all great uh and we had invested a lot of money into the regulatory investigation basically like to what degree are various global financial regulations going to apply to us and we came to the very depressing conclusion that we would potentially be treated like a financial institution which meant we would have to impose kyc and accounts and all the various financial surveillance apparatus on to shapeshift customers before that we had no user accounts we had no kyc it was you know a service for users to trade assets easily and we we felt like it was important to protect them by not taking their private information so that was mid-2018 very depressing for me for the whole company all the staff our users hated it uh they called us a bunch of sellouts and um [Music] you know just so mad at us for violating our principles and um this was this was pretty awful i mean we we ended up losing like 99 of our business uh most of the customers just went off to other competitors that were not um not taking the us regulatory environment uh as seriously as we were at the time and i can't blame those users right i mean they they wanted a service they didn't want to be spied on so um i get it and for the next couple years we really struggled and we reinvented the product to be not just an exchange but really like a an integrated wallet where people could use their hardware wallet or software wallet see all their assets in a self-custody way and trade them when they wanted that didn't get a ton of traction again because we had all this kyc and people just didn't like it meanwhile in parallel and this is where the story starts getting fun you have ethereum which had been created and spawned this whole defy ecosystem and in you know 2019 it was it was getting started and by early 2020 it had gotten large and uniswap in particular started seeing days where it was rivaling coinbase in its volume and when i came across uniswap and tried it i was like yes this is it this is they've done it but it only worked for ethereum assets and ethereum's great but it is only a piece of the ecosystem and it does not include the most important asset of all which is bitcoin um by market cap and liquidity so i was i was like all right well uniswap's awesome but like how do you do this across chain and i didn't have a knife i didn't have an answer to that so later in the year in 2020 we decided we would integrate uh uniswap um and in particular the xerox aggregator which allowed like 12 different dexes into shapeshift so we decided to just rip out our guts as a business like our trading engine and our ability to interact with customers as a trader and just replace them outsource them with these decentralized protocols so we took the regulated activity which had gotten us like caught in all this barbed wire and we outsourced it to a decentralized immutable protocol that was the start of us understanding the power of this decentralized technology we then went on to discover thor chain which allows which is like uniswap but it allows trades across chains um super cool technology and so we integrated that in april and since then in april we have not had kyc any longer we are not an intermediary at any step of the process and shapeshift is back to being you know this like frictionless uh place where people can trade without uh worrying about being surveilled on and we're using the technology in d5 to do it and so the regulators that you uh or excuse me the the legal counsel that you guys had at shapeshift the ones that originally informed you that it was probably not going to work out to not take kyc and all and aml and all the other requirements and then ultimately forced to you know shape-shift into doing that where they you also consulted with them saying hey what if we replaced all of our back end with you know uniswap 0x and thor chain are you would you guys then be okay with us not taking kyc aml information and they said yes um it's interesting to hear you compress it into one sentence like that uh the reality is this is this is like a three-year struggle through every nuance of global financial regulation millions of dollars countless hours of discussion with internal and external counsel trying to figure out what where the sensitivities were and where we could maneuver and ultimately came to the decision that like if you're providing regulated services you will be regulated right that's a fair statement so stop providing regulated services and that's what we did we stopped providing regulated services uh users are interacting with d5 protocols directly we are not in the middle of that we don't even add fees to that it's just a direct service but through our software interface so you know laws can always change and we have to watch these things carefully but under the current laws shapeshift is not an intermediary and therefore it's not responsible for the financial regulation that an intermediary would be eric there there's a lot more to talk about here in fact i want to get back to kind of the the laws might change uh conversation at some point during our discussion because um where you know i think the crypto world is wondering uh how laws might change in in defy circles you know there's a lot of talk about stable coins these days in congress and other you know legislative bodies but we'll get back to that um i i guess the meat of where you've gotten so far is you've gotten to a point where uh shape-shift is truly a non-custodial bankless exchange right and so that's that's one portion of the uh regulatory infrastructure and the trust infrastructure that you've essentially outsourced on chain to ethereum thought chain and other protocols right but you still have this other part of regulatory infrastructure which is you guys are a an llc a corporation some sort of legal apparatus operating in meat space right and so you have shareholder agreements and you have traditional bank accounts why because you have to have those in order to function in some nation-state jurisdiction right so you've got part of this that has been outsourced on chain and another part that is still in the uh the traditional like legal apparatus is that where the dow idea starts to to come about in the execution of that idea so so pick up the story there with that second half yeah so a year ago i was not thinking about becoming a dao we had had very casual talks about letting users of shape shift govern parts of what we were doing with the fox tokens so like some of these primitives were starting to seep into our discussions but if someone told me like hey you should decentralize shapeshift i would have kind of dismissed that as like a little silly um but after we saw the reception of the uniswap integration and after we started learning about these d5 protocols and the dows and the tooling that has been built for daos today and after we realized that our platform is going to be most competitive if it is open source and all other protocols can build onto it instead of having to fight for um bandwidth from our own small development team [Music] the number of reasons to be a central entity just started falling down and you know the last one is really okay fine you want to be a decentralized organization you have an obligation to shareholders you have an obligation to your employees you can't just like drop the ball on those people and chase this fanciful idea of decentralization how do you how do you navigate this such that those stakeholders are better off through that process of decentralization as we figured that out it became obvious that we must do this and so i would say our executive team had decided to do it back in late april and our employees learned about it in may and then it all became public uh just last week on july 14th which is coincidentally the steel day which has some fun symbolism that that is incredible um it's awesome i want to actually read a quote that that you made in your in your personal post i think announcing this um you said this just as it made sense for every company to utilize the cloud to avoid infrastructure friction in the 2000s so too will it make sense to utilize defy to avoid political and economic friction going forward buzzwords both and yet revolutionary using defy to avoid political and economic friction going forward that seems very much the path that you've taken all along this this timeline going from sort of you know more centralized exchange to completely non-custodial now foregoing the political and economic um friction of a nation-state corporation or or legal entity um do you think that this is going to be a trend that is going to like be as big as the cloud i mean there was a time where no one used cloud computing right uh now everyone does now that that is the norm is this move to dalify an organization something that is is going to be as big as the cloud how many others are going to follow in these footsteps what's that going to be like the cloud is pretty big so could it be bigger than that i don't know um but the economics are the same so the cloud became popular because it reduced the cost of holding and running infrastructure and reduced it not by like 10 but reduced it by like 95 percent uh there is so much cost and friction in running regulated financial services people do not see this because it just gets passed on to the end user and all the banks are these zombie organizations that have zero interest in innovating they do not complain about regulations because they are just a tentacle of the state themselves so you get that you have an environment in which financial regulations cost society tens hundreds of billions of dollars per year and the the uh all of society simply bears that cost today because there isn't an alternative defy comes along and you get these financial primitives and protocols which do many of these financial services without any middlemen without any intermediaries without any staff without any taxes without any compliance obligations they are just open immutable code running in cyberspace in ethereum or other blockchains as they develop that is incredibly powerful and so all we are doing here is recognizing that that is a better service to provide to our users than trying to run through it ourselves as a frictionladen organization i have to imagine that other organizations will come to that same conclusion eric i see this story of shapeshift as a company that first used crypto blockchain defy to protocolize its products and now it's using defy and crypto endows to take the actual legal structure and turn that into code as well so you know first products and and now company and so i want to ask you a little bit about the logistics of that uh what is the model for the path towards turning shapeshift into a dao i'm assuming it's not just like a black and white it's like oh we're down now it's a little bit more of a progression yeah so tell us about that story is it something maybe like the maker foundation model or something else in this ecosystem tell us about the progression of the shapeshift llc turning into shape shift dow yeah that's really the if you get away from all the fanciful fun poetic stuff like how do you actually do this so we are we are not decentralized today we are 100 centralized um we have two basic themes that we need to work on on the product side we have to open source all of the shapeshift code that will happen over the coming months that will allow the community to build on this product and to have you know a stake in where that goes we had to distribute the fox token to all those people so that they have an economic incentive to care and to participate economic incentives are everything and so our airdrop which was the largest in history went to all of our past customers and over a hundred thousand members of other defect communities that we have been inspired by so all those people now have a stake in the decentralized shape shift so that's sort of on the product and token side then there is the legacy entity so shapeshift is a swiss corporation with several subsidiaries in different jurisdictions ultimately all that stuff has to get wound down our balance sheet has to get liquidated out to our shareholders all of our contracts have to be wound down and ended we have various investments in different companies those have to get liquidated all of those kind of things to wind down that entity will happen also over the coming months and these things are kind of two parallel tracks that we have to uh have to work on so what about the employees of shapeshift dao what's the the long-term future for them because you know you can you with an llc you actually have an employment contract where you know they actually have to show up for work but with dows like they don't have to do anything like it's a dow like what's the story of the employees of shapeshift yeah interestingly uh employment contracts don't make someone show up to work and uh anyone who has ever anyone who's ever run a business um you know knows like the challenge of hr generally and having to have an entire department just to manage the logistics of incoming and outgoing um staff with payroll and there's a whole world of regulation just around that right so we we endure a ton of costs just handling the regulation of the people that we're trying to voluntarily work with so right now today shapeshift has about 65 employees and all of these employees will no longer be employees by the end of this year so there are three waves you know roughly a third of the employees are in each of these waves um they all have very generous severance but more importantly they all got very considerable grants of fox tokens which unlock over the coming three years depending on where the price goes this grant for many of them will be more valuable than the salary that they were making as w2 employees so that is now their option on how they wish to engage with the dow some of them we expect you know want to be conservative and will want to go find some new w-2 role at some company somewhere and we wish them luck others will probably value the freedom that they have and they'll work on shape-shift part-time however they wish and others are very committed to you know continuing full-time work for shape shift but not in an official capacity just as a economically incentivized member and someone who cares about our vision so i expect employees will fall into all three of those buckets and you know certainly the range of responses among our employees was um was as diverse as the employees some of them thought this was the coolest thing in the world others were like this is really scary what the hell are you doing and everything in between that um so yeah you fall on that spectrum i mean obviously the former yeah well i am i've been scared for 10 years trying to build things in crypto right so like that's kind of i've gotten used to that and i'm willing to take that risk but um lots of people aren't and that's that's okay too so where do you where do you see your position with uh shapeshift out over the long term uh as the figurehead and former ceo of shapeshift where will you be in relationship to the dao yeah so i won't be ceo of anything anymore you know after this year um i will remain simply an influential member of the community um you know i i will still be very much involved i am very heavily economically incentivized to make sure it is a success and i am more excited about shapeshift in a decentralized model than i was in a centralized corporate model so for me it's been very reinvigorating and seeing the community response after our announcement last week was was really fun so eric you've been on the side of kind of running a traditional organization for a while but a traditional organization in crypto i think some are still skeptical of the dao model in in general right and i know oh look all of us are early on in the dow model like at some level the entire community the entire crypto industry we're all learning how to dow together but because you took this action you must have been um optimistic i guess about the organizational model of a doubt but but skeptics will come and look at this thing and be like there's no ceo there's no employees there's no employment agreement how does anything get done in this structure what what's your answer to that how do you anticipate things are going to get done in the shape-shift dial structure great question yeah i remain skeptical about dows as organizations too you know just because we're doing this doesn't mean i think they're a panacea or that we have all the answers to this where we are as you say figuring out how to dial um i think it is a new form of of organ of economic organization for the 21st century and it was impossible before the advent of tokens tokens provide an almost unlimited design space for economic incentives and you coordinate people around the economic incentives of a token instead of coordinating people around the much more rigid incentive structure of salaries and equity ownership so it's a model in which people are far more free you know they can come and make and go as they please there is no employment contract people may show up and work for a day or they may be committed for 10 years and it's on them it is something that is far more appropriate for work-life balance because every person can figure out for themselves what they want to do they can work at night they can work one hour a day you know they can travel around the world with their family and work you know occasionally in the afternoon whatever they want to to do for their life this model permits that and and that is a net benefit to all of the participants of that system the the question in the test is okay cool that sounds all great can you actually align around one goal and produce a product an application that is revenue generating in some sense and revenue generating may only mean that the token value appreciates over time but some kind of economic activity has to be going on more and more people around the world have to be finding it valuable and it has to have a sense of of growth so um yeah that's the experiment and we will see well one thing i think uh you guys will find is that um you may have a whole new workforce a different type of workforce that begins to work within shapeshift right because the dow structure very much is uh is permissionless right so now you're not limited to the people inside of your contract or employment agreements anybody can come enter your discord and start dowing with shapeshift you might have some really interesting discoveries there so that's that's some of the benefit yeah we've already we've already seen this that you know there are people from other d5 community projects that have come into our discord in our forum and started proposing things that are kind of interesting ideas and this never would have happened in our closed kind of you know corporate state yeah it's it's incredible the amount of innovation and excitement you see in a doubt and it also generates in our experience too a lot of a lot more noise they have to find new ways to sort of uh filter through um one one other critique i'm just gonna keep my my critic hat on because i know you're thinking about this too is i think a critic might say yeah eric so now we have tokens and now they're on chain well those sound a lot like shares in the equity world and this whole thing is just going to collapse back to shareholder governance corporate structures boards of directors this is why we have the structures we have around shares and equity today and so dows are not struck not fundamentally any different than those things it'll just collapse to a corporate structure once again what do you think about that i think the mere fact that a person can buy one token and sell one token globally 24 7 at a liquid price demonstrates how different this is than any kind of normal corporate equity situation when there is a startup someone in some random country around the world can't go by ten dollars of that project and participate just by being involved in the forum right like that is something wholly new and i feel like is far more appropriate for the internet age um than the traditional equity structure so there are certainly overlaps and similarities between uh equity shares and tokens you know the governance of shape shift will revolve around those tokens just as the governance of corporate shape-shift revolves ultimately around the shareholders and the board of directors that are brought in by them so there's certainly there's certainly parallels and overlaps and it's not like everything in a normal corporation is bad you know there are some very good practices about organization among humans that have developed in the corporate world i think a lot of those same principles will emerge in the token-based world but what what you will get rid of is a lot of the corporate bureaucratic cruft that is not necessary and is not productive for a digital global project in the 21st century you know what blew my mind is uh when david had the guys behind a dow infrastructure tool dow payment tool called coordinate on bankless and meet the nation and this is this tool yeah and it okay but this thing blew my mind eric because it's basically like um the dow allots a certain amount of tokens and then opens it up to out all dow members to essentially allocate these tokens to their peers and reward their peers for contribution in the dao so the cool thing about that is it gives the people who are in the trenches the ability to like um reward their nearest neighbor reward the person on their project who's contributing that they see doing something in the dow with some additional tokens it's like if employees were able to choose their local environment of other employees as to who they think should be rewarded the most exactly and this blew my mind because like so many times in the corporate world when i used to like live in that it's like we all know who the big contributors are and we all know who the freeloaders are essentially and the people who most know that aren't the bosses it it's those that are in the trenches actually working with these individuals imagine if employees have the ability to vote for who gets a bigger salary and that's what this protocol enables so there's so much of that i love that i love that and like just to you know to use ourselves as an example here shapeshift was never a large corporation you know we were 65 people you know a little over 100 at most and even at that level there is a degree of bureaucracy that is i would say counterproductive so in in our case as a company if someone in the trenches as you say wanted their peer to get a bonus that has to get raised through like at least one or two levels of managers there has to be a couple meetings about it oh it doesn't comply with the company's like bonus policy and there's a bonus policy review meeting coming up in a month and we can discuss it there right good ideas die in that environment and we're a fairly radical company we're not the kind we're not like a bunch of suits building process everywhere but a lot of those processes form in the corporate structure and i don't think they need to form in the decentralized token based structure that is the experiment that we're going to try to to see eric i'd like to get into the logistics of the fox token and the airdrop and the overall distribution of it because now fox token is the power of shapeshift out and the fox token had a massive air drop so what were the logistics of the airdrop who got how many fox tokens and why were those decisions made yeah so it was the it was the massivest airdrop [Music] the airdropped was it roughly 340 million tokens which is about a third of all of this all of the billion tokens out to um [Music] roughly a million past shape-shift customers and uh 120 000 members of um a bunch of d5 and ethereum based protocols including uniswap bitcoin urine ave a bunch of others um thor chain don't forget them so that's how we we we wanted it to be a large amount both in like number of recipients and in just a huge chunk of the aggregate supply of these things decentralization is a process and if we only distributed you know a tiny minority of these tokens out to the community then it's kind of going to be stillborn we tried to look at a lot of the other airdrops and projects that have done this successfully and built good communities around it one of the most important themes in lessons is that the advantage has to live with the outsiders instead of the insiders right the insiders definitely deserve something but they have to be at the disadvantage relative to the community and you don't have to be altruistic to make that decision because ultimately it is on in all of the insiders benefit at shapeshift for this to be a success long term as a open community so um there is a lot of people who totally got that internally and when when they're like well why you know why is why are strangers getting so many of these tokens they understood that it's because you have to foster and cultivate this this decentralized model um so yeah it ranged from 200 fox tokens at the smallest to several thousand fox tokens at the high end um based on how many times that address had traded with shapeshift or based on you know if if that person had registered a keepkey we gave them some extra bonuses um you know anyone in the fortune community we gave some extra bonuses because we just are in love with them so a lot of it was just like discretionary and it's it's always fun and easy to just dish out money to people and everyone feels good about that um so yeah we we tried to model it after some of the other projects that we'd seen to do a good job with it uh eric i just actually checked while we were talking and one of my addresses one of my test addresses i've got some fox tokens coming my way congratulations yeah congratulations so how can how can people see if they're if they're eligible and um like what's the best way to view that because part of what you probably want to do right now is just get the word out so that everyone who is old yeah knows they're eligible and where to where to check yeah so again it's the largest air drop in history in terms of recipients and so i would recommend everyone just check it out um [Music] fox.shapeshift.com airdrop and you can check addresses there you can actually claim your airdrop for an address that you can't connect here so let's say you'd use shapeshift in the past with a wallet that is not like a web3 wallet not metamask or something you can go to this site check that address it'll tell you that it's eligible and then you can pay the gas fee to claim that with a different wallet so you could pay that gas fee with a metamask and then the fox tokens will be sent to that address that was eligible um the window here is 90 days from last wednesday from the 14th of july so people have some time to claim it but after that anything that's unclaimed will be dumped into the dow treasury uh to the benefit of all the current fox token holders and that's very much the uh the unit swap model as well right like you and a swap everywhere a lot people got the uni tokens and almost anyone could claim any of the the uni tokens and as a user experience that kind of model i thought was was the best of all the air drops that i've seen out there um there's also a liquidity mining coming for fox tokens can you go into details around that yeah so that started 48 48 hours after launch um we felt it was a best practice to not start that right at launch because those early yields are just so atrociously large like give everyone a chance to get on the starting line um an emotion so that started that point in time too yeah exactly um so that started friday of last week and it's a three-month program where we have just committed millions of tokens to be dumped into the uh uniswap v2 fox e liquidity pool and so the yields even right now the pools have gotten pretty deep but the yields are still in the 400 to 500 apr range those yields will fall to the degree that the pools increase so our goal here was to build liquidity for the fox token so we wanted to incentivize people that got their airdrop to put that into the liquidity pool because then you get liquidity in the token and that benefits everyone so that has been working fantastically well and um the liquidity pool is just hovering under around 10 million uh dollars in fox tokens are you guys going to be doing anything with the uniswap v3 to you eric yeah so we we struggled with this because v3 is awesome um we were trying to use contracts which had been vetted by other airdrops and liquidity mining and which had been audited so we didn't want to be writing a bunch of new stuff uh and putting it all out there just to get into the v3 version of uniswap so we made the decision to stick with the tried and true contracts that were available for you swap p2 that is awesome guys we are going to be back with eric voorhees there's so much more to talk about the nation state and d5 the dow experience uh so far crypto in 2021 and some broader topics like that so stay tuned before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dial no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right bankless nation we are back with eric voorhees and the brand new shapeshift dao and eric it has been seven long days since the launch of shapeshift dao what's happened uh what's uh anything happened in the last seven days i know the earliest like first uh days after a token air drop and a dow launcher some of the most chaotic and most hectic uh what are your takeaways after after the last seven days yeah uh so we were very excited to see the community response we thought it would be very good and it was so that was really confirming um we got a lot of people pouring into the discord and asking lots of good questions you know and there's always the people that are like well why wasn't i included in the air drop you know so that's going to be inevitable there is um inevitable for sure yeah you know one thing that i really wanted to see was the media picking up on not just that just this is just like a shape-shift story of what it is doing but that this process of dalifying a centralized company is potentially the start of an important new trend in business and in organizational development and they absolutely caught on to that theme so um i was excited to see that and you know i don't i don't really want to talk a lot about the fox token price but i was glad to see that it ended far above where it started the day i thought that was a great sign it was not nearly as volatile as i thought it would be it kind of just shot up and has been hovering 4x over where it was before um so that was that was good the liquidity pools filled up and we've been getting lots of you know great ideas coming into the the forums and people like just signing up for these governance tools so that that process of building that dao community which is ultimately what any dao has to rely on um all that's going really well you know and we're we're learning as we go here so we don't really have anything to compare this to but so far so good what are kind of your expectations for for like the next six months like if the dow achieves everything you hope it will where will we be by the start of you know january 2022 so by the start of january 2022 if things go well um most of shapeshift's code will have been opened up maybe not everything we will have had a number of successful governance vote on important topics and the shapeshift entity will have been mostly wound down although the uh the entity itself may not be closed until we can file like our last tax return so i don't know when that will happen but um that would that's where i hope things will be by by january um the dow doesn't need to do anything magical or or huge by then it just needs to start forming its base and its community and start getting that muscle of governance going eric i think you're going to have a unique perspective on this on this next question and topic because um you know you've been around around with with regulators in the past and seen them sort of increase their maybe enforcement or presence in crypto as as the years have gone by i think a lot of us are curious about um defy right so you've outsourced some of these regulatory functions um to to the to the chain you know custody for for one and now also um like the uh i guess almost the the operating agreement the guts of a token to on chain two um but from a regulator's perspective if you're an aggressive i guess um top down you want the nation state in all of this finance stuff and money stuff and there's some of those that that sit in congress in the us i know that doesn't surprise you uh and you're a crypto skeptic i mean recently they've been talking about turning all the stable coin issuers basically into banks making them have chartered uh bank licenses and they from their perspective they feel like they're kind of playing whack-a-mole right so i chase shape shape-shift and and vorhees into a into a dex model and now he's now he's like protecting himself and he's downifying and so now i'm gonna now i'm gonna chase him into defy um what do you think the the threat for d phi is maybe the existential threat or the concern that that d shot defy should have with respect to regulators do you think that they're going to come after this industry in an aggressive way yeah well this this is a key question in this topic it's always important to understand that regulators are varied right there are many different countries in the world and different jurisdictions within those countries and among regulators you have differences of opinion so it's not like they're just this one homogenous crowd that said you certainly have an entire industry of financial institutional regulators who believe their purpose on earth is to surveil financial transactions of all people that's their current job they believe that that's important they believe that it helps society i'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they have good intentions and yet now has emerged a set of technologies which are financial in nature and which cannot be stopped they cannot be changed by any central party they can be regulated in name only but they will keep on functioning as the rules of the immutable code declare they will so you get all these regulators who only want to regulate financial transactions and then these financial systems that are unregulateable at least on the base layer this clash is the story of the rise of the cryptocurrency industry none of us know how it will unfold and it will be something that takes place over many years and with many battlefields and unfortunately with many casualties hope is that a lot of these regulators recognize this financial technology brings about a degree of soundness and transparency transparency and honestness and gives the entire world a level of access to financial services which their prior status quo financial system has never been able to do and that they will see that as virtuous even if they realize that some of the things about it they don't like i i would hope that they don't see it as a pure enemy to them even though it will clash with many of their objectives this has kind of always been my hope and we've had many in the podcast including like people like ben hunt who are like hey you'll never get this crypto thing to work is because governments don't want they want to control the money system right and my my hope and my response to to that um you know critique or that idea is basically like you know what we're going to do in crypto so we're going to make this industry and these tools so damn useful that regulators will have to embrace it that their population will like rebel against them if if if governments try to to quash this industry and quell it like the internet right i mean i'm sure in the early days of the internet there were those who uh were of the mindset that like you know look uh this communication technology is is is too powerful for everyday citizens uh to have right yeah well strong cryptography exactly strong cryptography another example you share that hope what do you think yeah so for those who don't notice uh strong cryptography was illegal to normal usage it was considered a munition and could not be like exported out of the united states and there was a whole series of regulatory battles about this in the 90s it became so damn useful that the entire world had to let it be open and available to everyone even though it allows all people to hide messages from surveillance i think that parallel is really important when it comes to financial technology in the same way that you should allow all people to hide messages from government surveillance the same thing is true for financial transactions there is no reason that that finance is less deserving of privacy than communication and ideas generally and just as it is legal today to go encrypt your email in a strong way that not even the nsa can interpret so too should it be legal to have privacy in your finances this is not a popular concept right most people seem to support the status quo where the government surveils all financial transactions of all people it's incredibly orwellian and creepy and unethical and i would hope that especially as the younger generations grow up in a world in which they have the option of financial privacy many more of them will start to care passionately about that as an important social cause eric since you have been in this industry for as long as you have been i and i want to get your reflections as to where you find us in 2021 have we exceeded your expectations as to where you thought we would be back in the early days of bitcoin in 2012 2013 or are there parts of this industry that you wish is perhaps falling behind what you wish we were at by this time now uh just what are your reflections on the state of crypto in 2021 yeah it's it's done so incredibly well um and it's so much more diverse than when it first started as bitcoin so my naive hopes and dreams in 2011 as a bitcoiner was that bitcoin becomes the dominant form of money on earth and that it over it outcompetes fiat and fiat goes away and governments are restricted in their ability to debase currencies that was my ultimate hope um bitcoin is absolutely on that trajectory and though it is taking longer than i would prefer it's it's absolutely getting there and the chances of that happening today are far greater than they were back in 2011. but beyond that you have ethereum and these smart contracts and all of this immutable financial tooling which i certainly couldn't have conceived of back then and it is accelerating so fast and in so many directions um you can't help but be inspired and almost a little scared by the power of this technology and how quickly it is growing so i would say that it has more than lived up to my expectations and it is really transforming the world um in a very visible way right now so i'm just i'm just so happy to be part of it and i'm in awe of all these brilliant people that have flowed into this industry and are helping to build it what about this industry has actually uh disappointed you what have we not uh met your expectations with that's easy the the maximalism that's that poison is really what makes me the most depressed particularly about bitcoin um there are certainly ethereum maximalists but they're relatively few most maximalists are bitcoin maximalists and the degree of toxicity negativity anti-innovation anti-open-mindedness tribalism relig religious dogmatism to an orange coin rather than the principles on which that orange coin was built has been frankly really disgusting to me and i've been very sad to see it um it is still a minority of bitcoiners that are like that so i take you know i take heart in that and certainly the maxis are like the loudest ones on twitter so on some degree they're kind of irrelevant and can be dismissed and forgotten about but they they bother me because i feel like that is my tribe and i do not like seeing people that i associate and agree with on 99 of things act like total and degrade the wonderful quality of work and innovation that's happening elsewhere do you know eric at bitcoin miami anyway there was uh i i think there was a session um talking about the virtues of maximalism talking about max toxic maximalism yeah toxic maximalism saying that it actually strengthened bitcoin that that further bitcoin needed it maybe even further that if you weren't toxic maximalist like you were you know against freedom bitcoin you're against freedom i mean uh what about that argument that hey bitcoin does need some toxic maximalists that are going to hold the line no matter what do you subscribe to that no and i was backstage when that comment was made i was getting ready to go up and moderate the next panel um i was like horrified to hear that uh yeah if if you're not if you're not a supportive of toxic maximalism you were against bitcoin and you were against freedom that was like just such obnoxious propaganda that i would expect from like like a government agency in the cold war but not from bitcoiners right not from not from people who who have built this open source open immutable protocol for the world to benefit from to the maximalist credit they do have some good arguments and they do do some important things it is understandable that they rail against all these altcoins and coins as they call them because there are so many coins there are so many nonsense assets that are stupid pointless and many that are just downright scams that's all very true but there's a big difference in highlighting that there are many scams and you need to be skeptical and careful and saying that everything other than bitcoin by default is a coin is worthless is a scam nothing other than bitcoin could be decentralized and everything working on everyone on anything else is a bad actor um so i hope that the toxic maximalism will like recede at some point i don't see that happening it seems to be growing um and being at that conference that was the first time i was at a bitcoin conference where i was embarrassed about calling myself a bitcoiner i have never felt that feeling before but i was embarrassed hearing that and it really made me just feel awful uh as i left that as i left that stage i had made a comment about um that toxic maximalist thing i said that was as just my opening line and got some laughs and it got a bunch of booze in the audience and as i was leaving the auditorium i was getting heckled by people who were calling me this like coiner and just like yelling out insults um that has never that has ever been a thing at bitcoin conferences like so there was a cultural change that i sensed that was really disheartening and again most bitcoiners are not at all like that so i don't want to convey that at all but um the ones that always like situations also really loud yeah yeah uh i think it comes down to a lot of insecurity about bitcoin a lot of these people got into bitcoin far later than i did even though they had heard of it what were they doing in 2011 2012 2013 why aren't they supporting bitcoin then i think it's because they did not have the open mindedness the creativity and the foresight to realize why bitcoin was actually valuable in the first place and by the time they got involved it was because it was socially acceptable enough that they felt comfortable stepping into it after a thousand pioneers had already done it those are the very type of people that don't understand why bitcoin is valuable in the first place and so it's no wonder that they lash out against other projects because they are insecure about their own justification for being in it eric he's maximalist slayer my friend let's uh let's talk about something that is um is more exciting uh right so you know some of the negatives maximalism but what about the current state of crypto really excites you like what makes you most optimistic is it is it this dow thing that you're doing is it defy is it nfts is it layer two is it thor chain is it something else so it's not nfts nfcs are cool i think they're real i think they'll be around i think they will change society in some really fun ways i'm not personally passionate about them dows are really cool but very unproven and very untested i think what is most exciting for me right now is the d5 stuff and i don't care what chain it's on it is these decentralized immutable protocols which can do financial transactions without any intermediary um which are more powerful than i believe their creators realize i see things like ave where you could put up some crypto and get a loan backed by ave or or liquidy where you can put up crypto and get like a zero interest loan backed by that with no middleman involved whatsoever and you can do the whole thing in five seconds from anywhere in the world on a phone and i i have to just be in awe at how destroyed the banking system is going to get as this tidal wave approaches they are so far behind the curve and as the world becomes comfortable with using things like metamask which is not that hard right it's not that hard as the world gets comfortable with using those tools what the hell are banks going to be doing like why why in the world would you ever use a bank i mean the last reason to use a bank for a crypto person was to get the stability of fiat when you wanted to exit the volatility of crypto that's been solved with stable coins right so the the path into the stuff is a path that you don't emerge from you do not go back to banks and they are set up in such a way that they cannot be innovative enough to ever catch up to this stuff ever so that the banks that people are going to use in the future are just these open source interfaces and the functions and the services that people access are just going to be these open source protocols i think it's going to bring a great deal of wealth generation to the entire world regardless of who you are or where you are it's going to be a great equalizer and i think it's going to make the world a far better place so that's what excites me right now you are speaking the bankless language my friend is fantastic could not agree more um i want to end with this question because you've been in crypto for almost a decade eric and like we we don't have guests like that on bank list there are very few of you uh out there um but there are a lot of people listing where this this cryptocycle is kind of their their first cycle their first foray into crypto right and we've had this this bull run up and now it's down a little bit people are wondering if the bear is back bowler bear whatever what advice do you have for people in their first crypto cycle right now what would you tell them they they should be doing well i'll tell them about my first cryptocycle my first cryptocycle bitcoin was five dollars by the time i could get some it was seven dollars uh it rallied over the next couple months to 31 and i was like yes the revolution is upon us it's happening everything i thought about bitcoin was correct it's going to take over the world i'm so smart that bubble popped and for the next nine to twelve months it miserably decayed down to two dollars and everyone in the world made fun of it um dismissed all of us who believed in it and frankly the scoreboard was in their favor they could point to the bubble clearly and say that was a bubble you know congratulations for buying a bunch of stupid digital beanie babies you idiot and that was like a 95 decline right in an asset which had never come back from a bubble because it had never had one before this pullback from sixty thousand dollar bitcoin to thirty thousand dollar bitcoin i don't care if it goes down to ten thousand dollars it's just part of the process you do not have an exponential asset rise to global domination without insane volatility in its ascent so for those who it's their first time in such a bubble zoom out and chill it's all going to be okay don't put in more money than you can lose assume it'll all go to zero and if it does are you going to be okay if not take some money off the table and for the rest of it just chill like it's all working it's building and growing the ecosystem is better than ever so don't worry too much about it and i say that even though i worry about it right i get stressed out i didn't like seeing it fall below 30k last night that's not fun but you got to separate that from like your cognitive ability to recognize where the stuff's all going zoom out and chill is going to be a line that i'm going to repeat a number of times over the course of my history in crypto eric this has been a lot of fun fantastic advice my friend congrats with everything in shapeshift the bank lists community will be looking at shapeshift and looking for ways to plug in thanks so much
