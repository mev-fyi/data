decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform

from synthetics all right happy 2021 to everyone let's start with bitcoin dude it just hit 40k as we're recording this yeah like 20 minutes before i recorded it and then wow actually like three thousand dollars right afterwards but okay it's still up there still pretty close to 40k which is pretty insane uh bitcoin has doubled its market cap in the last like three weeks that is crazy that has never happened before ever wow that is like absolutely we are in the bull market and um if you look at all of 2020 uh this was an interesting headline this week bitcoin actually closed 2020 as the best performing asset of the year no of the decade wow incredible so there is i feel like at this point there is uh i don't know what the line is but like you you never get fired for investing in ibm this is the point where like bitcoin people like won't get fired for investing in bitcoin i feel like we're crossing that bridge the best performing asset of a decade is unignorable asset managers money managers like there's now like stronger deniability with investing in bitcoin at this point which i think is just really strong tailwinds it's definitely on the radar for institutions everywhere even jp morgan so jp morgan said a long term price target at bitcoin of bitcoin uh just this week for 146k david you think that's bullish or bearish coming from jp morgan my price target is higher than that but jp jordan a bank that used to be bearish bitcoin now saying that bitcoin is going to reach almost 150 000 i don't know how they came to such a accurate number 146 000 that's very specific i haven't read the article maybe i should have read that before we got into this uh but still like banks setting extremely high price targets for bitcoin i think the coolest thing about this is that um banks are understanding or legacy institutions are understanding that this industry moves in exponentials it's not that bitcoin is at 40 000 and then next year it's going to be 55 000 they understand that bitcoin is going to you know put on five times or something it's market cap absolutely okay speaking of exponentials ether the price of ether has been on a tear lately wow what did we do over the last seven days yeah we over the last seven days we have climbed from just seven hundred and fifty dollars to just under thirteen hundred dollars mind you the all-time high price for ether is 14 020 we still have a little bit to go this kind of feels like when bitcoin was hovering around the 9 000 mark really flirting with all-time highs but you know making sure it really melts the you know crypto twitter and all of our attention out of it saying like when's it going to break all time high when's it gonna be high now ether is doing that same thing just dancing right under all-time highs that's gonna be really a really fun day when it finally breaks ether's just teasing us guys but it did break something it broke its market cap all-time high of course which 150 145 billion or so and of course market cap all-time high is different than price all-time high because over the last couple of years ether supplies increased at a rate of about four percent or so per year so we've already broken that number david the only thing left is that magic number of 14 20. so guys 14 20 is the all-time high number to beat and as you talked about on state of the nation last week david do you remember 2018 2019 bears when everyone was saying ether would never hit its all-time high again it was just a flash in the pan a brief moment in time with the ico search and now here we are david right on the cusp pretty exciting and i feel vindicated at least because we've been talking about this for the last two years right yeah you know what i was doing when ether was like a hundred dollars and people were saying that ether is going to go to zero you know what i was during that time were you crying david or were you like no i was pulling out my calculator and calculating how much i had and how what how much money i would have if ether made it back to its all-time high that was two years ago and now we're almost at that point that i envisioned when i was pulling out that calculator for sure it's uh it's it's pretty exciting times for all of crypto and especially for those eath bulls who who've been hanging in the trenches over the last two years also for the d5 bulls so the d5 pulse index just hit 180 that's an all-time high as well right yeah d5 tokens are are are heating up right they still really haven't had their day uh today actually uh yfi one of my favorite assets uh finally broke through it's like twenty four thousand mark to jump all the way to thirty five thousand ave is at an all-time high of a hundred and twenty plus dollars uni is moving up to six and a half dollars so defy tokens are really strong but still haven't stolen the show yet and that is something that we'll talk about later in this weekly roll up uh i think that that is coming you know what's interesting about the the unit swap market cap is right is like um somewhat people are going to start benchmarking that with a coin base ipo market cap because like unit swap at brief moments last year surpass coinbase as far as exchange volume so you you have to wonder what's a better buy at these prices is it the uniswap token or is it the coinbase ipo i guess we'll see yeah there is such an easy comparison between coinbase which is going public on a stock market which with uniswap that's already public in d5 right and doing comparable amounts of volume if you are trying to get into and gain exposure to the defy ecosystem to leverage all the principles that defy offers uh uniswap is a perfect asset for that with a legacy comparison and that legacy comparison is theoretically going to go public at 50 billion dollars where uniswap is under 2 billion dollars in market cap there is an alpha there there is possibly some alpha now there you know some critics of that sentiment would say hey it's a governance token it doesn't have the cash flow guarantees that something like coinbase uh would have and and fair enough but as we've talked about before these are emerging as defy capital assets so we think that comes into play soon you know the other thing when we talk about bull markets and how it's face melting this is the kind of thing we're talking about like i didn't even know we hit 22 over 22 billion in total locked value in d5 and i didn't even notice david it seems like only yesterday we were celebrating 1 billion right total locked in d5 here we are at 22. just last week it was like 15. what's going on dude my face is getting melted yeah for listeners who listened to last week's weekly roll up we were at 14.4 billion locked in defi today we're at 22.8 billion locked in d5 and i remember making a tweet uh something along the lines of uh in 2019 that uh hey like uh we locked a value locked in d fi just hit 10 billion dollars and that was last week and no one noticed and like the same thing's happening with 22 billion no one's really seems to be surprised i think the next stop is really going to be a hundred billion dollars just like uh there's a conversation we're gonna have later in the episode but things move in exponentials yeah i almost feel nostalgic right it's like the only only time we celebrate this stuff going to be like from one we celebrated that and 100 billion maybe we'll have to see if that's the case another thing to celebrate i suppose is it this one was passed me by too we have 1 trillion market cap if you look at all crypto asset market caps in total so this includes ether this includes um bitcoin this includes all the defy assets some other things to you thrown in one trillion market cap the world's got to be paying attention to an asset class that has grown from zero 11 years ago to one trillion dollars don't they yeah one trillion is a big number nothing more to say about that okay we've got a few other things uh that we could talk about one is a 2020 asset returns summary if you look at just like 2020 the standout assets were bitcoin and ether so bitcoin was up 300 over the year uh ether was up 469 percent the nasdaq had quite a good year but that was 44 right so again low numbers low numbers gold had a good year at 25 but we're in crypto and we're like oh you know 460 percent a pretty good year man it's funny to see the comparison yeah anything below 50 is bearish in my mind that's because i'm spoiled and i'm in crypto all right um we also have ether like just chewing up um gas fees like all-time all-time high in terms of transaction revenue we'll talk about that more a bit later but like one day fees for a day last week it's driving 20 million in transaction fees right so like give me eip 1559 so we can burn some of that ether and make ether a better store of value uh another interesting thing i think in the context of like number go up price go up number go up is good for security right david number go up is ethereum's security mechanism that's exactly right uh according to this tweet if you are watching on the youtube it costs over a billion dollars to obtain a 66 stake which is how you if you want to be at the helm of ethereum that's how much it will cost you and then you also are have to be willing to burn that money and again as ether price goes up uh that number just goes even higher ethereum as as number goes up ethereum becomes more secure what a great safety mechanism yep becomes more secure more healthy also more trustless economic bandwidth as we talked about before okay that's market let's get to releases this is an interesting one what's going on with shapeshift yeah shapeshift run by eric voorhees a pretty prominent libertarian shapeshift used to be this uh platform where you could uh set up a trade where like you want to send shapeshift you know one asset and then shapeshift will send you back a different asset very much like like a centralized exchange it is a centralized exchange except the cool thing about it is it doesn't never ever holds on to your funds so it's relatively atomic so like if you want to trade your bitcoin they would give you a bitcoin address and then you would also put your ether address and you would receive ether from the exchange so you never actually had to deposit anything and because they weren't storing users funds they didn't take kyc the sec didn't like that and uh so they made shape shift take a take kyc which kind of was kind of killed their business model so something was it the sec or was it more fincen i don't know where it came uh listeners double check me on that anyways top-down regulators said you must do kyc he's a famous a famous libertarian didn't like that but complied regardless and so now they are pivoting to something different that allows them to remove kyc once again they are going from an exchange a typical exchange into a dex aggregator which doesn't which doesn't require kyc um and so shapeshift once again not a kyc exchange cool yeah and what's neat about this is like they're basically going to be a dex aggregator like a one inch right and this is another example of of protocol sync thesis right so now that these d5 protocols are available exchanges are deciding to build on top of them and in the case of shapeshift they're like we're getting rid of what we did before and completely switching out our architecture so pretty exciting we're gonna have vorkeys on actually next week right david yeah voorhees is coming on the tuesday state of the nation we're gonna talk about this transition from a exchange to a dex aggregator and then we're also going to talk about regulation because i know eric has very strong opinions about that yeah absolutely okay another interesting thing that's going that's happening is um van eck just proposed an etf a bitcoin etf once again if you'll recall many of these bitcoin etfs in the past have been have been shot down by the sec uh in one form or another but now what's different uh we have a new sec chairperson uh so taking the helm and and also a number of these more nefarious i would say these gray sort of exchanges have been uh actually shut down by by the sec right so um bit max comes to mind of course so exactly you know this might be the timing i guess is what i would say and wouldn't it be ironic david if this bull market ended with a bitcoin etf just in sight right that was like close to the top i don't know it's possible uh what do you think i think the so so you're exactly right one of the biggest reasons why we haven't had a bitcoin etf yet is was cited because so much of um uh price discovery happens in offshore exchanges that was the explicit statement of the regulators as to why they are not approving a bitcoin etf but that was statements made before bitmex was shut down and i don't know if you've noticed but ever since bitmex has been shut down there have been very few barts uh the market has been very very stable price wait tell someone what a bart is if a bar is when like bitcoin or ether just jumps like three thousand dollars up or down uh what what the sen the speculation as to what was happening is that people would use bit mechs very large wealthy individuals whales would manipulate the market they would go um what's called sniping for leveraged longs or leveraged shorts if there were too many people leveraged long they would take their bitcoin they would dump it they would collect the liquidation penalties of people on bitmex and then they would just buy it back right and so they would pocket themselves you know five percent 10 on their bitcoin extremely shady stuff extremely uh non-desirable for retail and extremely undesirable for an etf that ended when bitmex uh went away we haven't seen any bart activity since bitmex went away the market the price discovery is happening more and more inside of u.s regulated exchanges that makes things like fincen and the sec and cftc much more secure in a decision around the etf so this is the first etf that's been proposed since that has happened that is a big difference here with that and i'm optimistic that this is going to happen dave the sec has got to do something right because there's no way for retail to get in on this market if they have like this is a retail store it is because if you look at the price of like the the trust products from grayscale which we talked about before right um they're completely out of whack uh yeah did you notice the the grayscale ether uh price in the last week yes i did it's crazy it went down while eath price went up which is the price almost doubled yet the e price asset the trust out of grayscale went down in price so i know so like due to the sec's inaction retail is getting ripped off because we don't have good ether and bitcoin etfs right it's it's absolutely crazy guys you guys can avoid this of course we we recommend that if you have like a an ira or something that you like uh you use a self-directed ira something like rocket dollar could help you you could try that but for most of mainstream like they're buying these crappy products because the sec is forcing them to buy them right they're prying they're buying a product with 150 premium which means they're paying 101.50 to access one dollar worth of ether and like this is no fault of grayscale this is just normal market activity because there isn't an etf so come on regulators let's let's start protecting retail here yeah please guys okay uh future swap v2 beta so this is uh more options more futures on ethereum this is a product that came out of the summer due to overwhelming interest they actually shut it down and they wanted to make sure that they had security intake and and they are dave do you think this is the year for options and futures products on uh ether like d5 native ones on chain futures on chain options that's exactly right a little known story that i think is underappreciated future swap opened up their alpha on chain and they also had this the one of the very first yield farms before it was called yield farming before comp was even issued the future swap was the initiation of yield farming and it was a very uh dampened story and the reason why i was so dampened is because so many degenerates aped in like 10 million dollars right which they which future swap was not ready for and so they prematurely shut it down because people wanted the future swap governance token again this was before comp was even issued and so because people yolo'd into all their money into uh future swap in order to farm the future swap governance token it received like a crazy amount of success and then they said like no no more this is crazy we don't want this much money these contracts are unaudited they shut it down and that was before defy summer now they are finally releasing their product on chain with the future swap v2 again part of the story of 2021 i think is that on-chain futures and on-chain options is going to be a thing and this is that story unfolding also kudos them for shutting things down doing something that is more responsible right a little bit of a self self regulation there is something happening capping the degeneracy yeah yeah absolutely okay yam is a food token speaking of uh degeneracy a food token that has now pivoted into a fully fledged dow and it's pretty exciting because they're actually releasing products here's one of them anything else you want to say umbrella is one of them it's an insurance product sort of similar to nexus mutual i suppose uh anything else you want to say about uh the yam dao story david yeah i actually haven't researched this product too well but the people that i trust have and they say that this is an insurance product that is uniquely different from nexus mutual a viable competitor and i do agree with you the interesting story about this is not only that there is a new viable competitor for insurance in defy but that it is a new protocol that is owned by another protocol that is pretty cool absolutely uh let's talk about this to you this is a transaction builder that someone came out with which i think really illustrates right so like david you were responsible for coming up with the money lego's meme right like a little known fact guys david doesn't like to brag about that but like he came up with the money legos meme and now we see it everywhere and it's an open as all memes are and this is a an example of somebody actually building a product on the many money lego meme it's called defy legos and what does it allow people to do yeah uh well i think the the ui is a little bit simple and i think it's going to get built out but basically i think the long-term vision of this is like drag-and-drop transaction ordering and transaction creation and so it it has a number of different options right you can deposit from ave withdraw from as a flash loan from from instadap and do a bunch of other things trade on unit swap and it allows you to construct a transaction all at once so if you want to execute these things all in one transaction it allows you to do that and that used to be a ability that only the solidity experts were able to do and now this is a ui for people to recreate a complex transaction just by filling in some fields i think that this is a really cool uh really underappreciated possibility i think that's going to take some time to really refine how this works austin griffith has another product that's kind of similar to like this that's literally like kind of like microsoft paint and then you like drag and drop in different like features and options saying like well i want this to connect to this and then i want this to happen if this happens kind of like an if this than that builder i'm really bullish on like drag and drop money lego transaction builders and that seems to be what this is super cool programmable money guys is super cool speaking of programmable money this was an interesting posts that came out from coinbase about some programmable functionality that they added to usdc they did this actually i believe in like august or or september but this article sort of talks about how they did it how they made it upgradeable what do you think the takeaway is here david yeah yeah the really cool thing about contracts on ethereum is that they are upgradable and as we come to understand what we can do in ethereum what solidity is able to do in the code we come up with new and better things that we want to be able to execute on which means our old contracts become outdated however whoever deployed the contract at usdc deployed an upgradable contract and they actually finally used that upgradable contract to add in some new features and so literally the us dollar on ethereum got a software update there are now like larger and more diverse buildable surface areas on usdc and so i think that's something that is uniquely compelling about ethereum is that assets can get software updates and still be the same asset that's pretty cool yeah i mean think of a an update so like the the technology that we use for paper money is is basically paper right it wasn't always the case there was a time where we used uh coins but like when we switched to paper that was sort of a software uh i guess a real world update of something that's a hardware update a hardware update this is kind of like like similar in that we can change the medium around we can add features to our staple coins into our money on the software layer super cool stuff um all right david let's talk releases my friend actually never mind scratch that we just did that let's talk news so the big news of the week is this occ news so this is the um the office of comptroller of currency so this is like a big banking regulator in the us that brian brooks uh now runs the big news of the week is that federally charted banks so these are all u.s banks right now um the occ clarified that these federally chartered banks can now facilitate stablecoin transactions payments on their own using public networks like ethereum translate this for us david what does it mean yeah so yeah this just means that banks can use usdc to settle payments between each other i think that's going to be just a boon to efficiency and money transmitter services i i think just it's just the logical conclusion of this industry this is the entire thesis of like this crypto economy is that we can use blockchains to do our old things better as well as new things um i have a prediction coming out in the bank list newsletter uh which everyone should uh tune into it's coming out tomorrow 21 2021 predictions i think plenty of banks will adopt this service in order to facilitate payments between each other and but my spicy part of this prediction is that none of those uh none of the efficiency and none of that value captured the value of the increased value of being able to do this is actually going to be passed on to the end user i still think we're going to be taking one to three days to pass money between each other and there's still going to be limits and that's just going to be a boon for retail adoption of this industry that's my prediction so you think banks are going to continue to be rent seekers even as they deploy stable coins and not just use usdc of course they can uh deploy any stable coin they want on these banking networks the regulator clarified it for them um i i think what's happening here david is that like our prediction or bankless prediction of banks becoming ethereum side chains like ledgers off of ethereum is starting to come true using ethereum as a settlement layer for this sort of stable coin transaction so super exciting possibly the most bullish news i'll say of the year right because this is a short year it's definitely the most bullish news of the year bullish stable coins bullish ethereum as a settlement layer for them pretty exciting i think overall when will banks when will a bank ledger turn into an optimistic roll-up now that is an interesting question yeah and who will be the first i i i can guarantee you it won't be a jp morgan in front of me it's not gonna be wells fargo either exactly um speaking we were speaking earlier about grayscale um you know like at some level uh the products that they have i'm glad that they are available to retail because it's better than nothing but barry silbert you know grace greyscale's kind of um founder uh talked about the growth that they've seen in 2020 from 2 billion to over 20 billion in assets under management and the cool the interesting thing about this is he expects another 10x this year 200 billion in aum wow wow that's a big prediction and i'm with it i think that's an accurate prediction yeah we had michael sunshine ceo of grayscale on the podcast if you want to learn more about that and yeah again to no fault of their own for grayscale like it's kind of ripping off retail but that's a result of market dynamics and it's specifically a result of the extreme demand the the fact that like if you buy a uh one you need to buy one dollar and fifty cents worth of the eth e trust to get one dollar worth of ether that's not because of grayscale that's because ether the eth e trust is in such high demand that's just how that works and so it's kind of market forces that's ripping off retail so again no fault to their own for grayscale congratulations for getting 20 20 billion in that's a pretty good business yeah well done very pretty good business to be running right now um all right let's talk about the uh the biden administration so we've been talking a lot on bankless about this proposed rule uh that was coming out of uh fincen um mnuchin was behind that of course a secretary of treasury who is not very fond of of crypto but if like what could happen is that this entire proposed rule could be like just paused indefinitely right and it killed yeah and why this is just new administration stuff is that is that kind of why yeah so any any um any proposal or rules that have not been formally integrated into law by the time the biden administration comes into office in january 20th biden says none of them are going to happen and i don't think biden specifically cares about the law or regulation that we care about the fincen rule however it just falls into the category that if it's not finalized by the time biden gets in he's cutting it uh just because he doesn't uh doesn't agree with donald trump's decision making or any of his friends steve like steve mnuchin uh fine that's that's a win i'll take it yeah so that means mnuchin has to get this in before the 20th or it's not going in or it's dead in the water but if he does get it in i'm a little bit concerned that it stays in maybe david however there are over 6 000 comments that they by law have to review you know before they can get this in so there's a lot of time that they need to spend to review all those comments so maybe they're optimistic it doesn't go in the crypto industry maybe spam attacked them and that'll delay it well done guys we did it we'll see um also not it's not good news again and kind of like the uh the crypto banking side of things a crypto bank called bittrex which is exchange just de-listed their privacy coins monero dash and zcash i'm not sure if they were getting pressure from regulators against privacy coins or this was just like uh just in case our lawyers advise us to d-list but this is not good david yeah bittrex isn't the biggest exchange so i'm kind of curious as to why they decided to become first to d-list privacy coins um i actually don't know if if i know z-cash is on gemiini i'm pretty sure it's on coinbase i'm pretty sure monero is not on gemini or coinbase um dash uh we don't have to talk about dash i don't have strong opinions about cash um but yeah it seems weird that bittrex is is kind of going first with trying to de-list these these things i feel like they're you are right there is a story behind the scenes that we don't know but overall i don't like that i don't like that um this industry is taking action to protect themselves against regulators that also removes choice from users this is why we need defy guys because guess what uniswap cannot does not have the power to de-list your coin it's permissionless anyone can list anything they can't shut it down that's why we need these solutions to preserve our freedom of course jake travinsky our favorite crypto lawyer reminds us that in the u.s actually privacy is a constitutional right so we do have some of these freedoms baked into the the constitution uh it just remains to be seen whether these exchanges which are private businesses will will follow them or not it's it's definitely disappointing if centralized exchanges start to mass de-list these privacy coins but do you know what's interesting is is the work around once again is defy right ethereum for example is developing a privacy layer some technologies like aztec for example um they can be used to to uh like make a transaction a die transaction private so we we don't have privacy on the base layer of ethereum but we do have protocols that can add that privacy back in and that might be a nice back door to preserve this this uh monetary freedom that large governments are seemingly trying to take away and maybe exchanges are trying to take away as well yeah i've never really been compelled by the need for privacy to be integrated into one specific asset like we are seeing with zcash or monero i've always thought that privacy is a service not a not a not an asset right and i would rather have the ability to have my my ether or my die go through tornado cash or aztec if i wanted privacy so then i can keep my exposure to ether or my exposure to the us dollar and have that be private to me that just makes more sense i don't understand why i need my own l1 to have privacy but again that's a different conversation than what's going on here yeah absolutely it's a good conversation though um speaking of d5 unit swap had an incredible year i mean if you were to name one breakout d5 protocol that was just like yeah amazing it's got to be uniswap they did just did everything right liquidity on uniswap just passed a 3.1 billion that is approaching an all-time high the cool thing here is now they're doing it david without these uh these uni liquidity mining incentives right so like a lot of defy summer was different protocols turning on the juice by providing governance tokens uniswop's not doing that and they're still approaching their all-time high pretty incredible story yeah i wrote a article that a very short article and coined us recently that was all about how yield is only almost basically only existed in ethereum a 30-year treasury note is below 0.9 percent apy aaa corporate bonds are below 2 apy except if you are interested in digital assets a hybrid 50 50 each usdc position netted you a 35 apy over the year of 2020 if you are providing liquidity in uniswap that's why they don't need uni incentives it's because they're still getting 35 percent on their uscc ether position that is a lot of apy you know what's embarrassing is that that banks still call them savings accounts right like savings accounts what are you talking about i'm i'm making like point one percent it's not a savings account yeah numbers stay the same account no one's saving their money in those things not seriously all right david um iran is closing down some mining operations uh why does that matter what's the story here yeah we've previously talked about iran on the weekly rollups previously they were forcing mining operations to sell the iranian government their btc so the iranian government wanted a monopoly on the ability to purchase btc from um from mining operations and the thought there is that you know btc is permissionless iran is not able to use the us dollar or global payment networks due to sanctions and so they need they need the bitcoin and the only way that they can really get their hands on bitcoin is through their own miners i'm going to go ahead and guess that the illegal mining operations are ones that were not following this rule i think the uh the country of iran is just go they probably claim these for themselves this is probably now at this point the iran the iranian government is straight up mining bitcoin so that they can fund their own balance sheet because they don't have any other way i think that's what the story is here so do you know what else is interesting too it goes back to our conversation that we we had we put out a podcast uh just this this monday with uh vitalik right and he talked about one difference between proof of work and proof of stake is actually proof of stake can be more censorship resistant why it doesn't have this massive energy profile at the end of the day who controls the electricity grid like the nation state has a role in that we could we can see that you are like you you have a a grow up right or we can see that you are mining like massive amounts of btc you're you don't have a light profile there right whereas with proof of stake we can run it on a consumer laptop right so i do think that is a hidden benefit possibly of proof of stake versus proof of work and it's bearing out here like if a nation state has mining that's going on that it wants to control it can identify who the miners are and shut them down if it wishes yeah proof of stake does not have a real world footprint that's the takeaway that is the takeaway all right let's get into some you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith d5 visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited bunny goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's a-a-v-e all right let's get into some takes this is a first this is a a strong uh ethereum i don't know if you call him an ethereum maximalist if he is he's like one of the few mac ethereum activists i know uh but what is the stake from anti-pro antipro yeah says ask 10 different people which blockchain they think is second to ethereum and you'll get 10 different answers that right there is why ethereum has already won i haven't heard this tape before and i really really like it what anti is saying is that there is no consensus on a second place to ethereum therefore they the whoever would be included are is probably like a fourth or fifth or sixth there is no runner up to ethereum ethereum has the lead and it's probably going to keep it because there's no other viable competitor so speaking of ethics this is the the week for eth bull takes let's let's do an eth bowl take from our friend raul paul what's he what's he saying here yeah raul paul is comparing ether this cycle to bitcoin last cycle saying that the prices are really similar and he thinks that as a result of that ether is going to follow bitcoin in price leading up to bitcoin perhaps our ether almost touching 20k i think is the takeaway here uh really interesting to see rao paul being specifically really bullish ether uh he has a huge following and a lot of people listen to what he says absolutely and he's been particularly harsh on bitcoin maximalists lately who are who are basically saying hey bitcoin is the only asset that will ever appreciate in value and raul paul is just looking at it more objectively and he's saying um that's not what's happening that's not what's happened historically that's not what the price charts are saying that's not what sort of the uh he even looks at like active addresses versus eth price and he shows like a similar correlation actually like a um a higher growth rate of ether versus bitcoin so his conclusion is basically more objective he doesn't have a religious preference on this he's even like bankless he doesn't even care about being bankless right right um he told us that on the podcast he's just looking at it and and being like oh eth to me looks a lot like bitcoin in 2017. sorry maximalist yeah at the end of the day it doesn't matter what your religious beliefs about crypto are the fundamentals behind ethereum speak for themselves and that's what rel is tapping into here absolutely here's another take from uh dc investor and i really like this take he's comparing ether market cap today to a bank market cap what's what's he say here yeah he says ether at 1 4 140 billion dollar market cap just passed citigroup's market cap at 135 billion dollars just one bank ethereum is a permissionless protocol that will eat all banks uh ether the market cap of ether equaling one single bank in the united states means that to me that the market cap of ether is extremely undervalued to this day i expect ether to be worth more than one bank in the future it's kind of an interesting conversation of like how you define the total addressable market size of a thing right there there was a time where we thought like the total addressable market size of uber was like maybe all taxis all taxi fares in the world um but it turns out it's it's far beyond that it's a multiple of that it is a multiple of that and and the reason is because like people can start using uber more than they ever used uh taxis right like i'm gonna get rid of my car and just use uber so it turns out that it's at lower cost so this is also what dc is saying i think that like hey the way we think about the market cap of of these things uh the total addressable market cap for ethereum is obviously many multiples of the bank it's not even valued at a bank stop a stock right now so so he's making the case that it is uh under undervalued for sure um you made an interesting case this week too in the opening note on monday in bankless where like you you talked about and this is probably from your experience living through 2017 right we talked about the rex reflexivity this is a term um from george soros i believe that really uh resonates i think with what what goes on in crypto markets can you tell us what reflexivity is and like what's just happened yeah reflexivity is people reacting and making decisions based off of other people's reactions and decisions right and so it this is when the crypto markets this is why crypto markets generate like these hype cycles and bubbles that ultimately do burst right it's because people are basing their decisions on other people's decisions and not about fundamentals and what that's what happens when bitcoin blasts through twenty thousand dollars we lose the ability to like chart and do technical analysis if that's what your deal is we lose the ability to measure fundamentals people price in future growth uh extremely aggressively and we just kind of lose ground with reality right in into maybe to use the moon metaphor we are perhaps launching into space but in space you have no foundation you have no footing you are kind of floating you don't know how to evaluate these things because no one else knows how to evaluate these things so everyone is kind of just using their best guesswork and because things are disconnected from reality uh fundamentals are irrelevant and reflexivity takes over and that's actually partly why something can go and become really really bullish is because we've lost reality with the fundamentals and because there's almost nothing stopping ether from doing something insanely i'm gonna say stupid and going to 10k because like i'm i'm gonna tell you ether is not worth 10k but that doesn't mean it's not going to go there it's just i don't think the fundamentals back it up but it's still going it's still probably going to go there because reflexivity is in and fundamentals are out interesting and crypto market cycles of course are reflective up there are also reflective down if you lived through 2018 and you saw 2019 and you saw an ether price decline of 95 you can attest to that they are reflexive they go way under what they should be priced at as well so you're saying we're going to see that and we've already entered maybe the early stage of this reflexive market so what what people tend to do in the early stages of a bull market i think are they actually like um undersize how big this thing could get and that's what you're saying here like wait for it to get stupid because it has every other market that's what reflexive markets do they get really stupid that's exactly right all right um david let's go to uh what what you're excited about so what are you excited about this week yeah what am i excited about i am excited about alt season i'm going to say it um the the cycle to me and this is not something that people should plan on but if we want to be extremely rough the cycle goes bitcoin goes up then ether goes up then tokens go up and then maybe there's a correction i think we are about to enter the phase where tokens go up and that's and that's uh the other half of this take is that the crypto market cap just passed one trillion dollars and when people see that their reflexes will tell them wow fomo i want to get in and when and people i think have a hard time understanding exponentials in this world we tend to think in linear growth you know the s p grows at seven percent a year well you know bitcoin and ethereum they are average one to two percent per day on on some of their years which is pretty insane that reflexivity i think is going to kick in now that we just passed one trillion dollars in market cap the next stop isn't two trillion the next stop is 10 trillion dollars this industry grows in exponentials and part of the way that that implies a 10x growth in in the assets across the board right i don't think bitcoin is going to do a 10x that would put bitcoin at 400 000 i don't think bitcoin is going that high uh and i think the the way that we get from a 1 trillion dollar market cap to a 10 trillion dollar market cap is growth in alt coins in low market low market cap coins that go from something like 10 million dollars and then they grow to like 200 million dollars that's where i think the bulk of this market cap growth is going to come from and how we get to a market gap growth of 10 10 trillion dollars it's all season i think all season is coming that's going to be pretty fun to watch uh also hold on to your pants i uh i agree with a little a lot of what you said david but i i've got to say i hate the term all season i know you i do you know i do like so my question is like is ethan alt to you no ethan's not an alt to me to me uh alts are do we have to use this term anymore like yeah i think we do because because they all tend to move as a group right and and they is like the the assets and coins that maybe maybe the category is like certain market cap so maybe it's like and i wouldn't say like uni is an alt or wi-fi isn't all it's like i think we could be more strategic and precise about how we categorize them but if they all start moving at the same time and they're distinct from ether and bitcoin then we need to categorize them at some point in time and i know you like to categorize them and i'm totally agree with you as like capital assets or store value assets but the capital assets or store or whatever assets those type of categories don't categorize the the kinds of tokens that all tend to pump together and it's usually just if i don't know how else to categorize it other than alternative to bitcoin and ether i get so i get what you're saying there from like a trader's perspective right if you're saying hey like i'm looking at cycles and then this happens generally and then this pattern happens and then that happens right so like there's there's some seasonality in cycles so i guess i see it from that perspective where i think it's misleading and where i think uh particularly like maximalists overuse the term alt is they tend to think of anything that's not bitcoin is an alt right and what they mean is like kind of like a um a fake bitcoin something that is like scammy and won't accrue value long term and the other mistake they make is like so ether is not an alt of of of bitcoin like alt was a term that came in like 2013 2014 where you had like litecoin and all of bitcoin forks right and i think that's still a good term for bitcoin forks but it's not a good term for ether ether has an entire economy behind it it's also not a good term for um defy tokens defy tokens are like capital assets as as you were saying right so it's like it's not even competing with bitcoin as a money it's more competing against like like stocks right right um so that's why i hate the term alt but i understand using it for like the the seasonality cycles as long as people like understand that there are these distinctions there i'm good with it calling uni or calling wifi or comp or whatever calling them an altcoin definitely does not do them justice and it definitely doesn't do anybody who's trying to learn about this ecosystem any justice at all there's a much bigger picture behind the scenes but again at some point in time when the bull market comes those those fundamentals don't matter because reflexivity kicks in and reflexivity is going to kick into lower cap market cap coins and i guess we just call them alts yeah i got you i i hear you on that okay ron what are you excited about um i'm excited about like right now it's hard not to be excited about price right like ether bitcoin exceeding all-time highs people said it was dead would never happen uh ether on the cusp of exceeding all-time highs right people said it was dead people said it would never happen that's what's really exciting right now in the market but it might not always be the case so like i guess some some thoughts as we're entering a bull market i know you've given some some good advice on this recently which is like have some sell targets too okay so like what david just said about market cap going up to to 10 trillion is not a certainty it's not a for sure thing right like we don't know so don't um put all your eggs in that basket don't do stupid things like get in over leverage or like you know get into kind of margin positions that you're not comfortable with have some sell targets and stick to it but one of the most important things i think uh that you could do this bull market is be comfortable holding through some temporary pullbacks as well right so what can happen in a bull market is you can get like uh a few weeks or a month and you can get like forty percent even fifty percent microbial that doesn't necessarily mark micro bear markets that doesn't necessarily end the entire uh bull market but it it does shake out a lot of the people who are there like um that just kind of fill mode in and that now they think the bull market's over so they're certain they're gone so if you want to participate in this entire cycle you've got to be comfortable as well holding through a 40 drop don't sell just because you see something to that effect so this is kind of a mixed message here if like you got to keep your to your you sell plan make sure you have a number and stick to it but also be ready expect 40 pullbacks doesn't mean we are knocked out of a bull market yet um that's what i would say to kind of end this david anything else yeah definitely in 2021 all the listeners here if they plan on sticking through crypto through 2021 you will experience pain your portfolio is going to go down multiple times we are experiencing perhaps a version of euphoria right now with a bitcoin at 40k and ether just below all-time high it feels great we are going to feel the inverse of that you need to know that that is coming it's naive to think that it's not so be prepared for it pain always comes and you can definitely get out over your skis if you are not ready for that so make sure that you know exactly what you're doing and you are prepared for pullbacks absolutely all right guys so of course uh we say these things but none of it is financial advice it's it's just kind of based on our experience bitcoin ether defy assets are risky but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey this has been our weekly roll up thanks a lot
