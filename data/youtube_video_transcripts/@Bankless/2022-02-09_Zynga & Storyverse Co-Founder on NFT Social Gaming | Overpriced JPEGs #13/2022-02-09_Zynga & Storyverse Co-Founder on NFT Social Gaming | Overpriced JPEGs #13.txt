what if it wasn't just a jpeg in your in your profile picture what if we could take this character and and we can make them come to life and so like the simple way i like to put the story verse is that we we bring nfts to life [Music] hello folks welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley today on the show i have justin waldron justin at 19 years old co-founded zynga which is the company that went on to make farmville and the earliest like facebook poker games and mafia wars i believe was one of their games anyways he was uh involved in the very early days of social gaming in some ways invented the prototype for it and so much of it is a precursor to what has come and what has played out in web 3. and what's been fun for me in preparing for this conversation and preparing for this interview looking back and learning more about the history of zynga and the history of early social gaming and and just having all of these like retrospective aha moments if that makes sense it's been fun to realize how all of these things that i now take for granted as obvious were at one point themselves innovative you know we talk in this episode about in-app purchases or buying poker chips like in a game on facebook and and how that was new at the time that somebody would do that in that way and um and i don't know just that feeling so revelatory and then so relevant for where we are today with nfts so we get into all of that we talk about his history but the the real reason i had justin on is for a new project that he's launched called storyverse and justin approached me uh i guess a couple weeks ago now to tell me about what he was thinking with this project and it excited me from the very beginning i don't know what will happen with this i don't know if it'll succeed if it'll fail but i can say that the thinking here is is interesting and the thinking feels right in the sense that it sparks my imagination and it feels fresh and he's he's getting at things this space in my opinion really needs and starting to present solutions for how we can get them solving this problem of all these communities say they're gonna have a game and are community-led but how do we get to this end state of having a game i know there's there's a lot that i think um he starts to fill in the gaps for so without revealing too much because i want you to listen to this episode that's what we get into here and that's really why i wanted to have him on the show i will say i think i'm getting like 10 plots of story verse land uh as like an advisor to the project i have no idea what those are even worth or will be worth i think very little certainly at the beginning i am in no way having justin on because i'm getting these plots of land uh justin asked if i could help advise the project and i was sent an email saying that in exchange i'll be getting these this bit of land i do want to just say that uh but i just promise you that that zero impacted my decision to have him on or to show this project i just think it's interesting and i i think it's i hope it sparks your imagination as much as it did mine in terms of what the future could look like and where this space could go so with all of that preamble we are going to hear a word from our sponsors and then on to the interview with justin waldron everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse

overpriced jpegs i am so incredibly excited for today's episode on the show with me today we have justin waldron he was the co-founder of zynga which if you know it you probably know it for the game farmville that took over your facebook feed back in the i don't know 10 years ago and now the co-founder of placo and a very exciting web 3 project called storyverse which is really why we're here but i'm so excited for this conversation justin because i think i want to get into the history and what you built with zynga because you can trace with like a straight line some of the innovations and some of what you were responsible for pioneering with zynga to the world today of nfts and web 3. so we'll we'll talk about that history and sort of how you contributed to where we are i think in the work you've done um and we'll dive into that but just so excited to have you here and and to be chatting yeah thanks i'm really excited to chat about it cool well let's start off i mean give folks a little bit of your story and your background and and uh and we'll dive into zynga and how that came together sure so um i think for me i grew up playing games like a lot of other people um and from a young age i really i wanted to make them too i wanted to change things about the games i was i was playing and unfortunately um you know i started looking into what it would take to go and and make my own game on the playstation or something like this and you needed a development kit and they were tens of thousands of dollars and sony only sold them to official developers and i was i was a 12 year old boy looking to uh to make my own games and i and i couldn't so the only option i was left with was to really go and like figure out how to modify these these games and um and work on these sort of like cheat code devices where where i would like go and dig into the game and see if i could change little things about it and so from this very young age i was always thinking like well um if i don't have permission how do i take what i have and and make something out of it that i want it to be um and and that's really where like it got it got started for me and obviously you know the world is his of development has become a lot more accessible since then but um for me it was it was about sharing these these these things that i thought were interesting with other people um and so naturally like i became very interested in social networks i was lucky to have been um you know growing up when things like myspace were becoming very popular and again it was about finding ways to make my profile the coolest profile out of all my friends profiles and and finding ways to edit that and um and then ending up on facebook when it was just opening up to university right as i was coming into university and what was really interesting about that is shortly after they launched the platform um and i sort of like immediately thought like wow all the things that i've been doing sort of um without permission for the last 10 years i can now do with permission um and so instead of you know hacking aol and playstation games and in myspace pages where there are no apis facebook has come out and said we have apis you can build whatever you want on this platform and so for immediately for me it was like this really weird moment where i was like oh they want me to do that um and so i got very excited and i built something the day they put out the platform and it was a simple way to sort of connect to you with your friends um who also had a nintendo wii and to play games together and um after releasing that project um i i got in touch with uh mark pincus the the founding ceo of zynga and he was like well why don't we build some facebook stuff together and you know from there i went and i worked on and built our zinga poker game and you know obviously it became a much larger company with a lot more games after that um but for me like what was always fascinating was like this realization that there's there could be something great and there's a way to make it better and um like how do i how do i get involved with that and so for facebook i was like all my friends are here how do i how do i bring them together so we can play a game um and and and that's just been like probably the the constant theme of the things that have been interesting to me um as i've worked through uh my career more recently um you know what i noticed was that on mobile um these things weren't really happening um that in some way with the way the app store is is constructed it was it was harder to actually uh find a way to play games with your friends um because these apps are sort of their own silos it's hard to encourage your friend to go download the same game and so i started thinking about with my my co-founders at placo how do we how do we go and solve this problem on mobile and we realize you know there's a lot there's a lot to it there's technology that has to be built there are partnerships that have to be made um and and so we just set out to say like we should go build a company around this because it's not an easy problem to solve but we think we have a team to do it awesome and we'll talk about placo and sort of more in depth in the way you're you're innovating there or thinking about these problems you're looking to solve staying on zynga for for just a minute i'd love to hear you talk about a couple of the big innovations you think zynga really brought us i have some in my mind but i want to ask you first and then i may i may offer up some of my own as i've been doing research on on what you all did um it's a good question so i before before zynga um of course people were playing games on the web um and and people were developers were using products like flash or shockwave to to make interesting games on the web i think uh what hadn't happened was people really hadn't figured out a business model for games on the web and so you were seeing like hobbyists and and sort of um coders who who could been very talented but they weren't able to scale their ideas because they couldn't figure out how to make money from these games on the web and so we had websites like addictinggames.com or these places that had you know where game creators could make a little bit of ad revenue but it was never enough to sustain a team it was it was only like enough to sustain a person or two who are just passionate about what they were building um and and i think what we figured out at zingo was like in this model where where people could play games their friends that the distribution um cost could go low enough that you could get a lot of people to play and if and if some of them paid for the game they could fund the development of the game for everybody um and and now i think that's that's kind of like a widespread idea this is now called the freemium game model but um at the time it was it was very uh fringe and like people didn't think it would scale or exist in any any large group of people so what we were able to do was was bring these games out like farmville or mafia wars or yeovil which was one of the largest virtual worlds 10 years ago and basically uh show people that there was a path where we thought it was better for consumers where um if you look at like the history of games the the cost of of like a minute of entertainment just keeps going down and actually like this this model what it allows people to do is play a game for free see if they like it and if they like it they can choose to spend money or not um and actually we felt like that's a much more fair model to consumers um and and i think consumers voted with their feet like ultimately um even though a lot of game developers had disagreements about whether or not that model was was the best one uh for years consumers actually seem to agree with like they want to play the game they want it to prove its value and they want to spend in a way that they feel like they're they know the value that they're getting um and so i think that that idea over the last you know 10 years has really become a huge part of the game industry so what you're describing was this innovation around distribution and it sounds like it's that combination of identifying an opportunity and luck in the sense that facebook and social media platforms created a way for mass distribution in a way that really hadn't been possible for games or the kind of games you're talking about in the past and then you added on top of this this social distribution layer in in that friends would spam their friends for lack of a better term to get them onto the game and that was sort of free distribution you had directly through people's social networks and so that was really new and and tell me you can correct me if if any part of that was wrong but then there's this flip side that i think you also innovated in and it's the combination of the two that made you so successful which is the monetization side and you said in another interview that you felt like you were able to create this kind of awesome flywheel which is that you mastered mastered i suppose i think that's fair the distribution side of this in a new way but then you also created this new monetization side which was in-game purchases and in in the poker example you had folks paying real fiat and real money for chips in the game and my understanding was that was really new at the time too can you speak to that side of things the monetization and and correct me if if i'm wrong about that being so new yeah yeah yeah sure so i mean um well i think it's just about like thinking about something from first principles and and trying to figure out like what what's the best way to make everyone happy here um and and i think what we're we're doing is instead of we didn't know how to build games we didn't come from the game industry like i said um it wasn't it wasn't an easy industry to break into and and the people that were part of the initial team of zingo we were really focused on like the web and and what it meant to go build something that could um like in social networking and to connect people and so we approached it from that angle and for us it was like well these people want to play games with their friends it's more fun to play games with their friends um what do they want and and and how do these these web services work like people don't expect to pay some for something upfront in most web services so what is the internet native business model was like what we were trying to solve in our head and instead of just kind of like taking the existing business model and enforcing it into you know onto the web we are instead asking ourselves like well what did people pay for on the web how did they how did they discover things on the web and they were trying to figure out what that meant for for games and it was like sort of an experimental process that happened over over years but to answer your question about poker we didn't we didn't know if people would do it it was an experiment i mean we one day we decided to ship this idea of selling chips and um and we had no idea what to expect but we knew that people wanted chips because they were always asking us for more chips and you know of course they were they were getting some of these chips by inviting their friends and there were all different things they could do and so we said well why aren't we just also selling them and we started selling them and it immediately um it started working and it was like it felt like we found this secret um that other people hadn't realized yet and we had kind of a few years to go and run with it and we were like okay well if if chips works like why not you know this game in this game in this game and so um it was a really it was a really fun time and i'll just say like it was it was so early in the sense that you know even to sell these chips on the internet now you have payment processors like stripe and everything else um but we had to build like a 25 person team internally that just processed credit cards and prevented fraud and everything and so um you know it was like the earliest days here uh there were the only sites on the internet that were processing credit card payments at the time were um were you know uh businesses that were not like the the most upstanding businesses in the world and so shady businesses there was there wasn't there wasn't infrastructure built for like you know a modern web 2 company we had to go build it ourselves and what year are we talking about what years are you talking about here that was 2007 um when we we launched selling poker chips and and everything else and then we had a similar experience on ios actually where we were one of the earliest developers on on ios and we brought over one of our famous games mafia wars to ios um this is before farmville and there was no way to sell uh in-game currency on apple's platform actually and when we told them um that we wanted to selling game currency they were like why why would you do that and so we had to find a way we had to find a way to sell virtual currency and so we we they had the idea of paid apps and free apps that's that's all that existed on their platform and so what we had to do was have uh you know mafia wars ten dollars mafia wars five dollars mafia wars two dollars and mafia wars free and um you would the way that you would buy more tokens in the game was to buy many versions of the app in different dollar denominations and you'd have them all on your home screen and and all that money would flow into with the same account that you logged into and you could open up any of these and play the same game but obviously um if there's one way to get apple to change its mind it's it's to make something that's not beautiful so redundant and inefficient yeah once once we did that and if people had their home screen full of mafia wars icons they were like okay and you know ieps can shortly after so it's always been about like you know how do we how do we give people that experience what they want within the current constraints we're used to sort of um not waiting for uh for other people to go and figure it out well it's having i guess it's the first principles point you're making but it's having a real pulse on what people want and what consumers you gravitate towards it seems like a through line and we'll get to it with play co and story verse and things um but it feels like a through line in in the work that you do i was also laughing at a story i heard you tell and i think another podcast about you talk about this like it was this secret that you were selling all these chips you know in your facebook game essentially and you guys were making like a billion plus dollars and facebook had no idea like they just did not realize all this money that was flowing through their platform and it's just amazing to me that this was really not that long ago in the scheme of things and just to think how much we've evolved in the space so this feels like such an important point this point about in-app purchases or buying chips in the game because the expectation from folks in my world is that these will all become nfts and that yeah it's pretty cool to own something in an app or in a game but how much cooler is it if you also own it outside of that game and it can have value i'm wondering are are you naturally then also very bullish on that concept or do you have hesitations or how do you think about nfts being everything that we exchange in games at some point yeah my my approach here is just to assume like a greater level of intelligence and the people that consume products than most people i think do um and so with with freemium for us it was like well people people understand the people who play the games understand that freemium is a better value that they're not being asked for money up front and that they play something and if they don't like it they move on to the next game and if they like it then they spend money and that's fundamentally more fair and in a very easy to understand way and i actually think that um nfts have the same sort of value where um not only do you get to potentially try these games before before you pay depending on the way that the economy works you you also stand to potentially get some of the money back after you're done playing so there's an argument to be made that um these games can be more fair um than freemium games and this is going to depend on the economies and where everyone takes this but that's the future that i think consumers are going to be more excited about the world is full of choice especially in games people do it not just for a living but just out of passion so it's such a competitive space there's so much great content out there and i think striking that balance of like making something that feels fundamentally more fair to people is is a good thing and i think nfts are a tool uh that can definitely make that happen and i i see a lot of the same parallels when it comes to like the more traditional industry folks in the way they feel about about nfts and it sounds a lot like what happened with with uh with zynga like we basically we had this this growing fast-growing set of people who are so passionate about about the way that we were doing things and we had the traditional industry saying like this is crazy like you're not selling them anything like you're not really getting images these aren't real games the game design doesn't make sense the the model is like it's a ripoff like can you believe there's someone who's spending a thousand dollars in a month um and and i grew up like reading these video game magazines trying to figure out which game to buy and spending fifty dollars that i probably mowed a bunch of lawns for or something right and um and showing up and then like it wasn't as good as the review said and i had no recourse you know what i mean and that felt that felt much worse to me um and and so um i thought like if someone's spending a thousand dollars if they keep spending more money this idea of whales people likened it to like casinos or something but um they're fundamentally like these people it was a choice they were making and like after each time they put more money into the game they're saying i enjoy the value that i'm getting out of this game and they have a choice to and i know the value i'm getting because i'm playing it i know what the exchange is i'm not being asked money up front and then hope that it lives up to my expectations that's exactly right and so i think nfts will potentially offer the same thing right which is or in the next evolution of it if um if people design the economies that way where um you you opt in and not only can you um put as much value into the game as you feel like it's it's giving you back um but also if you decide to leave the game at some point there may be a way to like to cash out and sort of give it to the next person i i played a lot of magic the gathering growing up and when i was when i was done with the you know the card game i i sold off my collection someday and it felt like you know it's it's it's going to somebody else who wants it now and i think like that feels like quite a natural concept actually to me when you abstract it so it just um i think it's more fair and it's it's like closer to the way things work in the real world you know when you give up a hobby you you sort of sell your you sell off the things that you you put in other the time you put in the the objects that came out of it it feels like a very natural concept to people so to me it's it's less important like how people feel it compares to their existing paradigm it's more important like for the people who actually go and experience it what do they think right um and how do we make sure they're having a good time and they actually like like the way that it works i like that comparison to hobbies irl in that you know depending on the hobby you have assets at the end of your interest with that hobby to kind of sell off and this being similar farmville is a game that got a lot of crap for not being a real game in the eyes of of the gaming community and for those who aren't familiar uh you know it's a very simple game and you basically would plant plots of vegetables and build your farm out and you would click things to plant and sow the field or whatever and you had to come back on at consistent time basis to make sure you kept sort of towing your farm or i'm using all the wrong terms here but you get the point it was very simple and very basic and it feels like one of the reasons it got as big as it did i'd call it despite being so simple because people found it really soothing and it felt like an escape and i think uh marcus pincus the ceo at the time talked about how that was intentional and they thought they thought it was something they could get non-traditional gamers into more women older people who who just found it really nice and and like an escape to go back to their farm and and do the thing i'm curious one of the the criticisms i i hear of play to earn is that there will be this or that there is this psychological shift that happens when the thing you're doing also has the potential to earn you money and it it ceases to be an escape even if it's something that is inherently fun you're no longer optimizing for the fun you you can't help but to optimize for wanting to make money what do you make of that criticism would farmville have actually been less big had these been nfts that could have made the money or would it have been 10x bigger like how do you think of that based on what you've seen in terms of why people play games that's a great question there's a lot of um actual like academic research into this on in intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation um and and game designers spend a lot of time thinking about it and so uh what's been fun for me is just like as spending more time in web 3 just trying to combine the way like economists model these things versus the way like psychologists would look at it and i think game design comes a lot from the sort of psychology side but obviously in the markets psychology is very important too and there's some sort of um like mixing of the disciplines that probably has to happen here to figure out how to design the right uh systems but the the standard thinking is that if you if you apply extrinsic rewards on something that people actually feel good about doing that if you do it long enough you can actually replace those good feelings that they get from from doing the thing that they actually enjoyed which is actually usually not seen as a good thing and in in my experience like there's pure more intrinsic motivation in people that can be more powerful um and we see this like with in in just in in real life where um people who are purpose driven in their work um or in anything that they spend a lot of effort doing um they go and they generally do like bigger and more interesting things and they're more motivated and and then like it's sort of important to make a living and to be paid by um for what you're doing and it's like a huge consideration for everybody um but what was really motivating people on farmville was like they wanted to express themselves and and we had to find a way to sort of like give them the breadcrumbs to to do it um in a way where it didn't feel like a lot of work and so the internet is this thing where anyone can make anything and anyone can show it to the world but starting from a blank canvas is super intimidating like why aren't we all out there you know making a song every day or or painting a picture or editing a video um it it seems it seems daunting right um and uh the trick with farmville was like oh just plant a seed you know it was like this sort of five second ask oh but you gotta come back and and you gotta attend to it and then before you know it like you had this farm and and people were making their farms into the farm was a canvas it was a way of like showing who you are but instead of saying like okay you have this big canvas what are you gonna do with it you did it in such small steps um that by the time you play the game for 10 or 20 hours you look at your farm and you're very proud of it and it did look different depending on who built it but you never made a conscious decision to say i'm gonna spend 10 hours making something that i'm really proud of we just convinced you to do it for 10 seconds um and then kept you going enough that by the time it was done you were like i have to show everybody this this is my my cool thing that i've made and so um like i have this this like really really foundational belief in human creativity and i think this is like part of why i'm so fascinated by what's going on with nfts right now where like the more you lower the the bar like everybody is is creative like you can see it in children like we all start growing up drawing pictures and and somewhere along the way like you know there's some larger mental hurdle that stops us from doing that and um being able to create like a a tool whether it's a game or some other form of tool that just makes it easier and and helps people get to putting pen to paper is is like a very big opportunity and so like that was definitely um a big part of why farm farmville succeeded and i guess what i would say is like this is whether or not money adds to that um i think it does i mean i think people should be rewarded for their work i think where that they where they get paid in in the system it matters because you don't want people to to feel like um that the the creation itself is no longer meaningful to them um and so like it's it's just this system of incentives that you have to think through where like um i actually think that motivation to create is so powerful and so human that you know you want you want people to be rewarded for it but you don't want it to be the point if that makes sense yeah and and so much of this i think sets us up for where we'll go with storyverse in terms of lowering lowering the barrier to entry to expressing yourself but even that you know farmville being a precursor to so much that has come after what you're talking about with the farms being a way to express yourself put another way to socially signal which is so much of what this space is about and i mean that actually in a positive way like it's going to survive in my opinion because it's just foundational to hue humans are to who humans are that we we want to socially signal and tell people who we are what i hear you saying in in that is like it makes me bullish on the idea that you'll have games where you have some folks putting money into the system like people did with poker games and then you'll have some people who you have gotten so serious about that game they are earning money into earning money out of it or you know they are playing to earn and you have others who are playing to play and even potentially putting money in there and that you you might have those sort of hybrid models um in addition to maybe some other things um i want to get into placo a little bit and you mentioned earlier that part of the thinking with placo is how to solve this problem of of people being able to play games with each other more easily but but maybe give the the fly over of sort of what play co is and and the problems you're you're looking to solve with it yeah so um at placo we we put together a team of people who have been trying to solve this problem of of how do i how do i um build content that can live within the platforms people already spend their time so that we can very easily in that context let them play together um and our basic thinking on this is that everyone wants to play games with their friends um and and if you make games that fit in their life and fit into spaces they're already spending time with their friends um then they will they will play games with their friends and i think we we had proven like that sort of base thesis at my last company at zynga um but in a weird way like even though technology has progressed a lot and we're more connected than we ever have been um that sort of went missing and i think that's due to just dynamics around the way that software is distributed on mobile and so um what we wanted to do was to figure out like how to solve that problem from a technology perspective because really what we're talking about doing is putting games back in the browser where they can load instantly and we're not sending people the app store and and they have to load within the social spaces that people already spend their time and without asking too much of them in the way of like friction and sort of getting started and uh you know the the technology that we built the foundations of zynga on with flash steve jobs killed it um he he literally banned it from the phones and and like that is why that is part of the reason um that this didn't happen on mobile it was a technology decision and a policy decision from apple that had we're still feeling uh the effects of and html5 um at that time was supposed to be the the sort of ultimate way of of um solving this problem but it was just too early because like html5 never had to fill that void um you know flash was was building rich applications and games on the internet and it did it better than anything that um the open web standards could do at that time and so when when that transition happened it was you know 10 plus years ago at this point um people were saying well html5 will be the thing that replaces it and then everybody tried to go and build content with html5 and it very quickly became apparent that that actually it wasn't ready um and it and it wasn't the the replacement and so a lot of people became uh disappointed and you know people started shifting more and more to native development because it was what was necessary to go and build things on mobile which was growing very quickly um but we we lost that ability to distribute content in a way where like we weren't bound by any particular store and this the power of a link like and the way the internet works and what makes it something like to me the the the open web is is a lot like blockchain and when you think about composability like i love the metaphor of of like aol versus um the open internet and you know aol had keywords um and and everybody would would use aol uh back in the dial up days and instead of going to https you know oprah.com you would just go to aol keyword oprah um and and it was so much easier than typing in a url and so people would say like why would anyone go like mess with all these you know http semicolon stuff that's very confusing no one understands what that is um but i think what happened was like aol was building its own little private ecosystem that could grow in value linearly but the open web meanwhile was building this this uh this system where all the nodes were linked to each other and its value just grew exponentially and at some point like the network effects piece yeah yeah and and so it grew geometrically and so i think that the what we're seeing here is like a similar thing um playing out in blockchain and for all of the growth we've seen in mobile um and and all the interesting things that have come from it it's it's because it's not an open system like we're not seeing that type of growth we've seen a huge amount of growth in users and um and payments have gotten so much better and so like the business growth has been explosive um but how much better could it be if if every single thing every building block that any developer built other developers could build on top of it and and so i feel like um that's why i love like the term web3 because it encapsulates that idea that like actually the web um is is built that way um and it is like a natural sort of evolution of the web to go that that direction and so for us at placo like you look at the the people involved that are at our company it's people who have been innovating on like building high quality content on the web for over a decade um we have people who built the the largest um open source game engines in the world on our team so we we have pixie js which is the largest html5 game engine um and we're very focused on helping people get their web 3 projects um i'm on board on pixi um it's got 16 million projects worldwide it's it's it's got a top 200 github project it's an absolutely huge game engine um and we've got people like michael carter my co-founder who is one of the inventor of the websockets protocol so um like literally the the thing that makes live communication happen on the internet and is also used as a backbone as part of ethereum um he's one of the inventors of it so we have like a really technical team because we like to start from first principles and look at the technology behind something and then like try to connect the dots about like how do we make to my earlier point how do we make everybody get something more interesting and better out of the building blocks that are here and especially we're excited about like how do we then take that and let other people also um build from it and so i think what we realize at placo is that like actually like web 3 is is super uh aligned with with like what we've been working on um and and from my own personal interests like you were mentioning earlier um i it never seemed like a strange idea to me that that you could sell nfts and so i've been lucky to have uh been working with and advising a bunch of companies that are pretty early in this space so i met the cryptokitties team early on and i've been advising them since before it was dapper labs it was axims then an immutable team i've been advising before they were mutable they were fuel games and they had um gods unchained and i've been advising to central land when it was just a white paper um and i and i and i there was a lot about the space that i didn't like you know during the ico boom um but but i i couldn't help but be fascinated by these these people that i was i was meeting um and the things they were building when i just felt like you know the possibilities here um and these teams that are really doing things that are that are interesting and real like it just it sucked me in and so for the last sort of you know four years um i i've been just thinking like wow at some point when we feel like we can have something to contribute to this space you know i can't wait to actually do that well here we are and i think this is a that's a good lead-in for call it the highlight of this episode which is storyverse which by the time this this episode comes out people will have already this will have been announced on twitter and people will be able to start to to really understand what this is but let's dive in because you are now in the web through world and and launching something very cool in web3 and i i would love for you to explain what story verse is and we'll talk about everything that i think is coming with it yeah so um the story verse is is for us like the recognition that um the art and the communities that are being created in web 3 are like a huge turning point of of people being able to build bottoms up brands um and when we look at these these characters that are coming out of the sort of pfp universe of nfts um we're just amazed i mean we're we're in the business now for uh almost two decades of of like creating characters and games that people fall in love with and and when we look at the top projects like it we know that this is um the quality that's there it's in many ways like even more impressive um than what you would see in like the best mobile games or anywhere else and so that really um got us thinking like well what are what are we great at and like how can we how can we contribute to this ecosystem in a way where um we can kind of take different group skill sets and and make something that's much bigger than um each person or each group acting individually and for us we're experts in game engines and we're experts in distribution you know we on our on play code games we've we've had hundreds of millions of players uh play our games and um what we saw and got very excited about was when these nfts started to permeate and and become part of social networks we thought wow like that's that's what we do um and and what if we can make it more rich like what if it wasn't just a jpeg in your in your profile picture what if we could take this character and and we can make them um come to life and so like the simple way i like to put the story verse is that we we bring nfts to life and we we bring them to life by pulling them into a story that you can tell with these characters where they're animated um and and it's the act of creation back to this this lesson from farmville is as simple as being able to type out a dialogue anyone who can have a chat with a friend on imessage can create like a very simple dialogue between um these different characters and we have some of the best artists in the world producing amazing characters um and then all these people that are passionate about these communities who want to find more ways to contribute and create that can now like hopefully combine their energy and and create new forms of of content um and and so we announced the project uh last week and we're we're really excited about just basically um developing this project with the overall community because for us like we we really want to build something uh with the community that people feel like brings nfts to a new place which is really starts capitalizing on the storytelling that everyone's been so excited about how do we how do we build a platform together where we can actually have storytelling within these communities and individually that then can be shared on social media to people to make nfts an even bigger phenomenon than they've become over the last year so at its simplest version tell me if this is a is a fair description you all have built tooling that's underpinned really by a game engine that allows nft holders to easily create their own stories of varying lengths with their nft characters avatars etc is that the the most basic level what this is yeah that that's right and um we're excited about it because these the people that own these nfts that they they're passionate about them right and um and we think that uh if if they have a tool like the story verse a lot of them would love to uh go and write like an individual story about who is my character what is their personality and like what interactions that they have and and share that and maybe it ends up in their twitter bio um and and they want it to be like this sort of permanent uh bio of who they are in the character that represents them on twitter or or maybe they just want to create a meme and and have a hot take on some twitter thread and like they're using their character as sort of a their public persona to deliver these these messages or um and and also like we want to support community creation at like the higher levels where people want to collaborate and and go work on like what is the official canon for for our community in the sense that um we all agree like this is the main story line of the universe and so we're trying to solve the coordination problem of of helping people build the story for a broader sort of universe as well as like just letting people take the things they own and do something interesting and new with it um so for us it's been like how do you how do you balance the community aspect with the sort of individual ownership piece and try to find a way to make everybody excited about this let's dive into the canon piece of this because i think where the empowerment of the individual to create and to unleash their curiosity where that meets the community component of this as i understand it is i think really exciting so can you get into how the the canon side of this works and and ink rewards and talk a little bit about that tie-in yeah so so the way that it works is um like i mentioned before like at a basic level anyone can create what they like with what they own and it was really important to us that that people who who don't own something can't create with it and there's not only um legal reasons for that but we also just want to be true to the like the ethos of of nfts which is you can do what you want with what you own um and you can't go and create content with the characters you don't own and you don't have the rights for um and then we wanted to take this content that you create and say what is the easiest way for people to collaborate like sort of as a group without blocking each other and so this idea of official canon is um if people are creating these stories and they're part of a community if i have my own uh pfp community that i'm creating a story for and as an individual i'm creating a story for my meebit for example right we can use that as a hypothetical yeah exactly so so if you're creating a story for your amoeba you may be doing a meme or a hot take or you may like have like a much more elaborate story about your amoeba in the me bits universe everyone in in the discord can very easily see or other people can see on on the story verse um viewers that will be living in different places in these communities that this story has been created and other people can then if they are part of meebitz and they own amoeba they get to actually vote on whether or not this story that has me bits in it becomes part of the me bits canon and so what this does is allows for bottoms of creation but then some form of of consensus where like the group and the people who are involved with the project are the ones who get to vote on what should become part of uh the official canon and we see official canon as like something that's basically dynamic so not only is it based on the group voting on on a particular story as i i think this should be canon or other people voting it shouldn't be um it it's also something that can change over time so like if something no longer is relevant to the community they can they can go back and invoke something out of official canon and they can evolve the story as their thinking changes um but we like the idea of of rewarding the people who are writing the stories by these votes coming back to them um in the form of uh this currency this game currency inc um and we like that um it rewards people for for creating but it allows for a bottoms-up creation where there's no particular gatekeeper but ultimately leaves the power in the hands of the community to decide what they want to represent themselves as a whole and this upvoting there's sort of an upvoting downvoting reddit style right process there and i don't know what you will have announced at this point or if you can say anything concrete uh but you know there's there's thoughts of these stories that get voted into canon could live on the websites or i don't know within the discords or in various places of those communities themselves and then it'll still evolve to your point sometimes maybe the story changes but it's it's also in these places where these communities are gathering and they can build on each other and and be inspired by what others are kind of doing on that front yeah that yeah that's exactly right so um i think to some extent we want to partner with with communities that are interested to figure out like what do you want to do with with your official canon right and so um some communities we've talked to they want to put it on a special page on their website so they may have like a new page of their website where they're showing the official canon and the cool thing about that is like the official canon can be um dynamic like as i mentioned and so for a community member to go and be able to get their story on the official website for the project that they're so passionate about is really cool and we think there might even be ways to tie that back into other places on the web because this is web-based again like this content can live um anywhere and so it's not just the official community website where official canada might live we may be able to wrap that into um like for example an app um in the app store where like the content is dynamically being pulled in and out and if you think about it this way it's like now suddenly anybody in the community could be contributing a piece that ends up in like the official app um for for that community which is i think really cool um and and it could be in in other places like where where instant games are served on some of these social networks or like the possibilities endless that the thing we're excited about is that because it's web-based it's like this building block that can be shared wherever it's relevant um and and so what we we want to do is be able to like package up these official canon in a way that the communities want to distribute it and and have it live wherever they think is useful uh for them um from our part like we have we have partnerships with um from the placo side of the business with like a lot of a lot of those social networks so we could probably find ways um to to get this content like living inside of it in some pretty novel ways axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and

that that stood out to me where like memes just like the next evolution of memes right like it's it's memes now a little bit more advanced animated and with my own characters and if they're sort of living natively in the social apps where i'm already imbibing my meme content like that just felt like an obvious thing that i i think people will enjoy and i know there's a world in which this is sort of linear content where you can just kind of click through and see one story after another and if you're a part of a community that a story where a character is in that story you can then upvote or downvote i wondered if you could if you can drop any of the communities y'all are partnered with i don't know what will what will have been announced by the time this podcast airs but are there any communities you can share that you're working with um yeah i i hope by the time we uh we air this we'll have announced uh at least a couple of them we we've we've got a bunch of them that we've been working with for for a while now um one of the ones i'm i'm excited about just because i know that there were recently a guest on on your uh podcast is is a team um we're very excited about about doing more with with them and um ultimately like the way that we we view partnering with the community itself and the leaders of the community is is how do we help um them in the near term like imagine like what what is the full extent of the way that you can use this to create uh a story that sort of officially represents um this community and um and how do they um how can we help them do that faster so uh with with or some of these other projects we're working with we're we're helping them on board onto our tools um and and and also even in many cases like brainstorming with them about um the stories that they have and how you might adapt these stories to the type of format that that we um we've been uh building and um i'm just really excited to be working with like a team like that i think the ip is super cool um and and i think like when i look at it um just based on what i've seen from you know the rest of games and broader media like this is a brand with the right the right tools and and the right content and way of experiencing the content that could be really really huge and so um i i'm excited by this idea that like just like pfps and profile pictures for these with these nfts have exposed many more people to crypto than the people who actually have wallets i think that this is an opportunity to get the people who are in web 3 and excited about it already creating content that can get even more people excited and experiencing what web 3 is without necessarily getting their wallet yet and so i think about it a little bit like the freemium model back for games which is i think for a lot of these people um explaining the value of web 3 it can happen when they start playing these games and they start asking themselves like i keep seeing these characters these awesome cat characters like who are they from what company made this and um and then they start realizing like multiple people on the internet are posting these these story games with these cat characters and they start to notice that they're responding to memes in real time and this doesn't seem like there's some big game company behind this because it's it's too dynamic and it's too community driven it's um it feels like it feels like the way the internet works um and they start to notice that like someone must be this must be a community of people controlling these things how do i control one and they'll go down slowly get pulled into like oh okay these people own this and they're creating content with things they own and and like i if i own one i can create content like that um this is like a really a longer on-ramp to sort of web 3 than i think most people are imagining um but but i think it's it's the one that's like all the on-ramps we can get let's embrace them all baby yeah but i want to sell more jpegs man yeah what i like about it is it communicates the utility without telling them about the utility um and and basically like they will discover the utility by using um this this thing and so you don't need to tell them look they're valuable because of this by the time that they're thinking about like there's a process of discovery that will happen for some of those people where like it'll be very very clear to them um why why they should go and participate in the ecosystem because it's it's something it's what drew them in the first place and so i think a lot of people get this social signaling um but they would like to to do it in ways that feel more um authentic you know there's a lot of criticism potentially or like oh someone's using such and such a project for their profile picture what does that mean in in some communities it's it's totally fine um and in other communities people say like oh man you're being too flashy or something like this right um and i think giving people like alternative ways to use what they own that where the goal is not just to say i own this thing but it's it's more complex allows them to like have a way to potentially if they want to show off do it in a way that's like a little bit less obvious and more socially acceptable but also just like give them a way to to justify owning this thing from in more and more ways um and so i actually think like this idea it's about how do we make it obvious what digital ownership actually is is that is at the heart of what the story versus which is you own something digitally um that doesn't just mean using it as an avatar in a metaverse it also means that you can use it in these other ways that the the projects have have designated in their in their license agreements like they they want you to create these types of work right and so what's exciting about this is like it demonstrates that and so instead of people scratching their head and saying like well what does it really mean to be able to use um one of these characters and like that i own what does it mean to own a board ape yes it'll show them that that's that's what we're hoping will happen so you know i love how you're thinking about licensing and and some of the ways i guess you'd say you're kind of innovating in terms of making it clearer to people what these different licensing agreements that different projects have really mean we're gonna dive into that but i wanna i wanna highlight a couple things so as you're talking about this new kind of an on-ramp for folks i think one of the things you were starting to get to or allude to is that storyverse is fundamentally built on top of a game engine so while the simplest iteration of it is creating stories my understanding is you envision a world where this evolves to people actually being able to build fuller scale games with their characters atop the game engine is that right yeah so um you know the longer term by seeing you get scared like oh god we have not done that yet and i'm not promising that to everyone is that the look in your eyes that i'm uh picking up on well i mean look we do pixie js is the largest html5 gaming engine in the world and um for us html5 and web 3 go hand in hand so we would love to find a way to take those hundreds of thousands of developers and and let them um help join forces with all this amazing these these teams is creating great ip in in building the web 3 side to go build um game experiences with each other but there are some things that are missing right um and i think the story verse could be could be one way to start to fill in some of these missing pieces we have to solve the problem of like how do you get these these assets into a game engine and they're rigged up and they're animated in a way that everybody's excited about that represents their artistic vision and and also respects their their license agreement and also um is the way the community is behind and then um we may be able to take it from there like i don't want to get ahead of ourselves in the sense that like i don't think we're capable of that we are capable of it but but we have to go and make this work and then and then i think that um we can work with the community on like hey the natural next step here is is story games are great um and we can add more and more functionality to story games where we start to blur the line between what is an interactive story and what is a game um so i think there's a lot we can do there but also in the long run we're very excited about how do we expand this to just games in general and and and make it even broader um so definitely it's it's something we're thinking about what excites me about all this and and why i maybe i'm getting ahead of us as well is because it feels like something that's so needed in this space there are so many amazing art projects and pfp projects that ultimately promise a game or are promising a story like are promising things that they don't actually have the talent on their team as far as you can see to really pull off and this feels like a beautiful tool to to plug the community in in to fill that gap and i think that's exciting i'm curious with the communities you're working with you mentioned so i feel safe saying that and if it hasn't been announced by the time this episode comes out we'll we'll bleep it out and i'm sorry to all the listeners who are dealing hearing a bleep if that's the case um but what is the biggest piece of feedback you are getting in these conversations or or a couple big pieces of feedback and what they're most excited about yeah by the way like um i i don't want to suggest that that this is an idea that we sort of just came up with in isolation by studying everything and taking a bunch of of notes on what's on the internet like we we had hundreds of conversations with uh the people inside these communities and collectors and the people running these communities and um through those conversations like we figured out what we think um is most helpful to people like we we just kind of went around listening to to all these projects and what they were excited about and what they were good at and what they were having challenges with and that's that's basically the shape of what we came up with came from all these conversations and um for them like i can't really speak for the communities and they're all so different because they're all they're basically you know going at this with their own strategies in terms of what they think is important and and some of them are leading more into the technology and some of them are are leaning more into the hollywood relationships and you're seeing all these different strategies um play out for us like the one thing that is is common is is community um like all these projects are based on on a very strong community when they're succeeding and um i think those people are capable of a lot more um than than what that they can do right now and because they just don't have the tools and so for us like if if we think bottoms up brand building is the future it needs a new set of tools the future needs a new set of tools um and and there are tools that are great for for game development you know there's there's unity and there's these other tools but they're not built for communities they're built for companies and they're not built for web3 and so we're trying to go and ask ourselves from the grounds up like first principle approach what would these communities want in a game development tool um and what would they want in in the near term in a storytelling tool um and then work with them to make sure we're building uh what they're excited about basically so i like the dynamism of this which is i could see this playing out in a way where there are projects and call it i don't know call it right where maybe they go and they work with an incredible animation studio who makes a whole story that becomes the netflix show and that doesn't have to take away from what then essentially is really awesome fan fiction that can still be canon that live within the community and people can still have fun and enjoy that even while has has another kind of story that's the mainstream public story out there but the reverse could also happen right which is that some of these stories actually do become the thing that the netflix show is based on and it is actually born out of what the community has built and and it just being another layer of ways for the community to engage and be creative and uh and work with each other i think is is really fun and exciting uh i want to talk about um the the kind of creator economy piece of this so you mentioned inc and i love that this is a way to reward people who are writing these stories and my understanding is they actually if they get a vote at all whether it's a yes vote or a no vote there's a reward that you get inc with that and it's just rewarding that participation do you want to say a little bit on that and then i think the other piece is this free choices premium choices component that also has the potential to um to allow creators to to earn off of this yeah so the way we think about it is um people who are creating stories within their community are providing a valuable service to their community because when they share their story or just by the process of creating it they're contributing to the thinking and the excitement around the characters even if they never share it to twitter if it only gets shared within their discord just seeing like the next animated cool thing that somebody made is going to excite other people in the community so at like the most basic level we want to reward people for the creation of that for the work that they put in and we want to make sure the community decides what what it's worth right and so the community can can vote on it um in in a way that uh basically make sure that the person is is rewarded for what they've done um also we think there's like this opportunity potentially for uh these these communities to have brands and and experiences in businesses that engage the broader sort of public that may or may not be part of the community um and we have built into this the story game um the story game engine that storyverse uses this idea of being able to make choices and it's it's like choose your own adventure type of interactive fiction where there's a moment where the game stops and you can choose from a few different choices and um depending on which choice you pick there may be a free choice and there may be sort of like a premium choice and the premium choice may be locked unless you you're willing to spend some amount of currency to to use it um and in the long run like i think we're going to try to make that a very very accessible on-ramp such that like you know if if someone doesn't have a a wallet yet and they want to take this premium choice and they've just discovered this game on the internet somehow they're still able to very easily get their their fiat or something else into the system to be able to to get through these premium choices and so the goal there is like that's for mass market consumption and so it should be as easy as possible uh for for people to to say i love uh this story and and i want to take this premium choice and then the people that are involved in the community that helped canonize that story and help created that story can actually start to see like real revenue potentially coming in from from the things that they've created um and so then that gets to the sort of broader piece which is like like i said there's two parts of it one is how does the community value your contribution and then how does like the broader um public and people out there on the internet value yeah the normies how do they value your contribution and we're hoping that we can we can solve for both so it's early in our thinking on that but that's that's our thinking on it so far we've touched on some of this in the conversation even so far but i i want to ask you if this thing succeeds to your fullest dreams what does it look like in a year and five years ten years like what is the what is this fully played out look like um to be honest we're designing a system that we we feel like um hopefully creates like a lot of emergent behavior and so what i learned um for a while i was working on this game at zynga called yeovil and it was the biggest virtual world in the world at the time so everyone was talking about second life but all the all the sort of middle-aged women were playing yeovil on facebook it had almost 10 million daily active users at one point and it had item trading and we built a virtual economy it was making hundreds of millions of dollars a year and everything you did was just setting us up for everything in web3 it's like every time i we didn't have time to go into all of it but like i'm reading about zynga i'm just like that's the metaverse that's an nft like that's something you know it just was so so relevant yeah i i've been selling jpegs for a long time um but yeah i know the thing about to say what was interesting about yeovil is like what we learned was that when we decided what it should be um and we made something that had like really a strict view of that it was always less interesting than making some building block that let all these players decide what it ended up becoming and so i learned a lot from that experience and like i my biggest concern is that we would do something that would constrain um what the communities are capable of like our real goal here is to allow for maximum amount of flexibility um because to your point earlier like there's so many different interesting directions that this can go we're just asking ourselves like how do we how do we speed it up and build a really interesting layer for people to build on and then like if we're surprised we're probably doing it right um so i know i hope this doesn't sound like a non-answer but um i'm most excited about the year from now where like the direction in which it's taken off is is not the one um that i can imagine right now because that means we'll build a system like that has enough value to people and is emergent enough in the way that it's flexible enough in the way they use it um that we couldn't have predicted the the outcome and for me like i'm not so sure that um thinking of like what is the pinnacle of of web 2 of you know getting a movie on netflix is really the goal here it might be uh i don't want to i don't want to write it off but but i also i don't want to assume that that's like what we're capable of um because this model opens up new opportunities and that's what this is a shift in my thinking yeah this is a shift in my thinking that i've had recently which is just not being so focused on on sort of web two models of success and some of this happened i just interviewed uh poopy who runs or you know is one of the co-founders of doodles and things he was saying just were kind of opening my mind to like all the ways you can be thinking about these brands that isn't just so like when's the netflix show you know and i'll say one thing we're running a long time and i've other things that i want to talk to you about but what i love about this project is it it does spark my imagination like as you talk i'm like oh well this is an interesting place to probe and and so uh as i've been diving into this project one of the things that that i have like vision of is like you know this map a la other metaverses you see with the sandbox or whatever right but then instead of diving in and it's whatever the nike plot right i'm diving in and it's a story and now of course i'm getting really crazy being like and in 20 years or maybe it'll be less whatever it's like vr right and i'm actually just like diving in and like walking around this actual story and watching the movie or you know it could be other brands i mean gilmore girls is my favorite show i was watching the other day right now i'm in like gilmore girls and there some scene is playing out like as somebody who loves stories more than actually games like a metaverse built on stories is like this really cool idea that i really hadn't thought about before um i don't know what do you think of that yeah well i also how far away are we from that vision that's what i want justin well well stories are medium agnostic too right like people tell stories around a campfire that's how it started and then we started writing them down and then we we tell them on tweet storms and and we tell them in video games and we tell them in music and through lyrics like stories are not something that is just one medium and so like our view on this is let's go make a medium this animated interactive story medium that's like very native to what people like experiencing on the internet because we think that's a great way to launch this but um we we don't think that like these stories should just live in one way i mean if you're writing the canon for the these communities and these ip that exist um in a much broader world than just this animated world like you should be able to to go and watch that story in more context and if you're in um some metaverse some 3d vr metaverse and like these characters exist there why not use this same story data and the same animation data that we're sort of putting in to inform what that story looks like when it's happening in front of you there too and so back to this sort of like extensibility um idea and like this emergent systems thing i'd be very happy to see lots of community or developers in the community too come in and like build more ways to to view these stories like this isn't something that we um want to be the only sort of uh we call like a user agent we think about them like browsers right like you're using our our initial sort of user agent to view these stories in a very interesting way it's just one format like those should be viewable in a lot of different places like these stories do not just exist in in one medium and so um yeah that's definitely like something that we'll be uh jumping into a lot over the next year and um my hope is they they become like a layer that can be pulled in anywhere where it's useful to to like the broader development community or anyone who's building a game and says you know what you're building a metaverse and walked in the room what's the back story for that that maybe suddenly like you can actually pull this information from the story verse and and these stories are playing out in other people's metaverses or games of their buildings so we we love the idea of composability and we're definitely thinking about like how do we how do we make sure we build something that's um enabling that um here's the thing because i promise folks i want to make sure we do this but again i wish we could just riff on this for for even longer but um the licensing piece so anybody who listens to the show knows i've been talking a lot about licensing i think you joked about it when you hopped on you're like well we have to talk about that it's apparently the only thing you talk about on the show i'm like i know because i do think it's so important and i don't think that people have thought up to this point necessarily strategically enough about what licensing means for them as holders of these assets and you have some thoughts because licensing and rights are very seminal to this project because what i can do with my board ape impacts how i can use it in the story verse you have some really interesting thought interesting thoughts about how to represent licensing and how to incorporate it into this product you're building tell us about that uh well what we noticed was that um when we set out to build like a digital sort of product where you can use your your nfts in a way where you want to make sure that people own what they're using the next important question is like well how are they allowed to use that thing and that depends on the project i mean at the end of the day the creators of of these nfts that's written into the license agreement that we all agree to when we become a member of the project um and i unfortunately i think like a lot of people um don't necessarily read you know license agreements even if they're excited about these projects but i i do think that everyone's been very excited about like the spirit of many of these projects has been about this community creation idea and that actually um that most of the licenses do allow for uh the type of system we're doing but what we realized was um none of it was was written in code and so like we think that maybe part of the reason some of this hasn't happened is because if you really want to make sure you're respecting the license of every project you need a machine readable version of of the license for each project and so one of the things we've been thinking about is like how do we go and take these these license agreements and um represent them in code and like sort of parameterize like what's okay and what the people who are using these assets must do or can't do or um you know what rights they have to licensing or commercial use of these different projects and so we we uh you know we think that hopefully like if if we can contribute to like getting that data available it it will have a lot more use cases than just our project um and we're doing it because we have to like we don't believe in launching this in a way where we we don't at least have a basic way of making sure that we that we do right by everybody um in the community like the the content and the ip that's being created is it's it's a valuable because people put so much work behind it and and we want to make sure that we we find a way for everybody to um decide how their their content is used based on on the system that that we all have and but what's exciting about it is like hopefully in solving that problem it's not just the story verse but it's also more projects that can then go and start to use this metadata to produce more interesting things and is this a i'll give a hypothetical here you know in a world where there's a project that you can monetize you have the commercial rights to it up to fifty thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars which is very common right i think me bits is that way right you can make up to fifty thousand dollars on this or a hundred thousand dollars on it but after that you have to seek permission from the whatever project etc like where this can be an automated process where if you had somebody who i mean it'd be incredible right but was making the equivalent of 50 000 in ink or in other things because they were just creating amazing stories in this story verse where it could be auto set where that'd be an automated process where it says hey you've hit your it's you've hit your limit of your 50 000 or something where it just becomes uh much more seamless and less scary uh to try and navigate what what your rights are right yeah i mean i think i think it will empower communities because when you understand exactly where the line is then you're free to go and you know we talk about blockchains are powerful because they make things permissionless and and trustless and i think with a licensing agreement that is not living in sort of like metadata that um the computer can understand and that someone can very easily understand what's allowed and what isn't allowed um you you don't necessarily have enough of confidence that you can do what you'd like to do and so our hope is that um by making this more clear like all these people who are already super excited participants of these communities will go do more and do bigger things because suddenly it'll become very clear to them and they'll have the courage to go do it um and not worry about like interpreting you know the sort of more difficult to understand broader legalese around one of these projects and so um i think it's like we don't want to be a mediator in the sense that you know we don't want to represent the communities here um at the owner level or at like the creator level what we really want to do is just try to like find a way to represent it in a way that like everybody um gets what they want um and and it's really a technical requirement actually um if we want to do this in a way that like is fair to everybody and so we're just trying to design that system and like well it'll be an ongoing conversation for us and and everybody else just because um we hope that it's like an important building block of the ecosystem and it's not something we um we feel like is you know ours to decide on our own we're just trying to figure out the right way to do this for everybody amazing well i think we are probably at the point where we we have to start rapping but i know a couple things we didn't cover is sort of the business model around this i don't think we mentioned that these are quite literally plots that you're thinking these these stories are story plots that much like sandbox sells plots of land these would be you know plots that you can use to write your story on i think that's an interesting opponent for folks who want to like learn more or actually see how this works practically speaking where should they go yeah our website lives on uh storyverse.xyz um we have uh you know twitter accounts and discord accounts definitely join our discord um this is a community driven project um it's it's started by people and has grown out of a a company that has a lot of experience in this called placo um but it's not this is not a project that will be um driven in like a web 2 way we plan on having it be completely community driven and in the long run so if you're interested in this if you're you want to partner with us on this if you want to write stories and you have um you know basic questions about how to make a story that's interesting or if you have a huge collection and you want to do something more ambitious or if you're a developer and you want to figure out how how you can take these stories and pull them into other things you've been working on or if you want to just join the team like and and help us go and build this like we're we want to meet everybody um and and we're really excited about just jumping in and seeing if we can't build something bigger with with all the different awesome communities that have been in this space amazing anything else you think we missed i feel like we hit a lot of the the highlights there no no i think that's great and yeah hopefully um we'll have more fun things to share soon so um you know i know there's a like it was a great conversation and um you know i'd love to come back on at some point when we have more new things to announce i would love that i can throw out more of my hypothetical future visions and you can tell me how many years away they are i will play that game um awesome well thank you so much justin i really i would love to have you on i mean i would love to die there's so many things you know i would want to know stories about dapper and immutable and decentral and we didn't even get to get to those questions around some of these other projects that you've uh you've advised and so i think you have a lot to share for this space because of how long you've been in adjacent and precursor spaces but really glad we got you on for for this hour or so and look forward to chatting more in the future thanks carly [Music] hey we hope you
