the new idea with nfts is sort of this idea of like digital scarcity where people are assigning value to digital art in a similar sort of frame of mind as they do to physical paintings and things like that right but you know you can do that without crypto you could digitally sign a piece of artwork and upload it somewhere and then people could check it and see that I own some piece of artwork and you incredibly do that it's really the sort of cultural change that people were willing to assign enormous amounts of value to nfts that has helped artists and it has like you know again I will acknowledge that there are artists who have benefited from nfgs but it was really the speculative bubble around nfts that has enabled artists to get paid
