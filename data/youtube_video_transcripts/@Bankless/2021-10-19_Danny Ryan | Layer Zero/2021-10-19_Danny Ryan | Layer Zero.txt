welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with danny ryan who is the coordinator of the greater eth2 effort and denny is in an interesting position he's one of those people that can go deep into the weeds with code but then also zoom all the way out and explain it to the non-technical folk like me and so we went through a little bit of danny's pre-ethereum history and where he uh got his skills from and and it turns out he's got a little bit of an entrepreneur in him and then we asked some greater questions as to why danny feels as somebody who works for the ef and kind of doesn't really have a boss where he gets his accountability from for waking up every single day and contributing to ethereum when no one actually forces him to do that and then also expanding that to the other developers as well we also talk a lot about this recent in dev interop event and what it's like to be there as a developer and then also i share my perspective is what it's like to view these things from the outside and then we finish off with an interesting conversation about i asked danny whether he is an introvert or excuse me whether he is an optimist or a pessimist and what about the world makes him what it is and i thought his answer for that was pretty interesting so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into this conversation with danny ryan but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible matcha everyone's favorite dex aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eth and wrapped bitcoin pairs then your gas fees on matcha are free and that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage mantra has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that that it gets you better pricing trading on mantra is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price washer also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets alchemix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stablecoin into the alchemix vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcmix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types

to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance hey danny how's it going pretty good yes basement yeah where's your basement where in the world is your basement can i dox you as the first thing i ask on the show yeah yeah that's reasonable i don't think it's a secret uh boulder colorado ah one of the colorado clans huh yeah yeah i've been here for a couple of years yeah the michael wong the the guy who does uh culture and memes at bank list jokes about how all the colorado people are really into public goods and have long hair well i won't pull it down but i think i have the longest up there longer than milwaukee oh yeah my hair is to my waist what yes i'll actually pull down oh my god really yeah it's usually in a braid if it's done which you know oh my god it is the longest hair wow you have the longest hair in all of ethereum look at that i think that is yeah that's great how long have you been growing that thing out i don't really know i mean a while i i think before you were in ethereum yeah but probably like three years ago i cut off like six inches just i just wanted to be six inches shorter three feet you're supposed to trim it to keep it healthy but i know i don't follow the guidance well wow i have already learned something new about you so or so early into this show um danny i want to i want to hear about uh your time before ethereum what did you do what were you doing right before you got into ethereum i was doing a mix of various like software and business consulting so my my niche was probably like not just being a hired hand uh but also like working closely with small business ceos to like help them figure out how technology could actually make their their lives better some of this was like helping like literally small businesses like louisiana that like didn't know databases existed or like how to track customers and things like that and that was you could make a big impact but i also like i also did a lot of work with a company called kittenco uh which was like an airbnb uh knockoff for families traveling with kids so i built a lot of that stuff and like worked closely with the ceo on i don't know strategy and that kind of stuff were you working as an individual or was it under a company um always i mean as a company but just as a front for myself you know limits and liability and help with taxes and that kind of stuff and so your your typical client was like a kind of a boomer that didn't really know technology is what it is is that is that the vibe it was it was a bit of a mix you know i think it was it was actually not boomers it was probably like 30 somethings that were like you know go-getter businessmen that just hadn't awoken to all the things that technology could do for themselves was being an entrepreneur one of like have you always been an entrepreneur um or would before that did you ever like work for a company ever work for a nine-to-five i've never had a real job i don't think really i started a screen printing company when i was 15. uh it still runs today um that's how well yeah yeah wow my business partner and best friend that's his full-time gig but uh i'm still involved somewhat no way okay it's just this is like apparel right just like making cool shirts and stuff like that you started that when you were 15. yeah i mean we primarily do it for other people so like they can take the risk on of like their cool shirt and try to sell it [Music] you know we we do like 100 to 10 000 piece orders for all sorts of different entities got a shop in louisiana okay so so would you say that you've always had some sort of entrepreneurial dna part of you i would pre yeah yeah and i've always had the desire to not have a normal job and to dictate my time on my my own uh standard and this is probably the most normal of a job i have i mean it's like i work for an entity i and i i am you know i don't i don't have hours but i have things that i'm trying to do and i get paid to do them uh but that's it's entrepreneurial sense that like no one tells me what to do right and i just uh see i see what needs to be done and kind of try to bring the value where i can definitely yeah so you are you are your own leader even though you have a paycheck which is a the fact that the ef is the most normal job you've ever had is absolutely insane uh when did you learn to code in college i actually i've i've always like used computers uh and was like a power user probably but i i never dipped into into coding until i had to take a computer science course for a mechanical and aerospace engineering degree i was doing um and then and this is my sophomore year of college and i i loved the class and switched my major and went all in and i you know and was like felt like a late bloomer you know like i'm never gonna make it in computer science or programming because like people have been doing this since they were two uh but it worked out it's working out yeah uh what about code just resonated with you it felt immediately like the most sane way to get through college because it was fun um [Music] i guess i was doing the mechanical and aerospace engineering degrees i thought because i thought it would like build things but you didn't really build stuff at my school until junior or senior year whereas day zero of the programming class i was like building cool little things and and that just kind of struck me um and it felt like solving puzzles and i felt like i could i could spend the rest of my college career solving puzzles and it would get me get me through school at least so the the is the builder dna also in you as well like whatever you whatever medium you have to build something the easiest and the fastest is what resonates probably so i i don't know sometimes i think i'm a builder and then i see my wife who's like sewing and like making dresses and and like it's always building [ __ ] like literally always building [ __ ] and i'm like i'm not much of a builder wait you don't think you're much of a builder um i am a communicator i'm a prototyper i like to think deeply about hard problems but like at a certain point i'm also not the guy who builds it you know and nor do i think i'm the right one like if you look at the say like the sigma prime team you know paul's a builder paul like wrecks building lighthouse and like is it can is just constructing crazy [ __ ] i mean proto proto is a builder too and i build things but i do a lot of other things too and like i if i spend all of my time trying to build things and trying to bring something totally to production in terms from my own hands it's it i don't get i have a hard time doing that i have a hard time like focusing quite like that so i like the mix of stuff i do i made this uh mistake with kevin owaki once or maybe it's actually ryan that uh alluded to steve jobs and kevin was like i don't i don't like that analogy but i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it and do it anyways where um steve wozniak was uh yelling at steve jobs saying what is it that you actually do like what are what are your skills like you don't actually build anything and uh steve jobs gives this anecdote of like uh somebody going up to a a conductor of an orchestra and asking more or less the same question like what do you do that a metronome can't do and the orc of the or the conductor gets really really offended obviously uh and he goes well you know the the trumpeteer plays the trumpet and then the you know the flutist plays the flute i play the orchestra right like that that's his instrument would you say that that uh metaphor is kind of apt for how you are the conductor of all the eth2 client teams i i will not take like the steve jobs analogy direct i cannot accept that but i will say uh to a certain extent because like the conductor probably played an instrument most of his life and knows and knows music inside and out you know knows how to communicate about the music and things like that and so to a certain extent sure yeah um you know i and i i i enjoy that so what has it been like to be the i kind of so the other metaphor that i think i have for what i think you do is like kind of like a traffic control man for all of the the different just like packets of communication data that all the different client teams um talk about we were me and ryan were just got out of done uh recording a weekly roll up and we were reading um one of the uh zk roll ups like announcement blog posts and we were just trying to unpack their blog post over and over and over again and like it was very very clear that a developer wrote this blog post not a communicator uh so like as somebody who's a good communicator how is it how has it been like to like communicate with all these like you know developers who speak in this very very like technical non-communicative way uh it's fun i mean i i can speak the language and i i like i don't just communicate like in this interop last week like i did i did a lot of communication i did a lot of kind of organization stuff but i you know i'm in the weeds like figuring out like the optimizing the engine api right and like figuring out how that's actually going to run and like some of the edge cases and stuff and so like i i think if i could not get deep into it that i would be i would not be effective at what i'm doing or what i've been doing the past few years um and so on the technical side it's very fun and then i really enjoy explaining things i really enjoy teaching and so i really enjoy like finding the right metaphor or the right like thing analogy to to communicate a technical concept to people who maybe aren't as deep in the weeds and so because i get too deep i get to be deep in the weeds then i also get to then turn around the other side and communicate outward um so when you're at these uh dev interop events where everyone there speaks code like speaks developer you don't need to use metaphors right like that's that's metaphors are for you to communicate to people like me or or do metaphors are they useful in that environment like what are the communication skills there [Music] that's an interesting question the metaphors are different but they're still valuable they're still like sometimes you're talking about something very complicated and like if you can abstract it and be able to talk about it more from a higher level like one you're gonna get the three people in the room over here that knew what was going on and the four people over here that didn't quite yet you're gonna help expedite that process which is good um and also just it helps like we all have to think about different like we have to be able to think about different layers of abstraction so like once we have a good metaphor even though we've like worked on the minute details of thing a and thing b once we have a metaphor for how thing a and thing b kind of live together at a higher level once you have the details worked out then you can talk about that higher level and not have to worry about the details unless you like need to open it back up and go back in so they're very they're very valuable yeah they're not the same metaphors all the time sometimes they cross you know sometimes they're good for educating an outside audience and for communicating amongst oneself but they're certainly valuable computer science is all about distraction and that's you know metaphors in a certain sense is there a specific event that comes to mind when like you just could not figure out how to get two teams to communicate or you couldn't communicate with someone is it was there ever like a big like breakdown in communication that that's happened that's the story you can tell us about anything come to mind there there there are some things um and there these these types of things are if you talk to my wife would be the things that over the past three years three four years have like stressed me out the most is this communication breakdowns um i will probably i will not go in too deep about any one of them i will say that early on in the eth2 beacon chain journey um we had done a lot of work on consensus a lot of work on the core security the core state transition how these things come together but the the networking was not in full view and there and there was a bit of a lack of expertise on the networking and ownership over it and when it when we got there that was probably one of the hardest times is just that there were parties on both side of the aisle that thought very very different things about how the networking should be built and how it should look um and it like almost drove me crazy because i could not i could not like it took probably months to get past and resolve an issue and ultimately it came down to just being like we're gonna do it this way we can't do it both ways sorry you know and usually we're better at compromise usually we're better at uh finding a solution where all the parties are like eventually all the parties are like oh yeah that makes sense because which is really good i think i think in ethereum most people operating at this layer one like they truly want to find the right solution and like often we propose solutions that get iterated on or just totally shut down and like you have to do that most people are very good at that and don't bring a lot of ego to their solutions and because of that i don't think we get to these like weird impasses where we're just bike shedding to death i mean we bike [ __ ] certainly but like not about the important things what's bike shedding um it is a term used quite a bit uh but the idea is we're building a bike shed you and i and obviously bike shows foundation they probably need a concrete foundation they need walls and they need a door all sorts of stuff you maybe even need locks for your bikes for security but like instead of dealing with all that we're just sitting here arguing about like the color we're gonna paint the ship you know and the shed doesn't even exist yet um and so bike shedding is when uh people get hung up on some sort of minute detail that like doesn't really matter and we're not like we're not even getting to the meat of it so like the name of an api endpoint like that could be the thing that is bike shed to oblivion because there's no there's no correct name there's literally no correct answer like there's there's it becomes a matter of opinion and once you get to these areas that are a bit more of a matter of opinion rather than like some sort of absolute correctness and nothing has an absolute correctness but there's certainly things that like get closer in that direction but when you get farther away from that direction like naming things like that you get you get into bike shedding um and if you look at like all core dev calls sometimes it'll be like 20 meet and then 80 bike shutting but then if you say that people are bike shedding then somebody that really cares about the issue this isn't bike shedding this is really really important so right they don't think they're bike shedding they're they think that they are presenting the objective yeah right okay so i want to unpack that a little bit because building it ethereum no one knows what ethereum is it's kind of like the internet and like the future of ethereum is like what ethereum should be is a subjective thing right we don't have any objective like reference point for what we are trying to build when we're building ethereum so like you said all all choices are subjective and some are some are easier to come to consensus too versus others would you would you say like one way to describe your role is that like you are the facilitator of all these subjective decisions some of these subjective decisions all the teams have consensus on so we can just leave that you know we put that in the rearview mirror but perhaps a lot of them need to have you know pow-wows and deliberation and debriefs about how and why choices are made so would you say like your role has been to be the facilitator of these conversations about these subjective choices that's that's one of my roles i'd say that's one of my roles and the we we like it is subjective there is no absolute as to where we're going but there are design considerations there are like deep philosophical things that are guiding us um obviously like we don't have to all agree on them all but like you can go we can you can begin to cite you'll be like we've been working on proof of stake for like six years and like it has these the like these these are things we're trying to achieve and like the ethos of the communities kind of rallied around this you know and so that becomes something to help you help guide you but also there's other design considerations like complexity is the enemy of everything in in uh consensus systems and so like minimizing complexity even at the cost of of some advanced feature set or like optim some optimization often you know is a guiding light and that you know is generally agreed upon you know but you maybe there's five percent of engineers in this process that like they're not afraid of complexity at all right so they're you know there's a bit of there's like a compromise that has to happen there so um so yeah subjective but the there's this this is like ethos and philosophy and and kind of design guiding guiding like guiding light that's guiding us um and sometimes i have to help can try to contextualize that sometimes i have to help try to figure out what the community thinks is designing light or the the priorities and like i don't know it's all messy all right so yes you you said uh values and ethos will help guide the decisions how how much how well defined do you think that actually is because like if you really want to get down to it there's no actual source of single source of truth for anything in this universe right like are there any very very concrete things that like well this choice abides by this set of values uh obviously like decentralization is perhaps a very concrete value that no one disagrees with um are there any other values that like you can like name for for for us here but even decentralization is is on a spectrum and so like you know the bitcoiners might say that we've we've like gone off the deep end on you know in terms of it being some sort of centralized process or centralized protocol or something like that and i don't i don't agree with that but then i think other protocols have gone off the deep end in terms of centralization and design considerations and things like that so um [Music] decentralization certainly top one um decentralization also there there's many different things that can mean um often in protocol design we're considering like it not being able to be captured by powerful interests and not being able to be censored and things like that and the i would say there's there's a an ethos of an ethereum of assuming that the world as it is today and the way the world interacts with blockchains today is not as the world will be in five 10 or 20 years um so you end up seeing protocols that they make what i would what people consider pretty large compromises because well this is how it works you know no one's doing this no one's doing that like it's going to be fine uh whereas and there's a very strong ethos and ethereum assuming that something that can be captured will likely to be attempted to be captured uh if it's valuable enough and we're attempting to build things that are very big and very valuable um and so the we're not we're not we're trying to think about like you know what what happens when a state actor cares what happens when you know some mega cartel of uh some of the richest people in the world care like that kind of stuff what happens when when the banks are trying to shut it down um whereas and so that that's definitely it's definitely a design consideration what are the other philosophies um that proof of stakes better than proof of work yeah i mean i could i could that seems pretty binary yeah i mean there might be a spectrum there we were trying to do hybrid proof of work proof steak at one point so that's that's that's the spectrum although i don't think that was actually a good idea even though i wrote the eip but the yeah i mean it it's messy it's messy um what what's something that could be captured because like obviously all of ethereum is like or like you know enough stake to validate the chain in ways that you deem appropriate like obviously having enough ether that's one way to get capture but like what are the other like mechanisms that like maybe somebody that's not developer minded like i am wouldn't think of that is like a an attack point that you guys trying hard enough well you would well i think that this is this is something you would think about which is uh capture the governance process sure you know like the fact that you can upgrade ethereum is dangerous the fact that we can upgrade ethereum is dangerous and in bihari becomes increasingly so as the powers that be give [ __ ] about this stuff you know like there's there's a bunch of developers a bunch of community members there's a bunch of signals and stuff and and those i'm certain could all be manipulated and i don't think that's what's happening today but i do think that that could happen in the future right what about something that actually involves writing code in a specific way where if we write the code this way like it might be open for capture in the future yeah yeah um one thing that comes to mind is uh p2p networking you know it's we make assumptions about the amount of honest actors on a network we make assumptions about being able to connect and being able to get in and actually find the right network um and some of that the p2p stuff in general actually becomes a bit like uh a bit more a bit harder to define in an objective way like consensus mechanisms you can be like if two alternative chain histories were created a minimum of this amount of stake is slashable like that you can make you're very clearly define it whereas like defining someone being um griefed on a pdp network and and all the vectors there and being eclipsed and things like that is usually a bit usually a bit tougher and so um definitely places that you have to uh it's easy to not harden that i guess is the is the point but you you got to spend the time doing that let me think dependencies that's an interesting one um reducing your the the software dependencies that you have um [Music] reduces the ability for people to kind of make their way into your code unsuspectingly uh like for example if you had a dependency for a big integer library some random library and like one guy maintains it and like your client is is running on this then all of a sudden that one guy can potentially like get a bug in that dependency that then affects all the arithmetic in your client which could then lead to xyz bug you know printing a million ether or something like that uh multi-client helps us there uh but that's you know there's a lot there's a lot of different entry points not even an attack vector that i even knew who existed that's called a supply chain attack on the on the software itself but there's hardware supply chain attacks too um and apparently you know well there's a last up there but the like you could imagine there being some sort of box that people love the steak on and you literally just bug the hardware and you still get those keys right yeah but that's not your responsibility it's not but it's worth considering if there are safe ways to try to prevent that i mean one consideration for that would be like the separation of of the active staking key and the withdrawal credentials you know right by doing that by by having the ultimate ownership of funds being a key that could be much colder and maybe on a hardware wallet you know protects you against certain supply chain attacks at least you know you could these those attacks could still potentially steal keys but and could get you slashed but you'd maybe lose one each instead of 32e right so what are your entire protocol design considerations there what what you're talking about i think for for listeners who didn't follow that is that when you stake your 32 ether you predetermine the outgo outbound ethereum address where when you unstake that ether where that ether actually goes so when you want to take your ether rather than just like unstake my ether and send it to this address you actually give your ethereum address that it will be unstaked to when it is unstaked that was right right right right so you you talked about um uh maybe how there are some assumptions that are made in the ethereum protocol and this is of course a subjective uh decision that must be made um with historically with all these client teams and making these decisions is our people generally come to consensus about these things about where what the assumption level should be or is it a bunch of like is there a disagreement or a tend toward disagreement or 10 toward agreement what's that process like case by case basis yeah i mean it's been a case the case way case basis i think that the people that are working on you know the proof of stake consensus aspect of this protocol one inherited a lot so inherited a lot of the philosophy and a lot of the design considerations from eth1 from the existing proof of work chain um and uh you know a few core people wrote a lot of the the initial specifications so like myself italic justin drake and others and so those initial specifications are grounded deeply with a certain philosophy but then design and considerations ripple outward from there so one you know we we iterate quite a bit on specifications with engineers and teams and then the specifications only contain so much so engineers are ultimately making decisions but i think they are grounded very deeply in a certain ethos but you do see a bit of a you see different philosophical decisions coming out in different clients um so maybe like an enterprise client might cut corners here or there to make things nice for enterprise or make you know some user experience really nice whereas like a client that wants to be running on you know unstoppable embedded hardware and like routers and all sorts of stuff all over the world like they might have like a different you know standard that they're they're holding to it maybe it makes the ux worse switching gears a little bit here although i think this conversation is going to going to weave in and out a little bit is uh the culture around all of these uh client devs um uh not none of them work for the eef they kind of they correct me if i'm wrong here um like they all kind of have their own internal treasury that they use to pay out all of the developers but i feel like the the vibe of the job is they're all kind of kind of what you described your job at the ef is like well you receive a paycheck but you don't really answer to anyone you kind of just have your your job so everyone's a lot more loose loosely organized everyone kind of just like gets up and works loosely works what's so like the the answer is probably obvious is but uh like when you get up in the morning and like i don't i don't i don't think you have a boss um or maybe you technically do but you probably doesn't feel like you do um like what keeps you accountable like why why does danny actually do the things that are in his job description i ask myself that sometimes i don't i don't have a job description but i perceive a job description yeah i because i care i care a lot and i don't know why i mean i think i know why but sometimes you know throughout the years it ebbs and flows in different directions but like i cannot help myself like i cannot i cannot not wake up and immediately like figure out what the new problem is or wake up and like realize that if i don't do x y or z that the merge literally might be delayed by two weeks because we're like trying to get the specs out and stuff and like i just i i care and then i care because i care about the technology but i also like the way it's all structured is it's all this it's all this open source project that we're building together it's and and it's a community so like the accountability doesn't necessarily come from a direct boss or anything the accountability comes from the fact that i'm a member of this community building this thing and and i have i have this emergent responsibility building this thing with these people and if i if i didn't do what i thought i could do and do my best to do so um i would be uh not giving giving my my all to this community that i i care about and i'm deeply integrated in um and that's the community angle there's the like i care about shipping this piece of technology um and then i don't know there's a certain level of of obsession um that i and pretty much everyone else i work with has um and that's probably because of the community thing it's probably because of the impact but it's just like someone someone mentioned it like ethereum is just the ultimate nerd snipe um and i i the word nerd isn't even the right word like i don't necessarily consider myself a nerd but just the like it is such an interesting problem it is such like the combination of of uh economics and cryptography and game theory and and programming and distributed systems like it's unbelievable it's like hilariously interesting um and it's captivated me for many years now i just had to look up nerd snipe so for for those that also needed to look up uh nerd sniper typing is a slang term that describes a particularly interesting problem that is presented to a nerd often a physicist tech geek or mathematician the nerd stops all activity to devote attention to solving the problem often at his or her own peril danny do you feel like your own do you feel in peril at times because of ethereum sometimes sometimes i feel like if you're if ethereum holds you hostage i think it might i think it might i'm serious like i've been infected you know like the the memes the the mimetics like the infectious idea like that that thing like you know i've definitely been infected like i cannot it's hard for me to think about other things i have to like rip myself away and like go go to the gym or go hike in the woods to like force myself to not think about this thing um which is incredible i never thought i'd be so wrapped up in something and care so much about something but it's also like it's also a lot yeah yeah um do you like if you went and just like left off for the day like went to the beach or just like whatever like maybe two days in a row like would you feel like did you feel guilty what emotions would you feel while you were not working on ethereum no i i don't think i'd definitely some anxiety because like it all keeps moving like because because i'm going to open my phone even if i didn't look at it for two days i'm not with my phone i'm gonna have literally 500 messages and like many of them are going to be in like interesting technical conversations that one i want to follow and two uh i often i often have very strong opinions about all these conversations and so like i want to make sure that i help steer in the direction that i think is is good um and so you know if i if i disappear for too long you know who knows it might be steered in that direction i have to like try to right the ship right he might have implemented a dpos eip or something i i don't mean to i don't mean to imply so i think i work a lot i do and i love and i enjoy it uh but i think i actually have like a pretty good work life balance compared to some like i go to the gym almost every day i love camping i love hiking i got a beautiful wife that i hang out out with you know plenty of friends that kind of stuff so like i i i pride myself in having a good work-life balance but i also think i work a ton so i don't know there's i don't know where the line is right right yeah the cool thing about ethereum is like when i think everyone who finds a job in oh probably greater crypto too is that no one actually feels like they're working i'm sure some people do um but the the perhaps of why this thing has been so sustainable when it comes to infecting your brain is that because like it doesn't actually feel like work i yes i agree and simultaneously uh it does not feel like working but it can still be exhausting sure yeah right yeah absolutely there's yeah no plenty of things that aren't work are very very exhausting running a marathon is exhausting but it's it's not technically my job right um have you ever thought about like what you're going to do with yourself once ethereum calcifies no um i will either not be in technology or i will be working on open source technology i'm not i will not be working on closed source technology ever um i know because as a matter of principle yeah i mean it just doesn't interest me and also one of the reasons i'm doing what i'm doing is because uh i'm trying to make an impact on the world and i don't think close source software is the the right way for me to make that impact right but it's we'll see we'll see it's hard to imagine doing something else um although i certainly will do something else eventually um and yeah i my guiding principle is is to work on things that i i care about and to try to create value not in the sense of like lining my pockets with cash but like fundamentally try to create value um and in doing so i will continue to open doors and be able to work on interesting things that has worked out for me so far i'm also very fortunate very lucky person in many respects but um i figure if i keep doing what i'm doing keep working on interesting things keep working with interesting people that um whatever that next door is it will oh it'll be it'll be a good one do you see yourself putting the entrepreneur hat back on and building something on ethereum and now that you've finished the the foundation build build a product maybe um i think that that would be it'd be the right thing and not to be the right people you know if there was a person or two that i really really wanted to essentially hack on a project with for a few years um then then i would um but i'm not i'm not certain this is funny a funny so i got into proof of stake so like i i work on a lot of things but like i really focus on proof of stake for sake implementations and research and specifications and security and all that kind of stuff um in 2017 right at the beginning i got rid of all my clients because i had become obsessed with ethereum and i was going to figure out how to make it work how to make it my job and i for that first probably half year i was just kind of bumbling around you know i was i lived in new orleans at the time and i thought to myself if i'm going to be serious about this i need to go to the new orleans ethereum meetup and there wasn't one so i made i made the new orleans ethereum meetup you know and then i i was like i had never contributed open source before which is crazy because i was a believer in open source and i used it a lot in my projects and stuff but i had not like gone to a project and just contributed back so i was also like just start contributing to anything and everything you know i contributed to piper's web3.pi library of python tooling library for ethereum um and and started just contributing things and i wrote a few smart contracts trying to figure out maybe i'll maybe there's a business opportunity there and then i then i was like learning more about this shift this proof-of-stake thing coming and my first thought was that's never going to work that doesn't make any sense but then two two days later two weeks later two months later i don't remember uh it i was like oh i get it you know both of these are proof of dedication of economic scarce economic resource to the protocol you know it's easy to prove that about mining hardware and electricity and it's also easy to prove about the end protocol asset itself and so i was like okay this is starting to make sense and so i thought maybe i could make a staking pool and so i started i started digging into proof of stake because i thought it was coming in like five months and i thought i could make a staking pool and so like that that opened up my my contributions like that that that is why i got under proof of state because i was like there might be a business opportunity here and uh turned out there was a lot of work to still do so i had to kick the can down the curb on the business opportunity um and i will i will say wholeheartedly at this point i have zero intention to make mistaking pool that does not interest me at all at this point uh but that's the the business opportunity was what actually made me do the dive the deep dive on proof of stake to begin with that's that's pretty funny here i also in 2018 thought about like a model for a staking pool company and i actually pitched it to this ico advisory company that i worked for at the time and uh uh peter vestness who was the uh the owner of the company new alchemy uh he said that uh proof of stake is years away and i was like no it's not peter no it's like right around the corner it's like six months away we gotta start building this thing and that was again in 2018. yeah yeah i helped write eip1011 hybrid proof of workproof mistake and at the time i and i was in 2018 i was like certain main net by the end of 2018 no problem like no problem it's really funny that like um the 2017 bull market at least inside of the ethereum land everyone was like buying ether and ether was running up to 1400 because people were like speculating that staking is casper's coming casper's coming it's like it's right around the corner right and in 2020 and 2021 it's the same thing it's really coming it's coming i went to the i went to the merge interrupt and and uh saw some beautiful things that is actually coming how was that by the way i was thinking about it when you said that work doesn't feel like work um because multiple times during that week and we were in greece i was like walking back to my room and just and i get overwhelmed just with like a i'm having a fantastic time like i'm having a great time uh and after having been spending eight hours like in a room with 30 other people like thinking about hard problems and debugging software and all that kind of stuff which like i don't know if i don't know if i'm allowed to consider that having a great time but i was having a great time so um it was awesome it was like exactly the right time exactly the right group of people um and five times more productive than our wildest dreams so uh it was it was very very excellent is the in real life component with the reason why it's so productive you think i would say yes except yes with an asterisk the asterisk being that it has to be the right time and a project it has to be the right group like it made a lot of sense because we're done with london we're done with altair and we have the we have like the core specs for all the stuff and there was a little bit of lead time so that people could work on and lay the foundations in their software before we met and so like all of that doing all of the other stuff before probably would have wasted time if we were together um you know whereas we got together and we had this like very interesting structure in interop where most a lot of the software work had been done leading up to it and what you're doing is you're kind of like pairing off with different groups and and you're like can our software work together oh let's fix the bugs and then then you switch and you go with other group and you kind of like architect this pyramid of increasing complexity throughout the week and at the same time having conversations to iron out okay now that everyone has implemented the specs what are the issues you know what do we need to refine you know so we could have very deep conversations about uh ironing out the last bits of the specs and at the same time also like do this like culmination thing where we get to this mega milestone at the end of the week and and so yes there's magic to being in person but i i'm also like a um decentralization maximalist for a lot of it too because like the value and what i can do at home and writing software and stuff like it's just a different it's a different type of exchange and i you don't want one or the other all the time and but it was really nice coming together after like two years of being a part right yeah um i think a lot of people had very similar feelings in new york recently for for mainnet where uh a lot of people are literally just coming out of their homes for the first time since covid and also crypto is very very different in 2021 than than pre-coveted times like we've actually blossomed into some sort of like society and um just the the richness of the social interactions as a result maybe as a result of that or just maybe just in general inside of crypto for some reason social interactions in crypto seemed far more rich than all the other social interactions i've ever had in any other context and i think maybe it's because everyone has like shared stories shared values shared like purpose and is also intellectually intellectually curious i think everyone in crypto is generally intellectually curious and then like when you like hide people away for two years and then get them and then and then pump their pri their asset prices by 10x and then put them in a room together turns out they have like a lot of things to share yeah i think that's that's all it's all very true hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with danny thus far stay tuned for the second half of the show where we talk further about the dev interrupt event and also danny's optimism or pessimism about the future of the world and what he can do about that i had a fantastic time talking with danny here but first before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrarium you can get the performance of the centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built on arbitrage many default applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defy apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defy apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space the thing about the interop and about some other similar events is like how much everyone gives a [ __ ] um raises the level of engagement with the level of conversation and level of just enthusiasm and fun um whereas i could imagine being in a more traditional business context and like people are there to like do their job but you know there's not a there's not that that giving a [ __ ] that that's there also just everyone's so uh aligned on shipping the merge um philosophically uh from a perfect perspective of climate change like all sorts of angles like everyone there was like like they're on a mission like we're doing this thing um whereas you could imagine other things even in ethereum or in crypto there's like less of that like deep deep deep mission like state experience i mean state x3 is incredible like we we need we need a sustainable state solution period end of discussion but doesn't have that uh as much of this like world-changing feeling to it but i'm also very biased i love proof-of-stake why why is proof-of-stake so grand when it comes to meaning and impact for so many people at the dev op event and or just the ethereum devs in general one of the big things was was climate change a lot of people just like uh and i hadn't i hadn't expected how much most of the people at that event were were feeling impacted by that like i talk about you know proof of stake making things more secure more sustainable and more scalable all the time you know and i mentioned the the reduction in energy usage by like 99.99 you know and but and and i think it it makes an impact to some but i i was surprised and i shouldn't have been but i was surprised throughout the week how often various developers were just like this is literally the most impactful thing i will ever do with respect to climate change in my life like i i will not be able to like outstep this this accomplishment you know so there was just this like feeling of actually being able to make an impact especially when you look at estimations and ethereum uses like as much energy as poland or something you know and climbing is it simply just a function of ethereum using less electricity or is there a deeper like relationship between proof-of-stake and climate change or is it simply as simple as just moving away from proof-of-work yeah i mean i think it's if we have crypto economic consensus mechanisms and which the asset securing it the quantity and capital securing the protocol scales with the value of the protocol um when that is energy consumption um you quite simply have this like tough relationship between energy consumption and and the security and value of the protocol which like we all want the security and value of the protocol to increase um and so there's a bit of a i guess a dark side to it um and look i you know we could i'm i don't buy the like bitcoiner uh green energy thing or that like bitcoin is gonna usher in the new wave of green energy i don't buy that i think there is probably some nuance to the argument i think you could have like an interesting debate as to like if you have these proof of work mechanisms what does the future look like in 20 years you know does it look like bitcoin using 50 of all the energy in the world probably not it's like it's hard to imagine that that becomes the reality um and so maybe there's like more nuance into how this this actually ripples outward but um nonetheless i i would uh i would make a pretty grand bet that 80 or more of bitcoin and ethereum's energy consumption is not clean um and making an impact on that seems seems meaningful i think there's also there's other components not just the uh [Music] not just co2 emissions climate change that kind of stuff i mean there's also the uh the access and the potential like the amount of people that can participate in a proof of stake protocol in a meaningful way is probably much larger than proof of work it's also more equitable in a sense that i can very purely turn capital into um an equitable participation um in in the securing the protocol whereas in proof of work like that scales very poorly for small actors so like the more capital that you have uh the more entrance you can get into real world supply chains the more return you can get on your capital and the economies of scale and so like you you know fundamentally even you set the energy stuff aside that asset being grounded so much in the real world in not the metaverse uh means that you you don't get kind of the the same equitability in the the crypto economic consensus mechanism which one is maybe not nice from a philosophical standpoint but it's also not nice from a security security standpoint was there um any conversations at this interop event about bitcoin and how bitcoin is like bad or needs to change or um shoot like should be shut down or any sort of like resistance towards bitcoin as a as a system um we don't spend too much time on bitcoin uh it's certainly it's the butt of jokes sometimes um you know i think people people that are working on ethereum proof of stake find bitcoin probably pretty uninteresting um it's very interesting because it moved the needle you know went from zero to one but it uh people also i think tend to find it very uninteresting and then there's certainly toxic there's toxic members of any community um i think if you look at twitter there's a lot of uh loud toxic uh bitcoin members community members and so i think that sometimes when conversations come up that type of group like we would focus on that we're instead of focusing on maybe some of the good but i don't think we see a lot of the good because we don't we're not deeply rooted in their community we just see the loud toxic people we there in conversations we were there was a running joke about um [Music] writing a proposal maybe a bitcoin improvement proposal to utilize uh not not our beacon chain not the theorem's beacon chain but a bit a beacon chain you know an ins and instantiate instantiation of the same technology to do a merge for bitcoin and to help them get off of proof of work there are some complexities there in how you actually lock your lock your stake you might actually you might need a new opcode i know they're pretty resistant to resistant to that but i think it'd be pretty fun um even to just take as a social experiment yeah i mean literally just like you know in 2017 there were 100 000 bitcoin forks like bitcoin diamond and whatever the hell uh you could you could you could make a uh you could make a bitcoin fork once once ethereum has proven that you can safely move from proofwork to stake you can make a bitcoin fork and try to try to rally the world around it uh using the same technology that we've used in ethereum to to secure it i think um who does that really really matters right yeah well why not you that's what i'll do once the theory must apply i'm gonna i'm gonna help bitcoin move to proof of stake um what about um roone christensen's blog post with a recent blog post i don't know if you read that or not was that a topic of conversation at the interop event i don't know the blog post i'm sorry uh he was proposing that maker dao with its efforts to go into the real world and search for a real world collateral specifically finds climate aligned collateral right so maker dow has already financed like a 2.4 million dollar loan die loan to a solar panel farm in new york and then he talked about like you know more philosophically maker dao should find a collateral like find opportunities to finance and get collateral that is climate aligned and can actually like move the needle with regards to climate change and then we didn't we didn't come from conversation that's interesting i mean there's two different angles there one is like ride the hype like maybe you you get you get good press and it helps make your doubt it just like have this aligned basket but there's also like yeah i think it's more interesting if you can make a compelling uh business case you know maybe the the thesis is that these are actually the the types of collateral and the types of businesses that are going to be very fruitful over the next 10 to 20 years and that's why you know maker dao is being aligned um you know i don't know i don't know exactly his angle there yeah um my angle on it was that like there's a lot of uh the very far left social justice warrior cancel culture types that are also very very anti-capitalism um and what what happens if you can like create a money that fights climate change where if you use this money you're by proxy providing climate change like you actually might onboard some of that demographic into the world of money and finance and say like yeah we do we do know that money and finance is corrupt and bad but not this money in finance like this money in finance is actually good it's the inverse of that yeah why don't you learn to use money and finance and new coordination techniques to create the world you want to see mm-hmm yeah totally um so one thing about the the dev uh interop event and overall like uh i was joking with uh but i think both ryan and anthony suzanna in different contexts about this like from you you know what it's like to be there and actually to experience it a lot of us who the non-tech types view it from a distance right view it from twitter and we just see the pictures and so like from our perspective it's like this semi-regular like ceremonious time where we see pictures of all these developers looking at this projected screen with a bunch of code on it and they're all happy they're all happy and clapping and so like all the devs are like looking at the screen they're all everyone's smiling and then like everyone else is seeing the smiles on the devs face and so for us it's like yay the devs are happy i don't know what's going on but like they're happy so that's nice i showed that picture to my sister last night and i showed her the other picture from ben edgington's tweet i showed her the other picture of um of the screen we're all looking at and she just cracked up she thought it was hilarious she's like of course of course for context i don't know if it's on that picture but one of the pictures that was shared the key was there's a tiny little piece of text that said proof-of-stake stage entered or entered proof-of-stake stage you know and that's what we were all cheering about right right right okay so this is the first mock test net or actual test net for the the merge so you simulated the merge was that what happened right so we kicked off a proof-of-stake beacon chain that was not merged you know like the beacon chain is today in production and we kicked off a proof of work chain that was not merged and was run by proof of work both of these things hung out in parallel for a while and then they uh they did the dance to take the valuable things inside of proof of work and to instead put them into proof of stake and stop listening to work and finalize and and move on with its business so it was it was the what we were cheering was kind of the culmination of the week which was we had a lot of very short-lived devnets so like even just transitory i have two nodes running on my computer like running an experiment for 30 minutes and i'm like okay the experiment worked that's good you know and we had like i said we had a lot of these different client pairs where like geth and tech geth and tekku would like pair up for a bit and like make sure the software worked together and nimbus and nethermine would pair off and like make sure their software worked together and like we were building out more and more complex versions of all the interactions throughout the week um and but often you know with two or three nodes like nothing crazy like very small toy networks and what we did at the end of the week was perry who is a a devops wizard at the ef who has been increasingly taking ownership over test nets and automation all sorts of stuff he'd been working all week on on automation of all this stuff and so he took all the configuration and automated a 100 node deploy around the world so like 100 different cloud instances around the world uh with different client pairs and builds and like automated the creation of the the beacon chain network and the proof of work network and and um and kind of kicked it all into motion and then it was about i think they ran independently for about an hour and then uh we had it on the projector when they when the the trigger event came together and they and they merged and so it was really that like taking it from a toy on our laptops and you know different like reduction in complexity of different configurations so like bringing it to uh something that really you know felt real uh that network i think was torn down yesterday and there's a new one pithos which is the um it's supposed to be a longer standing one that is was it launched literally like an hour it was launched this morning but like the configurations became available about an hour ago and i already started seeing some of the east staker guys i think lamboshi was on it he was already running nodes and you know so now the the community can also interact with it um can you tell us what the sound was like when in the room when that proof-of-stake mode entered happened like was it was it like oh yay neat or was it like more of a roar of people like what i mean it was it was legitimate like legitimate joy legitimate like clapping not not just like a little golf clap but like clapping cheering people people literally hugged each other you know um it was it was it was an incredible energy and we actually we had this closing dinner at 7 30 that night and the the time stamp that we we did the merge because you proof of works especially when you're cpu mining a proof of work chain it's like hard to fully gauge the timing but it was 7 29 it was t-minus one minute till dinner like we were either gonna go to dinner like super [ __ ] excited and floored about what just happened or like kind of with our heads hung like the last chance of running this experiment it failed and it was a success and like we kind of we all just went to dinner after and had a had a great evening celebrating that's so yeah a minute before you you have to go to dinner so i'm sure maybe some amount of clapping was like oh thank god we get to go to dinner i don't even i mean i i doubt i mean i think we were all a bit late for dinner but it was um that the timing couldn't have been couldn't have been better it couldn't have been more suspense inducing dramatic yeah yeah do do who did you get shivers uh i probably not i got something i got what i needed again uh in a completely different direction um is your wife a crypto person yes okay does she understand like what you're up to my wife works for the ethereum foundation oh okay so she does oh well there's the answer to that question yeah i didn't was she there with you um she uh she used to be a pastry chef in a french restaurant on the french border in new orleans and i started traveling a bunch for work and so us being you know young and having fun i was like well definitely quit your job and come travel internationally with me a bunch and she got to know some of the people on the grants team and they needed someone to help like answer emails and stuff uh so she started as the person who helped answer emails and stuff and then like three or four months later was the team lead nice very cool so like when you when you were like i mean you work at home but when you quote come home from work and like vent about stuff like she's like oh god the the guys from teku were just so annoying today is is that some of the conversations that go on we some yes i certainly she knows what i'm when i'm bitching about something she knows what i'm bitching about um and uh and she understands things enough to like when i describe some issue i'm banging my head against the wall she like understands the domain of the issue right but it's also sometimes we'll be like driving into the mountains uh for for a weekend and we'll just be like talking about ethereum and be like we got to stop like we like i can literally talk about ethereum all day to the people on the internet and then i can like go have dinner and talk about there and more and it's uh it's very cool but it's also sometimes a little much eric connor who is the first ever guest on layer zero we were talking about this dynamic where like you literally can wake up and do ethereum things until you go to bed uh and then repeat that for years uh and then you get what we call this thing called ethereum brain where like you know you just have like toxic levels of ethereum going around in in your brain but you said you have good work work life balance so so maybe you don't have too much ethereum brain i um i have a good work life balance i do i do get a step away from the computer i do make sure i have nice little trips and things like that and i i do go out to dinner and stuff but i also i'm i'm probably toxically infected when you say you guys go to the mountains are you hiking or backpacking a bit of both just kind of depends sometimes we'll go stay at a motel in the mountains and hike around a bit and put around some towns or sometimes we'll go backpacking and my favorite thing is to um swim in very cold alpine lakes so often we'll be hiking up to 13 000 feet to find a nice lake to jump into yeah which was like recently snow a few weeks ago uh yeah i mean it just it just depends i mean sometimes there's like snow on the on the outside of it still uh just depends on the time of the year i you know i think we're at minimum the minimum snow hey um three weeks ago and i think it snowed up in the mountains about a week ago so the cycle has begun if your cat hadn't come on screen i was gonna ask about it so that's tycho tyco yeah how old the he's eight eight the image i have of you we were on zoom at some point in time but there was this time where you had you had tycho and taiko was facing the computer so uh he he yeah he was facing the computer so like kind of like pseudo looking at the camera and you were just like massaging his head it was like at least 20 minutes long of like you you just yeah just like massaging your head while tycho like kind of looked into the camera right in front of you i thought it was absolutely hilarious yeah and there he is yeah i mean i i tell tycho sometimes psycho you're my best friend and i mean it and not a sad way that goes my best friend nice yeah yeah he's looking spent a lot of time working on proof of stake with me nice yeah more moral support danny you can do it danny so uh what else do you do for fun other than backpacking and hiking are you a gamer at all no nope i probably left gaming behind when i was about 13. okay i was i played i think diablo ii and starcraft were my main games at the time i played a little bit of counter-strike and stuff but i um music and girls became much more interesting way to spend my time so i ain't playing or listening to girls no to music playing what do you play um these days i play mainly piano but i in high school i played a lot of piano but also uh bass i played in like jazz bands and metal bands do and you still play play piano to this day when i was 18 i went to school and i stopped playing music and um about four years ago i got a piano and i've been i play about every day so i took a hiatus but i i play most days now and i i very much enjoy it what kind of piano do you play um i learn some classical pieces um and and play that i also just kind of mess around and i i do actually when we launched the the beacon chain i bought myself a present uh i got this like moog synth so i have a piano and i have this synth uh next to each other and like you know i kind of mess around and make weird electronic stuff uh between the two nice have you have you heard of uh ben from optimism his ethereum song yes yeah very very good ever thought about uh writing something like that uh i'm not or is that or is that tainting of something that's holy that doesn't need to be mixed it definitely i think it definitely doesn't need to be mixed i also i i don't think i've ever played the piano and sang at the same time so it would be a challenge it'd be a new challenge maybe i should try so i think this question is always much more fun when somebody's actually a musician what kind of music do you listen to so in college my music tastes changed um because i started coding no [ __ ] i stopped listening to music with words like almost entirely and started listening to a lot more electronic music and i listened to like ambient electronic music most of the time uh very experimental like very like kind of out there sounds and soundscapes and things like that and i can definitely attribute that to like being in college drinking that cup of coffee putting on my headphones and just like coding and like getting into voting for the first time and like what what got me going when i code and like i that radically has changed my music chase and over the past couple of years i've like tried to reintroduce not when i'm coding but like if i'm in the car or different things like that like i'll put on i don't know talking heads or put on like the beatles or put on something where somebody's literally saying words um to like pull myself out of the uh the ether but is it because the words are distracting while you're coding or is there something else there i think so i think that's probably it i mean it's not just that the words are distracting it's that these soundscapes are like enhancing um like i oh here's a good one when i first in 2017 when i got rid of my clients and i wanted to figure out how to make theater in my work um i would listen to all the all core dev calls and the opening is um steep hills of vicodin tears by a winged victory for sullen um that's another helpful yeah so that that became like my anthem for a while like that album like every morning i would just like i'd drink a cup of coffee put on the headphones and like figure out how to make ethereum you know where to bring value to ethereum and i would just like listen to that album and something about the fact that it's the opener to the all-core dev call um and that it also kind of fit my ambient soundscape mode like it became like my uh my power music that's that's awesome that's a great story um andy uh danny as we come down to the end of the show i have just a few more questions for you are you an optimist or a pessimist i i used to be an optimist so when i was a kid very extremely optimistic and i think it served me well and i've realized actually probably over the course of the past 10 years i've become less of one so i'm very optimistic about my life so like i i you know i i have a good life i have a great cat got a cool wife um i have a great job all that kind of stuff um and so so i'm definitely optimistic in social relationships and kind of the the microcosm of my world um but i definitely like the old man like shaking his finger at the rest of the world in a certain sense like i don't i you know i'm super pessimistic about politics i'm super pessimistic about like our you know uh mass surveillance capitalism i'm super pessimistic about a lot of that kind of stuff um and and to to to a way that i i need to make peace with um because i think it like gets me a little bit too much and i also sound like the whack job when i'm talking to uh regular people but um the but that's also one of the reasons i work on ethereum you know if you asked me in in 2017 why why i wanted to work on theory and one nerd sniped totally but two was just like i don't i don't like the trajectory of the world i don't like what's happening with with big technology i don't like how we're all super manipulated by our phones and like we have these little slot machines in our pockets and they're just like abusing us and like i don't think ethereum solves all those problems but i do think that ethereum and related technology might help change the trajectory um and i think it might help change directory for good you never know you never know i do worry about that sometimes you know like the tools that are built are often co-opted by the powers that be to kind of continue doing business as usual i do think that ethereum and related technologies allow for new ways to interact and maybe kind of help avoid some of those previous issues but you know i'm also naive well danny i think that that is a fantastic
