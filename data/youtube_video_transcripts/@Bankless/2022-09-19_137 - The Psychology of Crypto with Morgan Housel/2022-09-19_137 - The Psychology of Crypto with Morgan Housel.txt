most of the time most financial debates and arguments and disagreements are not actually people disagreeing with each other it's people with different circumstances different risk tolerances and different time horizons talking over one another and they just don't understand where the other person's coming from welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here alone today david is off at a wedding and i'm here to help you become more bankless bankless nation really exciting episode today with morgan housel the psychology of crypto is what we're calling this episode the goal is to help us hack our minds in order to become better crypto investors and i think people don't realize that there are two tribes in crypto there's kind of the the get rich quick tribe the people who are looking for overnight wealth high api they're chasing pumps and i have no disrespect for this tribe because a lot of us started here in fact i probably started here in one way shape or form and then there's also the get rich slow tribe and those are the people who stick it out through multiple cycles of crypto they're here for like a multi-decade time horizon they're long-term holders i definitely consider myself in that camp one of the settlers not one of the crypto tourists this episode in particular is probably for the get rich slow tribe so if you're get rich quick tribe this advice might not land but i think someday maybe after you're burnt maybe after you have a cycle or two under your belt you'll come back to this episode and get some value and it'll land a few takeaways and benefits to look for number one why crypto isn't special i talk about this with morgan the same rules of investor psychology apply to traditional financial markets and krypto and we talk about what those rules are number two why people in crypto have this toxic relationship with money and how to fix it and number three we get into practical advice there's 10 things every crypto investor should know about wealth greed happiness and how to survive and thrive in crypto because that is what we're here to do at bankless guys we're going to get right into the episode with morgan but first i want to tell you about these awesome tools to help you go bankless lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3social rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there zk sync is an ethereum layer 2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zk sync has combined the power of zero knowledge roll-ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web 3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need zk sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll-ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk-sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zk syncs website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at zksync bankless nation i am super excited to introduce you to our next guest morgan housel he is a partner at the collaborative fund he's a financial writer he's also a student of markets and psychology and he blends both of these perspectives to give us timeless lessons on wealth greed happiness and how to invest i don't think this is so much financial advice as it is life advice maybe a combination of both morgan it's great to have you welcome to bankless thank you so much for having me i appreciate it thanks ryan hey so i recently read your book um and i had not caught it when it first came out but i'm glad i i read it and i i just want to thank you for maybe writing one of the best crypto investing books i've ever read uh and apparently maybe yeah i me i mean that seriously because that's kind of what i thought when i when i read it is oh my god a 100 of this applies very directly to crypto and these are lessons i think that a lot of crypto investors being kind of new to the scene being new to money management in general being new to wealth allocation in general they forgot to learn around uh like along the way um what do you think about that i mean has anyone in crypto said that this is a fantastic crypto investing book what's interesting for me you know my background i've always been very upfront with i i have never and don't own any crypto assets at all i'm not ruling out that i won't one day and i'm not against it i am not the crypto bearer who says it's all it's all a joke i just kind of think it's it's fascinating to watch and maybe it's my own uh naive kind of understanding about what's going on but i i consider myself a very neutral observer but i do not own any of it what i think is so interesting that you the point that you brought up though is how much all of finance and financial history and whatever asset you are investing in it tends to just be a repeat of the same behaviors over and over and over again and so much in this industry is focused on what's going to change particularly at the tech level the vc level the crypto level what's changing what's the new technology where are we going to go next that's all really important but to me what's always been the most fascinating part of economic history and investing is what never changes what were people doing 100 years ago that they will be doing 100 years from now and definitely i think to your point you can see a lot of the behaviors positive and negative in crypto over the last several years that are a direct echo like identical to what was going on during other bouts of both like crazy market action and new product and company innovation even though it's a brand new product and new technology the behaviors that underline how people respond to those things those never change and i think never will change yeah i think that that is the most salient observation you know from from this book for me and i think for for investors to just hammer in their head in in general and that's the thesis i think of your book that hey good investing is just good psychology uh and people have to level up i mean we're always obsessed with kind of the the external skills or more information that we can kind of bring to the system when the real uh battle or journey in an investor's life is kind of an internal journey i know some munger quote out there who talks about investing being more like a temperament uh and i think that's a crucial piece of the puzzle that crypto investors could stand to learn so the first thing i want crypto listeners to hear is that hey morgan is saying and ryan is saying crypto is not special okay it just falls into the patterns of every other market that's always been here and and the reason for that is we're all running the same human operating software that we were 150 000 years ago and crypto is not any different in that respect but the second lesson i think you're here to kind of tell us is that good investing is good psychology that seemed to me the big takeaway from your book so can you talk about that why is psychology so important in the investor journey yeah let me take both of those questions because those are those are really important the first in terms of psychology i've always just made the point that you can be the smartest financial mind in the world you can have a phd in finance from mit you know all the data all the formulas you you are just an absolute financial savant you can still lose everything in the market if you do lose control over your sense of greed and fear and that's not hype that's not hypothetical like that happens all the time the hedge fund in night that blew up in 1998 long-term capital management they had nobel laureates people who won the nobel prize in finance working at the company and they lost everything they went bankrupt during a bull market it's the craziest thing ever because even though they were the smartest financial minds in the world they had no sense of their own limitations they had no sense of greed and fear they were massively overconfident and those things that i just mentioned those are not financial topics overconfidence and knowing the limits of your intelligence that's all psychology that's just that's really what it is the flip side of this is that you can be someone who has no financial education no background no experience no connections but if you are patient if you do not lose your mind during bouts of greed and fear if you're just kind of a long-term patient buy and hold investor you can do amazing you can do incredible and every couple years we hear these stories about like a country bumpkin like gas station attendant janitor who dies with 10 million dollars in the bank that they leave to charity and these are people who have like the lowest education and experience you can imagine but they were absolute masters at patience and endurance and keeping their head on straight when it mattered most and that's all that matters in investing and i think the important part is that there are almost no other industries where that's the case it's not true in medicine that a country bumpkin who has like good behavior can perform open-heart surgery better than a harvard trained doctor that will never happen that cannot happen but that equivalent does happen in investing it just shows how much uh psychology really under roots all investing success all of it not just some of it but i honestly think all of it to the point about crypto not being special the only crypto take that i've ever made publicly was i had this kind of tongue-in-cheek jerk tweet a couple months ago where i said if you do not find some of crypto fascinating you're not paying attention and if you don't find most of it absurd you're not paying attention and by the way i think that i i mentioned that specifically to crypto but back to things not being special that is true for every new industry that has ever existed in every new industry where the technology is big and world-changing and it's attracting a lot of investors and it's making waves it's always been the case that 90 of it is absurd and not going to work that's that's the normal path of a new industry and if you go but the example i always use if you go back to the early 1900s there were 2 000 car companies in the united states 2 000 car companies that wound up with three gm ford and chrysler two of which ended up going bankrupt by the way but like that's the normal funnel of new innovation is like people try as a thousand different things almost none of which work but the ones that do end up working completely change the world so you can see that happening with crypto in the last year but that's not unique to crypto at all at all computers uh airlines car companies every new industry went through this exact same phase and the other thing that kind of underlines it that is always the case it's never not been the case is that optimism about a new technology exceeds the potential of that new tech that that of that technology that has always been the case another example of this i've always found so interesting is that like the the technology that probably changed america more than anything before or since was railroads that's what changed us from just a sloppy agrarian society to an industrial amazing world-class nation railroads that's what did it and the crazy thing about railroads when they really started coming into use in the mid late 1800s is that virtually all investors not not 100 but virtually all investors lost lost all their money on railroads this is the the world-changing technology that is the key to the future that is going to completely transform society and let's say 90 of investors lost everything now there were a few robber barons that ended up making dynastic fortunes from that but there's a big difference between a technology that can change the world and and making investments that will pay off on that technology the more recent example is what percentage of investors who are betting on the internet changing the world lost lost money in the late 1990s like it's safe to say all of them like it's not actually all of them but it rounds to all of them and i so i think that too is like that's always been the case and i think it always will be the case and so if you were to apply that to crypto today it should not be surprising you know there is the um you know there's been many quotes of like oh 90 of crypto projects will fail or you you open up the news every day and you see something else that's imploded and something else has blown up it is easy to view that as oh a problem with the industry oh this industry is rife with uh fraud and overconfidence my view whenever i see that is like that's par for the course for a new industry and if you don't have the stomach and the risk tolerance to understand that this is not the place for you and i can say that with crypto but again i would say that for every new industry that's ever existed you know i think that's a extremely well said and it's it's that's part of our thesis on bank list too it's definitely part of the bankless thesis and i would even uh you know increase those numbers from 90 in in 99 i mean crypto is kind of like this might be a theme we come back to in the episode but crypto is like traditional markets and traditional market psychology except on steroids and so we might be dealing with a market that is like 99 scam 99 going to zero and then people will see that and they'll be they'll dismiss the entire thing but that's not what's important the important thing is 99 of these projects are vapor are meaningless our scams are going to zero but one percent of them will absolutely fundamentally change the world shake the world yeah and so but but people i think due to um psychology limitations this this human operating system they have a hard time holding those two ideas in so their head mean this is the thesis for the episode right so um good investing is good psychology crypto's not any anything special and so some of the lessons that we can learn that that you've brought out in your book about kind of traditional uh you know financial markets investing they apply 100 percent to crypto and maybe even more so because crypto's just traditional markets on steroids one other thing i want to cover before we get into the in the practical is this i think that just having been in crypto for you know a while and and seeing many people come in and out of crypto i think that many people in crypto have a toxic relationship with money like a very unhealthy relationship with money and uh here's what i mean morgan i think you talk about this a little bit uh in your book about you know generally everyone lots of people have a bad relationship with money but once again i feel like in crypto it's like that except worse we have the same condition everyone else has except we have it worse and why i think it's because we have these higher highs we have these lower lows uh it's just like existing markets except the volatility is like five to ten x and so we have these different kind of participants in mark in in crypto they'll be like the get rich quick tribe so this is the group that thinks i'm joining crypto i'm going to become an overnight millionaire and what what do they end up doing they buy the tops and they sell the bottoms every freaking time every time we see this cycle play out then we have the youtube traders where they think they they enter crypto and they think they're part of that elite five to one percent who can outperform holding and just like trade and so and it goes well for a while and then boom they get completely wiped out then we get another tribe of like developers and and technical evangelists who are like don't talk about price this whole money thing has like corrupted crypto from its foundation so let's not even talk about price anymore let's ignore the wealth creation games and we have like the flashy nfts that people are showing for status rather than kind of the you know the cars and the penthouses we've got people who feel bad about 5x gains because someone on twitter is showing off their 10x gain and they're feeling bad about their and then we have like the pumpers and scam artists and i just want to ask maybe the general question we can extrapolate to crypto why do you think people in general have a toxic unhealthy relationship with money well i think what's what's interesting about new technologies is that it is usually at battle with whatever it's trying to replace and you can see this with like i said the car there's some really fascinating old newspaper clippings when the car was coming into use in the early 1900s about how much indignity it was putting on horses and people were fighting back against cars washington dc this is true you can look it up uh banned cars in i think 1903 because they thought they were in indignity to horses they were trying to protect horses and it was the same thing like when the airplane came about that was at direct battle with trains for transportation and it was the same thing people are like you should not like airplanes are a joke like trains are how you transport things like get out of these flying machines that you have you need to get in the train i think that's that's always been the case but crypto is probably that to a different degree because it's fighting uh against something that is much more fundamental at least the monetary side of it which is traditional money and that is like money is obviously so much of a bigger deal and more ingrained and government controlled than cars or or their horses or trains were it's just a much more entrenched thing it's like you're going to battle now with like a nuclear power that's like variance it's like this is a big big battle this is not a little street you know brawl this is a big time war here and i think that's that that could be really dangerous when you view when you when your view shifts from not how can i build a new technology but how can i win the battle against the incumbent that gets pretty dangerous and i have seen everyone has seen uh some arguments that have been put forth in the crypto world against the us dollar and against fiat currencies that i think are absurd and just so easily falsifiable and that's that's not to say that they're all wrong or that they're that's not to say that the dollar is the the most greatest in the world it's not that at all but when you are at war with something it is easy to exaggerate your opponent's faults and view your opponent as something that it's not i mean i'll give you a perfect example of this that many people know i don't mind calling this person out because they did publicly but um jack dorsey this is two or three months ago tweeted and i'm paraphrasing this might not be verbatin but he said when did the u.s dollar lose its reserve currency status that was the tweet and i i followed up by saying do you realize the us dollar relative to other reserve currencies is the strongest today than it has been in 45 years like are you talking about it losing it's it's stronger today and it's been in almost half a century today right and so that's when i'm like i just don't understand but i also go back and and i look and say like look if you are a bitcoin um you know a big big proponent of bitcoin we call them we often call them morgan bitcoin maximalists maximus okay thank you i've heard that phrase thank you thank you for reminding me if you are a bitcoin maximalist you might view yourself at war with the dollar and therefore i think you can have these views about what the dollar is or isn't that in my perspective from an outsider seemed completely detached from reality now other people if jack was on here i'm sure he would disagree with me and he would put forth an argument that i would probably agree with at least part of so this is not black and white but i think it does get dangerous when you are at battle with something because it it it turns it from like a technology and like let's just focus on like how we can get ahead to it it turns into how can we pull the other side down i just think that's a it's inevitable like i said that's been going on for hundreds of years it's to me one of the most fascinating parts and that to me is why i think so many investors in new industries end up losing their shirts because it it's not about investments and getting ahead it's how can i win this battle against this other this crusade against the other side i think uh there's an important lesson there for for crypto listeners uh not to make their bags right their investments a religion uh and this is very important and i do think that you're probably responding to some of this kind of almost religious level of zeal that you're seeing that is just kind of non-rational from uh from some in the crypto communities getting too attached to the assets such that they're they're making um like falsifiable claims about it uh too early and i think you're definitely responding to that one another let me tell you on that point though what's so hard is that in any new industry when you are fighting an incumbent you need religious zeal together sure you if bill gates was just a software like passive like oh it might be it might be kind of a thing it never would have taken off you needed a zealot like bill gates to be like screw you pound the table computer on every desktop in the world it's going to happen all the naysayers get out of my way you're morons you need that religious zeal to get ahead and so that's what's so hard about this is that it's easy to push back against zealots in any industry but frankly with a new technology that's going to change the world you need them at the same time that's what's so hard about it i think we're going to talk a little in more detail about some of the other you know tribes that that i mention as we get to some of the lessons that you emphasize in your book that i want our bankless listeners to hear about you know talking about the get rich tribe and you know everyone trying to trade this asset class but one other tribe i i i'd like you to sort of address at the outset so as i was saying like a whole bunch like there is a group in crypto who has just come to the conclusion that we shouldn't even think about price at all we shouldn't even talk about price it just makes people greedy uh you know turns them into scam artists price pumpers you know shilling that sort of uh thing and they almost get like this unhealthy relationship with money and i'm wondering if you've seen that in in your studies of markets and psychology kind of this this notion that it's bad to talk about wealth it's bad to talk about money money is the root of all evil that kind of a sentiment um what are your thoughts on that i feel i i i feel like that's kind of the the argument that we'll put forth after you've lost a lot of money say oh well price does it does it doesn't matter that sounds like no one's saying on the way up they say that on the way down yeah and look i think i think maybe the the distinction there is are you doing this for the technology and the products or are you doing this to get rich but it's not there's no shame in saying if you're an outside investor i mean if you are a coder working on these projects then you could say i'm like i'm doing that we're in this for the technology but all outside investors are doing this to earn more money that there's no there's no shame in that that's of course that's why i invest that's why other people invest so i think to say price doesn't matter again i think that's more or less a justification after prices have fallen fifty percent um but i i i do think like the unhealthy um drive for like constantly earning more money in a new industry like you've mentioned several times on this podcast something that's really smart which is that crypto is like a normal market in overdrive on hyperdrive and that's really true which also means like hyper volatility and if in the s p 500 normal volatility is going down 10 or 20 percent maybe in crypto normal volatility is down 50 to 80 and then if you have this unhealthy uh connection to like i'm investing in crypto to double my money every year or whatever it might be you need like that that's not realistic losing 80 of your money every couple of years is realistic that's that's what you need to get so it's the people who are attached to the constant profits that end up in trouble absolutely well maureen what what i want to do and throughout the rest of this episode i think is get real practical with people because uh you've identified some psychological uh tips tricks i i think maybe the best way to characterize these is as as lessons that people can learn um because your your temperament for investing can actually be improved if you kind of observe and and you listen to sort of the the advice of the ages and i want to try to go through at least 10 of these with you because i think they are highly relevant for crypto and while we're on the subject why don't we just start with with one of them and you have an entire book or excuse me you have an entire chapter chapter on the subject of volatility in crypto as as i think the chapter is entitled nothing's free something to this effect and you call volatility the price of admission and maybe this for bankless listeners is lesson number one from a psychology perspective uh nothing is free in crypto what do you mean by this it's just the idea like anything worth pursuing in life that has a benefit is has a price attached to it that's pretty obvious like like the the world is not so great that's going to give you great rewards and ask nothing in return okay let's start there with that to set it up so then the question is in investing what is the cost of admission you want great returns everyone knows you you can earn great returns in investment markets over time what is the cost of admission a lot of investors cannot really answer that or they will say something like the management fee that you pay to your stu to your to your advisor your broker that's not the cost to investing the cost of investing returns is putting up with and dealing with and enduring a never-ending chain of volatility and uncertainty and setback and disappointment and crash that that's the cost of admission and this is so important because most investors when their portfolio goes down 20 30 percent they view it as a fine and a fine means you did something wrong a fine is like a speeding ticket you're in trouble shame on you don't do it again that's what a fine is the better way to view it though is a fee it's a cost of admission it's you're like look i i need to put up with my portfolio declining 20 once a year or something like that in order to do very well over the long term that's that's what the world is asking me to give up in order to get something on the other side everyone in the other parts of the world under in other areas of the world understand that good things have a cost attached to them you want a nice vacation that costs money you want a good relationship with a spouse like some relationships end in tears that's the cost of admission to finding a great relationship everyone understands the cost in other areas but in investing it tends to go out the window and we view the cost of admission as a fine there's never been a bear market where stocks fell 20 where the huge majority of people viewed it as either politicians or their advisor or themselves screwing up it's always the case everyone views it as like who should i blame here i always view it as just the normal path of growth over time and if you have that subtle shift in mindset i think dealing with these declines like we've seen with stocks over the last year with crypto over the last year and a half or whatever is like rather than viewing it as somebody screwed up where i screwed up just feels like this is the normal path of growth over time and if you have that mindshift set shift it makes these declines just a little bit more palatable to deal with rather than saying like how can i screw up and how can i avoid this in the future that's that's the dangerous takeaway rather than having that you can just say like look i don't enjoy this it's not fun but i know that this is what i need to be willing to give up to do well over the next 10 or 20 years and i think that's that's a pretty it's so simple what i just said but i think it's actually a pretty rare mindset most people view it as a mistake and a fine i think it is a rare mindset and i really want uh listeners to hear that so the cost of admission is volatility that is the price of admission and so in crypto you don't get the you know 10x 20x 30x gain and then get scot-free it never goes down from there you also have to suffer the 90 95 99 loss in some cases and plan your portfolio accordingly i'll just give you sort of an example of this morgan so uh ether the price of ether as an asset in 2016 2017 we're talking about 10 or so right uh folks rode ether all the way up to 1400 dollars in uh february of of 2018 that was the high okay and so what is that in in terms of a gay yeah gained right i mean we're talking like a lot a lot right it's it's what's known as a shitload of money a shitload of money and like so but after that after we topped in uh 2018 what we then suffered over successive months was a 95 drop in the in ether asset price and other other crypto assets um saw this too bitcoin etc but 95 so rode that thing down back to double digits from 1400 highs all the way down to 80. okay a lot of uh investors in ether as an asset felt the pain during that time and that was the price of admission now of course prices have recovered since we're talking about a price of ether of fifteen hundred dollars it's gotten as as as high as 4 500. my i think the point you're making uh morgan is that a lot of investors they sign up for the upside and they forget about the price of holding and the price is legitimate psychological pain go feel uh a 95 drawdown in your asset feel feel what that's like right especially if maybe you've over extended yourself to bad ways like the way your friends look at you oh i'm such an idiot and in the depths of a bear market you think you're going to ride this thing down to zero too i'm so dumb what if why didn't i sell everyone was telling me i should have sold and i didn't it's it's like it almost gets physically painful that level of psychological pain and that's what you're talking about that is the cost of admission totally i mean there's this great quote that i love from schmath where he said however fast an asset can rise that's the half-life of how quickly it can be destroyed and the takeaway from that to me is like if you want an asset that has the potential of going up tenfold in one year you need to like don't do not be shocked when it loses 80 of its value in a year too those things go hand in hand with each other one other example from this because my world is more focused on on stocks but netflix stock from 2002 to 2018 rose uh 600 fold from 2002 to 28 600 times your money like ridiculous return everyone's dream but during that period during that period of ridiculous success it lost 70 percent of its value three times it lost half of its value on seven separate occasions and that's during this cherry-picked period of insane growth at every one of those major declines all the like every virtually every investor i should say second guess what they were doing virtually and that's why the number of investors who will hold a stock like netflix during that period rounds to zero it's not actually zero but it's damn close to it it's not intuitive to think that on your way to earning 600 times your money you're going to lose 70 of it three different times that's not intuitive at all but when you see it happen in netflix and in crypto you realize like that's the that's the the wisdom behind what shema said it's like however fast it's going to grow that's the half-life for how quickly it can turn around and spin back on you and this is also why i like look if you're investing in treasury bonds or bank accounts there's virtually no volatility in that that's that's the other side of this so much of these things like just follow the very simple rules of finance like you want bigger returns you get more volatility clear as day it's always been like that it always will be like that and but likes you hinted too it's so easy to either be ignorant of that on the way up or just be dismissive of that on the way up and during a bull market everybody thinks that they have a high risk tolerance everyone thinks like oh if the market fell 50 i would view that as an opportunity to buy more and some people actually will they actually have that but it's so difficult to contextualize what it's going to feel like what it's going to do to your personality what it's going to do to your social aspirations and it's not just that you're going to feel bad but your spouse is going to look at you differently your friends will look at you differently it really it really has a major like like you said physical impact on people this is not just psychological like a physical impact of what it will do to you and it's it's i think it's impossible to understand that until you've lived through it is really what it gets to so in a new asset class that's drawn in a lot of new investors a lot of a big portion of those investors do not understand what it's like to lose 90 of your money now the investors in eth and from 2018 on they do they were there but there's a lot of new investors both in stocks like the robin hood era of 2021 and in crypto over the last couple years who for whom this is their first rodeo uh it's like it's it's like that meme of like the guy on the gallows and he says first time it's just like that that's exactly what it is and i think we've seen that in the last six months both in stocks and in crypto of people who are here for their first time and they say oh this is not what i expected but there's part of me that's like it's for the young investors who are doing this and crypto investors tend to be younger the robin hood investors tend to be younger there's part of me that's like good good for you for learning about risk when you are young absolutely versus versus 44 and trying to put your kids through college like learn about the downside risk when you're 19. this is the time to do it well i i guess i guess on that before we leave this lesson because i i think this is uh so valuable so so what do we do with this recognizing that you know this pain is the price of admission what do we do with this do we become sadistic and just like i like the pain yeah 95 down like let's give it some more or is there some way to become zen about um this level of volatility um like what's what's your advice on how to not feel this and you know we made that we made this uh assertion earlier that this can manifest as almost like almost like physical pain like i feel sick i need to get out of the office i need to go for a run but at some level um it's not the same as physical pain right as long as you're you have not put in more than you can afford to lose which of course is like the investing adage hopefully you're still going to have a bed a place to sleep you're going to have your your basic you know western needs met you're going to have three meals a day that sort of thing like it's not actual pain it's just isn't it just numbers on a screen so how do we adapt to this high volatility environment i think there are there's a small percentage of investors who really do have iron stomachs and they can lose 70 of their net worth and be totally fine fine with it but it's a small percentage bill miller the famous investor i think he's one of them like he his net worth can fall 80 and i think he legitimately doesn't give a he does not but that's this very small percentage as it should be it shouldn't be difficult the majority of people do not have that mentality and if you don't like be honest with yourself and it's fine by the way i don't have that mentality if i lost 80 of my net worth i would i would feel bad i would not like it at all i would not want to deal with it so i just accept that and my asset allocation is more conservative than someone like bill miller's might be and that's fine like by the way he's gonna do much better than me over a long period of time i'm okay with that as well i have no fomo about chasing something like that i think you think it's so important to be introspective about who you are as an investor and like i said earlier you cannot know who you are until you've experienced a calamity and a lot of crypto investors have or they're experiencing it right now the important thing is to understand that however you feel during a calamity is almost certainly how you're going to feel the next time all the evidence we have in behavioral finance is like people do not learn from their mistakes that the same emotions that cause you to be stressed or to panic or to sell during the last meltdown will come roaring right back during the next one and therefore you should just accept who you are if you if you were not sleeping well at night and if you did panic sell not everyone did but if you did just accept that that's who you are and have a more conservative asset allocation it's fine it's totally fine there's nothing to be ashamed of and you will do much better over time if you're honest about who you are rather than chasing somebody who you think you want to be and like i said it's always going to be the case that people like bill miller are like are the there's that's like one percent of investors maybe maybe it's like one tenth of one percent who can actually pull that off most people want to think that they can do that during the bull market but they can't like everyone thinks they're that they are the next warren buffett during the bull market and then everything goes out and you realize like it's way easier to quote buffett than it is to be yes yes to choose wisely pick a lane i think is some of morgan's

what they choose to invest in in in how they view money and this is kind of the the byline is that your personal experience with money maybe makes up point zero zero zero zero zero one percent of what's happened in the world but maybe eighty percent of how you think the world works and it's interesting you talk about these different generations how they sort of approach um different investment classes for example like difference between you know great depression um generation would never would be very wary of stocks they might even be wary of putting their money in the in the bank and so you know great grandpa with a wad of cash under his mattress sort of idea and that's very different than the boomer generation for example who who grew up at a time invested a time when stock was booming can you tell us about this no one's crazy lesson i think there's two sides of it one is that like you just mentioned we are all prisoners to our own past particularly the dumb luck of where and when we were born and our view of the world is so heavily influenced by that dumb luck of where and when we were born and if you and i were born in africa in the 1700s we would not have the same views about the world today that you and i do right now it's just this is the dumb luck of where we ended up in life that shapes our view of the world the other side of that is how ignorant we can be to other views of the world and other people who might disagree with how we are investing or how what we're doing with our money if we were in their shoes it would make a hell of a lot more sense i came up i this was like shoved in my face a couple years ago when i saw this this stat that um 75 of lottery tickets in america are bought by the poorest decile of americans the poorest americans who can like barely feed themselves literally are buying the overall majority of scratcher tickets from gas stations it is so easy for someone like me or you or most people listening to this to hear that stat and say those people are crazy they're nuts they're out of their mind they can't feed their children and they're buying lottery tickets the hell are they thinking i had i had this friend who was uh he's now a very successful financial advisor but he grew up in abject poverty he was homeless as a child and he told me the story one day that he remembers being a child when his refrigerator was empty and his mom had three dollars in the bank and he said look three dollars is not going to fill the refrigerator it's not gonna make a dent but three dollars will buy you three lottery tickets that has the potential to fill the refrigerator and he said until you understand that math you know you don't understand like where these people are coming from that the poorest decile people some of it may just be their maniacs and they don't understand it but i think a lot of it is purchasing a lot of ticket when you are in that much financial destitution is your only ticket so to speak to getting to the other side it's the only thing in life that's going to give you a little bit of hope to about getting to the other side that people like you and i might view like oh we need to foster our career opportunities if we want more money if you're in if you feel like you're trapped in that level of society then the lottery ticket feels like your only way out and then so it's this one thing it's like from my initial knee-jerk reaction was you people are maniacs and after i heard his explanation i was like oh i kind of get it i kind of get why you would do this i think that's a really important thing that most of the time most financial debates and arguments and disagreements are not actually people disagreeing with each other it's people with different circumstances different risk tolerances and different time horizons talking over one another and they just don't understand where the other person is coming from and that's the huge majority of financial debates in the stock market and in crypto it's not even that people disagree with each other because i guarantee you that if you take two people that fiercely disagree about crypto if you were to get those two people in the room and have them talk about algebra or chemistry or meteorology they would agree on everything but in crypto they have different time horizons different risk tolerances different views of the world from their own upbringings and they're not actually arguing with each other they're talking over each other like these are reasonable people who would agree with each other in every area of life otherwise than where they have a different risk tolerance and time horizon so that's really important and to me the takeaway from that the practical takeaway is is twofold one it's like be less judgmental about people who who manage their money different than them like i said earlier i don't own any crypto i'm not against it but i don't own any and the number of people who look down upon me for that i don't it doesn't bother me but i think it's fascinating that someone would say if you're not investing your money like i am you don't know what you're doing and i think that's it it's based on this view that everyone has the same risk tolerances the same social aspirations the same career aspirations the same same family situations of course we don't everyone is completely different so of course we manage our money differently the other side is like you need to be more introspective about yourself and what you want and what your goals and aspirations are rather than chasing everyone else's dreams or assuming that there is quote-unquote one right financial way to invest your money when actually there's a dozen ways to skin a cat and a million ways to invest your money appropriately just depending on what works for you yeah well said and there's so many ways to apply this to crypto maybe on the less less judgmental um piece of it i mean you mentioned uh lottery players and i think some some old school crypto veterans get frustrated every cycle when a whole bunch of new entrants come to the space and they bet on dog coins for example just dumb meme um assets that are clearly not based on anything clearly have no fundamentals behind it but i think they're really viewing the crypto asset purchase as a as a lotto ticket and maybe the ogs and the veterans shouldn't be so judgmental about that at least they're kind of in the industry and starting to learn but like recognize that um they're coming from a completely different perspective and i also think there's a lesson for us as you know every generation of crypto investor has entered at a different time you know like eric voorhees we've had him on the podcast he bought his first bitcoin at three dollars of course he doesn't care if bitcoin drops from thirty thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars why would we expect a zillion dollars he is not stakes are low he's not phased at all by a 10k drop okay and that's very different if you maybe bought your first bitcoin at fifty thousand dollars so bringing these perspectives to bear i think is very important but let's go to uh maybe the third lesson which is uh another chapter in your book it's never as good or as bad as it seems and to me this was a chapter about luck and about risk and trying to understand the difference between the two what lesson were you communicating in this uh in this chapter what's interesting to me is that um investors are very aware and keen and focused on the concept of risk and we have risk adjusted returns and we hire risk managers everything about investing is like risk risk resource risk we'd almost never talk about luck luck is almost like it feels rude to talk about if i said you got lucky i look like a jerk and if if i think i myself got lucky i don't want to admit that so luck is ignored but luck and risk are like the exact same things just in opposite directions the def my definition of risk is there are things in the world that can happen that have a bigger impact on outcomes than anything you can do intentionally that's what risk is and what is my definition of luck it's that there are things in the world that can happen that have a bigger impact on outcomes and anything you can do intentionally that's what luck is too that's the exact same thing just in other directions and i think it's it's it's a problem when we obsess over risk and we completely ignore luck and if i were to say hey ryan there are there are 10 million investors in the world with your understanding of statistics would you expect let's say five of them to become billionaires based off of luck alone you say of course yes just statistically it's inevitable but then if i said okay name those investors like tell me their names most people would be like i don't want to get that makes me look like a jerk i don't want to get into that or or the billionaire investors i know i really admire their thought process and whatnot so even if you know luck is a is a is a plays a role here you just people just don't want to think about it and what that's why that's a problem is because i think we look up to and aspire to a lot of investors and try to emulate what they've done and i can look up to and aspire to warren buffett and what he's done and i can try to emulate his his time horizon i can try to emulate his thought process to emulate his wisdom learn from those things i cannot and nobody can emulate his luck i cannot replicate bill gates luck i can't replicate elon musk luck nobody can and therefore i think a lot of people like chase these false things in life they're chasing something that they have absolutely no potential of of getting and i use the example in the book just one kind of throwaway example that bill gates went to the only high school in america that had a computer just like ridiculous stroke of luck one in a million odds that he would end up in the school that he did and by his own telling he's the one who said this in a speech if he did not go to that specific high school lakeside school outside of seattle there would be no microsoft like is bill gates smart and hardworking and a visionary genius yes 100 full stop but did he have this ridiculous stroke of luck that underwrote all of that yes totally and everyone who was looking up to bill gates or musk or whoever it might be can't emulate those kind of things and so it's so important when you were looking at your role models in business and investing in other areas of life that you are looking up to them for things that you actually have a fighting chance of emulating yourself and so often we do not do that and that's why people that's why again there's one warren buffett and it's easier to quote him than it is to actually do what he's done it's such a good point there's kind of this uh survivorship bias i i think at work and one example in in crypto is um probably if we had done this episode um six months ago with you there would have been a top ten crypto trader and fund on the list uh called three errors capital uh yes uh suzu kyle davies um these individuals were treated like crypto gods basically traders that everyone wanted to emulate or investors that everyone wanted to emulate and you know a few months ago they went from being billionaires literally to zero the entire fund blew up and so we see now we see some of the strategies that they were using you know uh you're trading on margin doing all of these irresponsible things and their success was very short-lived because it wasn't based on any kind of long-term fundamentals and yet the crypto industry i think a lot in the crypto twitter community put these people on a pedestal so much so that other crypto lending banks were you know willing to give 600 million dollars of unsecured loans to three era's capital uh based on reputation alone so we have to be very careful who we put on on these pedestals and i think the same token what you're saying is uh not measure ourselves against maybe what is actually just lucky survivorship bias we can't be too hard on ourselves either it's just i think another takeaway is just like everyone that you look up to as a god is actually a human and like i don't believe in gurus i think there are i think there are some people who are smart and talented and have taken big risks that paid off but everyone is human everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time in the morning i heard this thing this was like 10 years ago so some of this might feel a little outdated but um it was it was uh this quote that maybe this was 20 12 13 something like that and they said last year the three most admired men in sports were lance armstrong oscar pistorius and tiger woods wow and all three of those guys came crumbling downtown back but but lance armstrong you know did have his thing with doping oscar for stories i think he was that he was charged with murder is that right i don't want to i don't want to miss and tiger woods had his his career collapsed even though he's come back a little bit but that's just like that's just like a be careful who you admire and what you admire them for and also realize that everybody even the mount rushmore people who you put on a pedestal are humans as much as you are okay let's go to number four and i i love this just two words have enough have enough i i came up with with that idea and i know you can't see it but this this poster behind me on my shoulder right there yeah is is is a story that i'm about to tell and it's told in the new yorker several uh several decades ago it was many decades ago um two famous authors kurt vonnegut and joseph heller were having lunch at the house of a famous hedge fund manager in the hamptons and kurt vonnegut turned to joseph heller and he said joseph do you know that the hedge fund manager who owns this house makes more money per month than you have earned in your entire lifetime and joseph heller said that might be true but i have something that the hedge fund manager will never have and that is enough money i loved i love that that's why it's framed on my wall behind me i think it's such an like that word enough is probably the most important word that exists in all of personal finance and having enough money does not mean you have no aspirations for more that's not what it means it doesn't say like quit today and you never want another another penny that's not what enough means because i want more money everyone should i'm not saying be like a monk here but having enough to me just means that your expectations do not grow faster than your income that i want my income and my net worth to grow but i want to make sure that my expectations remain below those with the idea that happiness and any kind of value that you get from something is the gap between your expectations and your income it's the most basic thing in the world i'm not coming up with those concepts people have been saying that forever but it's so hard to do in practice and i'll tell you like another extreme example of this that i found so so fascinating was that if you go back to the 1980s before bernie madoff started his ponzi scheme before the ponzi scheme began bernie madoff was earning by some accounts 30 million dollars a year from the legitimate side of his business not not his fraud not his ponzi scheme his real actual legitimate business as a market maker on wall street he was earning 30 million incredible honest to god he was one of the most successful businessmen in the country before the ponzi scheme and what is so amazing to me is that despite that success he uh he wanted more money so badly that he was willing to start the scheme that destroyed everything destroyed him destroyed everyone around him and it's like if you if you are broke and you have a starving child and you rob a grocery store you could wrap your head around that that makes sense i understand that kind of crime but when you are one of the most successful businessmen in the world and you want more money so badly that you start this fraud that ruins everything around you that is like that's so fascinating to me and of course he is a madoff was a a sociopath he's like he's the extreme example but i think everyone has a little bit of that in us that if we are lucky enough to have rising income rising net worth but our expectations for more rise by more than our our income and net worth it's never going to feel like enough and the practical example of this for people is not is not a ponzi scheme that's going to ruin everything the practical example are people who have no sense of enough who take more risk more risk more risks more risk and then it blows up in their face and these are people who could have had all the money that they could ever need to be happy but they just kept on taking more risk until it blew up in their face maybe three three arrows is a perfect example of that of like they could have they could they could just be on their yachts enjoying life right now but they took more risk morris morris until it exploded in their face and so that story happens all the time to good well-meaning people where they don't have any concept of enough and they learn what is enough in hindsight when it's too late this is the reason as we said earlier why people in crypto can't be satisfied with the 5x when they see someone else with with the 10x it's it's kind of this fomo but if you listen to what morgan is telling us and you adopt this mindset of of having enough you're not why are you playing for the top scorer right like get your score get get a decent score be be happy with that have enough uh super important i i think this relates to maybe the next uh lesson uh which i think we're at number five here morgan so we're getting halfway halfway through the the lessons um freedom find out why you're here my um my co-host david often likes to say crypto isn't here to make you rich it's here to make you free and i think we're talking about wealth from that perspective freedom being in wealth and and also having uh greater autonomy and control over your actual money taking custody of it uh via private keys that's kind of a crypto ethos but can you talk about freedom because i think people who make the last mistake who don't have enough are playing a different game and maybe it's a game they shouldn't be playing maybe they're they're playing a game for status or approval or who has the biggest yacht in in singapore hello three hours capital and and really the game they should be playing is freedom can you talk about that i mean i think i got that from charlie munger who had this quote many years ago where he said though he is a multi-billionaire he he is filthy rich but he said i never intended to be rich i just wanted to be independent he just wanted to wake up every day and just do whatever the hell he wanted to do and what he loved doing what he was good at was investing and that's how he became a multi-billionaire but just i think that idea can apply to virtually everything and i think that is really a core of what makes most people happy it's not necessarily the nice things the nice cars nice homes i like those too it's it's just can you wake up every morning and do it on your own terms the counter to this that is really fascinating to me are the ceos who might make 20 million dollars a year 30 million dollars a year but they have no control over their time every second of their day is dictated by someone else's needs somebody else's demands and they and that itself is like its own unique form of poverty they are like cash rich and time broke and that to me is like that's that's not happy at all i would rather be time rich and cash broke than the alternative i mean i ideally i'd rather be somewhere in between but give me the choice of one of the two i would want control over my time and a moderate amount of money then a ton of money and no control over my time every every day of the week that's what i would choose and so rather than just like wanting money for more things i want independence i just want to wake up every day and say i can do whatever i want now how you get that and this is what throws people off is i want to build up wealth not not money to spend on a new house or a new car i just want assets sitting around in the bank because that's what gives me independence and autonomy or not the bank but my brokerage account investments that i might never spend so then people ask like what the hell is the purpose of money if you're not going to spend it and they say that in like a gotcha way they think it's like such an obvious question and i'm like oh there's a very real thing that unspent money does and investments do which gives you freedom and independence it just makes it so that you can during the next recession during the next bear market or if like you want to quit your job or when you want to retire it's all up to you you're not reliant on the kindness of strangers and other people's goals and aspirations to dictate how you're going to live your life it's just the freedom and control to do whatever you want that to me is like the biggest benefit that money and wealth can provide you this is part of getting into a healthy mindset and i said earlier that a lot of people in crypto have kind of a toxic uh unhealthy relationship with money but the healthier mindset is as naval ravicon talks about using money as a tool using it as a tool to gain your freedom you actually talk i think in your chapter about like just some basic stages of of wealth freedom here right so like maybe you go from um paycheck to paycheck to the ability to pay a month's expense for example well you've just earned a little bit more of your freedom you're no longer a little bit of freedom yeah a little bit of freedom you're no longer a paycheck slave right and then maybe you you eliminate your credit card debt and you sort of get out of that level of slavery and then maybe you graduate to a point where you have six months of savings so you have the ability next time your boss tells you to um like stop spending time with your family and get on a plane go on a business trip you have the ability to say no why because you don't need that job because you have six months of question and the ability in the u.s anyway to withstand a health emergency what kind of freedom does that buy you and ultimately there's there's another stage of things where you could get to the point of of uh wealth where you have kind of the fu money which is basically like um you get to do whatever you want to do you wake up in the morning and you pursue kind of your life goal and your ambition to me this is the purpose of wealth if you're approaching it in a healthy way and not as kind of a a virtue signal competing for for high schooler way yeah and i think the important part you just hinted to this is that uh fu money exists on a spectrum and before you get to fu money there is like no thank you money and then there's like and then there's like there's like absolutely not money and there's like get out of my face money before you get to fu it's all a spectrum and every bit of dollar like every dollar that you save is just a little bit of your future that you own and the reverse is true every dollar of debt that you have is a piece of your future that somebody else has a claim to and so just think about in those simple terms i'm just like i want to be independent that's all i want and look i have material aspirations too of course but my main goal by far with every dollar that i earn and and save is just independence and autonomy okay here's the next lesson this is a vitally important one um everyone who's listening to this their monkey brain my monkey brain your monkey brain morgan sucks at compounding we do not understand exponentials we don't think in exponential logic and therefore we don't understand the core principle behind investing and the math mechanics behind it which is compounding interest can you talk about that a little bit it's just the idea that like if i were to ask you ryan if i said what is 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus eight you can figure that out in three seconds like that's simple but if i said what is eight times eight times eight times eight times eight even if you are mathematically inclined you're gonna be like ah this is that's a tough one i'm gonna need to think about this for a second we are not wired to think about exponential growth at all and even if you are a very smart person in finance you understand the math you understand the formulas it is so easy to underestimate the power of compounding the example i use in the book is that warren buffett's net worth he's worth 100 billion dollars 99 of that was accumulated after his 60th birthday 99 of that came after his 60th birthday and this is so important because that's the key to his success is he a good investor yes but the whole key is that he's been a good investor for 80 years that's what makes all the difference in the world and everyone in the industry including myself go through all this detail trying to answer the question how is he so successful and we look at how he picks stocks and how he thinks about business models and moats and market cycles all that's like really important but 99 of the answer to the question how did he do it is longevity and endurance that's it it's just that's how compounding works just the longer you stick around the crazier the numbers get and there's all these scenarios where you can think of where it's like if buffett had retired in his 60s like a normal person might you would have never heard of him never would have become a household name never would have accumulated literally one percent of what he has it's all just the amount of time he's been doing it for and that is so counterintuitive and it's also so boring to say like oh buff it's just been he's successful because he's been doing this right here it's like end of story it's so boring to think about that it's more intellectually stimulating to go through the details of how he did it even if the big major takeaway that by the way someone like me and you might be actually able to emulate back to like what we can learn from our from our heroes is just the endurance of how of how compounding has worked and so i i think that's never going to be intuitive just because our brains are not wired to handle those kind of absurdities but that's how like it's so easy to underestimate how big a company can get like if you had said 15 years ago that google would be a trillion dollar company like you just everyone would have been left out of the room even if the math behind it was actually pretty simple it's just easy to underestimate how big the numbers can get if something can compound at 20 a year for a decade even if you're a smart person it's just that you're always going to underestimate what that final number is so compounding is the most important force in investing and it's the easiest to underestimate so morgan how how old is buffett now he's in his like early 90s he's 92 he's 92. yeah okay so um 13 years ago he would have been like just about his 80th birthday right 13 years ago the birth of the crypto industry like warren buffett was about 80 years old and yeah i i don't think that because the industry is so young i don't think that most are entering crypto with a buffett-like mindset to this asset class it's only been around for 13 years but i think that most people who do enter should approach crypto as i want to be a warren buffett of crypto buy and hold long-term investing strategies this is the way to do well and it's about time in the market beating timing the market i think that's a buffett quote as well it's funny that we bring up buffett because i know he he famously hates crypto um but um i i think munger and buffett's um principles apply very well to the space with a long-term orientation let's go to the next one which is uh the difference between getting wealthy versus staying wealthy what is the difference morgan they're almost completely opposite skills which is what throws a lot of people off because getting rich getting wealthy requires being an optimist swinging for the fences taking a risk that's what you need to get rich staying rich is almost the exact opposite you need a degree of like conservatism and paranoia about what's going on in the world like low risk tolerance that's what you need to stay rich and so they're conflicting skills and the people who have done very well over time and generated a lot of wealth over time learn how to get those skills to coexist with each other there are a lot of people who are good at getting rich and some people who are good at staying rich having both of those at the same time which is ideally what everybody wants is that that's a much harder combination so i think having this barbell personality of like like one of the way i phrased it is saving your money like a pessimist and investing your money like an optimist that's that's the barbell mentality that you need to have of like i am i am a scaredy cat of the short run and i know the short run is always going to be a constant chain of setback and disappointment and surprise and bear market and pandemic and recession but if i can survive all of that and endure it financially if i can stick around long enough i'm a huge optimist about the next 20 30 40 50 years just because i think that most most people wake up in the morning trying to solve problems versus wake up in the morning trying to pull us all down so i'm like massively optimistic about the long run and i invest my money accordingly and i'm pretty pessimistic or just i have a big question mark about the short run and i save my money accordingly getting those two things to coexist i think is is difficult for some people but you need it to do well over time uh morgan can you tell us the story of um the the third partner of uh warren buffett's and charlie munger i think his name is rick and uh yeah what happened to rick because people don't talk about him so if you go back to like the 1960s the famous investing duo of warren buffett and charlie munger there was a third partner his name was rick gurin and if you go back to this era like the three of them invested together and they interviewed ceos together they were like a trio of great investors during this period and then rick gurin more or less fell off the map uh if you're a hardcore value investor like you you probably know who he is but warren and charlie became household names and rick goering kind of disappeared now about a decade ago uh a hedge fund manager named monash pobrey was having lunch with warren buffett and moses bryant asked buffett he said hey what happened to rick gurin and buffett told him the story of what happened to him which is back in the 1970s rick goran had invested pretty heavily on margin to buy more berkshire hathaway stock he was so bullish about it he went out and borrowed a bunch of money and during the bear market of the 1970s he got flushed out he got a margin called he lost everything and i i'm pretty sure he had to sell his berkshire stock back to warren that was like how he closed out his margin debt might be getting some of those details wrong but i'm pretty sure that's right and buffett's point was um that he told prabrai he said he said charlie and i always knew that we would be rich we were so we were not in a hurry we knew it was inevitable that we were going to get wealthy so we were not in a hurry and he said rick gurin was just as smart as them just as intelligent as warren and charlie were but he was in a hurry he wanted to get rich quick so he took this margin debt to speed up the process and and and it ended up with him being kind of getting flushed out of the system now i'm pretty sure rick gurin had a bit of a revival and he became a successful fund manager after that but nowhere near the success of warren and charlie and that was always really fascinating to me if like warren and like warren and charlie got rich because they were not in a hurry and that's like specifically how their success was built and the people who were in a hurry got flushed out and that story of course repeats itself time and time again warren has this this uh saying that i think is really funny about investing on margin he says if you're smart you don't need it and if you're stupid you shouldn't be using it this is like no one's just like no one should use margin under any circumstances full stop i think that's more or less right i i think uh that this applies uh exactly the same except maybe again once again on steroids and cryptos the game of uh crypto investing is survival you have to survive and that does require like doubt like why are you using margin um not investing more than you can afford to use also like there's some you know psych psychological tricks i think that people can use like just lock your crypto in a ledger don't check prices and uh go look at it ten years from now you know it's that kind of thing but this goes maybe this is a segue into uh lesson eight that you have which is the idea that being reasonable is better than being rational with your investing and with your money and i think the the approach i was just talking about was just don't check prices lock your crypto in a ledger throw away the key and then come back 10 years later that's not necessarily the most rational investment strategy but maybe for some people it's the most reasonable investment strategy because they know if price 10x is they'll sell and that might be selling too low they know if they lose 90 they'll sell and that's obviously selling on a crash not the time you want to sell talk about reasonable rather than rational what does that mean it's just this idea that people are not on emotional machines and people do not make financial decisions on a spreadsheet or on the chalkboard they make them at the dinner table where all these emotions and flaws and hormones and messy family situations come into play and therefore we should not expect ourselves or other people to constantly be making quote-unquote rational financial decisions if we can just be reasonable with what we do even if there are things that we do with our money that are flawed if we're being reasonable about it that's the best that any of us can do and there are things that i do with my money that i cannot explain on a spreadsheet and if you said like explain to me why you do this weird thing with your money like wouldn't you earn higher returns if you did x y and z i would say yes but i'm not a i'm not a fully rational people i'm i'm an emotional person and doing this reasonable thing helps me sleep better at night than if i was quote unquote rational and so this is where i think i think if there's any disservice that academic finance has brought to the world it's the assumption that people are rational and they're or or the guide that they should aim to do rational things i just think it's unrealistic if you just be reasonable that's that's the best we can do i use the example in in the book of like having a fever when you're sick is a very rational thing because a fever helps fight illness it helps fight the virus fight the bacteria fever is good fever is rational but everybody including doctors fight fevers like they're a nuisance and if you get a fever it's like oh take tylenol to get rid of it make your fever go away and the reason that they they want it to go away even if it's rational is because fevers hurt they suck they're miserable no one likes having a fever so even if having a fever is rational it's not reasonable to want to be uncomfortable so we treat them we're just like get rid of them it's the same thing in finance there are the equivalent of fevers in finance where it's like hey that's a rational thing to do but it hurts and i don't like it so let's get rid of it and so the example that i used was uh and i use this in the book of my wife and i paid off our mortgage when we had a three percent mortgage rate that is not rational to do it's it's it is honestly the dumbest it's the worst financial decision that we've ever made but it is the best money decision that we've ever made nothing has given us more peace of mind more comfort more sleeping at night more like stability for our children than the quote unquote worst financial decision we've ever made and so that's why even if it's not rational i think it was completely reasonable and made us it and increased our quality of life and everyone has something like that or it's just like don't aim to be rational just be pretty reasonable with the things that you do that's the best we can do i think crypto people really need to hear that um you know one example is morgan i've read 15 page reports academic reports on the the value of lump sum investing versus dollar cost averaging in and like different arguments on both sides but the conclusion of this particular report was lump sum investing has the highest ev expected value and so you should do lump sum investing and uh that just over complicates things doesn't it so say you have two thousand dollars that that you want to deploy what's going to make more sense for you psychologically just putting it all in now and forgetting about it or dollar cost averaging in 100 a month for the next 18 months or so which whichever works for you do that thing and then just forget about it like stop trying to like uh rationalize it make it all make sense on a spreadsheet because to your point people are not spreadsheets and then the point of like yeah like that academic study might be right to say it has a higher ev to do a lump sum investing but people do not invest based off of expected value right they invest they they expect boss based off of like what they're going to regret in the future it's it's based off of like if i make this decision am i going to regret it in such regret minimization that's exactly it and if people if someone lump summed uh their windfall and the market went down 30 percent even if it had a higher ev to begin with they're probably going to regret doing that and they're going to feel like an idiot and they're gonna say i'm never doing this again i don't trust my advisor again et cetera et cetera so that's why it's like even if even if even if lump sum is a higher ev like dollar cost averaging probably makes more sense from a psychological perspective number nine uh is one i felt like i needed to apply to my personal life and that is this concept of people change you bankless listener will change your goals for the future your strategies the things you're saving for the things you you want to buy um all of that will change and change is okay i think that's what you're telling us in your book uh so morgan people change what can we learn from this there's this concept in psychology called the end of history illusion which basically says everyone is keenly aware of how much they've changed in the past if you look at who you are today ryan versus when you were 14 you have different goals different outlooks you're wiser you're smarter you have different friends different values and you're keenly aware of that but if i were to say ryan imagine who you're going to be when you're 60 years old you probably think you're not going to change that much you think you'll have the same values the same goals the same priorities but you won't you're going to change just as much between now and 60 as you did between now and age 14 or whenever and it's so hard for people to understand that or to accept that i bet same for me like i think i'm gonna be the same person 20 years from now that i am today but i know it but i'm not i'm not there's no way i'm going to do and so people underestimate how much they're going to change and this has a big impact on their financial goals because particularly for like long-term goal setting if you're like oh over the next 20 years i want to achieve x y and z well 10 years from now you might be a totally different person with different goals and different outlook different experiences maybe you get divorced maybe you get married maybe you have kids maybe you have a medical emergency you have no clue who you're going to be 10 or 20 years from now so to take the takeaway from me was like avoid the extreme ends of financial planning either the like massive hypersaver or the yolo spend everything today like the more that you can avoid those ends the less likely you are going to regret what you did when you inevitably change in the future that's that's i think that the best that we can get in this area as i get older i'm seeing more and more value and kind of the moderate positions around things like that and i think a moderate position around kind of you know short-termism and long-termism is the right approach recognizing that you're going to change um last lesson for us morgan is a lesson on pessimism and i think this is uh particularly um salient to folks in crypto right now because the mainstream and the crypto industry of at large has once again turned pessimistic on crypto and you make this really astute observation in your book uh in the chapter about pessimism just like pessimism sounds smarter it sounds more realistic but then you also follow that up by saying like pessimism is actually even though it sounds smarter and more realistic it's often wrong more than it's right and so you're kind of like don't be pessimistic be long optimism talk about pessimism for a minute or at least at least getting your optimism and pessimism to coexist so to speak but the idea that that i brought up was like uh pessimism sounds smarter and it sounds like somebody trying to help you whereas optimism often sounds like a sales pitch if i were to say hey i i have a stock idea this thing's gonna double in the next six months this is like i'm pulling like i'm trying to sell you something which is probably true but if i were to say hey there's there's this threat chasing you down there's gonna be a recession in the next six months you're like oh tell me more about that it sounds like i'm trying to help you avoid this catastrophe and so that's like those incentives like all those come from evolution of like we are we are wired to respond with more urgency to threats than opportunities that's how you that's how you survive in terms of like how we've evolved to get here but the one of the one of the the quirks here is that there are no overnight miracles but there are lots of overnight tragedies so bad news tends to happen very fast and good news tends to be a slow compounding over time so like look at like the really bad news over the last 100 years it's like uh the crash of 1929 pearl harbor uh jfk's assassinated uh 911 covid all those things happened literally in the blink of an eye they were just instantaneous they did not exist one instance and then the next second they they just destroyed everything in their path so bad news happens very fast but the good news is almost inevitably it is always a slow grind over time so since the 1950s the united states mortality from heart disease has declined 90 percent since the 1950s 90 decline in heart disease mortality because we have blood pressure medications we're much better at treating heart attacks when they occur but it's so and that has saved literally tens of millions of lives just in the united states but we never think about it we never talk about it because that progression over time was basically two percent annual improvement for 70 years now if you compound 2 for 70 years the results are extraordinary save tens of millions of lives but in any given year it's two percent growth nobody cares doesn't make any headlines like if you like you're never going to see a headline on the front of the new york times it says heart disease mortality improves by another 1.8 percent nobody cares it's not exciting but over 70 years it's ridiculous it completely changes the world so the speed in which optimism and pessimism uh happen in the world just draws our attention to bad news even if the good news over time is way more powerful i think well said if you had gone back in time probably 10 years ago and told people in crypto hey you know 10 years from now this asset class is going to be worth over a trillion dollars their minds would have been blown away it would have been beyond the moon excited what a success this thing has been transformational beyond our wildest dreams and expectations and yet now we're looking at a 1 trillion market cap of crypto and we're mad about it because it fell from four trillion you know a few months ago and so now we're listening to the critics again who said there's nothing in this industry the asset class doesn't matter it's always been vapor it's always been pointless it's always been stupid and dumb and full of ponzi games and schemes this is what you're talking about here is these incremental uh gains and how they don't tend to be magnified what tends to be magnified is the pessimistic side always it's always been the case and it always will be the case that will never change morgan this has been incredible i think super insightful for uh those new to investing and investing in in in crypto on their journey i just want to uh thank you so much for for for joining us if you have anything to kind of sum all of this up maybe summing up your book summing up the psychology of money why this is important for investors to know what would you say to us in parting i think that the biggest thing is that doing well with money is not about what you know it's not about how smart you are it's all about how you behave and for a lot of people that's boring or it's not intuitive but i think in every successful financial outcome you will see that that it's not about intelligence it's just how you behaved over time bankless nation uh this has been morgan housel morgan thank you so much for joining us thank you this has been fun thanks for having me action items for you today of course read the book i've got it right here the psychology of money it's one of the best books on crypto investing i've read i'm serious about that i think every crypto investor should list you should i listen to it on audio as well should either listen to it on audible or something like that or read the book uh and of course gotta end with risks and disclaimers none of this has been financial advice maybe a little bit of life advice sprinkled in crypto is risky d5 is risky so is ethan bitcoin you could lose what you put in we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
