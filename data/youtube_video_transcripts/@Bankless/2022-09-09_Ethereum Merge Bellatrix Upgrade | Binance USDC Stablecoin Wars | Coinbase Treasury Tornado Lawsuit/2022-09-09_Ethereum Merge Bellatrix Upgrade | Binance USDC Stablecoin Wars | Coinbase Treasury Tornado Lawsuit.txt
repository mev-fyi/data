this is the last weekly roll up that will be under proof of work with ethereum bankless nation it is the second friday of merge timber what time is david uh ryan it's the friday bank list weekly roll up where we covered the entire weekly news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor especially this week because it's merge week ryan this is the last weekly roll up that will be under proof of work with ethereum i know that blows my mind the very last one in fact uh i you you mentioned that this morning i tweeted something out about it and i almost you always take my ideas and put them into tweets not always but um fifty percent of the time i do that uh and you know like i i started to get a little bit nostalgic about it and i don't know why right like i don't it's the end of an era yeah i was never a minor i know you did some gpu mining uh in in your history i'd never done that but it does feel like the end of an era and like we're crossing something and this is the very last roll roll-up where uh ethereum is on proof-of-work and i guess that counts for something so cross your fingers next time you guys hear this bankless nation we will be post-merged be all proof of stake from there on out yeah okay i'm just gonna make this joke once and we're never gonna speak of it again but like we're praying that this is not like the hillary clinton election party of 2016 where they were completely confident that they were totally going to win against donald trump and then donald trump won yeah that's like that's the last time we'll ever have to make this dream what a day that would be yeah yeah that's just a joke he's joking guys all right uh david is actually highly confident but like yes so so we're all the hillary clinton so it was hillary anyways hillary uh but anyways it is like this whole i was around in ethereum when it was proof of work people are going to say that in the future uh so if you if you were here listening to bank lists paying attention to crypto before ethereum went proof of stake that's pretty cool that's pretty cool your kids are going to think you're cool hopefully there's only two times to buy ethan before the merger happens after this year only two times that's it so you're here you weren't and we're glad you're here with us because we've got a lot to cover today uh first will we be merged next roll up we just talked about that but we're going to go through the schedule of what the roll-up week looks like next week because next week is roll-up week we're looking at thursday for the merge date david what else are we talking about uh we are also talking about binance rugging all non-binance usd stable coins on its platform but it's actually a good thing what happened there uh binance swapping out other people's stable coins we'll talk about that also coinbase going to bat for the crypto industry putting a lawsuit down on the table in front of the department of treasury because of tornado cash so yeah uh coinbase footing the bill for a treasury against lawsuit saying that what the treasury has done with banning tornado cash is unconstitutional outside of their just jurisdiction and just against innovation uh so coinbase nice job with that we'll go into all those details later in the show grab your popcorn guys and of course grab your coffee because this is going to be a good one today david before we get in got to share some special news from our friends and sponsors at consensus because they are giving away a free nft free to commemorate to celebrate them to prove to your kids that you were here during the emerge during that's right yeah uh so i'm definitely gonna collect one of these and if you want to be first to know about it as soon as it goes live so that you can mint one of these merge nfts commemorative nfts for free you need to click the link in the show notes click this button on the coinbase website called be the first to know it's got some merge information type in your email address and they will send you an email when it is ready to mint and you can mint that for free so that's the first thing we got going on also david there's a conference that you're attending at the end of september you should tell folks about that and some discounts that are available yeah of course converge 2022 in san francisco uh your boy is going to become a west coast boy for a half second this september 27th through the 30th uh this is being put on by circle this is circle's converge event of which there will be many uh speakers who you might be familiar with uh jeremy elaire of course the ceo of circle uh but also mike anderson from framework uh vitalik of course will also be giving a talk and to many many others in the industry so if you are in san francisco definitely get a ticket if you're around san francisco definitely get a ticket because i will see you guys all there there is a link in the show notes to get a discounted ticket yeah juicy discount too i think hundreds of dollars of off 250 off uh and that by the way that discount expires on the 15th of september expires the day of the merge so you better uh pick that up right before because because of marriage but by the time we tell you next week roll up it'll be expired so this is the time uh david acting like he's uh he's an east coaster here so he's gonna be a west coaster for the hot for a hot sec all right east coast david let's get to the markets today what's bitcoin looking like on the week are we above 20k no we are not we started the week at twenty thousand and seventy dollars we are ending the week at nineteen thousand two hundred and fifty dollars down about four percent on the week for bitcoin oof i don't like that being below the twenty seven don't like the all-time high overall the bitcoin chart looks not awesome no that's not feeling good how about eve any better news for us here yeah eath is up three point five percent so start of the week at fifteen hundred dollars fifteen seventy one thousand five hundred seventy dollars ending the week at sixteen hundred and thirty dollars up three point five percent so bitcoin down four percent ether up three and a half percent ryan it feels like the merch it feels like the merge trade yeah some feels it feels pretty mergy yeah emerge tastic all right god even bitcoin ratio uh that's got to be up on the week obviously yeah up 7.8 on the week up to .085 ryan do you know what that means i bet it is the highest we've been in a long time maybe in a year's time or so uh we are about there i think we are matched at the highs of the 2021 bull market it also means that one ethereum is worth 53 of one bitcoin you don't say yeah i do say sir that's halfway to the flipping that's over halfway to the flipping the eath market cap is now greater than 50 percent of bitcoins ah what happens did we unlock an nft when like when that happens does it no i just get really excited because after like a white knuckling my uh my youth btc down to like point zero five it's nice just have it recovered and then uh be in the green up to point zero david my friend you still play you're still trading ratios oh the deep dpi eath would have like just destroyed you on ratios from now on so that was only once this ratio is working out it's ratio's working out and there's a reason why we'll talk about it later in the show well it uh probably has to do with the merge but uh we'll get into more details how about the total crypto market cap we above or below a trillion yeah we're above a trillion last week we're at 1.01 trillion we are now at 1.025 trillion so small but healthy gain on the total crypto market cap okay which is interesting that the crypto market cap is up yet bitcoin is down yeah that divergence does not happen often that doesn't happen often that's really fascinating actually um how about eath gas prices so what we want to know is going in the merge is are we going to be deflationary post merchant are we burning more eath in the form of gas fees or are we inflationary is the money actually ultrasound david what are we looking like and so okay so this is actually something that we have to correct basically all times we've ever reported on gas because we've been i've been using that total gas distribution chart the chart further down uh and just like looking at the peak and seeing uh you've been looking at this no media no keep going up up you you went right over there there the green one on the top right the weekly gas distribution i would let's measure the peak and that's how i would report it but the peak is not the average and the peak is actually lower than the average uh and so what had what we've actually been reporting is the median the middle number but we're not reporting the average and so for the month for the last 30 days here are the new the new numbers the new numbers are in the last 30 days the median has been 14 grey the net average of gas prices over the last 30 days has actually been 18 gwei and that is the more accurate number when it comes to the eth burn and remember that's the average the average the average yes okay so the average is 18 grey and the ultrasound barrier is 15. so uh according to last month we will be ultrasound by the time we go into the merge wow that's great unless block space demand goes down but you can't imagine it going down too much but you can't go down too much more yeah so will our zero will our very first blocks be ultrasound or not it's looking like right now they will be i think that well i think they certainly will because there will be hella activity anyways because of the merge it's really just like are we gonna sustain that ultrasoundness and like it's close we're hanging on by like our fingernails but like it looks pretty looks pretty ultrasound to me all right for the last time for the last time we're going to look at the merge estimator date i know we'll get into the schedule a little bit later but what is the projected date of the merge date and time of the merge right now for next week thursday 8 a.m eastern time on thursday thursday morning eastern time uh sorry for the pacific coasters you might still be asleep you have to get up early to watch the live stream not too early though um but yeah eight a.m eastern time if it feels perfectly reasonable now totally still move up it could still move back but it could also still move up but eight a.m eastern i have no complaints i have no complaints yeah it's gonna be good good morning so sorry i'm sorry pacific coasters we'll get to the we're doing a lot that week of course bankless is doing a lot the ethereum community is doing a lot so we'll give you the schedule uh a little bit later after we get to the market section but we still got more market stuff to cover david you unlocked this fantastic visualization of eth price at staking deposit time what are we looking at and what is this telling us yeah this came from a fantastic twitter account data underscore always which is some really fantastic data analysis of blockchain stuff and there's always there's been this argument that like the east supply overhang and like or the eth unlock when we finally unlock is like bearish because that means everyone's going to dump all their ether and i just think that this argument is like totally overstated wait real quick what happens there for people who have forgotten so okay if you are staking ether on the beacon chain that there are no withdrawals and so it's a one-way street once you deposit and begin staking ether that's the only thing you can do you can't get your ether back that is continues to be true post merge so we merge and that is still true we need to do another hard fork to enable withdrawals predicted something like six to 12 months out after the merge and then people will unlock and people will fear that there is just this pent-up demand to sell ether because there's been like this massive staking event where people can't get liquidity on their ether and i think that this is overstated um and so the i mean granted there it will like there's a supply of ether there's like 13 14 million ether that has not been able to be sold but if you have to really ask your question who are these people that are staking on the beacon chain and especially the like the most credible fear is like this 500 to 700 range where people began staking their ether very in the very very beginning december of 2020 when the beacon chain launched or january 2021 when ether price was still cheap if you remember ryan january 2021 was when ether went and broke uh like 1 100 and then started it's basically up to four thousand dollars in may so people staked in december and january when ether was still like cheap you know 500 to 700 and a lot of ether became staked who are those people that are going first through the door into an unknown technology with an unknown stake to lock up time uh just to get like six percent yield on your ether it's permabulls it's probably and it's not like they deposited all of their ether they probably deposited like less than 10 percent because they're you know ether per balls that have been here through the pre-sale these people are not sellers and also for the remainder of like the deposits if you're somebody who's itching to get liquidity on your ether you probably staked with lido which launched the same time as the beacon chain and that's all of the blue bars you see here on the visualization that's all lido deposits and so that ether is actually liquid and so a majority of ether that's been deposited other than that first cohort that came in between 500 and 700 is actually underwater so they're actually like you know underwater in terms of their eth time of deposit not necessarily when they bought it uh and so like this whole like oh there's going to be this mass unlocking event and like it's going to flood the marketplace i think has been totally overstated and you're saying that because you're seeing a lot of this uh who are like below current prices they staked below current prices a lot of the ethers and even that i just don't think the people who are like willing to take the lock-up time are people that are inherently itching to sell their ether these aren't like flimsy paper handers well you know what's funny though so i i agree with that and i think that's a like a valid take you know what's funny though is i know a number of eath bulls who still haven't staked very much either in fact i would count like probably yourself and myself among those like right now when we have our we have our steak with rocket pool but like my personal stake i'm like i have my ether and then i have my d gen and my d-gen supply is trading the ratio right now right i've got some stake stuff but i have been also been waiting for for it to be de-risked ironically until like after the merge we'll see how the merge goes david and then like so yeah it's it's it's interesting it's certainly complex by the way risk the hillary clinton risk yeah you are having a uh a debate with um jordy uh on this i think the episode for for uh listeners will come out um live tomorrow it'll be today by the time you listen to this right right now because it's not friday yes correct so uh david will debate jordy on this very topic and you can catch that on the bankless podcast youtube as always um what's this david just one last amount of revenue for the miners theory miners made 756 million dollars in revenue in august ahead of the merge it's the last time we'll see that headline uh this is the last amount of like revenue for the miners uh they get two weeks in september um but all of that will be largely deleted good night goodbye prince that's it good night that's good that's it for the miners they are now retired uh yeah a lot of them have to retire there is not a job there is not sufficient proof of work chains that can support gpu miners to support that entire entire industry i think some of the miners have been uh stacking their eth in order to stake but um others haven't and they'll just move on to uh greener pastures and other proof of work networks uh david let's talk not very green ryan sorry not very great some red ones um let's talk about the general markets in the macro side of things so first let's start with the the s p um this is a tweet from charlie uh charlie biello this is a tweet from charlie bolello the s p 500 is down 17.7 percent in the first 169 trading days of 2022 the fourth worth start the fourth worst start to any year in history so um s p down on the election yeah definitely so that's what we're looking at but i think that the more broad thing in macro that we should probably be thinking about right now is uh european energy markets and its effect on monetary policy this is a great tweet thread from our friend jim bianco that kind of explains this you want to run us through this yeah he goes uh jim bianco says the bottom line europe is in an intolerable position and the public is getting angry and it's not even cold yet because of course energy is how people stay warm during the winter uh and so jim bianco continues and says natural gas is used for power generation and space heating and is highly seasonal storage of natural gas is filled in the summer and run down in the winter for space heating like they stock up their reserves during the summer when people don't need natural gas as much and then they consume that in the winter currently storage facilities are at 81 full about the middle of what you would expect an average like this is about a normal amount of being full at this point in the year um jim continues and says too many have pointed out to the chart above and proclaim that there is no problem but this neglects the fact that it has cost a lot to fill these facilities and as this chart that we're showing here says european natural gas prices are soaring after out even after this week's decline and so yes the reserves are full acceptably full but it's being it's costing way more this year like three four five x times what it would be last year uh consequently the cost of filling the storage has already cost yeah 6.5 times the still storage in any other full season they have the storage they have the supplies but they paid bigly for it and this cost has already happened will be borne by the european population because of soaring energy bills or through some form of taxation or bailouts and then he continues and says also note the natural gas storage detailed above only covers about 25 to 30 percent of winter natural gas needs meaning they will have to sip their energy straight from the pipeline in addition to their storage so it only solves up to like 30 percent of the actual problem so europe still needs flows from russia this winter uh and before the ukraine war germany got about 55 percent of its gas needs from russia and this has certainly lowered somewhat during the recent month but gas flows from russia are down more than 75 percent from a normal flow note this is uh a largest part of the north stream uh being constrained according to jim the north stream pipeline will continue to be constrained uh because that's the whole strategy from putin right now and jim bianco continues and says make no mistake putin knows all this which is why he is trolling europe with leaks requiring a shutdown of nordstrom for an unspecified period of time so putin is basically shutting down nordstrom saying just on the play that this is going to make things really painful for europe of course this none of this should be a surprise putin gave a speech in june saying that he was going to do this now he's actually doing it and so what does all this mean europe has all the gas it needs as long as they're available to drain their bank accounts for it says jim bianco so tldr uh there is adequate natural gas reserves it was really expensive it only solves 30 of the problem uh and that remaining 70 of that problem is going to be expensive even further and so how are they going to pay for it some form of money printing some form of bailouts some form of taxation but it's not going to be pretty either way is i think the summary of this thread yeah and what's interesting about that as it affects monetary policy is of course energy bills they're soaring for average business owners and average citizens that means everything else gets more expensive and so uh there have already been some government interventions so the uk is uh deploying some price caps on energy contracts but the bills across energy have been utility bills have been soaring nonetheless italy is approving new aid packages we've seen similar aid packages in germany and the one in italy is you know 12 billion dollars in government funding to help shield firms and families from surging energy costs and so i think what we're going to see across all of europe is essentially the government has to deploy policies and deploy funds stimulus funds to help consumers and help businesses pay for these energy costs and where's that going to come from it's not from additional tax revenue very likely it's mostly going to be in the form of money printing and they're doing this with a backdrop of inflation continues to heat up too and so they are cutting checks uh to people to help them pay for their energy needs yet at the same time the european central bank just last week raised rates by 75 basis points in order to tackle soaring inflation so it's this like rock in a hard place that central banks and governments are are trying to to manage and uh it's a very difficult place to be yeah and like i don't know if this is bullish or bearish it's bullish because money printing means asset prices go up it's bearish because people are like struggling and that's never good and that can result in many different things like people are burning burning their bills and like protesting paying their energy bills like so it's just like i don't know whether it's bullish or bearish but it's definitely chaotic and chaotic makes me scared marcus don't like chaos do you know uh speaking of chaos so i read this great post this week and uh from arthur hayes yet again arthur hayes writing it up and uh we had arthur on the podcast um earlier this week too so guys if you haven't tuned into that episode it's a fantastic episode he's talking all about the merged trade but um maybe i could just because i know you haven't had a chance to read this david but let me just like summarize it for you because i think it's super valuable basically arthur is saying we're in wartime right now people don't know it but we're actually in wartime and it's not not talking about the the russian ukrainian conflict although that is a source of kinetic war he's talking about economic war between russia and china and the us and the eu and so his his central thesis for this article is like we're in economic war wars could escalate in various ways but at least acknowledge we're an economic war we were also previously in in a war against a virus in a coveted war right uh and so we and we saw we saw all sorts of uh restrictions and and money printing as a result of that so the the tale of the 2020s has so far has been kind of like war it's like an omega right economic wars and wars against viruses and kovid and what happens during war when you look at it historically well two things happen inflation which we've talked about a lot but the second which is somewhat interesting is capital controls and the reason nation states flags as arthur calls them put capital controls in place is so that their citizens can't get out of the inflation so that we're all kind of in it together if we are going into an economic war or total war mode then all of the citizens need to be united and spend whatever is necessary in order to help the government and help the the people help the nation win the war and so the very first thing that nations do when wartime gets worse is they impose uh capital controls and and and sanctions and so we saw just glimmers of that i think during covet we're seeing a bit more with the russian economic sanctions but arthur goes through history and talks about times where it's gotten a whole lot worse and this i think is a an interesting uh piece of history that i would personally like to study a little bit more and maybe we can do a bankless episode on this in the future but um let's take the u.s in world war ii um did you know that before world war ii so this is during the great depression fdr put in place a emergency banking act in 1933 that essentially meant a gold confiscation so the problem was citizens at that time were trying to escape from inflation from other economic wars by taking their assets and putting it in coins bars gold certificates and fdr basically made that illegal you couldn't exit the existing fiat system through a store of value like gold anymore and did you know that gold private citizens american citizens owning gold was actually illegal until december 1974. so this was like a you know a capital control that lingered and this was in the us which they came out of the depression like fairly strong they actually won world war world war ii uh if you look at other countries like you know germany for example in japan the capital controls were far more severe right there was no way for the average citizen to actually escape and so arthur is kind of adding these things up like we're in kind of this early wartime period things could get worse they may not right like hopefully probabilistically um you know things will end up okay but they could get worse and when they do expect inflation and then also expect capital controls and his overarching point toward the end of the article is basically this the time to escape from the fiat system is not after the capital controls in place so it's basically the time to buy assets non-inflationary assets like bitcoin like ether in the digital mode maybe like other things if you think real estate yeah maybe or like that can be uh capital controlled very well by the nation state ideally you want to kind of exit the system entirely and so you're not dependent on the existing banking system the the the time to do that is now is this point and uh yeah i i guess some dark thoughts this week like as i was thinking about all of these things but i think he's absolutely right and the basic calculus is like what happens during fiat currencies during war time right like war time is destruction like capital gets destroyed like we spend capital to build a tank that tank goes to war tank blows up that capital gets destroyed fiat money which paid for that tank becomes like printed and inflated to move atoms and what is ultimately war is like it's a fight over the way that the physical world looks and so people like governments are using their fiat currencies as like the ultimate like power that that creates and supports and directs the resources of a world an army uh and when two armies are going at each other like what happens is that ultimately the most downstream net effect of war is that inflation happens uh and so like destruction creates inflation uh and so and why there's capital controls is like the nation state is like yo we are all in this together y'all can't sell your dollars because we need to sell the dollars to pay for war and so you guys can't sell dollars only we can sell dollars and we sell dollars by minting dollars and then selling them uh and so like you know usually this works when the populace is behind the effort this is like you know buy war bonds in world war two and people like okay i'll buy war bonds you know my my son is going to war i feel really scared for his life how can i help i'll buy war bonds ryan i don't really think the populist of today is in that kind of sentiment to buy war bonds certainly not now and like like like arthur goes through the kind of the return on investment of of war bonds basically even for the u.s who actually won the war and this like negative 40 to 60 right if you actually bought the war bonds right you lost money in real terms some people lost lives some people lost money it was a group effort yeah um so anyway very interesting but i i think that um people have to start thinking we have to start thinking about fiat currency and what it actually is and it's actually just a form of short-term debt to the government you're lending money to the government in exchange for your hard assets like commodities like energy essentially yeah and we're starting to see that in europe play out anyways back to the merge back to lighter news what's coming up next david coming up next the merge did you know it's happening next week i hope you did because we talked about it earlier in this episode and last week and the week before that but it's actually next week so we're going to talk about the merge schedule what you need to know what you need to do all that stuff uh binance rugs all non-usd stable coins but it's a good thing we'll figure out why uh and lastly coinbase proposes something big to make or dao this is unrelated to how coinbase is also suing the treasury we're talking about all these things and more but first a moment to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get r-eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your eath by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled ead that uses your note to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish each staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there maker dow is the og d5 protocol the first d5 protocol to ever exist even before we called it d5 maker dow produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mince die directly with maker the power to mince new money is in your hands and there's something new in the maker dow ecosystem every time a new maker dow is opened the owner can claim a po-op which contributes funds to one tree planted an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side soon maker will be present on all chains and layer twos bringing the biggest and best d5 credit facility to everywhere there is defy so follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence ryan the last hard fork before the merge happened it's called bellatrix happened last week it's activated there are now zero more steps between where we are now and the ethereum merge the next thing to happen on ethereum is the merge and the merge is happening next week september 15th thursday morning is that september 15th yes yes uh september 15th thursday morning 8 a.m eastern time 5 a.m pacific time uh later in european times uh but that's what's next the merge the merge is next okay so bellatrix being the last hard fork before the merge how did that go david can you go over that with us it went super super well uh here is a tweet thread from christine kim who's live tweeting as bellatrix happened and then so some quick stats that she put forth network participation rate ninety seven point eight percent active validators four hundred and twenty thousand uh offline validators one thousand one hundred you know that number can be expected and then also here is just like a quick cheat sheet of client diversity everything is below 51 that's good we could still get prism down but it's not really going to stop us from doing anything uh and then bellatrix happens uh and as a as the other side of bellatrix every hard fork you lose people that aren't ready and 95 of people hard forked with the bell tricks update uh and so like you know if we saw 95 with the actual merge that would be fantastic so 94.94 percent uh and so uh a few so the 11 000 validated offline validators jumped up to 17 000 but you could imagine these people just like didn't update their nodes all they have to go do is download more software fix something you know unplug it replug it in something like that is this right number of active validators 403 000 correct that is the beacon chain validators yeah yeah not unique numbers of computers but like 30 400 and 3 000 unique instances of 32 ether which is one validator of course and so 94.94 percent succeeded and like all we need ryan is 66 all we need is 66 for it to be a flawless merge and we had 94.94 well in my school growing up 94 was an a and even if it was below 66 it all it needs is like 24 hours to get above 66 so it's not like this one moment we need to be above 66 percent we just need to get to 66 percent like soonish is this what the merge is gonna look like i'm looking at a meme here it's just a guy staring at his computer and then like he's got a merch happiness and then he's got a little celebratory thing it is like this naturally like anti-climactic thing of this like invisible software just like changes we're gonna make it fun yeah on the social layer but yeah i mean like it's just code i guess in the background not a lot's happening uh what's this tweet saying david yeah this is adrian saying bellatrix looking good so far again this is moments after the merge definitely some people who didn't update probably around five percent turned out i was right but money at stake we should see that get fixed up pretty quickly so bellator bellatrix the the uh update doesn't actually mean too much like you go offline if something's bad but you get the leakage response like because there's because there's money at stake with the merge then there is money at stake with bellatrix because it was the beacon chain yes but like this is why this has such a good success rate and why even if repair is fast it heals it repairs so fast because there's financial incentive unlike all previous test nets which is like yo we're going to do a dry run there are like you know ticket paying audience members in the theater waiting to see the merge and so like you don't mess up them because there's incentives you're you're losing eth every every few minutes right yep um this is getting some exposure in mainstream i've seen a number of articles uh this is an article from the economist about the merge the title is the future of crypto is at stake in ethereum switch a lot of these articles david they're pretty surface level but they're also pretty good yeah and they're also about energy obviously they're like oh yeah like look at that subtitle can decentralized networks reform themselves as in like repent for their energy consumption and like it's always been like they're not going to talk about ultrasound money they're not going to talk about ether's deflation they're talking about how ethereum is going to go green that's all right they've got to leave some space for us to talk the economist can't steal our content come on guys i think a lot of people are also wondering whether a proof of work chain will remain and i think people are just curious like if i have some eath will i get a free fork they've maybe received a fork funds in the past and there's talk of ethereum proof of work fork that could be happening what are we looking at right here on coin gecko i think that the chart we have pulled up is uh for an asset called the ethereum proof of work fork iou what is this thing yeah this is basically a tokenized future of the ethereum pow chain ryan i want to say this extremely clearly i've said it all the other times on the show i i think listeners should expect getting zero dollars from the east proof of work fork i think this is a game that's being played by traders who are trying to meme this thing into existence i think people who are positioning themselves to capture that youth proof of work token are going to find themselves receiving roughly zero dollars from this rate i mean unless they're super fast unless they're super fast and sophisticated and playing this game you're talking about like just normal retail normal retail traders like a few bucks i don't think there's going to be this brand new like proof of work chain that spawns off and like you see you see extra ether show up in like a different wallet like it doesn't make any sense um i know i can go to the reasons why but it would just be me ranting for like 10 minutes i know here we're looking at kind of a a futures market right so this is you know but it's um it's about like two to three percent or so the price of e3 31 for one proof of work ether as opposed to the current price of ether which is sixteen hundred thirty two dollars and this is one hypothetical right it doesn't even exist yet it's hypothetical um but you know another way to look at this of course is um to look at the liquidity on this we're talking just such low liquidity right 24 hour volume of you know 350 it's not enough it's not zero not nothing but it's kind of a lowish cap you know defy token would have something similar so don't expect it it could happen here's the thing we'll answer some questions i think we had a lot of questions this week about uh what do you do in case you want to receive a hypothetical eth proof-of-work coin is there anything you have to do in case that happens uh the good news is a hypothetical scenario that it happens yeah hypothetically david doesn't do you not want this to happen do you know i just don't think it will like okay i'm going to speed run this like how are these how are these users going to access this chain are they going to update their their uh rpc endpoint in inferior somebody inferior is gonna have to accept it which means they're gonna have to run their own node that connects to the ethereum be a non-proof of work chain which means they're gonna download old consensus software like there's gonna have to be a client for this thing like people are gonna have to just make where's all the infrastructure if they have their funds in like you know coinbase and exchange coinbase would have to obviously like release it to them there's a lot of people only x is going to do that but if just one exchange service is this like service for people i think it's not anything this does feel different than previous forks that we've seen which actually had some traction like ethereum classic for one had some attraction but even in the bitcoin world bitcoin cash it was like roger there it's like yeah we've got a mission yeah we've got you know a developer community like noth no one no community is rallying around the east other than the miners and the only reason why the miners are rallying on it because they want to dump on you because that's their business model [Laughter] all right well yeah i i i totally see the point so don't expect any free bucks i wish i wish we had uh better news for you but you know if you do see that token maybe like you know sell it real quick yeah before everyone else does uh you know what's kind of bullish about this though david and this is really good to see is the at-home staking community 100 shout out solo stakers what are we looking at david i know we've got a bunch of images lined up yes super fizz who's just a fantastic community member of the ethereum community just really focused on proof of sake the merge and also just fundamentally bullish on steak from home he started this whole steak from home meme and i found all of these tweets because he retweeted it so just shout out to superfiz and this is just like this hodgepodge group of people who like live at home and they're staking at home like look at this mess look at this absolute absence of cable management while wait where's this where's the staking node it's that little black black square it's a little black square right there connected to the router like with a tiny ass keyboard that doesn't even like this does not look like a data center this is not professional this is just like amateur at-home staking here's somebody with like the the panda sticker on there like intel nook there and you see the tiny little computers uh running rocket pool here's another one like again a steak at home smaller than a pen like we're going to we got like 15 of these yeah so here's another one connected to this uh this guy's beefy yeah well no so that's the battery it's the tiny little it's the tiny little like uh and the intel machine that's up up in the shop but it's on the battery in case like the power goes out uh here here's somebody having their tiny little comm sticking computer on top of their ps4 next to their family photos next to their baby like they're a grandkid or kid or something i don't know it's another child my validator is my child yeah baby is it here's one is it's a laptop just like you know sitting on somebody's laptop sitting in the basement that's what this one looks like yeah like here's here's a nice like professional looking one like it's very very clean yeah you can see this on our battle stations maybe uh here's one with like a stuffed dog next to it like right next to like all their other server stuff uh here's one sitting under a shelf right next to somebody's modem with a fan on it to make it cool here's one with a post-it note that says don't touch this is daddy's sign daddy yeah kids don't touch this next to like some home server uh cause kids if you do touch it the family loses money all right don't touch dad's validator please here's like a custom made raspberry pi with like some eath branding on it that somebody clearly just like put together in like a wood shop uh you know here's somebody like with their again like a very small box an intel and uc thing uh with like that little temperature monitor this is inside of a home energy this is like yeah right next to their like home family tv and xbox right yeah right right next to your like your fire stick they got that little like monitor yeah like this is great like uh here's like somebody's like cooler bigger one i think this might be actually super physicist uh here's one like baked into a shelf just like built in right so like that's their hue light mode and like they have it like hooked up to their shelf that is awesome yeah it is great here's austin griffith you know pointing behind him this is his setup of course uh uh here's one with like a vitalik photo okay so we're getting to the good ones here this guy is he's staking in his mobile home he has a full-size computer and he's in the force of washington staking mobley via satellite like how are you you're not even on the grid he is off the grid he's off the grid this is like solar powered or something speaking uh-huh how crazy is it on the grid not even connected and it can't be amazing amazing uh and here's one it hit this guy it has it in his kitchen up on top of his shelves and so like it's above his kitchen cabinets and i was like i just love how this is in this dude's kitchen that mixer is there's the cuisinart the kitchenaid cuisinart that like somebody's making cookies yeah like i'm sorry you're not seeing this kind of stuff with professional proof-of-work miners this is in my mind the reason why we can share all of these photos is because of what the purposes of proof of work why does this matter is this just like hardware porn like why are we even so it's a little bit hardware porn but it's the point is is that ethereum becomes as decentralized as capital and hardware which are very fundamentally decentralized and that was my take that i put in here it's like the reason why we can share these photos is because how like ethereum exists in people's homes this is this area for the people yes this is this is what decentralization looks like right scroll through it it's like 100 run this from home this is your check on the network whereas individuals have power over the network this is you have a change that they don't like you making just a little bit of money 4 six seven percent on your eth for just doing the network thing doing the e thing i i thought you couldn't run a validator from home i was told this i think a lot of listeners actually haven't heard that because the bitcoiners who say that have just become more and more and more relevant now yeah uh what is this from jonathan mann of course put together a nice song should we play it for people yeah jonathan mann is the song of day man so of course he's saying a song about staking from home so here it is [Music] [Music] follow your nose [Music] the windows are open if the doors into the mind [Music] all right a lot to uh celebrate over merge week of course including solo stakers but david let's talk a little bit more about the stable coin wars because binance did a thing this week they have stopped supporting usdc this is of course one of the largest staple coins in the world second to tether usdc it's kind of a coinbase circle american regulated bank stablecoin type product and binance isn't having it anymore essentially they have converted all of the usdc funds over to their own stablecoin which is called busd this is the binance stablecoin similar product in a lot of respects not as american regulated certainly not a coin based product or circle product either what's going on here david yeah and it's actually not just uscc it's also pax dollar and true usd these are much smaller stable coins but all three of these stable coins are just being swapped on the back end to be usc so if you had uscc or pax or true usc deposited into binance congrats you now own busc instead a different stable coin a different stable coin yeah this is kind of like an analogy i think is if um you know when you deposit funds into wells fargo they're actually like dollar items cargo dollar ious right yeah and if you deposit it into uh chase bank they're chase dollars ious this is as if um chase bank was holding wells fargo ious and they said no more wells fargo i use they're just all chase ious now that's kind of what's happening here yeah and like it's no capital was lost because it's all one for one it's all like kind assets but just like you know the bankless take here is that bankless banks can do whatever they want with your money uh other banks throughout history like central banks have said like you know 20 bills no longer valid just like that now this kind of feels a little bit like that but at least no no users lost their money and actually there are some huge proponents of this saying it's actually really a really good move mainly because you can actually still withdraw uscc so if you have doll it's basically making all dollars on binance homogeneous which is actually a good move uh liquidity right so like yeah so like you just now have finance dollars which is literally what it's called but if you want to withdraw usdc to ethereum they actually still give you that option so like you deposit dollars into binance it gets turned to b usc on the back end your binance account so it's like okay you credited this many dollars and then you can withdraw those dollars and turn it into what do you want to turn it into uscc on ethereum die on like optimism like true usd on avalanche like it still lets you do that it's just homogenizing dollars in the deposit side and it's actually very good for liquidity because like rather than having like bitcoin trade against usdc and busd and ust it's just now which is busc so actually these order pairs actually get more liquid interestingly they did not do this for tether and i think that's because of the manual redeemability of tether i think this is the case and so the take here is that uh it's a it's a good ux upgrade for depositing stable coins except for tether tether gets a little bit left out here and so there's a prediction here that says that this moves leads to a gradual net share shift from usdt tether to binance dollar and usdc and this is also echoed by jeremy elaire who is supported of this move by binance and so the argument here is that this actually cuts out steps for usdc users who want to trade on binance and so this is actually removing a step and still enabled everything that you could do before ftx actually already had this and built into their exchange and so but like this actually this feature doesn't get embedded into us into tether because tether has this like t plus one settlement time i'm a little bit harry on the details um but that's the hot takes here yeah jeremy lehrer of course is the the ceo of circle who would be you know very incentive to respond negatively to this if he felt it was negative to usdc um yeah i think it's there's an element of this is news but it's also kind of non-news um there's there's also an element of like uh rest assured this is definitely you'd say it's in in binance users best interest maybe from a pooled liquidity perspective but it's definitely in finance's best interest right they want to propagate busd and what's interesting about this to me is like we're fine with uh stable coins like the bankless position is hey they can provide some good ux right usdc busd whatever it is but we should also recognize their limitations and these are effectively um bank coins sometimes on crypto rails but they're issued by bankers both are fine it's good ux but neither of them are decentralized uh and i do think that each bank over time of course they're going to be biased towards their own stablecoin the interesting juxtaposition of course is ethereum is credibly neutral and biased towards neither it cannot favor usdc it cannot favor busd in any uh stretch uh it's interesting when you consider you know something like the binance chain for example you can very easily see that maybe favoring a binance-centric stable coin over another type of stable coin we're not going to get that on a truly decentralized system like ethereum so banks will be banks they're going to play their bank games and some of it will be good ux and some of it will not be detrimental but it's definitely not decentralized um david speaking of banks playing bank games banks coinbase and mkr there is coinbase proposing some kind of agreement to the maker community what is that yeah coinbase the exchange is making a proposal to make or dow the dow and so they make this proposal for maker dow to take one third of its usdc of its which is about 1.6 billion 1.6 billion is one-third of it so multiply that by three and you get the total supply again can't do math uh listeners do that in your head but coinbase is proposing that 1.6 billion usdc in makers faults be deposited into coinbase to earn yield with coinbase and they are offering maker 1.5 yield on their 1.6 billion usdc and maker dao is currently getting zero percent on that uscc so this would net maker dial about 24 million dollars in yearly revenue if they agree to do this and so some of the parameters here is that um uh maker will pay zero custody fees on uscc held by uh coinbase prime so coinbase isn't charging maker for this uh maker governance will be able to freely mint burn withdraw and settle almost instantaneously in uscc less than six minutes consistent with coinbase's prime standard offering one of the reasons why this works is this highly automated and then the rewards from the uscc account with coinbase will be calculated based on the weighted average of assets on the platform each month and paid out on the fifth business day of the following month uh and so some some takes are like well you're taking collateral that's backing dye and you're giving it to coinbase does that offer any like sort of security risk or centralization risk roon responded to this criticism saying from a regulatory legal and seizure risk perspective this proposal changes nothing because there was already centralization risk with usdc anyways and also like circle and coinbase are kind of embedded together like formally they have a formal agreement yeah and so there's not additional risks here uh another community question uh came in it's like why not advocate to like ave or compound you would improve censorship resistance reduce centralization risk and it's likely less likely than a risk to a custodial service uh and i guess actually the answer to this is exactly what i just said uscc is already essentially any custodial right it's already custodial yeah but also it would nuke the yields inside of d5 and so putting out uscc into d5 sucks up defy yields and they actually want that defy yield to actually go work for die so they're using their uscc for coinbase to get external yields so it's actually going out and get getting external yields into crypto rather than just like having this internal circular economy where we're just like lending each other our stable coins um so that's that i guess uh it's interesting a few uh maybe hot takes for me on this are like number one isn't it cool that a company like coinbase is proposing a proposal on the maker governance forums that is cool that was really cool like that's really neat so i love that piece of it and and i also think i mean my other hot take is probably like coinbase is probably looking at some of the discussion around the usdc concentration in the mkr remember we talked about last week these factions right of the maker community and dye and you know one faction wants to completely eject all centralized stable coins from the backing of dye and here's coinbase coming in with a sweetener 1.5 annual apy if you don't and so that's interesting as well so uh yeah it's it i it's always fascinating david to see how all of this you know has evolved and you know makers a relatively new project like five years old now here it's getting uh on the government it's not new in crypto terms it's now in global terms yeah it's new it's a new kind of like operation new type it's new in the same way that crypto is early exactly my hot take here is that's your hot take this actually doesn't fit the protocol sync thesis i always thought coinbase would be depositing money into maker dow not making proposals for make or doubt to deposit money into it that actually seems inverted from what i would expect because this is like a protocol is on top of a centralized entity rather than a centralized entity being on top of a protocol that's my hot take it's like that actually didn't really fit my model here yeah it's i i see that as well it's it's interesting to ask what actually is maker right like it's not quite a bank it's not fully a protocol what is it right it's some it's some kind of new thing in the middle of something it's a dow i got a new sort of banked out david what's coming up next though it's not the last time we're going to be hearing from coinbase in this weekly rollup because they are also suing the treasury department so go pop your popcorn once you're done with your coffee and then also the ens august numbers are in and they're hot because they're always been hot so we're going to cover those numbers and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms pezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-train crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets bravewall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave at brave.com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started it's still air drop season david one inch users on optimism are receiving an air drop of 300 000 op tokens in order to receive this you had to be a highly active one-inch user on optimism and you get a little airdrop bonus incentive in the form of op tokens any thoughts here yeah this is just really the effort of distributing op tokens to users of optimism again using crypto rewards you at least it tends to this one is unique though in the sense that one inch already had an airdrop uh with a one inch token and they already had users on optimism i'm not really sure if this is actually like moving the needle of just like incenting usage of optimism um but it is distributing op tokens widely which i guess is good i'm actually left with more question marks on than than anything on this one i think the new like meta for airdrops is you got to be doing stuff on layer two yeah that is basically learning lessons from this which is in order to get your next airdrop um hit you got to be active in an uh layer two like optimism or arbitrarily or like later zk sync is starkware and others so uh take note my friends um let's flip over to nfts though uh do you know reddit we talked about reddit launching nfts except they're secretly not calling them nfts uh for the reddit community and they are actually selling fairly well david some of these nfts are selling for over two thousand dollars and all of the ones that they've released so far have uh sold out which is pretty fascinating looking at some of the nfts here i get this is just good adoption i've read it i'm loving where this is going uh i want to see more i want to see more what's delivering more though ryan is the august numbers for ens uh so we got the august numbers 301 000 new dot eth registrations so minting new ens names is still hot that's 4.7 million dollars in protocol revenue of course all going to the dow and we've got some unique new holders of course 34 000 new ethereum wallets that are holding at least one new ens name and of course like always 99 percent of domains on openc are being sold as ens because i don't even know what another like domain service provider is uh so enos numbers are hot i think the four the the 10k club where like if you have an ens number that is zero through nine nine nine nine has like a floor price of three which is wow pretty good really yeah that's maintained it wasn't just a blip huh no not not just maintained for sure that's funny to me that ens uh names are like they are the bear market nft they really are they've become like that like i saw them last week converge on fundamentals right like these are non-speculative these are totally going to be around jpegs yeah you can actually use a domain but like useful i mean like you can use it to like name your ether dress or like you know direct an ipfs website or something like this and you can't do do as much with your jpegs so last week i saw they were actually exceeding the trading volume of board apes yeah so the trading volume was 2 300 ether in the last month board apes was at 2120 ether i'm the captain now 9 000 ens names have changed hands in the last seven days so the like not only are the the ens like registrations happening new ens domains are coming into the world but like people are also just like trading them around too it's crazy i kept the ens airdrop too david i don't know if you did but i wasn't able to clean mine my mine got burnt oh sad you lost tokens i lost tokens yeah yeah this sounds like i don't have to pay taxes on them that's what i'm that's why i'm claiming i don't if i can't if i can't claim the tokens i can't pay taxes somebody fact checked that for us i lost the private keys if i don't have the private keys i don't i can't claim the tokens well if you said it in a podcast it's a hundred percent true so if any irs agents are listed the irs is like okay deduct 500 of the dues paid by david hoffman like okay yep they're listening that's how taxes work one thing that remains bullish is nfts for public goods what is trent doing here with the protocol guild uh in this nft issuance yeah so the protocol guild is this guild that's really meant to provide things for the market for the community that people might want and then sell those things and then give that revenue to protocol devs um sale yeah yeah lemonade sale bake sale uh but the protocol devs you know development funding development has always been like a problem in open source world uh and also with ethereum uh and so the protocol guild has gone after that problem and so they are making nfts with like actually really just like big deal artists uh and those platforms and so there's this whole like network around like producing some really cool nfts so like while it seems like a bake sale like oh like buy a cookie it's big this is like these are coveted nfts uh so i think people are going to play the speculation game on these things look at this 120 ethereum core devs that this goes yeah being funded and that's amazing because uh guess why next week is merge week david it's because of these people right it's because the ethereum core devs they made it happen and so now is a good time to celebrate them you could do so by purchasing an nft and the proceeds go to the devs via the protocol guild i've checked out some of the art on these things both from like some of it's not released yet but you can just check out because like some artists are on board other artists haven't been revealed yet but like this is not just like a you know you know casual thing this is like a big deal thing like artists are coming secret artists blah blah but like the art of what has been revealed is pretty damn cool pretty damn cool another way too i will be participating in this yes uh okay oh yes here we go okay victor victor bunyan out of coinbase he works at coinbase cloud but definitely just like deep in coinbase says today we announced that coinbase is funding and supporting a lawsuit by six individuals against the treasury department sanctions of tornado cash smart contracts an open source piece of software you can read more about the details here so six individuals are suing the treasury department and coinbase is footing the bill and basically coordinating everything uh here we go nice job okay okay so this is are you ready to rumble this is basically so you guys know because you've been listening to the roll-up uh the last few weeks dave and i have talked a lot about tornado cash the ofac sanctioning of smart contracts and the unco unconstitutionality of it or the illegality of it we've done a number of episodes about that with jake travinski and the question is okay what is the crypto community going to do about it and if you're an individual right with an ether dress and your government has just told you if you use tornado cash to try to keep your transactions private you could go to jail for 30 years what can an individual do about it okay right so now we have the infantry coming in we have coinbase stepping up and actually suing the behalf of treasury department funding this suite funding the street funding the lawsuit of the treasury department on the behalf of six plaintiffs so six individual citizens like you and i uh who are there are representing and they are funding they're paying the legal bills for these individuals it's badass that's a super chad super chat of coinbase coinbase to do this they don't have to do this this is crypto native values above and beyond in my opinion pretty excited i i don't know how much is going to cost i imagine a decent amount but overall i actually do expect this to be like ev like expected value positive for coinbase because from a brand perspective from brand perspective but also ensuring that like coinbase can integrate with other d5 projects maybe they don't integrate directly with like tornado cache but if they stop the unwarranted regulation at tornado cache then they're like free to like do stuff that's you know not so like ridiculous like uh not so dubious as privacy stuff just like you know good compound ave uniswap it really just stops the progress of dubious regulations so they don't have to fight it later so i think they're gonna drop a line in the sand somewhere yeah is that what you're saying yes exactly i mean and this is where coinbase is trying to line the sand it's uh great this is a blog post from brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase this is not legal this is brian armstrong the ceo and co-founder of coinbase i always think things are stronger when they come from a co-founder and the tl dr of this post is coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the u.s treasury department's sanctions of the tornado cash smart contracts and asking the court to remove them from the u.s sanctions list the sanctions exceed treasury's authority harm innocent people remove privacy and security options for crypto users and stifle innovation well said coinbase is a legal officer told cnbc it sets a dangerous precedent if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law any technology any tool or system could be a fair game for also being banned so this is what i was saying is like coinbase maybe coinbase is cool with tornado cash being banned but they know more than coin than tornado cash and so in order to protect their future business models ones that might not be alive today they are doing this uh thank you thank you coinbase well done did you know did you know david um alex.eth is actually one of the plaintiffs here ah alex this is alex.eth on twitter he says today i joined five other plaintiffs in challenging the u.s treasuries no fact sanctions against tornado cash a regular citizen uh aetherian that um known for a while in the space just on twitter and other places um i'm not with you he's saying i did not take this decision lightly being a plaintiff in the case so this also required bold action by individual citizens individual crypto natives and crypto citizens but he said code is and is speech and free speech is a constitutional right and worth protecting well done alex i hope he gets a poep you get the retweet man good job alex um i'm proud of the community for for for doing this david what do we got for releases releases today curve usd was born new decentralized stable coin on the scene from curve which is an interesting place for a stable coin to come out of because it is the source of stable coin liquidity in all of defy so i expect that to be highly competitive not much more to report but that's that's kind of big um we just are going to have to wait and see as curve usd gets uh integrated into the rest of d5 uh binance dot us is launching ethereum staking with six percent api six percent of the merge yeah so the six percent yeah binance binance.us all right so it's the us you're trying to play catch-up obviously with coinbase and others and staking with a six percent apy david that has to be juiced because i know you ain't getting six percent from the protocol right now probably you're getting four percent granted they're only paying there it will be six ish percent post-merge so they're only juicing it for like two weeks ahead of the merger so it's not that ridiculous why they're juicing it in the first place i don't know oh promotion it's just like promotion right yes why would i do coinbase if coinbase is four percent and you know maybe finance is six percent if you're just not really looking carefully at it you just choose the higher apy right but the yield should jump up to at least five point something percent post-merge so they're not juicing it by that much this is kind of cool from notional introducing leveraged vaults from notional what's going on here yeah basically uh you can the way that this works is that a user say for example brings a hundred thousand usdc into notional that gives them a line of credit of up to seven hundred thousand dollars uscc from notional for six percent four percent and then you can combine those two things together to deposit this into this leveraged yield vault so its way to get like 8x on your yield um is like the tldr of this product uh probably some risk but also pretty cool definitely some risk notion of course is uh fixed rate lending and borrowing which is really super cool to have a d5 primitive for that but uh as always with leverage be careful out there guys do not take leverage unless you absolutely know what you do you're doing and a lot of you think you know what you're doing either myself at times you find out that you don't you find out you don't the hard way you get liquidated david on the raises side one thing to cover what are we looking at here miston labs uh is the creator of the sui sui blockchain closes his 300 million dollars raised led by ftx ventures 300 million dollar raise that's not a valuation and the evaluation is two billion dollars what you know we should start a layer one for what would be our price five billion five billion something higher yeah do you know uh this is kind of i've seen like this new crop of fast tps blockchains yeah and you see these kind of every every single cycle right all the time now this is just like yeah well the very first one it was you know eos was you know one of the main ones and then later um i think in future like it was solana now what's interesting is there seem to be three this one uh suey we're saying it pronunciate correctly and there's another one called sei say i think that's maybe how you say that so there's suey say and there's aptos and you're getting a lot of the ftx's and the multi-chain capitals and a lot of the vc firms who are funding at these levels like you know uh two billion dollar market cap um types of of levels so it's just interesting to me because you got a weak question of course your question all the time what is the durable competitive advantage why is the token worth what it's worth as a layer one and um i guess it's the vcs taking on that risk right now i just i always get worried about the the retail dumpage that comes later um without any significant progress on many of these projects and that is what can tend to happen although david i do feel like there probably could be a bankless episode where we explore these projects in some detail i just i want to wait until there's some traction or something to actually talk i'm sure they would love that if we did that well just the fundraise is kind of boring to me it's like what can we do what have you built that's the point at which uh we could get interested but like i don't even know the technology stack i know aptos is using like there's too many ryan there's too many of these suey say aptos like one of these things is going to zero at the very least if not all three so somebody's wasting their money yeah or am i just an ethnoxy or something maybe david maxey what do you think bankless community which of these projects should we be looking at you tell us um jobs david jobs what time is it job time time to get a job last week to get a job before the merge i'm not sure that matters but it's true either way do you think someone could turn around and get a job in like a week's time yeah hit apply if they are a fitting candidate for one of these fantastic jobs that we're about to read out maybe perhaps well i'll read about that economia is looking for a lead product and brand designer what's that david uh non-technical is ryan silent protocol full stack smart contract engineer super foam senior back-end engineer bick green uh full stack software developer masari needs those software engineers for market data and media dydx needs a back-end software engineer steak fish an hr business partner a steak fish also needs a back end a software engineer and a front end engineer a devops engineer and of course bankless is looking for someone to help with media operations go apply for these jobs go get a job before the merge if you can the merch is fine too crypto is always hiring the bankless job boards that's bankless.pallet.com slash jobs you can find out more all right david what do we have coming up next got some questions for the nation this is when we talk about some of the eth pow questions east state questions overall merge related questions because ryan it's of course the last weekly roll up before the merge i don't know if you mentioned that yet but we got to answer all the merge questions uh so we'll talk about that and also the hot and spicy takes from crypto twitter coming up next but first let's talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrarily is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home while d5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage you can now bridge straight into arbitrarily for more than 10 different exchanges including binance ftx kuobi and crypto.com once on arbitrary you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe new to arbitron for a limited time you can get arbitrary nfts designed by the famous artist ratwell and sugoi for joining the arbitrary odyssey the odyssey is an eight-week long event where you complete on-chain activities and receive a free nft as a reward find out more by visiting the discord at discord dot gg slash arbitrary you can also bridge your assets to arbitrarily at bridge.arbitrum.io and access all of arbitram's apps at portal.arbitrum.one in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure crosstrain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across its bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer 2s and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of across the story by joining their discord and using a cross for all of your layer two transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrary or boba networks we are back with the questions from the nation of course if you've got a question for the weekly rollup you can follow at banklesshq on twitter look for that question of the week respond and we may read your question out on the roll up and answer it to the best of our ability the first one is from johnnycast.eth will i receive eth proof of work for the staked eath i have what about if it's staked on a centralized exchange or in an eath staking derivative so this person wants to know johnny cast wants to know if he is getting a fork of the eth pow token should it come he is asking if he's going to receive the eth proof of work token if he has ether staked and if you have ether stake that answer is no no you are not because that ether is in the deposit contract on the ethereum side which is where people deposit ether into the beacon chain the only reason why you deposit ether into that contract is to tell the beacon chain to make you some ether on the proof of sake beacon chain you it's a one-way street it only goes into that contract there's no way to get it out of that contract so all staked ether on the ethereum chain when it goes into the proof of work chain will be irredeemable the proof of work ether will be in that same contract on the proof of work aside but there's no way to get that out so all staked ether is not redeemable for proof of work ether it doesn't matter where you staked it on a centralized exchange or with lido or rocket pool that ether is gone that proof of work ether has gone but to our point earlier guys who cares it's probably it's probably almost nothing it's probably pennies it does make sense for a proof-of-work fork to kind of punish those who staked right and so that's not what it is that's a by-product it's not it's a by-product but like it's kind of um also interesting what's happening what about on centralized exchange then what happens there or staking driven any any stake any supply of staked ether will be irredeemable so they can't give you they won't be giving you anything because they don't have anything to give you the key word is there is staked it's the stake to piece that's right if it is on a centralized exchange right and it's not staked then it's totally dependent on the exchange which and then the exchange yeah that could be months down the road or never um so don't expect much i think if the price moons because people are doing shenanigans they'll enable it then they'll enable it because that because people will desire it yes uh here's another question from matt in the first few hours after the merge is eth proof of work value will receive equal the value of our eath proof of stake so can we double our eath holdings if we exchange the proof of work for the proof of stake as soon as possible this is another question i think there's been a lot of questions right about this new proof-of-work hypothetical chain what's the answer to matt's question here well so we saw the chart earlier that that was doing a futures market for 30 dollars for a proof of work ether you will have the same number of units but the market prices on these things will be totally different uh and so like after armageddon on the roof of work chain happens because all ether positions and make or dow of a compound will be liquidated all tokens on uniswap like mkr ave will be worth zero and so like those people who have those will liquidate those there's going to be like just like y2k on the ethereum beacon chain on the block one two and three after the dust settles then the proof of work ether will have some sort of value determined by the market that will be significantly meaningfully lower than the actual ether real ether proof of stake ether and then if you are sophisticated and you can set up the infrastructure you can sell the proof of work ether can you yeah on polonia x because they say they're going to support it maybe if you could find an exchange you can find an exchange there's not going to be a uniswap yo like it's only going to be centralized exchanges that facilitates somebody decides to kind of pick that up and run like yeah it's going to be really hard to escape from and what we're talking about he here even in the futures market it's like 31 dollars per each basically it's kind of what you'd get i do not think anyone will be seeing a dime i said very excuse me very few people people will see retail like normal highly motivated retail people who are running both a consensus node on the beacon chain and well no actually just any pre a pre looked at the people asking these questions are probably getting nothing yeah if you don't know how to do it you're not getting it i'm sorry the best thing okay if you are a retail and you are super bullish on trying to get that youth proof of work token the thing that i would do even though i'm not recommending you to do this in the first place is to deposit your ether into poloniex because polonia x the exchange even though it's run by a very shady individual justin sun said that they are going to support the ether proof of work chain and so they will do all the service for you so if you are somehow after listening to this magically still bullish on the eth proof of work chain and you don't know how to go do it yourself deposit your ether into poloniex they said that they will credit people their proof of work ether and then you can you can just use them to do it i don't recommend you doing that but that's how you would do it but also don't do it and also just just don't [ __ ] do it sorry for swearing here's a question from henry jk4 this may be basic but with the eath i have when the merch happens will i get new eth or will my existing eth convert to the proof of stake chain can you explain this for me thanks so much for all you guys have been doing been listening for about a year now so what does the average person ignore the eighth proof of workproof and say ignore all of that you're just holding the eath right now and yeah what do you have to do on the other side is there anything that you have to do what happens to your existing eth that you're holding nothing nothing changes remember remember we saw that pie chart there's a 95 percent of validators already that's because like 95 percent of people and it's going to approach 99 are ready to do the hot swap your ether doesn't convert it doesn't change form it doesn't do anything you actually won't even notice anything at all happening whatsoever maybe there will be a blip in ether scan or something ideally or just a blip but just like your ether that you have today is proof of stake ether once we hit post merge so if you're an eth holder what do you have to do nothing nothing if you're a defy user what do you have to do nothing nothing maybe monitor your positions if you're on leverage or something like that sure if you're levered up or doing something like that yeah if you pay some attention if you are a uh uh running a node ethereum node you gotta update well you will have already have an update if you haven't updated your nose you gotta update your notes you're late yeah you're late but not too late well if you're not running a node if you're just an eth holder or a general defy user is not on leverage nothing you have to do it just transfers gracefully you can tune into all of the live streams that's what you can do many many live streams today next week we're doing a lot of those uh we went over the schedule earlier didn't we yes yes we did yeah okay cool schedule all right um takes the week david of the week this is from tim baker who is an eth i guess core developer core coordinator core developer coordinator yeah works with the ethereum foundations the person that made the merge happen yeah him him and danny ryan are like the two people that made the merge happen uh and tim baiko uh that's that's putting too much weight on their shoulders many people made the merge happen tim was a coordinator of many of these people and tim baiko says i've said we might have merged by then twice on the core dev meeting today and it feels pretty surreal to be honest it's happening sparkly emoji really it's really cool take really cool take we're talk we're already talking about just like after the merge the state of things after the merge it's happening so much work to get us here and it's actually happening you know the ethereum community has been waiting for so long for this week to happen and it's actually happening in spite of so many doubters who said the merger happened ethereum there's no way it'll transition to proof of stake it's like replacing an airline engine in mid-air too complicated too difficult challenge accepted it's awesome i get it again knock on wood against the whole like hillary clinton thing this is a tweet from me this week uh you're old but are you old enough to remember this and this is i'm showing an image for if you can't see it on the podcast side you can catch it on youtube this is an image of the original make your dao interface david do you remember when maker looked like this i do remember and i remember experiencing this interface it's being frustrated but also optimistic and then finally figuring out how to mint die for the first time and seeing the dye show up in my wallet and i just i didn't obviously have any like concrete predictions but you could just feel the future it's like no i did not know no unit swap would be a thing but i kind of figured there would be something like it like yes this is automated algorithmic finance by code and this was like my magic like aha moments like i just minted money and no one stopped money i just took out a loan no bank no bank account no paperwork just code and eth transactions it was incredible this this that could you imagine this if all d5 interfaces were like this level of just like clunkiness now i just what i'm what we're looking at is an interface that looks like it it was from i guess 2017 or so 2017 2018 but it looks like it's from the early 2000s i mean it is just it's terrible it's better did the job it needed to do it so this is like the old grandpa david and grandpa ryan saying to you youngsters you got it good kids yeah your guys's interfaces are great they're so good compared to the old days uh they don't even know what peace is they don't even know what peace is p e you say pete i said path i said path p yeah we didn't even have we didn't even have a consensus on whether it's path or oh god remember when people would say f yeah instead of e i hate dark times i hated that your interfaces have gotten much better and the rate at which they are improving makes me so bullish on this space yeah you know if i contrast that to my interface from my bank wells fargo right it's like no change in the last five years so bad but it's basically the same as it was five years ago it's like equally kind of terrible right um what's this take from police says a swap on binance smart chain is five times more expensive than arbitrarily yet binance smart chain has ten times the activity bsc has established clear network effects particularly in eastern markets and roll-up teams have to do their marketing after up their marketing game significantly to out-compete bse their stiffest competition interesting take what do you think about this the idea if plenty goes on to say uh today i learned binance smart chain are building zk roll ups can you imagine running a zk roll up layer 2 on top of binance smart chain and this is plenia who knows what they're talking about really uh not necessarily bullish on binance um like the token behind binance smart chain but certainly like it's establishing it as the one to beat for other layer twos what do you think of this take yeah i heard anthony cesano on the daily grade talk about this and i think uh a lot of this comes down to language as in there might just be more like chinese or english language support of the binance train ecosystem and so it's kind of accidentally become like the ethereum of the east just based off the language barrier i think that actually does account for a very decent amount and just like the raw power of binance has that hat is also big in the east too um i think that's what i think that shocks up to more than more than 50 of the reasoning why binance train is so big i think this is a good message for um layer twos if you want to onboard the world you have to have multi-regional multi-language support right it's a key component of this uh anyway i uh i'd like to do a bit more on you know binance smart chain i'm not super interested in the technology but like the adoption it's had where it's coming from is somewhat interesting to me all right here's another tweet from ryan sean adams who's been super focused on just like reserve currencies and war and all this stuff and so we're going to hear his takes here in a hot sec ryan says reserve currency statuses rise and fall over the decades i expect ethereum to be one of the next ones to rise ryan what are we looking at we are looking at a pie chart over time and the way this begins is at the beginning of the 1900s and we take you back to 1901 when the british pound was 60 percent of the reserve the world's reserve currency do you know a second david the french franc i don't remember that one and then behind that um pound sterling uh no excuse me behind that a deutsche mark and uh there's also a category for others so you know british pound by far the world's monetary the worlds of reserve currency and then this kind of fast forwards through time and you can see the british pound as a percentage of the world it kind of ebbs and flows through world war one through world war ii and we fast forward all the way to even after world war ii in the 1950s the british pound still had like 45 percent oh today i learned right but then the u.s dollar which wasn't even present in 1901 wasn't even on the map for a world reserve uh currency is now 46 of the world's currency and then we fast forward to of course where we are today can you see the british pound anymore on this chart well no well it got folded into the euro folded well it's still present it got oh wait no yeah yeah it's still present right there it's 4.5 it's tiny it's tiny it's 4.5 you got the euro that's 20 and the us dollar that is 61 percent i i think the take here is just when you see this chart over time the fleeting nature of currencies reserve currencies is uh you know something to hold on to and this looks a lot like uh 1901 right right when the british pound was the dominant reserve currency now we're in you know 2022 and the us dollar is about 60 all right david what are you bullish on this week uh ryan i am bullish on the eth btc ratio uh as i have been uh and dj spartan put out a pretty cool tweet that uh talked about uh how much of each btc people that are taking on this trade such as myself will be permanently unwound post merge he says i expect a drop from the people that think it's an airdrop play lmfao but i expect it to be one of the greatest paradigm shifts in hindsight as each goes from a zero to one as a hoarding asset and flows will be one directional and i follow up and i say the point of the eth btc trade is to hold it and like it's not just like a momentary thing because that's how press said on our show with him once we go through the merge time works with ether and against bitcoin because uh with proof of work the theoretical it theoretically approaches 100 of all cell pressure from proof-of-work liners and with proof-of-stake it's the inverse it's the theoretical 100 gets held by proof-of-stake stakers so every single dime of proof-of-work miners gets sold every single penny of ether stakers gets held again on in principle these things are probably more around like 90 um but the that just goes to the contrast is time works with ether and it works against bitcoin and so if you're somebody like myself who's short bitcoin and long ether the point of that trade is that it just works so like people are like super focused on like the flipping rounds like ether is 53 the market cap of bitcoin at some point it'll flip bitcoin i have 100 confidence in this eventually but like the trade is not over there either like once you flip bitcoin you can flip it again like you can lap bitcoin over and over and over again shilling has bitcoin ratio bags to you yes yes i am i'm chilling my trade is like i'll unwind my ether bitcoin trade when ether ethereum is worth like three bitcoins that's a that's a hole forever wow is there is there any like um are you mad at bitcoin at all is there any like vindictiveness in that trade no it's just that it's just it's just the flows it's just the factual flows if proof of work is forced selling and proof of stake is incentivized hoarding this is why this is why a djinn is saying ether goes from zero to one as a hoarding asset and flows will be run directional it's just a fundamental part of the fundamentals i'm not trading narratives jokes i'm trading the fundamentals i've been i've been hoarding this thing for a while i i didn't just start hoarding zero to one ben horton right it's fun you want to hoard ahead of the transition from zero to one ideally um there's still time of course that's what i built oh you know what i'm also bullish on ryan what you know what i'm about to go do after this no you know you know this guy zach weinberg yes i saw a clip with him with um andreessen mark andreessen where uh he's kind of um playing an injurison clip and just like digging into how stupid it is uh andreessen's answer i think on like what web three means so he is this person is uh zach is a web three crypto critic i believe yeah uh right after this i'm about to go into manhattan and debate him on stage at some like vc founders conference that'll be fun i don't i don't think it is i don't think it is but if it is i will definitely tweet it out but yeah me and i was listening to him i didn't hit listen to his uh andreessen clip so i got to go listen to that but i did listen to him going up against packy mccormick yes and like i'm like dude packy you are missing some really low hanging fruit like points here and so i don't think that zach weinberg has gone up against any sort of meaningful competition yet until two hours from now when i smear his face wow i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm super aggressive david just pre-merged david is like just you know i've had i had an extra cup of coffee today it's got the adrenaline watch out exactly i think it'll be good and actually i think if that episode if that goes well sorry i caught an episode if that debate goes well we should host them on bankless sure and uh have kind of a review like another one of that because we need some more critics if he's going to round two all right ryan what are you bullet john who are you debating this week uh i'm not debating anyone if i can help it all right i just want good vibes into the merge right i don't want you know no hassle but you know what i am bullish on or what i maybe this is kind of a thank you this is a gratitude the youth developers right we saw earlier about 120 core developers a lot of eth developers made the merge happen and we know some of them we don't know all of them all right we don't know most of them we don't know most of them and you know particularly kind of you know the silent people been just coding in the background making this happen like sincerely thank you i think the entire ethereum community um has you to thank we can't build this dave and i are here working on the social layer we're users we're building in a different way but like none of this would be possible without the ethereum developers the core developers and i remember a time when they when everyone said no one thought they could do it uh do you remember back in 2018 a lot of the talk was there's not enough protocol there's not enough funding for the devs to actually do this so i don't have any money yeah there's semi-serious propositions to actually add a protocol dev tax inside inside of the protocol to siphon off a portion of this and give it to devs to fund it we uh we did this without critical funding um we did this with frustrating road map pivots do you remember in 2020 was 2018 we were supposed to get proof of stake right we were like months away from forking it in an earlier version of it and um the road map completely changed yeah the better version was in sight so which pivoted towards the better version right what kind of patience does that require to keep uh along with the project you know it's like delayed for another like five years they've been working on this stuff and they did it all without a centralized corporation uh all in this like decentralized open source way and i don't think there's any precedent for what we are seeing like launching a staking protocol like this which is maximally decentralized at scale and converting it in real time with a network that's worth hundreds of billions of dollars in real time and that's what's happening next week i think it's a historic event and i am um bullish and thankful on uh for the ethereum developers and um man this protocol can ship i didn't always know that was true i didn't always believe that but we're doing it now so uh that's what i'm bullish on yeah every single client team has eight 10 20 people on its team that have been working on this and there's like six seven client teams that's not even to account for like all the people at the ef also helping coordinate this thing so like the image that came to mind while you're talking it's just like that the picture of like atlas and they have all the core teams like holding up ethereum like everyone who's ever used ethereum and is bullish on the merge has a core developer to think have you thanked a core developer this week because if you haven't please do we should make that into a meme next week have you thanked core dev yet thank you you know thank you thank you thank you ryan did just now that's what he was doing he was first i feel like there's other things i could be doing but um yeah we appreciate the theorem development community for sure david meme of the week what are we looking at this week uh we're looking at the uh patrick spongebob meme that he's like what if we take this and put it over there uh ethereum miners this is the headline from earlier in the roll-up ethereum miners made 756 million dollars in revenue in august ahead of the merge and patrick the meme goes what if we take the minor revenue and give it to the stakers basically what the ethereum proof-of-stake mechanism is although you do have to take note that you are doing a supply reduction of 90 90 so actually only 10 of the stakers get that but also stakers are holders of eth and so since the miners aren't dumping the eth they get they do get the benefit of not having ether dumped on them by miners so i will say they get the full value of that that's it's true it's what's happening the stakers are the new security budget for ethereum essentially and holders yeah yeah so right i mean this notion of ether as a tokenized asic i think is holding true so that's what's happening next week of course dave and i will be with you all week make sure you tune in to banklesspodcast and on youtube and of course on twitter we'll leave it there none of this has been financial advice ethan's risky d5 is risky so is all of crypto you could
