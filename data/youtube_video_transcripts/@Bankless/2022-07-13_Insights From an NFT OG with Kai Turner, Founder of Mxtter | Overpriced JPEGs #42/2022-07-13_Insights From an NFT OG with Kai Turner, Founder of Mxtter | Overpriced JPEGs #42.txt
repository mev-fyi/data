what's up [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs I am here with my friend my former boss the one and only Kai Turner known as kaigani on Twitter is that your Twitter handle kayani this is my Twitter handle yeah go follow them y'all kaigani uh I'm so excited to have Kai here you have been in this space like in nft since 2017 right like very early days you cracked the crypto kitties genome code so like not just in the space but like a full nerd in this space since the very early days you were also at Netflix for many years you were at Netflix at the time so have a really interesting entertainment background we're gonna get into some entertainment film stuff here during this conversation um you founded me bits Dao which may seep into the conversation a little bit though it's not the focal point and you are the founder of matter which we're going to talk a bunch about today I've talked about it on this program before and and an executive producer on uh new here executive producer on new here um yeah I mean it feels like many many lifetimes in the nft space that I have to say well I I I'm missing all sorts of projects you've dabbled in because you just have been in this space for so long and are like an excellent like doer like you just are creative and constantly getting your hands in in all sorts of different facets of

the bear Market of what 2018 2019 what are your tips what is your biggest tip for surviving a bear so the biggest tip is not making the mistake I made last time so I was at um I was at Sony pictures at the time and I was pitching lots of projects and really excited about the space this was following uh having having gotten involved in the crypto kitties community and and sort of getting a little bit of uh attention for having cracked the uh the genetic code uh and was really excited about nfts in general and was pitching projects and then when the when the bear Market hit uh I kind of put everything on the back burner and and then but I stayed involved in the community and I eventually got re-engaged with uh folks with advising Jimmy as avastars was coming out and projects like that and was still excited about it all along um but I didn't really get Hands On Again probably until 2019 so I was always just sort of collecting and dabbling in the in the you know just keep keeping abreast in things and really still equally excited about what was going on but I'd pushed my timelines out like five years I was like oh we'll give you know be five years before this ever comes back around and gets the sort of attention that you know you can pitch projects to a Sony or to a Netflix uh and in some ways that timeline is still kind of true um but what I wish I had done in the last bear Market is continue to build those projects you know like game ideas and all sorts of things that I wanted to build uh that I just put on hold until the market came around again and the people that did build through it like Jimmy with avastars and all the other folks and you had you know the sort of I remember when crypto so you could you could buy crypto punks very cheaply and and I didn't didn't think it made sense at the time I mean the people that that kept that same level of activity as well as enthusiasm through the last bear Market are the you know became the leaders of the of the you know nft movement when it came back around so that's that's you know I'm not the first to say that but it doesn't feel like it when you're in the middle of it and especially if this is your first bear it feels like you know the worst thing in the world um but it will come back uh you know when it comes back is is Up For Debate but I think if you can uh sort of get in a position where if you're a collector you continue to sort of look for the project teams that are going to make it uh and collect and if you're a builder that you continue to just hopefully buckle down and build and you know I have some ideas around how projects that don't have that amount of Runway are gonna hopefully survive um but you know it could be some tough times but the folks that get through are going to you know be the leaders of the next uh the next round I guess you said you thought it was going to be five years before it came back around and you just said you think that timeline in some ways is still true what do you mean by that yeah well in in 2017 you know I was thinking five years until it had the kind of mainstream attention so in some ways you know you can look at 2021 as the the Breakthrough I mean the I guess I was gauging in terms of when could you tell your parents about nfts and they would understand what you're you know they'd heard about it before they understand what you're talking about um so that kind of happened last year which from 2017 you know I thought you were saying from 2019 was when you thought it would be five years ago no no in 2017. oh so you nailed it most people I feel like under like overestimated thought it was going to take much longer than it did even those who were who were into it in 2017. yeah so I was I was sort of right about that um but actually I was off by maybe a year and a half because I didn't think uh I didn't think it was going to break through in 2021 like I would have put it towards the end of 2022 as you know maybe it gets enough attention but then you had things like Top Shot come along and then you had uh you know the art movement and people and art blocks and all these other things which I think accelerated yeah the discovery of those things and the stimulus checked and all of that which facilitated the adoption there and just like the emphasis on digital in general right is the era of Degen trading and by that I mean like just becoming a millionaire overnight flipping a jpeg is that over do you think uh probably not but it's not I mean it I would say it probably should be uh I don't think it's healthy so I have a few thoughts on that I mean one is more related to what I'm working on which is how how do you justify uh an nft being worth a million um the other is just you know flipping for the sake of flipping I mean I I sort of got my start of you know I'm friends with folks like Frank C and and you know Jim and Nate Alex I mean Carlini and all these folks like flipping I mean that's a fun part of the market is to be speculative um but I think the the extent to which flipping happened I mean I I remember in in the early days we would flip projects or we would we would speculate on projects but there was always something underneath it that felt unique that felt Innovative uh so you felt like you were backing something that maybe it didn't it didn't pan out or maybe there was a game that just you know flopped um but you felt like you were getting behind something that wasn't just you know oh I think lots of other people I mean that's that's really getting sort of Ponzi mindset lots of other people are going to buy this so I'm going to buy this and then I'm gonna try to flip it and time it uh so I hope that that kind of dies a death and I hope that we get to the point like we did with you know in the last phase you had you had it was the uh kind of tokens and the icus icos rather uh so you have these icos that were going to do everything under the sun and people were backing them and then as you got further along in the bubble then it was just a hint that there was going to be successful or you had uh you know uh what was it like Floyd May forget his name Merryweather boxer yeah the boxer would like like he's like the the uh you know one of the four horsemen of the of the bus cycle when when you see him come in and say that he's backing an Ico it's like that was before the crash and I think he came out behind some nfts and then right before the nft market crashed it's like uh people were just seeing any celebrity who attached their name to the market uh that was the project to get into rather than you know was there a team behind it what was the team gonna do and I think we got to a similar place in the nft space where anyone proposing something that looked frothy and bubbly people wanted to throw money into just with the hopes of flipping it and not even thinking about you know what is the what is the project meant to be or what is it meant to deliver uh so I hope that that part of the market does die a death in in this bear uh and I hope we get back to real value and where I think real value I mean I think you can get true valuations of whatever six-figure nfts but I think it has to be tied to um some sense of profit sharing or Equity related to IP which is sort of where what I focus on we are definitely going to get into that because I I share your vision there but it also makes me nervous in terms of will we ever get to where we want to be staying on this bear Market theme though for just a few minutes more are you buying through the Bear right now like are you I know you're building but are you looking to pick up uh nfts right now I'm I'm buying some things probably I don't really have a strategy to it like um a bunch of us uh just started talking about uh is it Metro verse is like this this sort of game that just started so I bought a bunch of I hadn't had any before so I got a bunch of metaverse to to join up with some other folks to um build the city uh so I'm kind of dabbling in stuff that again getting back to like what's interesting to me um and and you know thinking about the fun of it more than you know do I think I'm going to make a return on it uh so I'm still I'm still buying things but I'm not I'm not yet looking for uh you know like Market opportunities or trying to time the bottom um yeah this I mean that that I don't really speculate that way anymore because I didn't get any sleep when I did so I just mentioned games Metro verse and I remember when I was first looking at axi and axi was getting really big and popular you were one of like the Skeptics in my life being like I don't know I'm kind of skeptical of this and I've seen this game I've seen this before because we've seen games not work in the past do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts or thesis around blockchain gaming yeah so it's interesting because I saw a lot of people last year got excited about blockchain gaming and they went around for there was actually a big surge in blockchain gaming maybe I want to say 20 2019 early 2020 um where I got heavily involved there was a crypto space commanders was was a game that that lots of folks were excited about and they had the Star Trek license and everyone thought that was going to be you know I mean it's funny because people are still pitching the same concept of like it's going to be an open world where uh the the players decide the economy and you'll hear that come up again and again and you know projects talk about like a space game that players decide the economy and it's going to be the the new space game that everyone wants to get into but crypto space commanders did this they did a pretty good job in my uh sort of thesis at the time was again what people repeat now with blockchain gaming is like I don't know if I'm gonna make money from it I didn't get into it with the goal to make money but maybe I can play for a good amount of time and at the end of which I can cash out my assets and at least sort of make back what I put in or make back a little bit less than I put in so it's like subsidize your experience yeah yeah been playing you know like if you were playing a sport if you're if you're you know taking up skiing and then you you sell your skis at the end of it or you you know something like that you sell your equipment off and you recoup some of your some of what you invested and you had fun playing the game along the way um I think that's that's a POS you know possible model that I can get behind I haven't seen anyone pull that off but I can understand it um you could map it to something like World of Warcraft where people invest in their in their gear and you can imagine that there's a value and there is you know people trade this way now for for in-game items so I can see something where it's more like um a market that that uh where your the value slightly depreciates of your things but I don't understand this idea of play to earn I don't sort of believe in it because I think it's it's I can't see any way that that adds up uh or any any way that you can sort of think that process through that doesn't turn out to be uh like a Ponzi Dynamic you don't think there's a world where there are people who like the very upper echelons of players are in fact able to sell their in-game assets or or have earned things by being really good in such a way that they are able to earn on a regular basis from it I don't I don't see it I mean I I mean maybe you could extrapolate out to some kind of content creation but I I guess what I look for is like where is the value creation and I don't I don't see I mean you know I guess some models are like well you don't want to be there doing the the grindy sort of gold farming type activity so you Outsource that to people who who do want to do it but how long are they I mean I don't think anyone's going to get into that uh I mean are we talking about like digital Fife Dums I mean does no one wants to be the sort of laborer in the in the fields forever I mean presumably they want to get to the point that you're at where if they've been playing for three years they're controlling the the estate uh or they having a state of their own so so that means that they're then going to have to look for a new crop of you know laborers so it still turns into that same Dynamic of you need people uh you know at the top of the funnel coming into the system for it to work well in theory the play experience could be just as fun you know on the the bottom or the top and it's just a matter of like have you gotten good enough to whatever have the cool skin kind of like you know fortnite style or something yeah yeah I mean it but isn't that just kind of like selling off I mean so I played a few games I only I'm only skeptical because I've been down this path a few times where it gets so grindy that as a new player you find you know I've been playing 60 hours and I've got like the the copper armor and the copper armor is actually worthless because the the people who have got in from day one and you know they're on to like the mithril armor that they that you have to grind away for like thousands of hours to get so it's like you're always catching up and and that's just not a it's not a fun experience I think whenever you tie value to the in-game items like that you're just always gonna feel like you're behind and there's always going to feel like there's a rather than fun there's a fundamental grind behind what people are doing um yeah I have I am a relatively sympathetic to the argument that when you can earn money off of something it psychologically changes the experience so much that it no longer is a game and for escape but you can't help but to to think about optimizing for money and that that just really changes the dynamic of the game uh well anyway I won't this is not the point of this episode but I you were kind of an early player and skeptic in my ear and and I always value your thoughts on it because you have seen so much in this space as it is uh last question on this bear Market how long do you think it'll last you predicted it well in 2017 I would say yeah I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not going to pretend that I'm any kind of you know insight into into you know accurate predictions but uh I think what I I I'm feeling now like people have to prepare for 36 months in terms of if you're thinking about your how what will it take for your project to survive I'm I'm hopeful that uh well I'll be looking for signs at the end of the summer because Summer the market tends to be a little bit slower anyhow um so I'd like to see something happen at the end of the summer that that looks positive uh I'm reassured by looking at projects like Doodles I mean it seems like there is still uh you know some maybe it's all internal still I mean so we're always looking for what will be the next event like Top Shot like the friends that will bring new people into the market that will expand the market um so I think it could be as early as I mean it depends also what we're saying what are we getting back to um but I think signs of life I think should be returning by the end or hopefully we'll be returning by the end of this year but I think if you're running a project you need to be thinking about a 30 to 36 month sort of Horizon and how do I survive for 36 months you can't say oh we're going to do a token sale in January and that's going to give us our next bit of funding that will help us make it through because I don't think that's going to work you can't rely on the same funding mechanisms and the sort of cheap flowing cash that we've had up to this point yeah there have been a number of products you mentioned projects you mentioned Doodles but I think even board Apes is holding up pretty well I mean other side land is doing well you have even like Pro you know Goblin towns still at like 3E Suzuki's like a lot of these there are a lot of projects that I think are doing really well and one that stands out is Art blocks because this will take us right to matter you are an art blocks artist oh my gosh I didn't mention that as part of Europe you're an art box artist um and I feel like art blocks has also really thrived uh relative to other projects during this Market do you buy into art blocks these days or or you're like enough just as as an artist and selling your work so I haven't I haven't um been collecting uh you know again I've sort of slowed down my collecting in general I still have a number of uh early art blocks projects that I'm holding um but I mean that's related to like what did we do last bear Market as well like last bear Market we continued to look for artists and and sort of support Art For Art's Sake and not not for the uh even even when people were flipping and doing uh you know speculative speculative type uh of buying in the market they were buying art more than the sense of like buying pfps and uh you know their Collectibles but Collectibles might be related to games but um but yeah that's sort of what we lost sight of was uh you know just the interest in the art and and that's what um like when when we found it matter that I was looking ahead past the pfp market regardless of the the ups and downs it was like what happens after pfps well I think we get back to the art I think we get back to generative art which you know know art blocks has been instrumental in leading the way and putting the attention on generative art but I think um you know in the early conversations like all this came out of what we were working on with Nate Alex and svgs on chain with Jim Jimmy and uh avastars and that to me always felt like you know this is 2019 that always felt like uh the real essence of the medium is is like using um well I like to talk about generative art as it's like the the artist and the and the collector uh kind of coming together to create a work of art like the artist creates this template and creates the recipe for the art but then it's the collector that at the time of minting uh kind of instantiates and creates this work of art so so that I think is what's unique about art on the blockchain um and and that's what I think you know we're going to see more of moving forward so let's talk about matter this is a project that was initially incubated through block block you and I both worked there and so I was a part of some of the origins of matter and when it was first kicking off it was it had this concept of like art blocks Meats nounsdao like it was a generative art platform but it would have this ongoing auction feature where funds would go into a dow treasury I think the strategy on matter has shifted since I was uh involved can you explain to folks like where it is today and what's going on with it now yeah so what I was born out of was um wanting to work with some of the artists that that are my friends and that I've encountered in the space and we wanted to do projects together uh so we came up with an idea for a platform so how could we differentiate how could we do something that's different than art blocks a lot of it was built on my my experience with art blocks and and seeing uh you know art blocks does generative art in its style very well but I was curious about how do you how do you get artists that are working in different styles so like layered you know photography Rich imagery um uh that can't that isn't just programmatic like how do you get them working in in the generative Art Space uh and we've seen some of that through through you know kind of very a very narrow take on it through the pfps um but you know I talked to folks like Garen Mendez Mendez who who had their own projects and their own generative art projects and they they wanted to come together and do a concept around test prints so that that's eventually that eventually became our first project is our um but in terms of the the tokenomic model behind it there was always an idea that it launched as a as a platform and a dow that would support artists and and you know we wanted to capture the same lightning in a bottle as nouns now so we thought you know we could have a Perpetual auction and people love Perpetual auctions and look at the treasury that nounsdown has and wouldn't that be great to have that to fund Argus with but I think we found found and one of our friends you know Jonathan Mann sung a day man has also done the same and it's actually for I don't know well I know a little bit about what now it's now did to to do that successfully but it's not a model that looks like you can recreate it uh and we had some successful so we ran two auctions for for our two drops um that ran for 14 days and they were successful but we did notice there was a sort of sense of diminishing return so it's not something that we could do uh again and again and repeat like it's getting harder and harder with each one uh even maintaining it 14 days like we did it over uh I think a holiday for the second one and that was just like a real grind for the team to try to let everyone know because there's no there's no real easy way in web 3 this is another point I make a lot which is like web3 lacks some of the some of the stuff we have in web 2 which is like we can't let people know that there's a new auction very easily so it's like we always have to do the work on socials like there's another auction today and we didn't really have the message that or people that didn't really absorb uh the message that announced out people have absorbed which is that there's a daily auction for 14 days and maybe I don't know if we had set it up in a way that we were just running through the year if that if anyone would have gotten it I don't I don't think so so just seemed like as a Perpetual auction model um that was just too difficult to sustain but Underneath It All the idea was we want to bring together artists to do collaborative uh generative art in an experimental format so getting them to to like this is the lab where they do things that they wouldn't normally do that pushes them outside of what they're used to by collaborating together so we had Garen Mendez Mendes work on a project then we had wax bones and rombrandt worked together on a project and it's just exciting to see them merge their Styles and push push into a new form altogether so that's the heart of what we're trying to do and we're continuing to do the other side of it was wanting to support up-and-coming artists so really the vision has always been that we want to get to the point where we're collaborating with an artist that might be a well-known artist that could bring in an audience and a lesser-known artist so they could you know learn from this well-known Artist as well as sort of benefit from having a joint collaborative project so that we're continuing to do but I think it's just the nature of how we're funding the underlying Dow and how we're funding artists is what's changing where the shift is happening okay so let me let me see if I can say this back to you the generative art platform piece remains relatively the same and I want to say a note on that because I thought this was so cool I still think this is cool when I've talked about this on the show it's it's uh first and foremost been sort of about that piece of things I'm bullish on generative artists people know and I think like generative Art summer or whatever right like I feel like that this is we're in a a an important era for generative art and with art blocks you have to be fairly proficient with code in order to actually be an art blocks artist so you need to not only be be creative and artistic but also be like computer code Savvy and you saw that and we're like there's all these artists who maybe don't have the computer coding chops but want to be in on this generative art movement and they create their art via layers like on a I don't know Adobe that's not right but there's something they're platforms for the stuff they're tools and um and so why don't we create a generative art platform that can allow them to put their layers in and then out will come you know randomly combined assets or whatever and it'll be generative in that capacity do I have that is that a good way to explain that yeah so and and so we we so that technology we did build and that was sort of the original emphasis before you know I've spun it up from blockbot um but the original emphasis was we were building a platform and the pitch to artists was uh Photoshop so you had it you're pretty much artists are familiar with working in Photoshop and and the pitch the artist was well imagine if you're doing a piece of art in Photoshop and let's say you're just trading that back and forth with your your collaborative partner uh and you're all you're exchanging layers you're you're you know sort of riffing on each other's layers uh imagine if that photoshop file could be something that is uh you know where you could also put these generative rules into it so if you wanted to say well let's vary the the sort of uh transparency on this layer and do different things or let's out of this set of this folder of five layers two choose one if this folder of layers choose another one and have that be you know an overlay on the underlying layers or have it be like a multiply effect or anything that you can do in Photoshop so that was the idea for for the platform we were building and we do we built that as a base technology so we we have that as uh as what we can use for future projects but one thing that's trained is that we've moved away from thinking like I'm thinking of it more as a almost as a digital gallery now uh and and with me playing the role of a of a gallerist uh rather than building a platform and that that we need to build something that's going to be like a piece of technology that that will hopefully you know I don't know that maybe we want to sell off in some time because I think what that has allowed us to do is open up what we can you know we're no longer limited by uh having artists conform to this underlying you know the technology we're still building with each project as well but we're not trying to build towards an end goal like the next you know I'm talking to we're doing Seasons now for matter and one of the seasons I'm talking to a group that I I've been advising called sound obsessed and you know working with these great folks that are are doing like uh you know AI generated music and collaborating with AI um and Gans and all sorts of stuff that is even over my head uh but they're doing some amazing work that's you know a collaboration between Music Creation and and participating with the underlying AI generative technology and that's the sort of thing that we we couldn't build into that own that old system but we can do a project around that now because we'll just create like a brand new bespoke piece of technology for fit for purpose for for what we want to do that season um so it gives us more flexibility to try new things and to sort of stay on The Cutting Edge of experimental because even in with matter what we were doing that was maybe Cutting Edge at the time with this like you know generative Photoshop style technology others have caught up with that and there are other other people that are doing similar things so rather than trying to build a platform it's like looking for what's what's the latest most exciting thing like I'm playing with mid-journey a lot and and you know everyone's talking about Dali uh you know maybe we could what could we use the form of uh technology like that and just you know get artists to to put their spin on what they would want to do with that that type of underlying technology or if we want to work with video or if we want to work with animation it's kind of frees us up to have a theme for a given season and we can pretty much do whatever we want within that there's so much to unpack there I'm gonna start at the beginning I was taking notes as you were speaking on the on different things I want to go a little deeper on I want to just make the point around you were describing what the the generative platform side does what that technology does and how that interacts with Photoshop and really just want to emphasize for folks who haven't dug deep into this like how much Artistry is involved and what what a puzzle it is to put together a generative piece of art where you have to make sure like to make a piece of work look good when it randomly comes out of an algorithm the moment an artist or the moment a user mints it is really challenging and there's a lot of puzzle pieces that you're trying to fit together there I mean Tyler Hobbs and fidenzas fidenza is one of the most famous you know generative pieces or generative Works to come out of this era and probably will be for many decades to come and part of it was that he had both a tremendous amount of variety in in the art that was produced but it was all really high quality and getting that balance is really hard and I think there's still people maybe can't wrap their head around like like generative art the the skill or the craft of it um and it's one of the reasons I think probably in the global Art Market it's it's still probably undervalued in many ways because folks don't really understand it's craft I think in some ways um so I wanted to note that and then when it comes to this shift that you're talking about so it sounds like now it's it almost sounds like a Marketplace and it's it's like a curated marketplace where some folks will have used this underlying Tech that you're developing and and others are really just you're showcasing their work and their collaborations with others and and it's really about collaborations being highlighted on it is is that a fair way to phrase it or is Marketplace not really the worst marketplaces it really is a gallery in the sense that uh you know I want to focus on the the artists and uh you know I'm I'm new you know I don't have a background as a gallerist uh but I've been sort of studying that as a as a analog to what it sounds like I I am doing is kind of a curator of this space um because I think what what a gallery will do is it'll bring on artists to show you know so they'll have a an exhibition of an artist which is effectively like when we do a drop so if we do a collaborative drop that's that's showing an artist that's that's our presenting a pair of artists to the world and and a lot a big part of what we did with matter was also going behind the scenes and talking about you know what was the background of this artist uh because I was seeing again looking at the space and I felt like you could see a lot of artists work but you never saw their story and and in the traditional our world so much about the art is the the story of the artists in their process and like their their inspiration and like what they're actually trying to do with their art um so I wanted to bring that out through matter as well um and and I think we're gonna kind of double down on that moving forward so it's more about um making sure that we're you know so this this summer what we're doing is we're giving grants out to up and coming artists uh so it's really about identifying artists and helping them uh sort of feel more secure in the space especially with the you know this is in response to the we're calling it artist summer in response to nft Winter because uh you know we want to help artists sort of make their way through the winter and if they're any up and coming artists that were you know starting to dip their toe into the nft space and now they're like well maybe I can't you know maybe I need to take that agency job or I need to find you know other other types of work hopefully we can help them stay in the space and continue to be artists in the space um so that's the emphasis for the summer and I think as a viewing matter as a gallery it's like that's the responsibility it's like we're we're thinking more about the artists and we're thinking more about how we can show their work online but even to follow their story over time so I think it's really putting artists at the center rather than a platform or Marketplace at the center so they'll work when you do a drop of an artist is sale right so it's it's through first which I think is why at my head went Marketplace but of course a gallery work is also for sale it's just it's for a season to your point so it'll be for sale and then after that drop has sold out you'll buy it on other ongoing marketplaces that that's really how you see it so it's not an ongoing marketplace where I can always go back and buy that artist's work but it's a gallery where I can go in and browse for uh you know the period of time before it's been sold out for example or before the season ends right and I so I I spent I also spent a lot of time on sound XYZ and I really like that as a platform for music so a lot of the inspiration comes from there where they you know they have their Seasons they focus on on the individual artists and their drops but then after that it's it's left up to the secondary marketplaces you know so that direct you out to the marketplaces after the drop uh to Carry On from there one of the interesting mechanisms when this was more of like a nouns down model with ongoing auctions you know 14 day auctions and then one bigger auction at the end of that for for each artist was a significant portion of proceeds went to the artists themselves a significant portion went to then this Dow that would help to support artists how does that work now with drops have you all is the model the same so it's evolving in the sense that we're still we're still going to have drops and we're still going to have a sort of split that favors the artists in our in our drops um but for the Dao it's going to be slightly different in that where before we had this uh initial 14 exclusive items that were these auctioned items and then the auctioned items became Dow membership uh where we're doing a partnership with seasons and seasons are the is it szns oh yeah which sounds like Seasons from the it sounds like yeah yeah exactly yeah partner with seasons scns.io and that that's a group that I work with um you know we raised a million dollars with the mbbt uh album which was a collection of me bits um and I want to do a similar model except have the funds uh dedicated to the funds raised will be dedicated to reinvesting into the r art up and coming artists community so how how that will work is we're going to have a period of uh where collectors will put their artwork that will be valued and put into this collection so this album as it's called in in s you know Seasons CNN NS they put their collection into the album that that collection is then given a value of the the native token and then the remainder of those tokens will go to uh will be put on sale so any any additional funds will be uh you know will go into the into the treasury raised from this token sale this is kind of ongoing token sale so that that becomes a new model and we're going to move the existing dial members over to this you know we'll give them some of the tokens for for their existing Dow membership uh but that's really going to become the model for the Dow and then artists that we would fund out of that that treasury uh would do their work would then go back back into the collection so they might you know they might get a so we're doing 12 artist grants for 2500 over the artist summer uh part of that will the will result in one of one either commission or a one of one piece of work from that artist to go back into this Collective treasury so uh the idea is that you know people will initially fund this collection uh and then over time hopefully we're we're starting to discover artists that you know we're finding their their initial pieces so so I was you know I did something similar for uh black nft month which I've been doing every black history month for for two years now uh and just happened to you know the first year I did it I found I got one of the first pieces of um uh IXL zixo yard who you know has gone on to be a really you know well-known generative artist so the idea is the theory is that we would do similar things with this art fund uh while we're funding up and coming artists you know we're going to discover uh the occasional big name just just because we're as we're collectively going out and looking at the artists that we think have promised and we're we're uh collecting their work so in time the fun the album confront itself and we can you know continue to sustain itself by you know it'll sell off if one of the piece is suddenly valuable it might sell that that piece off return the funds to the treasury and then that gives us an additional uh funding for future artists I want to explain this model or have you break down this model a little bit more because I I think it's brilliant and I'll I'll explain the mbbt model because I was around and he did that and it like blew my mind at the time I was like oh my God this is so cool so mbbt is uh a token that has been issued through szns.io seasons.io we'll just say dot IO to reflect that um and it was something you did through me to style where you got me but style Founders to not donate because they were rewarded for this but to give some other mebits these were some like big knee bits whales including yourselves and others to give me bits to this pool all these knee bits were pulled together and I'm gonna use some hypothetical numbers here these were not the right numbers but like it was like 50 worth of me bits right that were given to this pool and then you created these mbbt tokens worth a hundred dollars off of that pool you gave 50 of mbbt tokens back to the folks who gave the original me bits to one-to-one compensate them for the mebits they donated and then you had 50 mbbt tokens left that you were sitting on you sold those remaining 50 mbbt tokens and with the proceeds of those of that sale you then went in and bought the equivalent of like 50 more 50 mbbt more or 50 more of me bits so that the total value of that pool still ended up being a hundred dollars which was what you initially valued it at right I don't know if when you verbalize this I don't know if this makes sense to people I tried to like break that down real slow because I do think this is like a it's like it's kind of weird when you're verbalizing it yeah I mean I think it's basically you the fund was valued on the future uh value of the value of the members that we we hadn't purchased yet so so you know we raised we raised a million dollars and then we bought a million dollars of me bits or or we we supplemented the the however many bits we had to begin with so that the the total was still worth a million dollars so it um it the idea was uh of course you know tokens never behave rationally but the idea was that the tokens uh should always just be kind of a one-to-one uh mapping to the underlying album value and there's interesting interesting development development on that where they went way above the value and the others below the value um and we're working on Arbitrage opportunities yeah we're actually creating that that uh the ability to Arbitrage that more directly because it's currently the the value is there but it's locked um but uh but yeah the next the next phase we're going to announce soon is that you'll be able to trade back and forth uh mbbt and get a me bit out of the pool uh so that should bring things level um so that's a little bit of I don't think it's Alpha because I've been talking about it a lot on Twitter but knowing the market doesn't seem to to realize is mdbt undervalued right now yeah yeah it is um so can you explain to me because even me understanding the mbbt I I still haven't quite wrapped my head around how you just described it was going to work for this style so you have art I understand the underlying assets the equivalent of the me bits in this case are going to be works from artists is that right right yeah so the valuation is going to be a little bit more difficult because previously with me bits we could just say people mostly donated floors uh you know we had a couple of people that donated uh premium me bits so we came up with a valuation based on the relative floor of those premium events um but that was easy enough to to find a value you can just go to the secondary Market um I think for the valuation of of the art that people contribute we're gonna have to use uh more uh sophisticated model so it might be and and you know maybe there's a sort of judgment call to be made by the the Dao so maybe we sort of collectively agree on evaluation of the the contributed art but I think it's going to be a it's going to factor in uh what the the purchase price was uh maybe what the artist's current uh Arts other other pieces of art is are valued at or or have been trading for so we're gonna there's gonna be more Nuance to it because you you won't just be be able to you know one of one art is a lot less uh you know even though nft liquid yeah or I mean they're semi they're semi-fungible in the sense that lots of people watch the floor for for uh you know 10K collections but yeah one of one art that's going to be a little bit more of a judgment call to arrive at a fair value but the basic premise is let's say you know we we're saying the fund is a million dollars we're going to try to give everyone their fair value their fair share of that Fund in this token and then the artists who contribute their artworks the artists who contributed the artworks and the collectors who contribute the initial uh collections so we're gonna have a initial contribution round where people can say right I'm going to take some of my collection I'm going to put it into this this album and I'll get some once you once we agree on evaluation I'll get the that share of token will be sent back to me and then the rest of it will be raised in in the token cell got it and then the the proceeds from that token sale will be used to to invest in upcoming artists new artists new artworks and that's the dynamic you're describing where yeah yeah it's you feel like it's likely you'll happen upon you'll you'll probably buy some veteran artworks and then you'll happen upon newer artists who may end up being something and really driving value for the the piece yeah so so again it's like if we buy off of secondary if we buy a pizza one of one for one each then then again that that value you know all you've done is exchange the value raised you know the the if we raise from the token sale for the peace the physical piece of art um which you know may you know food chosen wisely will go up in value um or we've invested in an up-and-coming artist and we said that we're asking them to commission a one-of-one piece of art for the equivalent of an East and in which case it's you know there's more subjectivity and there's more like it comes down to working with the right artists and supporting the right artists but um but yeah I think it's less the the it's less looking at is this a an amazing investment it's more is this something that we should be doing to help the the sort of digital art space and to help artists sustain themselves especially through the nft winter how are you determining who can contribute Works what works get contributed I guess that ties to a broader question around your pipeline of of curation in general yeah I mean that's that's a Hot Topic right now so right now we're kind of migrating over the the existing Dao members so we have voting and non-voting members from the existing Dao uh getting them into the new Discord uh which I think you know will have announced um so matter.art is going to be the the sort of MX um so that that'll be the The Source where you know you'll be able to find a new Discord at the time that this goes out um so we're moving people over to the new Discord that will be you know the existing dial numbers will be the core uh you know working group that will start to think through this from there extending to uh artists that I'm in contact with either through ART blocks or just through my general network uh and seeing who who feels as passionately about helping up and coming artists as I do and who wants to get involved and wants to lend uh initially we're going to focus on this um you know this grant to 12 artists so that'll be our way to dip our toe into how do we how do we create these grants and whatever criteria for giving out grants um and then outside of my immediate Network we have the network of the film which you know we you can you can start to talk about but the film is spoken to uh lots of names through the space and you know we have a what would have been a Rolodex in back in the day but we have a you know a good network of artists through that side of things too so we might start to uh reach out to those folks as well to see who wants to participate in helping to give out artist grants there is a brand new staking feature in The Ledger Live app today we all like staking

funding the Dow and that's going to be providing opportunities for for upcoming artists and helping to support artists during this time in the space and tie for me now then then that you're going to have these seasons s-e-a-s-o-n-s and these drops that happen on your website well that also partly go to fund this Dao over time so the the drops will go primarily to the artists so we want to so we're probably gonna have more of a separation between the the Dow you know the Dow the Dow will continue to play a role in terms of uh our criteria for selecting the artists um but I think we're going to move the Dow more fully over like participating in the Dow will be a a a a function of participating in this in this fund and through the new token that we're going to be issuing um but the joining the Dow uh will come out of that and then the drops will will just be purely uh going back to the artist and going back to the you know matter as an organization so this all ties to this topic that you're super super passionate on which is how can artists create sustainable careers in this space and that's really hard like there are artists who relative to most people who try and get into nfts were really successful over the last year or 18 months and they were able to sell pieces for 1000 thousands of dollars or you know the equivalent in each and it's still not enough money for them to you know just like rest on their Laurels on you know many of them probably looking at all right I gotta go back to being a contractor do agency work so how are you thinking about this and how are you advising both both artists and I think projects you were saying projects just need to survive 36 months is what you're telling them how are you recommending the folks that they go about trying to do that yeah so this this came out of last year when I was I was looking at you know how people were behaving and and you know I I sort of made a song and dance about leaving Netflix and going full-time web3 uh but you know this is after a 25-year plus career in in you know working in Tradition more traditional ways uh and then I see some people that are coming out and saying I'm full-time web three they're full-time nfts and and you know there they've had maybe an art drop or something and and you know have made some some level of success off of it I'm like that's I don't know how you're gonna do that like I don't know how you're going to sustain yourself uh especially with you know anticipating that the the bear Market was coming um so I think you know maybe some people if generous uh you know I don't know what percentage like you can imagine the top 10 of the artists will be comfortable through the through the next 36 months but I have to imagine that most uh artists won't be and even a larger portion of artists were probably just sort of waking up to the market at the end of last year uh and are maybe just getting going when suddenly they're being hit by the bear and and don't really know where to go from there so so it's it's sort of a it was a question I had last year when I was sort of looking at how are people going to do full-time you know become full-time artists but it became more relevant this year and this is why I sort of moved matter more squarely into let's give away some grants for the summer um is because I don't I don't know that I have an answer to that yet but I know that you know we can start to to help artists um by buying their art you know hopefully through the winter and then hope then if with matter at least if the uh you know we'll continue to see is there a market for people to to buy our generative drops as they as they find out about them and continue to fund the artists that participate in that um but yeah on a macro scale I hope it's just you know the the nft community returning to Value the art and the artists um over the speculative side because I think you know what what goes into even my my friends at Doodles like if you look at what they raised uh you know compared to like what is very meaningful to a lot of artists I mean those are often two different scales and and you know what what could go into a speculative drop could could fund maybe 20 artists for the next year so that's I think it's like it would be nice to rebalance our our priorities a little bit growing up and really until I hit this space I feel like I thought about art as things that like rich people cared about like it it didn't feel like an accessible thing for the people you know it was like and I'm curious if you think that that's changing and that if that nfts and what they were changing that where the younger generation will become art collectors in a way that I don't think of my generation doing without web3 or if people were really just here for the money and this is not some great art Renaissance well I mean I think I can compare it to my own Journey like I I'm someone that sort of moved from uh you know generative art was always something that I did as a Pastime and I wouldn't even have called myself a an art collector prior to nfts you know I had like the odd uh poster I mean I mean I had a print Jamie Hewlett print that I picked up in shortage when I was living in Britain like I had the odd thing that I would pick up and I had you know aspirations to one day have a bigger art collection um but getting involved in nfts sort of accelerated my uh by getting the Digital Collection in place you know it spilled over to now I have all these rolls of of posters because I've bought physical prints at a you know I got the the Damien Hurst that uh that that you know he put out and so I think it does you know it kind of moved me into uh so I was always kind of an aspirational collector and it sort of made me realize uh that I could start being an actual collector sooner uh then maybe you know it always seemed like this thing that yeah you do have to have you know a certain amount of wealth before you can become a collector you do have to wait I think it broke that down uh and made it by by making it that much more immediate in the fact that you can just go out and get a piece of digital art uh you it sort of opens your eyes to the fact that well you can get physical art you can get you know it's it's not this thing that is relegated to uh sort of snooty galleries that you have to you know be on the inside to even get a look in on on being able to get a piece it's like it is more accessible now and and you know my Twitter stream is transformed where it's like now full of great art because I'm following all these artists and I think before that was just I wouldn't necessarily know where to look for for digital artists or you would have to go sort of hunting around through I don't know deviantART or all these random sites to maybe find a little bit of art here and there um so I think it is changing I think it has brought it you know because and and people come down on like the speculative side of the market but I think that that's what puts attention on it and that's that's what makes people realize oh there's something there and hopefully you go from thinking this is some a place where I can get rich to this is a place where I can just you know get some art that I can appreciate and I can you know help out an artist in a very real way and I can see their lives change as I talk to them on socials you know on Twitter and Discord uh and and less about you know yeah maybe if you follow their Journey there they'll become a successful artist and you'll you'll share in that success with them um but that's that should be secondary to you know it's about the the journey not the destination in that sense you mentioned sound.xyz you mentioned sound obsessed is maybe partners for for a future drop on matter are you bullied it sounds like you're bullish on music nfts so this comes back to what you know what was my other I guess hat to wear which is which has to do with ownership and IP and uh profit participation so yes I'm bullish on them but not I think they need to evolve further so I'm interested in if I could own a piece of music that if it goes on and gets licensed for a film that that you know I've participated in that you know whatever licensing fees they get so that you know or if it becomes a if I find it if I spot it early and it turns into I don't even know how we track top tens anymore whatever platform people are using yeah Spotify or what have you or blows up on YouTube um that because I've been a supporter from the beginning and the artist or in their in their song that I'm I'm you know that I'm going on that Journey with them again it's like where I get where it's more something more tangible just than I'm a collector of their art because I think I think there's some value in that but I think we we kind of overvalue that in in this space and there's not a lot of um uh you know because what what would the real world example be like how many people are looking at that um you know it's a Select Community that's going to look at that vinyl from the 60s like the you know original limited edition Marvin Gaye said uh that is going to be valued but it's going to be valued by a small group of people so I I think just to say collection you know Collectibles will be valuable for the sake of there being a collectible isn't isn't enough for me like I think they need to be sharing in something greater so this is the perfect segue of course to new here which is previously known as Nifty the film where I still will probably end up calling it Nifty the film because that when I was heavily involved that's what it was called once again a project you and I were both involved in starting at block block I worked really closely on this project for many months um and but I'm a little bit less close to it now so you're gonna break down where we are with it uh an amazing filmmaker behind it we've got Dan sickles our friend who is the youngest director at ever win Sundance he's one thing's at Tribeca he's making this documentary about the nft space he's got I mean just every big name you can imagine from you know Justin aversano and Tyler Hobbs to the influencers like Andrew Wang I know shiny and Jimmy and et cetera et cetera involved in this film to really tell the story of what's happened over the last 18 months or so in nfts and like boy did he pick the right moment to capture because it's been such a crazy year and really I feel like you and I initially got involved around this premise you're outlining which is how can we raise for this film in a way where we can try and allow the you know we can read from the community and allow them to participate in the upside of the film and we ran into just about every legal obstacle uh imaginable and I found out it's really really effing hard to do because it basically has to be issued as a security and it's really hard to issue something as a security and and and issuing things into Securities doesn't necessarily jive with the way that film financing works so um it was it was one thing after another talk to me about where we stand as a project today and I think we'll end up riffing a whole bunch about about film financing and how we can really change things yeah yeah well the starting point I mean I was I was really excited to to meet Dan and and sort of uh see eye to eye I mean I I going back to um you know I have a production company with my wife Helen uh who I love Helen I love him um but we she's done some short films and we have our own production company and I was talking to her about um you know early I guess early last year um saying wow this is just you know as as the mainstream has woken up to the nft space thinking that you know this is a moment in time that I can imagine capturing in a documentary film and you know who how could we do that who do we know that's a documentary filmmaker uh and then we got pregnant with our first baby and and just kind of putting all those plans on hold uh but at the same time Dan emerged and I think he was originally talking to me as he was exploring the space and just wanted to reach out to me as someone who who had a network of of people in the space and had been around for a while but I immediately sort of uh wanted to talk to him about you know because it seemed like he had the vision for what what I was starting to scratch at and wanted you know had a had a motivation to do and um you know he he wanted to tell the story of the space have it be something that emerges from the space and really to focus on the people so those other you know I felt like there might be documentary films that are talking about like you can make so much money in this space and and you know look at this guy you know put ten dollars in and now he's a multi-millionaire it's like a that's not interesting to me I I wanted to see if uh and Dan was coming from the same perspective of like wanting to tell the human stories and wanted to talk about how artists and this is transforming the lives of artists around the world and what you know so what is actually happening on the ground outside of the hype um so that's that's where we sort of saw eye to eye and then we had a basic concept that was you know I just said what if we tokenized the film and then uh used one of these fractionalized Services uh to fractionalize the token and then that became the fundraise for the film and and Dan was saying like if you know wouldn't that be cool if like Netflix comes along and Netflix wants to buy it but they have to buy buy out the token holders and isn't that a cool concept um so that was our starting point and and that's sort of where uh you know we we started investigating but as you as you all know as we as we got under the the the you know beyond the simplified concept into how does this actually work and what does it mean to own a film what does it mean to sell a film and like who are you buying it from and and what do you have shares in it just becomes more and more complicated um so we didn't we didn't crack that uh but I still think that's the future of where where this needs to go uh and I've written a lot about you know how we need to move from crowdfunding to profit participation because crowdfunding to me isn't enough of a uh like a media enough model because uh you know with the films that that I produced with with my wife we didn't uh we didn't go the crowdfunding road because it feels like you're just you're just kind of going to your friends and family and how many times can you do that before you exhaust that that means of funding um so but I think it becomes a repeatable source of funding if it's actually profit participation in the film uh because then it's like you know you get that you do that fundraise once and then it becomes a Perpetual source of funding uh or it could be returned back to the original investors and they could get you know money in his money out um so that's that's a lot more interesting to me as a model uh and I'm surprised and you know this this led to some of the thinking around you you and I you led by you more than me with Lobby three around uh you know what needs to change because they're fundamental things about uh the the regulations that need to change to get there but I'm I'm just surprised that you know why can I give endless amounts of money uh just to fund something but the idea of me getting a return on that is is unheard of or as like you know I can buy lottery tickets I can go to Vegas and burn all the money I want but the second I want to invest in something I'm told I I'm not as sophisticated enough investor because I don't have over a million dollars like it's it's actually so wildly backwards and I think I believe there was a good intention here like I do believe the intention here is to protect retail investors from getting fleeced or manipulated or et cetera Etc at the end when I say here I'm talking about like our Securities laws because that's really what we're bumping up against um but make it a financial literacy test then you know like yeah I love that idea that's the actual thing you want to compensate for not based on not don't test based on income levels so yeah because all you have to do is watch uh I'm also I mean I constantly watch the show American Greed and you'll see accredited investor after accredited investor just get fleeced because you know you can still be unsophisticated in terms of falling for a scam so let's just get smarter about how we deal with with scams and scammers instead of limiting the the kind of upside potential for people to participate in an economy or sort of support a film as a as a stakeholder mm-hmm you have some other interesting ideas around like future models here you know do you want to talk a little bit about I think we were talking about this the other day like maybe if there is a return you don't get to cash that out but you could still leverage it or use it in some way I like some of what you were describing so ultimately I'd like to see us get to a place where uh you know nfts are just Securities and a say this backwards and forwards all the time like I think nfts need to be Securities to justify the the value that people put into them that's not going to happen overnight like that again maybe there's another five plus year Horizon before it happens um but I think there are ways and a lot of us are in this space um you know John Rogers who you've had on a lot of us are thinking about you know what can we do in the short term and and you know there'll be a lot of legal work to get there but I think there are interim things that we can do that will um will be steps in that direction in our and and can sort of color within the lines legally today um one thing I said I was interested in is how uh when uni swap is buying out uh Genie I know they they're giving back as a result of that sale or to reward the original members of Genie they're giving usdc back to them and that's that's sort of similar but I think it's the I think the difference is that there was no expectation as a genie member as a genie user that I was eventually going to get some kind of uh return on the same on the eventual sale of Genie so that could be where where they're not crossing the line um but the model that you and I were talking about is maybe there is a way to use something uh you know to sandbox the funds in a way that there's a token that represents the funds uh that is not a direct return on your investment but you could still effectively control your investment uh so how I would imagine that could work is let's say I put a hundred dollars into this film and it means that I have a hundred uh let's say 120 to get to give a return 120 fund tokens that are going to be locked in this project in this film until the film eventually sells and the film can put into the treasury the 120 dollar value that is the underlying value for that 120 fund coin and then if they do that if they sell the film then my fund coin becomes unlocked and I can use that again on the next project so maybe I take 60 and 60 the two projects that I like there's a film and there's an animation series maybe super Geisha is something I want to fund so I put that in to the other projects and I can sort of keep building uh uh sort of capital so I can keep investing in these media projects but I can't actually uh you know ever put that back into my pocket but maybe that's that still seems like a one step ahead of um because if you imagine on Kickstarter if you're crowdfunding all these projects every time you want to crowdfund a new project that's you're taking more money out of your pocket to put it into the crowdfunding but what if it could just be drawn from this pool and this pool could just your own personal pool of capital could grow bigger and bigger uh based on the successful projects uh selling and returning returning the capital to the treasury so so that's kind of the idea behind it but I think and I'm sure there are people that are working on similar models but the the difference like that I would want to emphasize is like this isn't just Kai's pitching some platform with a new erc20 attached I think it needs to be a token that has broad kind of industry adoption or else it'll just be another like whatever one of a dozen platforms that if you subscribe to this platform it works this crowdfunding platform you get this sort of internal token if you subscribe to this other one you get this internal token and there's a million internal tokens like I think we need to see what I'm calling the fun token would need to be like platform a is using from token platform B is using fun token it's like they're all there's like this underlying shared maybe protocol or shared treasury that everyone's drawing from and everyone's returning to and that could that could even be you know in a dow or a smart contract it could all be um you know sort of coordinated in that way so that's it's trustless um but I think the diff the key difference is it has to be more like an industry standard than a platform has its own token so I'm playing this out in real time here because I think this is really interesting and I love these thought experiments so you you say okay you've got 120 because for example when like someone industry standards have like a 20 return on like a film investment for example so if you invested a hundred dollars and it returned as expected you would get 120 back you're saying okay okay since we can't have this be a security you can't get that money back instead of getting 120 back you're gonna get 120 fund or you know film coin and that film coin can be invested in in a future project and then if that returns 100 you know if that returns it's 20 right now you have 142 or whatever the heck that math comes out to which I just did wrong um and and you can keep going and keep building and investing in more projects and if you're successful at that you're able to help a lot of projects on just that initial 100 investment which is really cool to think about but that means that future projects have to be able to take film coin to your point well no because the all they're taking is the underlying dollar value so the treasury behind the scenes is saying so I'm projects XYZ I've applied to this process you've given 120 film token into my account which releases to me yeah okay because that I was going to get out is yeah you can't just give people dollars because then they or usdc because they could then just go cash it out which is what you're trying to avoid so these are really just like wrappers for usdc so that I as the participant can't cash out my 120 there by making it a security but it gives me something to give them and they can just redeem that then for the underlying treasury that is sitting somewhere in a smart contract yeah I think it's really interesting I mean I think there could be cool models for this with like Charities as well you know at that point it kind of ends the the line because in theory if you're coming to a charity you're not expecting any sort of return but you know if there's a way where you do this for you do six successful film financing rounds which sounds like it would be an incredible track record I imagine that there's it's hard to get it right on on films in terms of like getting a return but and then now you've you know worked that some up to three thousand dollars or something and and you can go and and donate that to a charity somewhere I think there's lots of interesting models for that so not as exciting as getting to the point where we actually just get a return on this stuff um but but if you think about it if you think about it in a slightly different way what if the 20 a month you're paying to a streaming service was giving you 20 fun tokens that you can then put into whatever shows you want to support and you know that's that's 20 a month that's coming out of your account now and going nowhere or going into you know going to a streamer like that's the same model effectively where you know if you're if you're not interested in being a big kind of producer level investor you could still say uh you know this is part someone could build a platform a streaming platform around this film token if that became the industry standard that's effectively just taking subscription fees and using those to to fund I mean you're just recreating a streamer um broken my brain again I don't understand I pay a stream so I can watch all the shows so I'm I'm talking about um so all so you're doing this now right with Netflix you're taking your your subscription fees are funding the Netflix originals uh which is different than a studio model where executive producers are putting in however much money and funding uh the development of that content so I'm saying if you have a protocol that's that's about put money in and then uh filmmakers creators can take money out that could be used in a traditional funding way which I described originally which is like people want to put you know half a million into a film or it could be distributed among streamers so you're building a streamer platform on top of this protocol where you're taking half a million of cash from from people that are subscribing to your streaming service and using that to fund the film yeah but I paid 10 or whatever however many dollars to Netflix 20 to Netflix to get like three billion dollars worth of content you know what I'm like my value prop there yeah yeah but how much of that are you watching so it's like you could you could directly say I wanna I Wanna Give these I mean it gets into other debates but but you could say like I'm only watching three three shows right now send my money there could be you know sort of the more like web3 way of thinking about a streamer so you're sort of allocating exactly or it could be passing that is interesting it is tricky because it is like how do you know what you want to watch and like you know before it's even yeah that's why but that is that is interesting okay I see I see where you're getting where it's like just I mean this is the the you know the end of the intermediaries and the the just like I just want to pay for you know I pay for a lot of individual journalists like I pay so I I pay more for sub Stacks than I do for like subscriptions to newspapers at this point because I'd rather just pay directly for the journalists whose voices I want to hear and I don't feel like I need to pay for the whole platform so you are talking about that like sort of a just paying for the individual yeah I want to see other than the platform and you touched on the problem with that model too like you know you you some at Netflix you'd probably say there are there's a Content team whose job it is to go out and find content if you just sort of open that up to a democratic process then or just open it up to like streamers I mean sorry subscribers voting directly on the content that they want to see you might get the the kind of lowest common denominator or you might get that sort of indie film that you know you want to take a a a gamble on this filmmaker because you you they've pitched it really well to you but like they couldn't necessarily pitch it to an audience and make sense to the audience so you're not going to get these sort of weird quirky uh films you might just get more of the same so that's that's the danger in that model um but I think it's a it's a model that I'd like you know it could exist you could have a streamer like that alongside a Netflix alongside a you know peacock or whatever you have I'm just saying I'll be interested in that existing in addition to our our other forms yeah my subscription payment is going to fund the content that I want which is the case in in Netflix of course because some of the money they pick up from that is going to fund their content or if I think they spend more on content than even bring in in Revenue in the in the past era we've been in where companies don't have to actually make money uh so in that case I was getting a really good bang for my buck but but being more targeted with it it's a very cool premise um let's maybe close just with how the new here drop is working now there are some unique features to it so we are still fundraising for this film new here through an nft and you've been heavily involved in advising the team on that and uh talk to me about the drop mechanics and things because I think it's kind of cool yeah so we we uh so we kind of changed the emphasis from there there is a drop that's coming up that's going to be a generative uh character-based drought which I think is pretty cool in that uh you know again capturing the idea of the film being being called I'm new here uh the drop being called We're new here uh being about the the artists and personalities that that are being interviewed and are are you know this this film being about a moment in time uh capturing the nft space in the nft community uh the drop reflects that so it's taking all those different characters that we're talking to and creating artwork little characters based on on the different people uh and and then those traits are being sort of remixed into a into a larger collection so there's going to be a larger collection that you can get you know one like an artist's head or a head based on that artist maybe the Hat based on another personality and just remixing their traits which I think I think is pretty cool um but we moved from thinking that maybe we can completely you know in boom times we that that you know we've talked so many exciting people in this film that that would be enough to fund the film completely uh I think we we wanted to uh I guess hedge against against that because of of the bear uh so we are looking at a combination of traditional funding uh and so we've been securing that and the drop uh and the drop is going ahead but we have the drop even structured as uh mint passes first so we're we're opening it up to the communities again so there's this idea of a community Builder so a sponsorship tier where you could go out and uh buy a hundred tokens for your community and then that's participating in the in the drop as well and that you could create uh something that will appear so a pet or a prop that will represent your community and be a part of this drop and be mixed into the collection and everyone in your community gets that that unique uh trait uh they're also uh like a Dao who like wants their like all the members of the Dow were like excited about this project and then they can get these tokens yes something that they that means something to that Community will have been like interspersed within the The Collection as a whole yeah so you get like your special mark on this collection that represents your Dao or like we we a few of us pitched in and went in for super geishas to do a super geisha's Community one uh Jimmy came in for avastars and you know just stuff like that where people can can represent their Community because again it's like this idea that this is you know like the film this is representative of the nft community at this time so it's just another way for folks to feel like they're taking part in it um then the there's a tear that is called crypto producer and that's uh you know if if if if you wanted a producer credit this is probably the the most web three I want to say it's the first but I can't can't back that up it's the most web3 way of of having a producer of credit in a in a film that's being released that I can think of and basically you can come in on the tier you'll have a crypto producer role uh you'll be a you know a genuine producer in the film so you'll have access to things like early cuts and you know special channels in the Discord and uh a credit on IMDb uh Credit in the film so I think that's exciting um and and then there's a tear just for people to to make their own mark on the collection as well and get a one of one that looks like them uh so we have a few going out that you can you can just have have a design of yourself uh immortalized in this collection as this moment in time um so yeah so that's that's what we want to we really want to open the the drop up and have it be more of a sort of a community have a have more of a community building aspect to it um and then the drop will come after we've you know this means that we have a we have these men passes so that we have more time to incorporate people's art or people's likeness into the into the artwork that needs to be created uh so that's that's what we're going to do and then we'll have to drop uh that people can participate in the public sale as well awesome Kai thank you so much I'm so glad we finally got you on here I'm sure it won't be the last time uh and uh yeah it's a it's a good time to be talking to you because I really do think this is like art is this is the time for art this is a summer for art and uh you are at the heart of that movement so thank you well it's great to great to be on and we've been talking about it for a while so for months you were one of my first like friends who were like OG in this space so it took us only whatever seven to eight months of knowing each other but here we are thanks so much thank you [Music] so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you like this conversation if you liked this episode please go ahead and
