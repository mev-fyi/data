digital markets in the future will be all markets and I'm building for a future in which digital markets are open source public goods I don't really care about anything else I just view the tools we've built as cosmos as an essential part of getting there I also think ethereum largely shares this Vision um and so feel very aligned with ethereum but like if we're successful we will have open source digital markets that provide economic coordination for the entire Cuban race welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless today we are going to explore the cosmos together this is the cosmos thesis we brought on Zaki and sunny who are Developers app developers and long-time Cosmos community members to talk about the cosmos thesis this I think will give you a 0-60 on Cosmos in 90 minutes I think it's a canonical episode for this community for this ecosystem in fact the guest said as they were leaving this is probably the best Cosmos episode they've ever recorded you remember you be the judge after this episode a few things to look out for number one we talk about the cosmos thesis itself how it's similar versus how it's different to ethereum number two we talk about ethereum as a tree versus Cosmos as a fungus if that makes no sense to you now listen to the episode and you'll see what we mean the difference between the fat protocol thesis and the tall app thesis that's another distinction we make and atom 2.0 a new white paper was just released with new token economics and a whole new Cosmos Hub design we talk about the new features and differences in that design we also asked Zaki and sunny if they think Adams could one day flip ether in terms of total crypto market cap David there's so much we unpacked in this episode uh why are we talking about it Cosmos that is and what should listeners look out for as they listen the cosmos ecosystem the cosmos Community the cosmos philosophy has always paired nicely with ethereum while also being different I remember reading the cosmos white paper in in 2018 and really having like an aha moment it's like yo this is something real that's new and it was specifically about cross-chain interoperability and even to when I was talking to Sunny at Etc forever ago he was he said like the cosmos and ethereum communities have always been very philosophically aligned and I think when we get into this episode The Listener should really pay attention to the I think the accepted truth that Cosmos and ethereum converge at their logical conclusion in their design philosophy at the same place they both believe in the same general outcome of how these ecosystems look like but what they're where they differ is how they get there and the how they get there the Genesis stories for these changes does impact what these things ultimately look like Cosmos started its Journey as a network of interconnected Sovereign application chains that weave themselves together later adding a shared security model ethereum started its Journey with the Central Security model of ether proof of work a canonical single monolithic chain falling into now the beacon chain and then many chains organize around it we have the app train model in Cosmos we have the layer 3 model in ethereum we're each going after the same design structures so the listeners should really pay attention to what are the net consequences of a system that emphasized the security first which is ethereum and ether the asset first which is ethereum versus an ecosystem that emphasized the Sovereign app chain model first and then added security later what are the net effects of that um overall I'm just uh we've used this metaphor on Bank list and I use this I've used this in the podcast that if you re-roll the dice of the crypto industry over and over and over again you will see something like ethereum unfold out of that a hundred percent of the time 99.9 of the time and I think that's also true for Cosmos uh and that is why I think this the cosmos and ethereum uh there's like two sides of the same coin uh we will always see these two models and I don't and I think these two models the app chain model the Central Security model of ethereum that is what crypto has to offer these are the logical conclusions of crypto design philosophy in my opinion so I think with that context I think the listener should be pretty well equipped to go into this episode and get completely downloaded as to the whole Cosmos Vision the other thing of course to think about as you're listening to this episode is where the investment opportunities in Cosmos and David I think I want to talk to you a little bit about that some of my thoughts on investment opportunities but we'll save that for the debrief and of course the debrief is available for you who are premium members it's our episode after the episode where we talk about the episode that was uh so upgrade to premium membership if you want to catch that as well

Agarwal is a crypto OG he's been in the cosmos ecosystem since the very early days in the community since the very beginning he's a man of many hats he's been all around the space he started the blockchain at Berkeley a student Club this was the largest student Organization for the crypto world at the time and he's also the co-host of the epicenter podcast Sunny how you doing I'm doing great uh you know just got off of three days of Cosmo verse which was the big causes conference and so in decompression mode right now I understand that both of you guys are recovering from Cosmos verse uh so uh hopefully we'll get uh some of that energy back into this podcast as we go through we also have Zach emanion he also wears many hats in the cosmos and crypto space he's been in the cosmos ecosystem from the very beginning as well he helped chip most recently cosmos's IBC which is an interchange blockchain protocol he's also working on the validator ecosystem he's been an advisor to the electric Coin Company remember zoku and team from uh Zuko and team from Z cash and he is a co-founder of a staking provider as well Zaki welcome to bank list how you doing I'm doing great Cosmo verse was the best but like I'm glad that I I've I flew out of column I was like I was I was like do I stay in Columbia have gone and then I I'm so tired I was like I'm gonna leave so this was in Columbia back yeah we uh we did it in MIDI in Colombia um nice but you know Colombia is getting a lot of love this year from the the crypto Community with Devcon being there for sure um it's great it was there was there's actually a Bitcoin Cafe like a crypto Cafe in Medellin that we got to we got to do some events at um uh and I I you know um I think Bogota is going to be very different but from the experience of Medellin ended up being phenomenal so how was the conference for for people that weren't able to attend uh and also people that are uh wondering what the temperature is during the bear Market what was the energy like what was the Vitality like how many people were there uh fill us in on what the Cosmos first conference was like I don't think you could tell that it was a bear Market uh we had like so you know we had this is the second Cosmo verse we had the first one was last year in Lisbon uh it was like a sandwich in between like eat Lisbon and the Solana conference and I think there were maybe like 500 or so people there uh at controverse this year I think there was about 1500 people so it's like three times bigger while we're in a bear market and like you know last time there was a lot of like overflow traffic coming from the other places it's like here it's like everyone who came here like came for Cosmos right and like so yeah just like shows how much like there's a lot of excitement and like growth in the last one year even and a little harder to get to uh than Lisbon yeah definitely yeah you couldn't get there uh you couldn't uh uh uh you you know you weren't already there for other stuff or it's like yeah I'd say a third or more people were just like okay like I'm in town for uh uh uh for break point and for near con I might as well do Cosmo versus two um that was kind of the the you know it was all I also also like just like again the origin of this conference is is like very typical of Cosmos which is like a person uh named cryptocito um sort of uh he's a YouTuber uh uh has a relatively popular YouTube channel about crypto he got interested in Cosmos in early 2021 he started to build up a following in the community uh Jack uh zamplin who is my co-founder another one of my projects called similier Finance has another validator business and I was also like a core Dev in the ecosystem so Jack and I had been kind of looking for people to help us bring the message of Cosmos to the world and we found that you know cryptocito was doing a really good job we ended up spot we had taken up there was a marketing Dow that was set up called prop 34 that took money from the cosmos sub treasury we ended up spending what was remaining in that to sponsor and like give cryptocito the funds to do uh Lisbon this time it was like multiple chains so it's the same person now um you know held this much larger conference in a much more difficult location uh he had a staff like 150 people working on it it was sponsored directly from governance proposals from multiple Cosmos chains um and you know 1 600 people could throw up that were there were After parties and events every night it did not feel like a bear Market at all and uh and people I think and then like the other thing that was really unique about this is there's literally never been a cosmos conference where anything was announced like really like the little Chains would announce stuff but like ecosystem level announcements had never happened before uh at a conference and we actually were able to do both the atom 2.0 white paper and uh the announcement of usdc coming natively to Cosmos in our conference David I remember like we talked about HCC you know I was saying like when we we had our interview there I said Etc is my favorite conference uh and part of it is because you know I don't know I just always feel that etcc has a very Community just the fact that it's a community organized conference rather than Foundation organized conference it always had like a more interesting energy to it to me than even Devcon I I like BTC better than Devcon and like every other uh ecosystem it's always like foundations on conferences right Cosmos feels very much like HCC for the same reason it's not a foundation thrown conference it is like random Community member decided to do this yeah and it's very emblematic of what Cosmos actually is which is a little bit more bottom up than top Town orchestrated uh and so what would you credit the success of this conference well uh the the cosmos uh Cosmos verse was harder to get to in a different part of the world uh three times as many people showed up while crypto prices have gone in one third right and so you know one-third the amount of of capital in the space yet three times the amount of people showed up like why where's all this energy in Cosmos coming from what would you guys credit the the Vitality uh the source of Vitality here I mean Cosmos as an ecosystem has just grown a lot I think especially you know in the last three four months I think I think the dydx sort of announcement of like switching over to Cosmos uh you know I know Zaki was pretty involved with that what like that I think just got a lot of people's attention where you know it was a and people are like wait here's this like project that's like been building on ethereum for forever and like you know why did they suddenly decide to like you know make this sort of switch right and so people start to look into like on looking at the reasons that why like dydx did it and started learning more about you know the cosmos thesis is very complex and you know it's like you know when you're switching from ethereum to I don't know Avalanche like oh okay cool it's faster yeah it's like no but like you know when you're switching to Cosmos there's like a whole set of like fundamentally different things that we're doing that like uh and people took one to do with the do idx announcement people start to actually look into that and I think a lot of people just got very interested in the Theses that we have at Cosmos and that kind of just like snowballed like from there over the last few months before we break down I think the thesis and how this like really complicated idea of how we're different from ethereum um and how we're basically different from the blockchains than most people are probably familiar with um the uh I'll also say it was just like you know we are also basically like what four or five months out from the Terra collapse and Luna was built on top of the cosmos technology stack it was it was part of Cosmos it was connected to IBC um the anchor carry trade passed through both the cosmos Hub and uh osmosis in a very large way so we were very economically connected to it its collapse was almost felt like it felt like was a devastating blow to the ecosystem um uh you know almost everybody lost money it was like it was a huge thing um and uh you know and I don't know you know we we can we it's certainly if we want to talk about you know how we all feel about the the whole UST story um but it was it did feel like there was a moment at which there was a bottom there uh where we kind of felt like you know it was like unclear whether or not Cosmosphere is really going to how long it was going to take us to recover and the recovery happened like far more quickly than anyone have anticipated um and like you know it basically I got I got so much busier in like maybe like two weeks after the tarot collapse and it's just like not slowed down like uh at all since then yeah that's really interesting you're right this is uh this is not long after the Terra collapse would you guys believe that was just like less than five months ago when that whole thing imploded uh it's been it's been a wild five months for us yeah I bet and um there's definitely a lot of excitement one thing I you know I've been observing of course in the cosmos ecosystem is the amount of building that's going on there's also this kind of renewed interest maybe through dydx and others but even in the ethereum community around app chains which I'm sure we'll talk about a little bit more um and and really are I think our goal for this episode is you know David and I cover a lot in the kind of the ethereum ecosystem on uh the podcast right so you guys have to teach two ethereum idiots like what Cosmos is what it's all about I will say I was involved in the cosmos ecosystem in the early days and so um it's always been a community that's been kind of um I've been I've been observing and I've liked and I've appreciated kind of the the efforts of but you guys have come a long way as well Cosmos the idea has come a long way and we want to talk about that trajectory I think we also want to talk a little bit about the Terra Luna collapse but let's save that maybe until a little bit later uh first let's talk Cosmos the idea and David said this to me before we recorded uh that you told him Sonny Cosmos has been called an idea more than an actual thing those are your words I think uh Sunny Cosmos being a thing uh isn't a thing it's more of an idea what do you mean by that what is the idea of Cosmos was the central thesis yeah sure the the central thesis of Cosmos was that you know we are going to see a world of not a few blockchains but many many blockchains most of them being application specific blockchains or app chains and that these block and there's no such thing as a single final settlement layer the the entire in the real world there is no subtle final settlement layer we're going to have many many settlement layers and they you know every blockchain is going to be the settlement layer for its own native assets and its own native state and that's what gives it fundamentally sovereignty right Roll-Ups and other you know systems they don't have true sovereignty from from the main chain right the main chain is what finally dictates uh what these fine it's the final Arbiter of Truth in you know this globalized system while Cosmos is a very you know we we're all like localists basically we we believe that like Hey we're not trying to build the world computer as Ethan Buckman puts that he we're trying to build community computers and let these Community computers all uh talk to each other um so yeah that's I know exactly you want to add anything to that um all I will say is so there's another thing the the sunny um I know like the cosmos thesis really believes which is you know so one of the things we say is that like Cosmos is coming to kill your fat protocol thesis um the uh so the fat protocol thesis is that like the way that blockchains will accrue value is that you'll build a blockchain it'll you know typically a protocol with a token that token will have a bunch of apps on top of it but because the the infrastructure where in the network effects around it are represented by the token that's where the most valuable crew and the cosmos thesis has been from the get-go that the where the value accrual layer is is the app layer that the that like it's the application layer that is the thing that and that the thing that is closest to the users um it's the it's it's the application where we're intent and Order flow and everything originates um and that's the layer of the system uh where the value will accrue um and we basically purpose built a blockchain stack for people to build the best possible app layers rather than thinking that like hey I built another Fat perk what an analogy that I like to pull through is like you know if you're in the early web in you know in the 1990s you know a lot of people were thinking that the way to bet on the web was AOL and CompuServe but now with like retrospect we know it was Google and Amazon right the apps are what were sticky and actually had user relationships and the infrastructure layers uh you know really actually what ended up actioning was the biggest apps actually ended up building their own infinite layers and became actually the biggest infra providers as well they were like AWS but really it is the the app developers are the ones who like you know they'll they'll move between infrastructure providers but users are sticky to the applications so we want to we want to leave that out there so one idea you're presenting is rather than fat protocol fat app thesis would that be a way to summarize what you just said Cosmos is fat app I actually like this term called tall acts because one of the things at least with osmosis what we really believe in is like vertical integration so like you know we build our front end we build our Dex modules but we build the chain itself and we just happen to build like the primary wallet for the cosmos ecosystem as well but we have this like you know the one what we what we actually take a lot of inspiration from is like apple which is like a very vertically integrated system but that like gives them I think the best ux of any like any uh product line right and so you know I call these the tall apps right for highly vertically integrated so just to put a a visual a metaphor on this whole thing uh ethereum has like it's got this one canonical layer one and then we have um a proliferation of layer twos there's like five or six real big ones and then like now right now is like a big conversation going on in the ethereum space with layer threes and this kind of looks like a tree there's like a big Central tree trunk uh there are like four or five smaller branches but still pretty big that come out of this tree trunk and then they fracture off into like thousands and thousands of smaller branches and twigs that eventually turn into leaves and maybe these leaves can be like the applications that you know capture the energy of of the Sun for example but it all it all collapses down to a central point a central trunk uh and that was really the ethereum beacon chain and heat staking at the very very bottom of this whole thing uh the cosmos model is a little more of a of a mesh network uh I kind of want to say a spider web but even a spider web has kind of like a center point but it still kind of looks like a more flat there's not actually a point in the middle and these things weave together as like a natural metaphor is or like the correct analogy is like a fungus the mycelial networks that like pervade the like forests and the Earth and and do make it so that the trees can actually live right you know yes that's yeah you have definitely used this metaphor but much better than I have but that's definitely right uh it's Google searching mycelial Network for those that don't have an image in their head as a result of that will definitely definitely help um and so and so the idea here is that like is it and the cool thing about the mycelial networks is that they're just like res automatically resilient because there is no Central focal point can you guys kind of just like lean into this metaphor and help me unpack it a little bit more so I think one of the big things that we've really believed in in Cosmos is that like we do think that like the the if there was like a core difference of a vision let's say between like sunny and I and vitalik is this idea that like um so like we we think and like these I'll try and like quickly unpack the argument like where like my perception of vitalik's views and our perception of our views which is okay like vitalik's view is like monetary premiums are really hard but it's really hard to build like a secure decentralized censorship resistance system without securing it using a monetary perimeter so you have this thing with where you have the the root monetary premium chain which is the beacon chain and that everything descends from that monetary premium chain uh uh is secured by the and like reinforces with that monetary premium chain um you know sunny at Cosmo versus presented this idea of mesh security um where Cosmos chains actually opt in to uh additional slashing conditions around each other we believe in like ad hoc economic networks forming so sh so you know the the the you know to you know you have these like natural natural trade routes of which the you know UST carry trade was one of them but like you have trade routes between Adam and osmosis you have have a number of large crypto exchanges run their own Cosmos change including okx and crypto.com so then you have trade routes between their user bases and other Cosmos chains um and you see this like at what we are sort of expecting is this like network of value to form between these Community computers um and if and like some of the ideas that we're exploring now and are sort of in their in our in our vision of the future is to make sure that security and economic uh uh security can travel with economic interdependence but you don't need this like root structure yeah the like so I like an example of this um what what it would be chains provide bilateral security agreements with each other so in this app chain model people have always asked like oh how are you going to get enough Security on every individual app chain the analogy I like to give it you know I like geopolitical analogies uh and so for me the example is NATO NATO is a a collective of sovereign countries they all have their own governance systems they don't meddle in each other's internal politics but they have a security uh a mesh security system right they if Article 5 says that if any one of the NATO countries gets attacked they all rush to each other's defense and I think the same thing happened will happen with Cosmos chains as well and it will be based a lot off what I think what zaki's point was it'll be based a lot off of economic relationships so if you look at uh so I'll give an example of osmosis and axillar so axlar is you know currently the most popular bridge between um you know ethereum and the cosmos ecosystem osmosis of the Dex osmosis makes up about 70 of axelars tvl right now while four of the top 10 assets on osmosis are wbtc die and usdc are coming via the axillar bridge so it's like hey we have such high economic relationship with each other it would suck a lot for osmosis if axillar got like attacked if it's like for axillary osmosis guard attack we should be both providing shared security to each other basically right osmo holders should be putting up economic stake backing axillar validators while axillary Axel uh Staker should be putting up economic State backing osmosis developers so basically by these two systems doing Mass security with each other they actually have the economic value of both of the market caps combined securing each chain and you can imagine that this scales with more and more chains you know uh we'll have a network of five change ten chains and all the sum value of all of the app chains is going to be you know in this you know it will provide greater or equal security that to like these L1 systems today can we talk about the trade-off here which is a trade-off I think um Cosmos has made from the very early days and Zaki just alluded to it and sunny I think you you also alluded to it in your answer which is um sacrificing monetary premium uh essentially saying that the the token at the bottom of a layer 1 chain does not need to and perhaps should be designed not to accrue monetary premium so coming from maybe kind of the the Bitcoin space and also now the the ethereum space obviously for Bitcoin monetary premium is the thing that is the app of Bitcoin right um in ethereum I think the community has uh most recently and more recently adopted monetary premium as part of its security Defense Force and when we've had Justin Drake and others on on the podcast is kind of like maybe less the fat protocol thesis and more kind of the fat money thesis which is the idea that if you can create monetary premium in your base layer asset you essentially get like free security it's like mimetic security for your entire network for the entire tree trunk and all of the chains that are built on top and so why not number one and then also secondly how can other layer ones compete against essentially free security it gets a chain and an ecosystem with monetary premium and this is something I think Adams has you know Cosmos and atoms being the token of the cosmos Hub at least which is just one Hub in the mesh network of course is not the thing the cosmos universe is much larger than just one Hub but uh in the in the cosmos Hub design it's been kind of sacrificed the idea of atoms is not to accrue a monetary premium but it seems like you're giving that up what about this trade-off uh Sunny what do you think so um so about the you know getting the free Economic Security I actually think that the mess security is actually a non-rent extractive way of getting uh free Economic Security when you're building on top of an L1 that has this monetary premium there is actually some you know rent that's being extracted whether it's like you know being forced to pay transaction fees in that token or giving the Mev value to that to that base layer or while with the app change system you don't and you use economic relationships to uh you know natural naturally forming economic relationships to provide that security basis um now to your other to the question about like so this might anger some of your listeners but uh you know I remember I had a tweet a little while ago saying that like hot take the cosmos ecosystem is a bunch of undercover Bitcoin Maxes and I know you replied to that like yes I realized this two years ago uh and for me I actually started building working on Cosmos because I wanted to build the app layer for Bitcoin I saw you know I was in I was working on ethereum stuff for a while I saw you know I I was at consensus for a little bit and to me the I don't know the monolithic World model didn't make sense and I was like okay wait a second Bitcoin is an app chain maybe we just need to build more app chains and have everything uh you know we can build the the app layer for Bitcoin Bitcoin will just remain this simple chain and its only purpose is to you know control the issuance of the Bitcoin system and then Bitcoin will flow off of the Bitcoin BTC will flow off the Bitcoin chain and be be the main money of the entire Cosmos Network that we're building you know I guess I'm a little bit less of a Bitcoin Max monetary Maxi as I used to be but you know I'm still you know I I definitely put myself more in there you dabble yeah I dabble I don't but here's there's actually a new project that like kind of um came out of hiding a little bit at Cosmo verse uh which I'm really excited about it's called Babylon it's actually a way of using Bitcoins like monetary premium security layer to provide security to all the cosmos chains and any proof of stake chain so what it is it's a way of checkpointing proof of stake block headers into bitcoin's proof of work system and you it you know augmenting proof of stake security with the proof of work security of Bitcoin and you know you kind of actually get a lot of cool benefits with this you get like you know proof of stake really secure in short time frames fast finality all that not grease occur in long time frames with whole long range attacks and all this kind of stuff proof of work not very secure in the short time frames really secure in long time frames and if you actually overlay these systems together you actually get a little bit of The Best of Both Worlds and so uh I don't know I think Babylon is actually in a little way like bringing back that idea of like using the base monetary uh premium chain and having it provide security to all these chains as well but in this sort of like mesh Network Paradigm you know it's not it's an opt-in system it's chains that want to use Babylon can it's not a like a hard requirement before we get to Zaki with the same question just uh one other follow-up for you Sunny so isn't this the problem though when we take something like Bitcoin and we Port this to Cosmos is we lose the root Economic Security of Bitcoin now Bitcoin becomes like a lesser secure Bitcoin the native Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain so native Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain of course is secured by all of the miners right it's got Bitcoin level Sovereign resistant uh security guarantees now when we move Bitcoin to Cosmos now we have to trust whatever app chain set of validators for our our security of that Bitcoin asset it becomes a less secure asset when it's ported in that way because we're not not sharing the security isn't this a challenge that you see yeah so you know uh getting secure Bridges to bitcoin is definitely an important Focus for you know it's not it's not you know something that we're definitely want to help promote more of right like we are you know we've been trying to help Jeremy Rubin with like getting some of the op CTV stuff and like you know more secure covenants on bitcoin which will allow for more secure Bridges effectively I'm a big fan of the the drive chains model Drive change is effectively like how how you would do IBC for Bitcoin um so you know I think uh what I've what I've learned is that like pushing on bitcoin development too hard like if you the more you push at it the more it's like kind of uh pushes back at you and so you know I think that we're we're building for the long term here and I think that and I think the Bitcoin core developers have like a 10-year 50-year 20-year mindset you know and I but I think the I think the core Primitives that will make Bitcoin be able to securely have the same trust assumptions as IBC will exist within you know a few years Zaki what's your take on this whole uh monetary premium thing do you think it's Much Ado About Nothing do you think monetary premium actually doesn't matter as much as maybe bankless and kind of ethereum and Bitcoin Community think it does so what I would say is I would I think too many teams who build l1s so like again so one thing that I think is again is sort of important to remember about Cosmos is Cosmos is a 2014 project basically but we started J like Jay started it I started hanging out with Jay I've been work we've been talking we've been working on it and talking about thinking about Cosmos back since then it's gone through many names but basically the core thesis has been the same uh we are very long-term Builders um we were building the stuff before there was any money in it we'll be building it you know if the money goes away like We just it it like it's an idea that seems so correct that it just has to be built um and the so in that Spirit of building for the very long term I really don't believe in building something that's so fragile that if you're if you like sort of lose the meme the whole thing collapses right where it's like bit you know the pro problem with and like honestly I admire ethereum's current monetary premium I think you know I think vitalik has done a vitalik Justin Danny have done an extraordinary job they don't really always listen to me but you know we saw that with Tara a little bit right they lost the meme and the entire system collapsed exactly right so how do you build systems so start by Building A system that is secure in the absence of a monetary premium if you happen to also get a monetary premium great you get like this uh additional security additional value you could do you could you could do things differently with um but if you don't but if you don't happen to have that and you've still built a sound system then you know it'll keep going uh and you know whereas like you know you we've seen the flip the other side of it which was also built on our Tech which is like what do you what does it look like when you build a completely unsound system the minute you lose the meme everything dies uh which was which was Luna let's earmark uh this question for later but since we're on the topic of monetary premium we'll come back to atom 2.0 and the new economics that were introduced but just really quick Zacky so we can earmark this for for later in the in the episode um is atom 2.0 increasing the potential for monetary premium of atoms in your mind does it make it better yeah yeah it absolutely is is part of the vision that's part of the design it is part of the vision to increase the possibility increase the probability that Adam may have a monetary premium um Ethan Buckman that is that is cool that is cool that makes me as a as a monetary premium Maximus which I probably am in addition to a decentralization maximalist um it's cool to see the cosmos Community doing that can I give a little example about the mass security and other like justification of it gold is probably the asset in the world like the the one Bearer asset in the world that has the most monetary premium right now it has a market cap of about 11 trillion dollars the top 10 companies by market cap in the world have a higher market cap than gold combined and so if you go the and that's the option model right it's like oh value comes from real real actual like revenue streams and like same way that company you know market caps come from and so if the top 10 companies in the world have a greater market cap than gold why can't the top 10 app chains have a greater market cap and security system than a monetary premium basis so your point there Sunny is just it's about like total Economic Security not Economic Security does not need to come from monetary premium it can come from a productive asset that is adding value so like Facebook stock for example uh and like if you have the top 10 companies then you get a market cap exceeding gold it's interesting yep so in in this mesh Network model of security what's stopping one chain from just being way more useful and Central than the others and might that chain also get some Network effects and some liquidity liquidity premiums and so while it all starts off as like a pretty diffuse mycelial Network that's very horizontal one chain call it osmosis as like the liquidity Center of Cosmos what's stopping osmosis from kind of just like positioning itself in the very center of everything because everything has to hook into osmosis for liquidity and then while the cosmos idea the cosmos ecosystem never actually created like a beacon chain right an actual this is the center is what's stopping something like osmosis from basically becoming that anyways and what in your answer Sonny could you just uh Define what osmosis is for people who are not familiar with the cosmos ecosystem yeah sure so awesome uh osmosis is a uh it's a DEX app chain right so it is a you know currently it's an amm based system but you know we're adding more concentrated liquidity style stuff and you know our goal is to build the best decks possible and you know we looked at like other dexes on other ecosystems whether it's uniswap or serum everything's always like constrained with the limitations of the platform it's built on and we had a lot of ideas about how ux should work how like uh new functionality especially around like privacy and like new things that you we just were so constrained by building on like the like the you know we've actually we actually thought about like building it on an evm and like we're like this doesn't actually work the things we're trying to do won't work on here and so you know by having our own chain that we can go you know especially if you want to do a lot of stuff at the Privacy layer right you know we need to go be able to change how the cryptography in the code base works well we also have to go change how the wallets work and like you know you have to have this like full stock control and that's sort of what we did um and osmosis was you know so this IBC thing this inter-blockchain communication protocol that allows Cosmos change to talk to each other it it it existed for a little while but then osmosis sort of came along and like it was like the first killer app of Cosmos right and there will be there are already more I think killer apps coming and but right now it is sort of where the center of user activity and liquidity has aggregated um you'd say it's the first but would you disclude Tara Luna just because it blew up because I was uh looking like giraffe a year ago so Tara Luna was uh they they took a little bit longer to activate IBC so they activated I that you know they had you know Tara was had quite a bit of traction but they were using the Costless SDK stack and then they acted I activate I mean I've talked to them about it you know they they're like oh there's no benefit of connecting to the cosmos ecosystem you know we're the only app and then osmosis came along and they're like oh okay there's something worth connecting to which is why they activated IBC um so back to your question about like the you know the how what we're building here is highly organic systems right and that that's the whole premise of Cosmos is like you know you let organic systems arise and you let like uh you know the natural Network effects happen and you know natural connections will happen and in any organic system hayekian system uh you have power laws right there are things that are it is fundamental to the nature of how hayekian systems work that there will be power laws and you know obviously as an as an osmosis developer I I intend osmosis to be at a certain end of the spectrum on those power laws but you know I I think our goal is not to be you know we're not trying to build a hub and spoke system right I think that would defeat the entire point of what we're trying to do with Cosmos and we are you know that's why osmosis is contributing heavily to like things like mesh security and like making sure that you know we we a lot of people had asked us like hey us why aren't you doing like routing through osmosis right you you know all this you have all this assets flowing through osmosis if someone wanted to send a token from you know regen chain to secret Network chain for example you know why aren't we actually we had a we had the opportunity to allow it to have all go flow through osmosis but like that's just just not the vision for how Cosmos works and we like specifically said no no this like whole system is bad we sh everything should be doing point-to-point routing all chains are the router the hub for their own native assets and so I think that's also kind of why we wanted to build this first option as well was so that you know I our team you know me and Dave and other folks we had spent three years building the uh core stack of you know building the SDK and IVC and at some point we wanted to go build an application and by building the application we can kind of help set how you know be the good actor be the first good be the good actor that sets the cultural norms for how app change should be built so so in that answer is it is the answer yes a chain could become the liquidity focal point of the entire Cosmos ecosystem but we will also build surface area and routes around that liquidity Center that doesn't like formally instantiate it as a winner even though it might be winning it is not the winner and it will never be like locked in there is that a summary of your answer David doesn't just feel like uniswap basically on ethereum yes yes yeah you know unistop has quite a bit of competition they still make up over 50 of volumes on ethereum but like you know it's still a free and fair market that like you know if unit stop goes down this ethereum doesn't die right there's so many Alternatives that things can flow through as well I think the difference though is that uniswap is largely a platform for ether liquidity more than it is uni liquidity and when there is an absence of a monetary premium asset that's like instantiated or formalized in the cosmos ecosystem perhaps the osmosis token becomes that asset if it is providing its own liquidity to its own asset and the osmosis token is the most liquid asset inside of Cosmos and starts to become the money of Cosmos I think that's a difference there that's worth uh worth poking at a little bit because then that does start to like bacon bacon the osmosis token more formally into the broader Cosmos ecosystem than uniswap does for the uni token because then the osmosis so can start to fill the role that ether plays in the ethereum ecosystem what would you think about this yeah so we did do a little bit of that where like osmo is the base liquidity pair of uh most of these pools but I actually don't think that's going to be a lasting thing because as we move towards more concentrated liquidity and order book style systems I think the ux kind of Demands for stable coins to be the uh you know the quote asset for most of these pairs uh you know people if they're putting contrary to liquidity positions they want to say hey I want to put it between 90 cents and a dollar ten right not like denominating things in osmo so um you know I I I think with osmosis you know another thing though is like we we're we're not just the cosmo stack so it depends on what you call Cosmos like you know we are uh funny enough you know we're actually the second biggest decks for DOT uh like that is funny yeah and it's like so we have a lot of Doc coming over we have you know Ethan wbtc are the third and fourth most liquid assets on osmosis we have um and you know we are working on building up connections to more ecosystems you know our one of our goals is we want to be the place that if you have Ethan ethereum and you want avex on Avalanche you can the osmosis should be the best place to Route it both from a ux perspective and liquidity perspective I don't know if this is true with respect to monetary premiums but I have always seen the cosmos ecosystem they sort of import different monies into their kind of trade route Network rather than build up their own monies maybe maybe thing things are changing with uh with atoms and kind of the new design and that's that's being more conducive to monetary premium but importing Bitcoin for example tokenized version of Bitcoin importing eth now more recently importing usdc which has got to be a big boom to the cosmos Community Zaki do you have any thoughts on this and just in general how big do you think is the move for um Circle and usdc to be Now supported on Cosmos are you kind of a stable coin maximalist and do you have any issues with this particular staplecoin design that it's a bit more centralized for instance so um occlusion so okay I wanted to make a couple of points that like just kind of Pop the stack a little bit that like all descend really nicely down this so one thing that I think is very different about another thing that's a real difference between Cosmos and ethereum um is that in Cosmos most of the core devs also work on apps um versus in ethereum there's like like you go to like uh uh like um like um like uh what devconnect in Amsterdam and you see this like massive disconnect between like the ethereum core Dev community and the ethereum app community in Cosmos every single quartet like most of the like well-known core devs inside of Cosmos and the people who sort of guide and Steward the other core devs who don't want to think about Apple Air concerns almost every one of them has an app so like I have sommelier Finance I also work on agoric and agoric stable coin called IST I work on the usdc Chain uh or or the chain the generalized asset issuance chain that usdc is coming on to um you know and I helped close that close the deal and the announcement um and so there's like this whole um uh uh which like gives this very different feel uh feeling to the whole ecosystem and also kind of help solidify this whole oh it's going to be a mesh instead of it's going to be like centralized around one thing because we all have our own apps we all have our own you know and like economic incentives to like make sure that like different coins in the ecosystem all succeed and Thrive um and so we're all we're all constantly constructing different routes and trade routes and it does sort of preserve this sort of decentralized nature of the ecosystem so then like go all the way up onto the stable coin thing um so you know in in many ways the uh you know the I I would say like the the way the usdc announcement was structured I think was oh we're coming to a lot of change so it just like sounds like okay we're coming to a lot of chains um but like honestly what I would say is the biggest thing that I have seen from the sort of discussion and conversation with usdc around Cosmo but coming to Cosmos about coming to so like one of the differences between Cosmos right is like on all the other chains except for uh uh polka dot that they're launching on the chain like the apps where the chain is going to be used and the chain where they're issuing are the same on the cosmos ecosystem they are issuing on an interchange secured chain both the understanding that the majority of the usage is going to be on dydx osmosis say protocol like all of these you know Agora all of these things so what I would say is that like one of the things that's been exciting to me has been seeing usdc from go from sort of ignoring the multi-chain world and sort of just like okay we're like we're gonna maybe we're gonna like we were on the like L worldwide kind they were kind of affiliated with the fat protocol thesis where they're like we'll go to the fattest protocols we'll issue usdc there to okay we get it it's all multi-chain we gotta like make usdc much more natively multi-chain um which is honestly a challenge for a lot of the bridging protocols like you know when when Sunny says you know axelr is is is the is the biggest bridge in osmosis it's almost all stable coin volume and you know we're bringing usdc natively to Cosmos um the the like most rapid Bridge tokens in general are primarily stable coins going from where they aren't to where they are and we're much more entering a universe of stablecoin ubiquity like you know essentially now you know if you're building a new L1 and you just build IBC support you're going to get usdc from Cosmos um uh from the from the from the from the r chain like seamlessly and permissionlessly which you could never do before so these things are like I think the circle announcement was kind of underplayed as exactly how big deal it is because like literally what they were just saying like the literal logical implication of of usdc coming onto uh Cosmos is now usdc is available to any L1 Builder who implements the interblock chain communication protocol and they get usdc for free I think that is the big deal and I I like the idea of usdc on Cosmos more than say something like some kind of a Bitcoin because uh usdc itself is is already a centralized it's an IOU for a dollar in a bank account owned by coinbase right it's not supposed to provide Sovereign grade security it's not a crypto native money at all and so putting that on Cosmos just seems to make sense you're not really sacrificing uh any of the um any of the security or any of the kind of the sovereignty of the money because it's just already a dollar it's a digital dollar but okay so um I'm gonna lay out another question I guess I have for you guys and this is again maybe from a dumb um you know ethereum Kool-Aid Drinker uh point of view and you guys tell me where I'm wrong yeah um okay so uh layer twos versus Cosmos let's talk about that so um yes the future is multi-chain what people don't necessarily understand is that there are kind of two multi-chain visions I think at play right not to say that both won't coexist I'm sure they absolutely will co-exist but one is kind of a cosmos multi-chain vision and the other is maybe an ethereum multi-chain vision and let me uh lay out the the ethereum kind of multi-chain vision because I understand that a little bit more but the basic idea is all of the chains settle back and use the security of ethereum right and so yes the ethereum ecosystem or Universe if you will will have app chains and yes app chains are a force Cosmos is absolutely right in its thesis about this that app chains are going to be a big deal I think you guys have led the way in probably the ethereum community is like oh yeah we get it now like we understand app Chain's big deal yes um but the way that the ethereum community is doing app chains is basically like as part of maybe call it a layer three as part of kind of a roll-up so you've got arbitrum and there are any trust strategy we just had um the folks from ZK sync uh on the on the podcast last week or a couple weeks ago at the time of record at the time of uh people will listen to this and um that episode was about essentially spinning up app chains inside of what they called the layer 2 which just means basically settled down to ethereum at the root at the end of the day so secured by ethereum and the benefit of this you guys are going to emphasize the cost but let me tell you what the benefit is of this IC is you get ethereum's level of security or something close to it with maybe a few minor trade-offs without having to pay for it right so if you spin up your own Sovereign chain there is a military there is a security Force the police in the military you have to fund and those are called the validators of the system they secure the chain for you if you're on uh ethereum you settle down to ethereum you benefit from a theater ethereum's Economic Security you don't have to pay your own military and police force and so that has both economic advantages it seems like you get to preserve much of the sovereignty though you guys maybe will disagree and say well it's not completely your own your own kind of sovereignty in that app chain but you get those benefits and then you're kind of tapped into the ethereum network and the ethereum community cross chain bridging becomes much more secure you get a lot of benefits from from that path so contrast that if you will with the Cosmos app chain model and um yeah tell me tell me where the the ethereum strategy breaks down uh but we have a name for that system it's called Empires and colonies and we're building for Sovereign systems um start yeah okay so that was the very memeable um of of the put down I'll do the a little bit more so okay so first point is I don't think like like I I think that the you know part of the goal of you know part of like the dialogue between ethereum and Cosmos which I think most people in ethereum don't really realize this but this dialogue has been going on since like 2014. one of the co-founders of Cosmos was like an early guest contributor and gets get uh uh uh person like we have been these have been existence systems that inform each other and honestly we've been trying to get convinced ethereum to like move towards something like what the current vision is for a very long time we've been like okay guys like yes like we get it but like you've got to understand the app trade thing like that has to like be part of the vision and like it's taken a long time because like they went down this like sharding uh uh uh uh uh off ramp and I was like what are you doing and like it was like there's a couple offerings plasma sharting it took them so long to like be like single slot Vitality app Shades Okay cool so they kind of pixelated a little bit and they came around to the cosmos Vision yeah I I you know I I was I hung out with vitalik for like a week earlier this year and I'm like if I I finally convinced you it's taken seven years but I finally convinced you um so I I was so that you know there's a there is a friendliness always to the ethereum community we are we are we I've always viewed each other as brothers and in many ways like I think the mission of the cosmosite if that world like you're describing of the ethereum world the idea of Cosmos will have succeeded and that that's why we're all here so that's first of all of us now what I'll just go to like what is the specific sort of technical reason is in my mind a blockchain is three things it's an execution environment it's a data availability system and it's a system of bridges ethereum is trying to say hey basically we want to build one of all of this like there's like one canonical place you bridge to where you have where you post your fraud proofs where you post your uh uh uh your yours uh uh zero knowledge proofs we'll provide one data availability aware called dank sharding um and then you can investigate all the execution environments that you want the cosmos vision is Bridge wherever you want we have IBC you can go anywhere you can Bridge anywhere IBC can can enable you to bridge anywhere um post your your zero knowledge proofs and your your your uh fraud groups and everything wherever you want um you know Celestia is kind of part of the cosmos family it is a data availability focused app chain enabling a like a a a roll-up type ecosystem and you can post your stuff there and then we've given you a free toolkit for building execution environments and so the differences between the ethereum environment ecosystem right now is one for the most part the execution environment toolkits are not free um uh which is which is I think a big reason of you know why do idx for instance came to Cosmos and why other chains have come to cosmoses there is an advantage to being like hey wait the execution environment is not the product of some company that like raised like Bill you know 100 in a multi-billion dollar evaluations exactly with that is that is that like um tendermint is that kind of the Cosmosphere it's open source out of the box open source Apache 2 licensed public goods got it you know collaborated on by many different people um where there's many different experts all over the ecosystem who sit in chats with each other and just like work on it and debug it every day um much of it is funded by the Adam holders but it's like again we use the atom fundraiser we use the speculation speculative energy around Adam to like build this public good for everyone um so that was that was that was so that's that I think is the best I also just I think it's actually just the best framework for this like I mean you know if you compound if you you know Robert Lesnar treated a couple weeks ago a couple months ago he's like you know compound chain tried to build an app chain on you but I think they just chose the wrong stack they chose substrate and spent a year banging their head against the walls and gave up and and like Robert Russell said like hey I actually think if we chose the cause of SDK as the stack to do this on I think this could have worked and um you know apart from a builder perspective I think there's actually just like one of the big things is we can just build faster with the causes SDK that we could with Roll-Ups right like build so in rollups today you kind of have like two model two real Frameworks right now which either everyone's building these like evm compatible systems but like I mentioned you know the stuff we're trying to do it doesn't work on the evm we need we need a custom uh framework for that building optimistic rollups or ZK Roll-Ups for really custom State machines is actually really hard probably the closest you know the closest thing right now is Cairo from from the starkware team and you know it's really impressive what they've been able to do but I mean I'll say that writing a text of the complexity of what we're trying to of Osmosis trying to write this in this new programming thing called Cairo that's like very Cutting Edge you know it's it's like trying to write in like you know not even see it's like a proto-c like it's like versus you know the stuff that we can do and like go and roster just like build faster and I think build the applications and build the ux framework so I guess like you know maybe one one thing is how to compare a lot of this stuff is the ethereum ecosystem and Cosmos yes maybe they're more moving towards the same place right now the same end goal the ethereum ecosystem decided to spend a lot of time focusing on you know that things like the duck said like the fraud proofs and bloody proofs the data availability stuff while I think the cosmos ecosystem has focused much more at a higher level layer of the stack at the you know the state machine stuff I think the cosmos VM is probably the best designed VM in all of crypto because how it does interchange composability um I that the the cross chain composability that we have in Cosmos is way more advanced than anything else you know other ecosystems yeah you can Bridge tokens right in Cosmos we can have like Dows on one chain like do transactions on another chain like that's like so and I think maybe part of that comes from the you know like documention that all the core devs of Cosmos are app developers as well and so that's kind of informs the decision and priorities that that that we do and so that's sort of one of the trade-offs and no we will eventually have fraud proofs and validity proofs and all that stuff for Cosmos SDK chains as well but we were just like oh we're going to build a better ux and like app features first I think this is very much what the what the difference is is Cosmos is starting like app down and and ethereum is almost starting from kind of like the base protocol up a bit more and so I yeah I think a big part of your answer was hey the cosmos SDK is just badass if you're trying to build a chain and like there's nothing comparable in the ethereum community yet I know we've we've heard the optimism team talk about um you know a Bedrock which is kind of their version of creating kind of a uh almost like a WordPress for chains we just kind of you know stamped them out and these would be Roll-Ups but Layer Two Out of the Box yeah layer two out of the box but it's not it's certainly not there yet what's interesting I think I'll take is that you know Roll-Ups like to talk about how much how like secure they are and stuff compared to like but if you go to l2beat.com you can see the actual screen we know it we know it yeah I would say the IBC system right now is actually more secure than any of the most of the Roll-Ups in practice today well we also had um vitalikon who was like wondering if we'll ever get to a place in optimistic Roll-Ups at least where where fraud proofs um actually work because we're not we're not there yet right um although I will say ZK EVMS are looking pretty pretty good from a tech perspective and uh from from from that side of things but yeah it's it's very interesting I guess one comment I want to make and then just a quick question is it does seem like because all of the cosmos core developers are also app Developers app chain developers they probably from put on your app chain hat you guys are just willing to use whatever technology app chain technology is best right and right now that seems to be Cosmos for you but like if there was a way to do kind of of Cosmos plus settling on ethereum you might decide to migrate your app there it's just not been the best approach to date right the cosmos Community has has provided the best app chain tools the brave wallet is your secure multi-train on-ramp into web3 and it's built directly into

maybe to to 2018 2017-2018 and this was I remember at the time there were two big interoperability chains because this was the narrative it was uh polka dot and it was Cosmos um and you just were talking about a failed attempt from the compound team to actually build something in in substrate that you know the poke.tech has Cosmos won that war do you think Cosmos versus polka dot is Cosmos ahead and I'm asking for obviously you're probably going to say yes because you're on team Cosmos but like give me some I objective reasons for why you think that's true um yeah okay so we could talk about a little bit about I mean we have many friends at parity in the in the polka dot Community uh IBC two polka dot is also being built by a team called composable Finance another exciting thing just talking about all the ZK progress is ZK IBC has gone from being like maybe it's like five years away to like maybe it's like a year away um there's like a lot of exciting teams that have have kind of come in and started building uh the the building blocks of ZK IVC which would potentially allow for much more interoperability with ethereum so just like kind of talk about all those things but then like like get to the heart of your question polka dot versus Cosmos which model is winning um dot Market capwise dot is winning but okay so like you know you heard in the same sentence it like basically the same presentation from Circle usdc is launching a polka dot it's launching before it's launching on Cosmos absolutely true does polka dot have an app that's going to Mint a billion dollars of usdc on it no right we have dydx like when usdc goes live on on on on uh on uh Cosmos the floor mint is a billion dollars just to move the dydx user base from starkware to with to to Cosmos this is the cut like I mean that that's like it's a very hard number it's a very hard metric but it's like like this is what happens when you bring the best apps to your ecosystem and you don't collect rent from your app developers you you build an ecosystem into which of collaboration in which they can Thrive and we can Thrive you get the best apps and then as assets and stuff move to the ecosystem you you get these like exponentials of scale that like are not possible uh you know well in other ecosystem what's interesting about that is it feels like polka dot has maybe done the strategy where they've tried to split the difference between ethereum and Cosmos and because they've been in the middle like the middle just hasn't held right whereas like ethereum it doesn't just like yeah the middle doesn't hold and so ethereum is just like hey where um we're an Empire I guess I don't think particularly think they're an evil empire but in in an Empire like they're not metallic certainly not evil no one would say that but it's all it's not evil there's some rent extraction and there's all sorts of things right I get that and it's not nearly it's as I don't consider it nearly as adversely selective as as polka dots sure you are getting these enormous Network effects from it well but so you have that and it's like it's kind of like uh the United States right and all of the chains are sort of States within the United States there's a federalist kind of like notion to it but a you know Confederacy of States as well and then you've got Cosmos on the other side which is just like Anarchy almost it's not Anarchy but it's almost like hey anything any city-state can spin up we'll we'll do a network if it's advantageous we'll do Sparta and Athens will make an alliance but maybe we won't Maple go to war but maybe we will and like it's like it's very loose but there's no rent collection paid to the kind of the cosmos Hub then you have polka dot which kind of tried to split the difference here where they tried to have kind of the uh you know the sovereignty of all of these chain experiments but then they ask the chains to pay rent economically bat back to dot holders right you have to rent out your parachain in the polka dot Network right and it just seems like that model is not picked up from an economic perspective and this is why very much right now in crypto maybe this has always been the case I've I just see these two sides there's ethereum on one side and there's Cosmos on the other and these are the two kind of parallel ideas that are playing out in crypto before us in 2022. we've used this metaphor before uh Ryan is the one that put this into my brain is that uh Nature has made a crab like 10 15 20 different times throughout history and these crabs are unrelated to each other like on the bio uh evolutionary line and that's just because the crab is a good strategy and some of the lines I've been using on this like metaphor is that if you re-roll the dice over and over and over again about how the crypto industry forms you'll get ethereum every single time and it also I think goes to show with Ryan was just saying you'll also get Cosmos it is the Central Security model of ethereum versus the app chain model of Cosmos and that is like the whole thing maybe bitcoiners will be like oh and there's also the proof of work money uh strategy as well maybe that maybe that's also true but uh my opinion that's a type of app chain yeah okay sure that's an app chain right uh so it's it's one of these two flavors maybe maybe it's a 50 50 split maybe it's an 80 20 split but it's definitely not 100 zero I definitely will take that into account I want to um talk about Mev I want to go down the Mev Rabbit Hole a little bit uh because I think that will also help uh illustrate the incentive for apps to be their own app chain uh Sunny can you talk about the Mev model of ethereum and like we can use uniswap as an example Dan elitzer just put a fantastic article talking about uh uniswap and all of the money it makes as Revenue versus the money it leaks to the ecosystem and just like real just to speed run that article of roughly one-third of the economic energy that go through uniswap is captured by uh liquidity providers the actual like service providers of uniswap about one-third goes to gas payments to transact on unit Swap and one more third goes to Mev payments front running back running like Arbitrage opportunities so there's this application on on ethereum called uniswap and of all the costs it takes users to use uniswap about one-third of that cost goes to profits for liquidity providers one-third goes to gas payments which goes to Ether holders and one-third goes to Mev Bots which are Mev pop and so the claim here is that there's a leaking a lot of value anytime you use uniswap so sonny can you talk about this in like the cosmos perspective and how Cosmos and app chains uh solve some of these problems that some of these Mev problems and are a less leaky ship when it comes to uh value capture and value accrual for apps yeah sure um yeah you know Dan's uh that was like uh proposal hey we should build like a uni chain and I was like yeah we we did it's called osmosis and Dan knows this Nathan is a major investor in osmosis uh but so the uh yeah so uh Anatoly from Solana had a you know how to tweet a couple of months ago at this point but he basically said you know he also doesn't believe in the monetary premium uh thesis right and he actually said that like I I don't think that's my I don't know about the monarchy premium stuff is a little bit too hand wavy for me but the value of l1s is the Mev that they capture and like you said exactly that like you know uniswap is leaking that Mev value to the user to to the base layer of uh of ethereum right for osmosis you know for as a vertically integrated chain there's sort of three sources of revenue right I could see it we have our app Revenue which is like you know it's a Dax training fees and all that kind of stuff um there's your transaction fee Revenue but my take is actually that transaction fee Revenue should never be a meaningful source of Revenue uh this is sort of my like concern with the whole EIP 1559 like sound ultrasound money like thesis is that like in any world in which the transaction fee okay why is what are you paying for with transaction fees you're paying for like block space of a BFD compute system and the point is that like you know I think that the FD block space and bft compute systems is going to be cheap in the long run because there's going to be so many chains and you know they're going to have a lot of uh you know as more you even in the ethereum model as more uh usage moves onto Roll-Ups the demand for base layer block sprays will go down massively and like users are not going to in any world if transaction fees are too low it's not a meaningful source of Revenue if they're too high users are not going to use it and you know ethereum had this like kind of like you know it had this like two-year period in the last starting two years ago of like oh okay you know that was high enough there's really high fees but users were still using it because there was no real Alternatives right but I don't know if that like is a especially with Roll-Ups and app chains and all this new stuff coming out I don't know if that I don't know if users are going to be willing to pay hundreds of dollars again for transactions uh so and then we kind of see this you know that's why a lot of stuff markets have moved to other chains you know nfts are very popular on you know Solana for example right or games have moved off of like completely move off of ethereum main chain altogether um so yeah the third the third source of Revenue is the Mev capture right and so osmosis we actually started with uh also before we were building a DEX we actually were just like building like Mev mitigation strategies and so we were working on something called threshold decryption um which is a way of encrypting the mempool entirely and so that way and only decrypting and executing after blocks have been finalized and committed and so you know the model that we followed at osmosis is mitigate bad Mev internalize good Mev so how where do we draw this distinction that Mev is the type of Mev when you are doing actions based off of other people's transactions right because the mempool is public you can read others transactions and you could you know sandwich them you could you know generalize front run them copy their strategies you can do all this stuff which is like not cool fundamentally that's a privacy breach and like it is a bug that the mempools are not encrypted right now so that's why we focus on building threshold decryption so that the mempools are encrypted but now there's still some types of Mev that remain right and I call these like I don't know if good Mev is the right word but they're not that it's not extractive me you're not extracting it from anyone else so examples would be arbing prices on osmosis relative to centralized exchanges or even arbing prices within osmosis pools you know there are circular routes through pools are being those together or there's um there's you know the Mars protocol is launching a lending platform on osmosis quite soon so you know triggering liquidations is another sort of you know good Mev and all of these are good things you know you want your pools to be armed you want liquidations to be happening fast but there is value in being the person to do that right and so how do we internalize good Mev and bring that s protocol of Revenue uh we're working very closely with a team called skip who's helping us you know instead of letting this stuff be like you know I call them like I call you know then them be run by these off-chain validator cartels right you know I would say like flashbots not being part of the core protocol it makes it so like you know it's sort of it ends up having to be a little bit profit maximizing when if the core the beauty of app change is because your chain hat understands the semantics of the application built on top of it it can be opinionated about how it orders transactions or and it can do things to actually promote social good right it could be like you know we are going to make sure uh you know you can't just rug liquidity we're going to make sure all trades happen first before liquidity removals happen and like so that way you know liquidity can't get drugged from under you or or we can like detect sandwiches and like you know be like oh this is an invalid transaction order we're going to move these transactions around so it's not a sandwich anymore um and like you can do things like that right to help continue to mitigate that bad mov and then on the good Mev you know we can run automatic on-chain art Bots where like you know we calculate our ARB cycles and we run an on-chain arbor that happens at the end of every block and captures that ARB Revenue it and gives it to osmo stickers or we could uh what we're going to do is have a top of the block auction but in the protocol itself so instead of relying an off-chain system the in protocol you can bid to say hey I want to be the first transaction in the block and that way way you can be the one to do all the arbs and you know uh liquidations and stuff and doing it in protocol is important because then the protocol can decide how the revenue gets shared right in if you do it off chain you know the revenue goes to like only the validators and you know maybe we have to rely on them altruistically like you know maybe we'll see a market where validators have to end up start sharing all their revenue with with their delegators right but in if you do it in protocol we can say oh we want some of this Mev Revenue to go to all stakers we want some of it to go to the community pool we want to give some of it as a kickback to users like we can like choose what to do with that Mev Revenue which is I think a very important property yeah I think that's definitely the strength of the the app chain model um you know as we move kind of this conversation to from from comparisons comparisons to ethereum and from the cosmos thesis uh to the world of uh the new atom 2.0 economics that were released um I haven't gone through that paper there are a few things that that stuck out to me and I'm going to try my attempt at summarizing but you guys uh go in there and and let me know what the what the main thrust of these changes are it seems like before atoms from an economic perspective the token economics for an investor anyways weren't really great kind of sucked at least did not accrue monetary premium and Zaki you're going thumbs down can you talk about like why did why did it thumbs down in agreement right yes thumbs down thumbs down in agreement yeah I know right so why did they suck before I mean like this was a big part of our presentation at Cosmo verse my presentation specifically you know it was like look um you can think of what Adam was foremost in the first iteration was a prototype of a proof of State chain right we kind of you know we would say that from our point of view that Pro our argument is that before the cosmos have launched there was no live proof of stake chain that had really taken proof of stake economically seriously and done it in like a rigorous way from like the computer science level all the way to the economics level we I believe that the cosmosite was the first Gene to do this um so but it was a prototype of what does proof of stake look like how can it be done in a rigorous way like all of these things um but it was only a prototype and like the best way I would describe it is also is we have an app chain thesis what the hell is the app of the cosmos Hub uh it doesn't appear to have an app so we were kind of the uh uh you know and so you know the uh you know both Ethan and I talked about this so this was been a big theme of you know the last week of our lives and like the preceding like nine months of pulling all these ideas together um has been about you know okay we would like to go out and we would like to say one we want to make Adam a better ecosystem asset but part of that but it inherent to that idea is we must create an app for the cosmos Hub why don't I let you kind of take your other do other takeaways for the paper because I'm curious in real time getting like what you what you took away from it um and then uh but I can talk a little bit about but yes so like issuance is changing we are moving towards you know not this exponential inflation we think that helps Define the ecosystem we think it makes Adam closer to a monetary a monetary asset like all of those things and we think those things are good okay first leg of the story let's camp on that because as a as a monetary maximalist you'll note that the first thing I noticed in this paper was um hey the monetary policy has changed how this is interesting and I you know I I almost wondered in the back of my mind if it's like if the ethereum community kind of capitulated and being like ah Cosmos these app chain guys were right they were right all along right we're gonna do more app chains in ethereum I almost saw maybe some of recognition from the cosmos community that huh this this ultrasound money thing hmm maybe we want our atom token to actually exhibit some characteristics of of money and have a a better issuance policy that's kind of what I saw but maybe that's my bias reading of the thing and so what I saw is previously I think um issuance for atom token holders was that between like seven and twenty percent per year that was the rate of issuance issuance in the market it's adaptive to the amount that's staked so we target a stake rate of 67 percent um uh because of you know we want to keep the make it very expensive to attack to like have for there to be enough liquid atom to accumulate to actually attack the network right um uh and you know so you know we and and so basically you know what pulls atoms away from being there are like what's on centralized exchanges that centralized exchanges themselves are not staking um and then all the atoms that are out there uh in LP pools all of that stuff um uh you know that pushes the staking rate down the uh uh inflation rate goes up to compensate so um right so like since osmo so we had dropped to about seven percent inflation okay um uh uh new atom issuance and then since kind of Osmosis launch and the IBC ecosystem we've been averaging about nine-ish percent in this PID Loop um but and that has translated into a staking apy for atoms of about you know 19 20 gotcha and now what are the changes there seem to be almost two phases of these changes like a transition phase and then almost a steady state and the first phase issuance actually increases I believe but then in the second phase it kind of like tapers off and it's going to decrease to like one percent yeah there's there's a bunch of complicated moving pieces in the issuance thing a big part of the framework around issuance though is that Cosmos is taking a very different approach to liquid staking than let's say ethereum has where I would say ethereum fought tooth and nail to make it as hard as possible for like liquid staking to emerge and it emerged anyways because the economics are so compelling um the cosmos ecosystem has been taking a approach of hey we want to make sure that there are just a large variety of liquid staking providers and so that there's competition and so you don't have a situation where a Lido like entity becomes like super dominant but we think on the whole like the good staking staking derivative assets are actually really important to the security budget of the system um so and the the logic there is it allows people to stack their yield so rather than saying Adam holders like we're gonna try and like print so many atoms that we compensate you for the opportunity cost of everything else you could do with Adam we're saying liquid stake your atom take your liquid state data go do all the other things that you could do in D5 go use the app ecosystem with your liquid state data and have it still contribute to the security budget of the cosmos so that that'll so the first thesis is so there's like um probably about like six liquid staking protocols launching or in the midst of launching on top of in the cosmos ecosystem right now um so there's like there's a lot of activity around that so we're sort of projecting in the future saying hey we think this over the next three years we expect these protocols will succeed uh my team at occlusion um has been working has been uh has been working really like one of our big contributions of the occlusion team uh to the uh to the paper has been that we spent the last like 18 months making changes to the like default Cosmo staking module to improve the ux of liquid staking so all of that stuff so that's happening so staking yield starts to fall uh uh starts to fall on like a yearly basis in this now the issuance goes up but that is issuance to the community treasury it is it is because you know a lot of chains have had this idea of having like the on-chain Dao being able to have funds and fund something we started the cosmos Hub out with a very small amount uh where there's only about uh half a percent of of new issuance goes into the and so like we have about you know 10 million dollars I think of token of value in our in our uh uh community pool whereas you know some other l1s have will have like a third of their market cap um in in the community pool um to like fund new things and one of the things that we're saying is in this new app vision to execute on that app Vision you need working capital like we're gonna have to go and do business development we're going to have to onboard chains onto uh this interchange security thing like there's going to be a lot of stuff that needs to be done that wasn't really conceived of in the original Cosmos level but like you know if you hold atoms you're going to be a voter on what those funds are being so like the extent to which is dilutive I think is a little overplayed because and then we're saying after this three-year period there's not going to be any more new funding going into the community pool there's not into the on-chain treasury um there's uh and then we're gonna drop the staking yield basically to about one percent that makes sense okay so that's the economic change for atoms and lower staking yield is kind of or like lower issuance is the eventual outcome that'll take some years to play out and you also mentioned liquid staking which I noticed in the paper making that kind of a First-Class citizen I would say in the cosmos ecosystem and the way it's liquid sticky is probably it's not a first-class citizen in ethereum it's just it's kind of an app that a third party creates um and then I also noticed like you're you're posing the questions Aki of like what is the app of the cosmos Hub itself and is the app of the cosmos Hub not interchange security isn't it like isn't that the thing I said so talk talk about this and this I think uh is is sort of the idea that um you can call on atom validators Cosmos Hub validators to also secure your app chain if you want is this the case is this what interchange security means yeah so all contrast I don't we talk about two terms one is mesh security the other was an interchange security okay technical Primitives are very similar are basically this almost identical between them they're about you know translating staking information from and slashing information from one chain to another chain so like if you fault on one chain you get slashed on another chain um what's called interchange security but like your uh the version in which you replicate The Hub validator set um okay so when we started with this interchange security thing I was like the biggest skeptic that we would find anyone who cared about it I was like anyone who's really serious about building an app will like want to be in their own Sovereign chain why would anybody else want to do this like and then we found we found like an enormous amount of uh of uh customer demand for for interchange security that like uh or like we call them consumer chains um so chains that consume security from The Hub we found so much demand for and I'm like like it was like a shock to me but I've understood now in in in the in in the past like what are the what are the things that interchange security is offering that people get uh that is like appealing to people one category of thing is there are very high value users like usdc for instance um who want to be able to like launch be strongly affiliated with the developer Community core the exchanges the custodians the the community around Adam um and like do not want to think about tokenomics they just like don't want to like that's like just not something that they would like really at all want to do um and so that's like one really strong use case which is like really powerful use cases that accrue value to the whole ecosystem and crew value to the cosmos Hub um but like don't want to think about their own tokenomics at all other things are hey we are building something that's like actually very security sensitive like liquid staking where if like you have a major liquid staking provider and it gets taken over it like cat there's like a cascading effect on the security of every other chain that is per is is like running on top of their liquid staking protocol so those chains have also wanted to affiliate uh more closely with the cosmos Hub um and then there's the sense of hey I want to be able to build like and really Target just like the network effects around Adam the wide holder base all of that stuff these are three team uh themes that we see popping up over and over again and frankly this has give it this like again has finally given us a sense of what is the purpose of the cosmos Hub which is to enable these things to succeed that is cool um I I guess another thing I I noticed was um some something that you guys are doing with Mev on uh can I add one more thing about the Hub yeah yeah go ahead relates in the mesh security Vision so um I taught a class on Switzerland in uh at UC Berkeley it's my favorite country a lot of class on Switzerland on the subject of Switzerland yeah yeah eight lecturers talked about history politics economics like everything it's all on my website very neutral country yes so you know how did Switzerland become it's one of the richest countries in the world right uh and there's many things that that went into that right I think the role of its credible neutrality that is played throughout history was very important one thing that people maybe don't realize is that uh Switzerland you know it's CR it's neutral but it actually had one of the best militaries in the world and even till today it actually is one of the best militaries in the world but from like you know the period of like 1200 until like Napoleon basically they were like Europe's mercenaries they were the best most like respected military in all of Europe but because they were neutral they acted as mercenaries and went and like defended whoever would pay for them and I see the role of the cosmos Hub to be this credit incredibly neutral system that is a we will you pay it for security and you get this like amazing Economic Security from it so that's where the military for hire military For Hire it's like you know you don't want to have to come up with your own military well you know uh you can have you you can you can pay the cost of top and you'll and that that's the role I feel that it plays in this mesh security vision so the idea here is that app chains maybe at Genesis don't do this because they're at Genesis but then their product Market fit happens their utility is proven out their value increases and then they can start to be like hey you know what we can afford security uh and so then they start to tap into this like credibly neutral Army uh which thing can secure them other direction well I will I'll just say to one one of the things that uh is like really cool and I think unique about our vision of shared security is we have specced out the whole system to the extent where you can seamlessly like just through like the standard kind of upgrading application upgrading process that we use in Cosmos both join uh uh uh interchange security um without disrupting your IBC connections or anything or leave interchange security so you know communities are still giving the uh given the uh it's not like they have like if they if they like find the Hub excessively value extractive for the security that it provides um it's very it'll be very possible to leave it'll be possible to go join someone else's shared security environment too um or like be your own software app chain um and so like again this is like a long-term commitment we're creating Market forces and Cosmos that ensure that this is a pluralist environment and that like we are not creating any sort of artificial rent seeking like the Hub has to really provide its value otherwise um we'll provide value otherwise no one will do this um because the Mev has been like Mev censorship all of these things hugely relevant to the ethereum community so so we've we've heard a little bit about what does Mev look like in the pure app chain thesis um but one of the things that we you know I've talked a lot about with the Mev you know flashbots teams we also have some very good Meb teams inside of of Cosmos uh Skip and Mecca Tech uh who are you know doing also like building you know businesses around Mev in the cosmos um and one of the things that we've been talking about um uh most um one of the things that like is built into it is again we don't think transaction fees will ever be high like we don't think transaction fees will be a meaningful amount of Revenue but you know in a world where there's like atom usdc other assets that are major Fiat uh or on-ramps between Cosmos uh into the cosmos ecosystem at least one hop of every economic sort of loop or economic activity will frequently start within what they call it the atom economic zone The Interchange secured area of Adam will probably be a place where a lot of economic activity originates and the ability to sort of Arbitrage that so statistical Arbitrage without not sandwiching or anything but just knowing hey someone is minted a whole bunch of usdc and we see them issuing an IBC packet that kind of information is likely to be valuable that block space is likely to be valuable so one of the things that we're proposing in the in the in the hub 2.0 white paper is that like one of the again applications on the Hub is this box-based Market that any chain in the ecosystem whether it's interchange secured or not can opt into participating with and say we're actually going to package a product that is like a better product than like what Skip and mechatech could build right now which is guaranteed uh the guaranteed ability to like have a transaction at the top of the block across many blocks over some contiguous period of time and that the Hub is a natural place to like hold this auction and execute box so right now Cosmos the atom token is coming in at 23 on coin gecko the total coin market cap and it's kind of behind some tokens that I never really would expect it to be behind I'm still behind Litecoin uh a lot of tokens are sadly behind Ripple uh light Litecoin is the one that comes to mind uh it's that's right before it at 22. uh it doesn't make any sense to me because it's Litecoin uh all it's got is Lindy uh do you guys Envision that uh Adam actually enters the top 10 crypto Assets in the future as some given amount of time um if that doesn't happen Adam I will not be hip satisfied like I woke up considered that like the work that I've been doing will not have been a success like there is a like I like I believe that this that this this work that went into atom 2.0 has created a top 10 aspect like when executed creates a top 10 asset um and if the market doesn't agree with me uh you know but and like there's as a as a entrepreneur it's like you go out you bring your best ideas to the market the market punches you in the face um and so we'll see um but uh yeah that's what we're trying that that is I I would say that is up explicitly my goal this atom 2.0 Sunny any thoughts um yeah I mean I'll I'll admit I'm not as focused on the atom side of things I believe you know I focus on Cosmos level at the vision and then you know I'm very focused I'm very focused on the cosmos vision and then very focused on the osmosis chain um we're trying to build osmosis we're trying to build the decentralized version of binance Finance is a top 10 asset and gospel will be one day too uh Zaki the ethereum ecosystem and Community like largely on on the page of like yeah we're gonna flip Bitcoin one day uh do you think Cosmos is is there a part of Cosmos that's like Adam is going to flip eath one day um like okay so I'll I'll I'll just give you where I feel like I can always tell you my feelings I can't I have become really probably more despondent about bitcoin's long-term future than I ever have been um I own more East today than I've ever owned in the past I own much more Adam but I own more Ethan I've ever owned before I moan more eats than Bitcoin um uh I think ethereum is doing a great job uh and like deserves is like the better representative of the cryptocurrency community the values that I believe in and I feel more aligned with ethereum than in the past um and so I'm not I I don't I'm not building with this with like oh I have to flip Eve I wanna I need to flip all of the that is between me there's a lot of it guys this has been a lot of fun I really feel like listeners at the end of this episode will understand the cosmos ecosystem so much more including how it's going to evolve in the future and what's so interesting to me is these two communities ethereum and Cosmos is like you see ethereum veering towards Cosmos right getting more into app change and this sort of thing you also see in places Cosmos veering more towards uh ethereum at least with atoms and kind of monetary policy improvements and you know it's uh interesting to see these two communities one thing I've respected out of both is uh they are both the community of Builders like you guys are just Cosmos is building a lot and it's hard to be bearish on Builder activity when you get 1500 people at a conference in a bear market and you know they're there because they think they're building something cool uh that is special and that is certainly something to watch so uh we're definitely watching it at bankless I guess last question for you both so let's fast forward you know five years into the future ten years into the future where do you think Cosmos ends up what does crypto look like and what does the cosmos ecosystem look like maybe five years into the future or ten years from the future or just any point in time where you feel like the vision is fulfilled Zaki over to you um in so okay so I mean my my expectation is is that by the time the vision is fulfilled most people who use cryptocurrency based technologies will kind of not really know whether or not they're using a cosmos thing an ethereum thing and a Solana thing and hopefully what I want is them just to abuse we use a thing where they're where they are not being exploited where there's not being front-rated where they're par where where digital Market okay so like this this comes down to the question I think which you know uh I have a good way of articulating now digital markets in the future will be all markets and I'm building for a future in which digital markets are open source public goods that's like flat out what I've tried to accomplish I don't really care about anything else I just view the tools we've built as cosmos as an essential part of getting there I also think ethereum largely shares this Vision um and so feel very aligned with ethereum but like so if we're successful we will have open source digital markets that provide economic coordination for the entire human race um and it like works it's you know and no one is exploiting or extracting Red Sea because you can't um and that is the world that like is that is the Utopia open source digital markets that sakis Utopia what's yours Sonny mine is for a long time you know like I mentioned I've always I Really Love Organic hayekian systems and uh part of that I I think that like build rebuilding uh the infrastructures of society away from these like very top-down organized systems to like bottom-up localized look yeah localized systems where you know people make bilateral treaties multilateral treaties build communities and organize you know it's it you know it's meshes all the way up right and I I really believe in ideas like uh web of trust based systems um you know I started working on one of the reasons I started working on Cosmos was I just thought that you know I really wanted to work on proof of stake and I you know I was working on that you know I saw that I thought the classes team was the most like uh you know most farthest Along on proof of State actually and so and I yeah they were uh and so now that like you know as of last month or two weeks ago over 50 of market cap is running on proof of stake I'm like that's awesome but now what's like the next thing I think there's like I think there's things we can do even better than proof of stake I I really believe there's like a world where we can build like a web of trust based consensus protocol that will actually be even more decentralized than proof of stake um and I think there's like a lot of like I don't know I just want to keep tearing down like centralized or even you know high levels of communication required systems and build more organic mesh systems so at bankless we use the metaphor of exploring the frontier quite frequently and the cosmos name actually is very conducive to this so say a listener is listened to this and they're they're on board and they want to go explore the cosmos uh in ethereum we have like metamask you gotta have metamask uh what's the toolkit for people that need that what's the toolkit that they need to be equipped with to go explore the Cosmos first what's like the metamask of Cosmos or just like what are the tools that listeners should probably start with in order to go explore Cosmos um you should go get a Kepler wallet which is actually built by our team uh but you you know go on a centralized exchange buy Adam which is the you know entry point into Cosmos today you IBC it to osmosis do a swap for a token called Stars you IVC it to stargaze and go buy your first bad kids nft that's your that's you know that's your onboarding path that's your to-do list cool yeah and like I think if you just look at that okay you've got like an nft app an onboarding place a decks and just use that experience and say hey is this how different does this feel from ethereum but then go look at how much you spent on gas and we're getting that we're getting it better right now each of those steps requires a click and you know at least on osmosis our view is that every click loses half of our users and so we're working on a lot of the tooling to like make that entire process feel like one click guys what what we'll do is uh after the show before this is actually published so by the time you're listening to this bankless listener we will have a little tutorial for everything Sunny just said that we can link to on the bank list uh website so uh you could see sunny and zaki's ideas and how to get started with Cosmos and start exploring the cosmos guys this has been a lot of fun thank you so much for joining us thank you action items for you bankless listeners the first is we'll include a link to the cosmos 2.0 atom 2.0 white paper check that out also referenced was the inevitability of unichain an article by Dan ellitzer and of course we'll include a link that I just mentioned to that tactic on how to get started with Cosmos and this is for Zaki and and sunny if you guys are willing a thing that we've been doing is having our guests actually read out our outro of risks and disclaimers crypto is risky you can lose what you put in but we're heading west to the frontier it isn't for everyone but you're we're glad you're with us on
