this is what I did the last bear market and I came out with more conviction stronger than ever incredibly excited about the future Nation happy third week of June it is a bear Market officially a bear Market David do you feel embarrassed this week well I feel now that I am capitulated to the bear Market I'm like well do I continue to be bearish or are we done here what's the point of being buried yeah what's the point of being bearish now it's all the bearishness that's already happened right well that could be wrong and could be wrong yeah we'll have to get into that and uh your new setup in New York the first roll-up I think we've done in New York and you've got like a bear Market Vibes with the big brick wall behind you is this your new place are you always gonna have this brick bear Market jail is like yeah I'm the bear Market jail time yeah I was overly bullish to I got punished for being a Primavera now I'm in the bear Market Perma Bowl so now I'm in a Paramore bear Market in prison jail yeah exactly that's exactly right well we got a lot to talk about this week so I hope bankless listeners have their morning copy coffee coffee it's Friday morning bankless ain't stopping in the bear Market every Friday this is gonna come at you actually I won't be I'll be out next week but Dave's got it covered all right every Friday bankless will ship a weekly roll-up and this is yours this morning we're going to talk about a few things the first David crypto is crashing why we look at the Historical precedence of that what else we got uh we also got of course the FED raising interest rates which is definitely a part of the whole crypto crashing story but also there's a you know everything's crashing uh so this is actually a first for crypto crypto summer crashed with well also everything else crashing too uh and so we're going into the details around with that the tide is out part three of the topics of the week the tide is out and many many people are caught swimming without swim trunks we're going to talk about who got caught swimming naked uh and then last but last not least Ryan take us home yeah Celsius is one of the people who got caught without swim trunks so is one of the largest hedge funds three arrows Capital we're going to talk about that story it just uh came up in the last week from our last roll up uh and then CFI is breaking all around us but defy didn't we got some hot takes at the end so stay tuned and make sure you like And subscribe if you enjoy these episodes of course on YouTube and rate and review if you're listening to this on the podcast go ahead and do that you know what David we're going to get to uh Celsius in our show in a little bit but actually our friends at notional they are a defy borrowing and lending platform and on the topic of C5 breaking but D5 didn't guess what didn't break David defy and notional notional still spitting out the yield the fixed apy yield so uh notional is giving you 3.08 percent on your eth right now on your ether uh and you can of course also get usdc dye or wbct lending as well so notional part of the whole part of the crypto industry that's working just fine right now uh giving you your yield when you want it where you want it so you can check that out there's a link in the show notes bankless.cc slash notional if you want to get some of that dependable yield what I love about this is this is a fixed rate so you can sign up for a fixed rate yield for a year also there's no counterparty here that's the problem that's the thing that got Celsius in trouble is went into a black box there were all sorts of counterparties who knows what they were doing with it this is all on chain this is uh how D5 solves some of the problems that are lingering in C5 anyway go check that out the link that David just mentioned but David we got to get into the markets man you ready for some Bitcoin talk has been a bloody week give it to us straight don't yeah okay don't hold any punches no don't hold back well Bitcoin lost basically ten thousand dollars in the last week which I mean if it was at the highs of like seventy thousand dollars that would be one thing but it was at thirty thousand dollars last week and it went down basically ten thousand dollars it's come up from the low so we're at twenty one thousand dollars right now but overall Bitcoin is down you ready for this Ryan thirty percent Thirty in the week half percent in a single week wow this is a bloody week uh It's gotta be historic in some ways but tell us about eth as well um yeah ether uh another uh oof week of course I think that to State the obvious start of the week at eighteen hundred dollars we are currently at one thousand one hundred dollars so last lost seven hundred dollars down 38 oof can we talk about the lows here so how low did did ether get this is yeah did it get into triple digits not yet right but close in D5 markets it actually did Wick down uh on uniswap below uh one one thousand dollars so in in D5 very very briefly got whipped down but it got bought right back up so I don't really count it it's more of an anomaly uh so yeah the I would call the official low at about one thousand twenty dollars an of note though that is lower much lower than the all-time high of the last bull market so the all-time high the last bull market was 14 000 something 14 20 14 30 14 40 something like that and we are below the last all-time high uh so this is unprecedented yeah unprecedented of course uh ethereum's only had one cycle so like one big bearish oh it's got two now this is the second uh Bitcoin did it drop below its last high like just about I mean yeah it's basically there basically there so it's low is uh 20 166 on this chart um well uh this is the the wick you were just mentioning on unit swap where we dropped into triple digits but we're still hanging above uh into the um quadruple digit territory for Eve but what is the Bitcoin chart telling us yeah we went down from .059 to 0.052 uh down 12 percent so oof uh and I'm gonna chalk this up to a number of different reasons mainly eth being collateral and defy uh and overall collateral across crypto so that collateral win we have liquidation events that collateral gets sold off heavily uh and so like three hours Capital those look at liquidating eth Celsius was liquidating staked eth uh creating that incredible discount between steak teeth and eth right now uh and so just like the eth BTC ratio just getting absolutely hammered I'm going to add another reason to the list is you called the bottom on that right now I'll bring that up let's keep on going it's another reason we knew we were headed down at the bottom every single week this is the absolute bottom of the hvtc you know what that means guys I'm calling the bottom again next week all right uh how about uh total crypto market cap uh we gotta be are we below one trillion oh yeah yo yes sir we are we uh started last week at 1.3 trillion we are down to 0.94 trillion we lost 306 trillion oh excuse me trillion a billion dollars in total crypto market cap last week fell out of the quadruple comma Club look at that um I remember when we first surpassed that one trillion dollar Milestone and now we are back under it so we're retracing a lot of the gains over the past uh year or two um how about this like how unprecedented is this drop can you compare this to 2018 and look at the history here because this felt very fast and very steep yeah so look at this try this is the 2018 bubble uh of to the total crypto market cap this is an index of all crypto assets so it peaked out at some something like 80 billion dollars I think excluding stable coins although stable coins weren't that very that weren't that big that back then uh so it peaked out at basically 800 billion dollars fell down to below a hundred billion dollars like 91 billion dollars and it took 350 days to do that Ryan that's it basically took a whole year from Peak to trough top to bottom it took a whole year of time and inside that time there were multiple like plus 40 percent like run-ups like bear traps um and so or excuse me bull traps because like it would go up and then people get really bullish like look at that run I remember like ether fell down from uh 1400 down to 300 and then rose up to 900 and then fell back down to 300 again and like Bitcoin did something very similar uh and so like even in what was ultimately a one year long downtrend there were periods of plus 20 plus 30 plus 40 price Rises uh we did not see that at all in this particular uh bear market and in comparing this to the 2022 bear we go down at 70 percent in 217 days rather than 350 days that is 40 faster if we are calling the bottom right now if this is the bottom uh which it could be it could also not be um but if the if this where we are right now is at 217 days versus 350 days and right now we are down 70 70.6 in total crypto market cap versus where we were last last time which was what was that percentage 87 so uh not we have 17 percent less red than in 2018 um uh and also but also 20 like we're only 40 percent the time or 60 of the time so like if you are comparing cross cycles that could lean into like we still got a little bit more to go like if we went down 50 what would that put us down to if we went down 50 right now that would be at 85 percent um and so that would start to be comparable uh so like there's plenty of evidence to suggest that the the bottom is not in yet although there's also evidence to suggest that the bottom is in yet so we'll talk about that further on in the show I think we might what who knows what'll happen again this is prognostication we're not Traders but like I think we'll see some relief rallies but I don't think this bear Market is over we definitely have a ways to go from my perspective then if you look at 2018 there was this recovery phase so even though we bottomed in December 2018 it didn't feel like the bottom at that point in time because then we just kind of you know crapped out and just hung at a price point you weren't sure whether we're gonna dip or not uh anyway this this could be a a long one and there could be some more pain ahead is what we're saying but how did the gas market hold up in ethereum because this is interesting you'd think this would be a big stress test what are we looking at here yeah so the average gas price over the last week was about 38 gray you can see that if you scroll down a little bit Ryan uh the which is kind of crazy uh the gas prices by week peaked out at 32 scroll down a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more there we go total Gas Distribution that green curve on on the right side uh yeah 38 Quay which is crazy I remember in during the covid crash where ether prices crypto prices on ethereum crashed like 40 50 60 percent inside of 24 hours gas spiked up to 300 gray which was unprecedented at that time we had never seen gas prices above like 10 or something and it went up to like 300 and we had in uh we had just irregularity in the D5 market so we had maker vaults uh being liquidated for zero dollar collaterals which was bad but like the D5 liquidations right now were totally regular and the gas markets were totally balanced and nothing really got out of hand and so this is a big story that is really being discussed right now is how efficient and regular the D5 markets were doing one of the fastest drawdowns in crypto history it's actually pretty crazy it's actually incredible I think that's a theme of this episode how well defy held up how resilient it has been and and the kind of the more centralized aspects of crypto's financial Market have been the things that have been stress tested and those are the things that have been as the tide rips out not wearing any pants um but David let's get to kind of like how people people feeling because there's a lot of pain in the market right now and especially for first like cyclers maybe come in the last year or you know 18 months or so they're not used to this level of pain I mean they've been born into a world that's been basically up only and I've seen a lot of um I guess um pain type tweets on on Twitter I mean people very worried about the future of crypto wondering if it's all over I know we talked about this in our bear Market special edition Market episode that we did on Tuesday but uh how do you feel like the community is hanging in there and like how are you doing with things I'm generally a pretty Zen stoic individual so if I really need to like I really need to kind of like dive deep to figure out like my emotional state um I do have I do have fear uh for and this is very related to uh the the Federal Reserve the United States economy uh and just Fiat ecosystems at large and so while like crypto seems like the fundament like the prices and fundamentals are always incongruent fundamentals of the crypto industry are better than ever and they only continue to get better and especially and that's proven out in the regularity of the D5 markets while we had Liquidations in C5 C5 broke D5 didn't and that's proving use case proving its legitimacy but it's going to take a while for that to settle in and meanwhile like the job of the FED is to cut to control inflation and not send us into a recession and I feel like we are already committed to a recession which is one thing like we've been through recessions before many of us lived through the 2008 crisis even though I was just a kid I still still felt it I am actually I do have fear of an actual like d depression wow yeah uh and the and I don't know if this is just because I read a lot of like Ray dalio and we've seen what happens to other Fiat economies when they lose their legitimacy like the FED is the Fed is losing trust uh they're whiplashing the world around uh like I don't like we also have the war in Ukraine so like gas prices are are up and they're not going to respond to interest rates because that's a different part of the world's economic system food prices are up and they're only going to get worse as far as I can tell I'm not an expert I only see what I see the information that I I see on like Twitter and like well I do think that I know where to look doesn't mean that I actually that things can change I don't know but like I think there's I'm worried that food prices continue to go up and that continues to do harm to the American economy and to the global economy inflation can't really get under control because it's like 50 of inflation is energy and energy you can't control with inflation rates and so like I'm conflicted in that like wow there's so many cool things in defy but like it doesn't really matter if like the world burns down and so I do have that fear yeah I get that fear and I think that's a fear a lot of people are um are thinking about right now one bit of uh one thought I have for listeners is um if you want a take from somebody who's in macro and also studies crypto go listen to our episode earlier this week from Jim Bianco um Jim shares some of the concern that you just stated but he doesn't think we're headed for a depression he thinks we're already in a recession but um he talks about kind of the way out we're going to be talking about a little bit more of the way out as we get into the FED section I um you know one thing that's helped me through these times because you know been through bear markets before as have you David and I'm wondering if this could help some of the bankless listeners is all of you guys are probably going through like the five stages of of green grief here right like you got got the denial phase you've got the anger phase bargaining depression acceptance is the last phase and you probably oscillate between some of these early phases like back and forth in a given day like sometimes you're denying it sometimes you're angry sometimes you're you're like well it's not so bad and then sometimes you're just straight out depressed um one thing I think we can help you with is getting to that end stage which is the acceptance stage and that's the stage you want to be in if you're going to get productive again uh to get to that stage you have to accept some hard truths and I think one of those hard truths is you mentioned earlier David you're fully ready to capitulate and weren't in a fully like full-on bear market right now that's getting to the acceptance phase and I just want to say this out loud for people we are in a bear market right now things will get worse before they get better this will take a while okay hear us when we're saying this we are in a bear Market things will get worse for a while and it could take a while now once you've accepted that then you can get to a phase where you can be productive again and one of the decisions you have to make if you accept that truth in that reality is what do I do what do I do with my crypto portfolio and you have kind of three options ahead of you number one you just sell it and leave crypto my conviction's gone you know if we're entering a you know kind of uh sort of a very sad Global state I'm better off with like food and supplies and like you know shelter and like I don't know gold I don't know what you're gonna do with your money but maybe something else maybe that's an option for you right uh the second thing you do people could do is trade the pumps and the dips right so they see these and they're like oh you know it's it's dipping Now's the Time to buy and then they sell it goes up another 200 300 they sell um I think a lot of people choose to do that the third thing you can do is just hold through the pain all right um of course if do the first one if you're not convicted on crypto right it's like and again uh I think holding through a bear Market requires conviction you can't get conviction through listing someone like David or myself you have to develop that on your own um so if you don't have a conviction maybe number one is the right option uh it's not an option for me I do have a tremendous amount of conviction in this asset class so that's not the one I chose but a lot of people who have conviction in the asset class they default to two where David they start like trying to trade the dips and the pumps and they try to think they can make money on that so many people in these bear Market scenarios get wrecked by that David like you do not know that you are a Trader then you're not a Trader don't do it that's what I'm saying so like I I'm I'm I'm kind of encouraging the bankless audience to be very careful before they start trying to trade these dips and the pumps and that sort of thing if you're good at that game maybe you could do it but most people 95 of people should not be playing that game and so you come to acceptance and the third option which is just hold through the pain is hold through the pain you have conviction and if you decide to hold through the pain there's some things you can do for your mental health right now okay one of the things you can do is delete your price apps for a bit all right stop checking daily hourly every 10 minutes every five minutes stop doing that that is not good for your dopamine levels all right it's like not good for your psychological Health it's not going to help you if what you're deciding to do is holding through the pain anyway you're not going to trade any of these moves so why check it number two I think you can start working on yourself a bit more and maybe this means hitting the gym maybe this means reading some books that you have on economics on philosophy on on History maybe this means learning to code there's so many disparate skills that crypto requires to be really good and you know you can draw these out and you can start learning them during the bear Market the third thing is you can go build something David you mentioned like you and I started a podcast in a newsletter the last bear Market uh maybe art and if TC is going to come back it's gonna boom again maybe learn to code maybe get into a community we talked about layer twos being incredible opportunities for the future maybe you decide do join governance in one of these layer 2 ecosystems that opportunity is in front of you it's way less crowded there's way more signal go do that number four You Can level up all right forget price just learn about the new D5 protocols David you put out a great Alpha leak episode on Volts protocol how much do you know about interest rate swaps guys because I don't know a ton but I can level up through bankless content and start to use some of these D5 protocols and then number five I think you get to a place in acceptance you start doing these things where you're like ah okay we've it's not over it's not actually over everyone in crypto went through this before this is how you earn the crypto appreciation people think you get lucky with prices of crypto going high in a bolt run you don't you do but you also don't this is very much about your ability to hold through these deep dark crypto Winters uh and that to me is how you get out of this this is what I did the last bear Market and I came out with more conviction stronger than ever incredibly excited about the future no that I think those are some fantastic bits of advice Ryan and just had to add on more clarity and color to that uh my mental health uh is actually bad in Bull markets like it's it's the things yeah things are noisy they're hard to reason about I'm confused like there I can't look away from crypto Twitter like there's like my attention is being pulled in every single Direction and like what a bear Market is is a bear Market is a return to fundamentals and you can apply that same lesson to your own psychology and your own personal well-being like take this opportunity to take a step back go touch some grass uh go go exercise because if you are exercising it's hard to have bad mental health that is a there's a connection between these two things and then just like zoom out and think about not like the the forced one to four week time frame perspectives of the bull market but the one to four year perspectives of the bear market and that is how you create like maintain your sanity and so just to reiterate what Ryan said what do you want to get done in the next one to four years do you want to like get fit and get out there and see the sunlight and get away from crypto Twitter do you want scenes and like if you need gaining conviction about like what we're here to do in this space get educated like understand why we're going through a bear Market understand federal rate Federal uh reserve and like monetary policy and the choices that they're doing understand the history of Fiat currencies and the choices that Nations have made to uh to manage those things to get a long-term perspective and to prepare yourself and your family and your loved ones and your bags for the future uh and just just so like again zoom out get rational get get sober the bull Market's over uh we got the is it time the hangovers here uh and so as soon as we can skip forward like you said into that acceptance phase we can start to actually plan for the future and rebuild ourselves our portfolios and like our our industry there you go guys I hope that was helpful to some of you listening who are feeling the pain right now that's how David and I get through it and cope and how many crypto investors do as well many of the ogs that uh that you hear about in crypto people don't even look around do these things yeah absolutely um let's get to the FED all right what are they doing this week uh we're still on markets that segue was important for our mental health David but let's talk about the traditional economy numbers what's up first yeah so this is the Dixie the dxy which is a dollar Index which is comparing the value of the dollar compared to a basket of currencies it's at all-time highs uh well not all-time highs it's at a high sense so 2002 basically uh and so all-time highs for as long as I've been paying attention to money uh and so what this means is that people are really demanding the dollar and this is what happens when interest rates go up for the world Reserve currency they are making the dollar more scarce they're making people with outstanding loans from the Federal Reserve pay back those loans at faster rates therefore people need to get their hands on more dollars so they're selling more assets the Dixie at all-time highs so these are just correlated um the world since the world's debt is nominated in U.S dollars demand for dollars is going to go up as the FED increases and interest rates therefore things sell off to access dollars and that includes the bond market something that's unique that happened in the last two weeks Ryan is that both the equities market and the bond market have gotten hammered which usually those things go in inverse correlation to each other but in this week the last couple weeks they are uh correlated with each other both going down both getting hammered because both markets are trying to get their hands on dollars everyone's trying to get their hands on dollars it's funny that uh with inflation so high the dollar goes up but that's exactly what happens when people are panicking and uh uncertain um also we could take a look at the a gas the gas Mark is I'm not talking about ethereum gas I'm talking about traditional gas it used to fill your tank with and uh we are at highs as well so above five dollars is the U.S national average per gallon um you know part of this of course is uh covid right lack of oil uh refineries and processing the US a big part of this of course is the war in Ukraine there's lots of issues and this is one of the issues the FED can't really fix it can't print more gasoline can't print more barrels of oil and it looks in the future like it's going to continue to rise as long as we're looking at numbers David what is the third number that we have here yeah this is of course the CPI the the metric that really kicked off the last 40 percent downwards price action Consumer Price uh prices up 8.6 percent year over year on ending May 2022 and so while people and this is why crypto prices went down so violently and equities too people were uh hoping praying that inflation had peaked uh that in April and so we were going to see the CPI numbers in may be lower hopefully in the seven uh ideally in the sixth range um eight like the low eights would have been just like meh okay fine but it was 8.6 which was a decent amount of inflation uh above what expectations were and so this goes from the last holdouts who thought that inflation was transitory capitulated and so the entire Market reorganized itself to go from transitory inflation to uh long-term inflation plans and so assuming that the FED is going to raise interest rates faster than expected the faster than the market had accounted for and so that's why crypto prices and all prices are down bad I I do think 8.6 percent is actually a a lower limit of that too there's an interesting website that rolled out recently called trueflation which tries to predict like a better non-government uh inflation rate and that was tracking websites not loading right now but but uh you know it's bad when the private Market comes up with its own inflation numbers because you can't trust the governments this is this is classic end of stage Fiat cycle things when the government says oh inflation it's only this percent and then meanwhile the market understands it to be way higher yeah I found trueflation really interesting so they're saying annual inflation is about 10.8 so already double digits and if you look at things like housing for instance like housing is 12.3 percent uh and go to energy do you see that anywhere um Health transport Transportation it's more like 18 so uh that's reflecting it by category as well and this is interesting nearly one in four homeowners would have to sell if interest rates rise even more so there are some breaking points in this economy right and as we're talking with Jim Bianco you only see those breaking points and those fracture lines when uh the market is in stress and in turmoil so we're not sure where the next shoe is going to drop in the traditional economy but we have some glimpses of things um David all of this of course the the FED has to respond in some way and you were talking about what the FED response is going to be they just announced yesterday that they were going to raise interest rates by 0.75 percent and this is the biggest increase since 1994. they've not done this high of a raise since 1994. people are projecting interest rates of 3.4 percent by the end of the year the next time the FED meets likely in May it's projected that they'll increase by another 0.75 percent maybe a one percent that seems to be what they're indicating at this point in time but there's a problem here in that like the fed their plan to fix inflation they only have one tool in their tool belt and that is to raise rates or do quantitative tightening and the FED has made it clear that they have no impact on demand sorry they have no impact on Supply but they only have impact on demand so they're basically beating us all down making us feel like we're in a recession and actually trigger a recession in order to decrease demand for products and the hope is that that will Tamp down inflation so if you're an asset owner your assets go down if you have no assets you're kind of living paycheck to paycheck you might lose your job that's what a recession is and the sign of reversal like when will all of this reverse I don't think it will reverse and this is what we talked about with Jim Bianco until we see the first signs of inflation actually reversing so the beatings will continue until we see inflation maybe drop from that eight percent to something closer to six five four percent who knows what the measure will be either that will happen David or something will break to require them to reverse course what do you think about this the way that this bear market ends the way that we get out of this thing the way that we all feel better is that the FED has will might decide that it has gone too fast too far too quickly and it reverses Course and there are some grumblings about this some murmurings about this possibility that by the end of the year the FED will actually stop raising interest rates because of out of fear of the recession it's it's triggering being too strong because if you if you kill demand if you kill demand too fast fast you kill people's jobs and then that turns and that can spiral out of control and that can be even harder to get out of and so like the FED is trying to weave this into weave this needle to to thread this needle by reducing inflation but not triggering a recession and and Ryan like again the window might not be open and so the FED just has to pick does it send asset prices through the roof because that's what would happen if we all heard that the FED is going to stop interest rates or do we send asset prices to zero because of a depression that we triggered and there seems it seems to be like the likelihood that it's actually one of these things like and there's no middle ground it's like pretty most the most likely outcome it's one of these two things up big or down big and so there's some murmurings that the FED is going to just be fearful of just having gone way too far and it's going to reverse course and then when we see that we're going to see markets just like pump off the floor because like yes it's over like back to the Easy Money era they crashed the markets we're all broke but at least the markets can go up again so like there are some conversations about like this predictions about this happening so how do we interpret all of this this is what people want to know this is uh Vance Spencer's interpretation you know some people are saying hey this is the the end of easy money is era fed interest rates are going to rise the last 30 years of low interest rates we'll never see that again but Vance has a contrary take what is his take here Pam says have seen a commentate from VC investors that the era of low interest rates is over maybe for a few months maybe maybe a year that's probably right but long term it doesn't seem like we can put the genie back in the bottle and reverse a 40-year decline in interest rates and Ryan as we rate as the FED raises interest rates If the Fed raises interest rates by like one percent it puts costs on the U.S government because the U.S government is in massive debt the U.S government has more debt than any of us by a long shot it's like one percent of interest rates turns into like hundreds of billions of dollars of monthly fees payments that the government has to make and it does it the federal the Federal Reserve is just as insolvent as three hours capital is like we'll get we'll get to that part of the story but like they have debts to pay and so like this is going to the conversation of just like at some point they cannot raise interest rates and it's lower than five percent probably and so I the era of easy money is on the horizon whether it's in one month one year a few years It ultimately will return back to an easy money situation just because we're in debt and that's just what we that's the the Paradigm that we live inside of and we can't break stuff without triggering a depression and so um this is like the light at the end of the tunnel eventually everything breaks so far that we have to go back to zero percent interest rates it's just a matter of when yeah I think that's that's probably true because the FED it's not in the fed's interest or U.S government's interest to actually break things and send the world or the economy into another recession so depression and so if that's the case then you gotta imagine this will stop at some point in time when will it stop not sure but there could be tremendous buying opportunities here one thing that's interesting is do you know Wells Fargo and ethereum are the exact same market cap like it's real close right now both of them are worth 146 billion dollars so as an investor if you were like you know decide to invest is like where do I put this dollar and I have the world's assets choice I put it in bonds I could put it in stock you could put it in Wells Fargo or you could put it at eth and you're buying those things at the same price right now I think it's a total gift to be able to buy the future things like ethereum at a low price point right now at like lower than the price of Wells Fargo the same price of Wells Fargo stock and some people don't like these comparisons of like because Wells Fargo is a bank and ethereum is is a whole monetary system look they're both assets I know apples and oranges but both are fruit I think you can compare them and the question is coming out of this where will people want to put their money well they put in the old traditional banking system or will they put it in this new economy this new Financial system in ethereum and I know which bet I'm gonna take personally but again you got to develop your own conviction for this uh David we got uh some other things to explore that's coming the next section but uh Spencer noon kind of teases that for us what's he saying here yeah Spencer says it's becoming increasingly clear that one the East move from eighteen hundred to one thousand dollars was the result of large forced Sellers and two the majority of four selling is behind us cautiously optimistic that we found a local bottom I heard a cool take interestingly recently Ryan that if 2017 the Ico Mania was cryptos.com bubble 2022 was the 2008 housing crisis and what that means is that the.com bubble was a bunch of like internet promises which is what the Ico Mania was and the 2018 crisis uh to the 20 2008 housing crisis happened because of an over leveraged low money uh easy money monetary policy and and then over like and people just kept on cascading because they were leveraged on Leverage on Leverage which I think we're about to see Ryan is exactly the case on many many of the crypto participants in the market so that is the topics that are coming up next uh CFI insolvency the three arrows Capital caught swimming with no shorts and also layoff season as well so some bear Market topics coming up next right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eats with rocketpool and get reth in return allowing you to stake your ease and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a note rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish is staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool Network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now Ave V3 is here av3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of D5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to Port their Ave position across all of the networks that Ave operates on like polygon Phantom Avalanche arbitrum optimism and Harmony the beautiful thing about Ave is that it's completely open source decentralized and governed by its Community enabling a truly bankless future for us all to get your first crypto collateralized loan get started at ave.com that's aabe.com and also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than a hundred thousand Dow members are all robbing about at governance.ave.com hey guys we are back with our main event news items the first is about Celsius so Celsius is a centralized lending and borrowing a platform and they announced this week in a shock to the market that they were pausing all withdrawals and so users could deposit funds into Celsius and receive interest as a result of that they could also borrow from Celsius accomplished what many of the D5 protocols do only in a black box centralized model where you're not really sure how Celsius is generating that interest you just know you're getting some interest back it's kind of a black box for you well they just uh notified the entire world that they were pausing withdrawals and so this is an indication of insolvency that they can't actually honor all the depositors commitment and this of course sent the crypto World in a tizzy one a tweet from bankless HQ that I think is right on yeah if they can freeze withdrawals it's a bank if they can freeze withdrawals it's a bank and so Celsius looking a lot like a bank right now and of course uh you know the bankless position has been any centralized lending and borrowing platform is actually a lot like a bank but David could you break down actually what happened here what are some of the details of what Celsius is doing with the money and why can't they honor the withdrawals right now so some details out of coin metrics which has put out a great uh metrics on-chain database newsletter they say as of May 17th Celsius controls over 11 billion dollars of crypto with at least 1500 or 1 150 000 Bitcoins sorry I'm not used to that large number of Bitcoins uh inside of their the inside of their like a AUM inside of the assets that they hold they also have outstanding D5 positions uh so Celsius is an active depositor of users funds into D5 protocols uh and and they've also suffered some losses from hacks right so last December Celsius admitted to losses of a hack of the badger Dao D5 protocol when Badger that was hacked so they have losses that they that they used customer funds for which they have to make up and so users don't even know if they're you if their funds were lost it's because it's an aggregated pool of all users funds and so whatever funds was in Badger was lost and so that stuff like that starts to chip away at the solvency of of Celsius also controls the largest Vault of wrapped Bitcoin inside of maker Dow so as of June 13th Celsius is maker Vault held 24 000 wrapped Bitcoin worth about 500 million dollars as bitcoin price fell below 25 000 Celsius makers Vault quickly approached its liquidation price of 22.5 thousand dollars uh and so uh bitcoin price twenty five thousand dollars if it went down 2 500 more the vaults collateralization ratio would reach the low price the low ratio of 155 for those that don't know maker Dow vaults get liquidated at 150 percent so uh with just a few percentage more moves to the downside that all of Celsius is uh not all of it but a very large chunk of their Bitcoin would have been liquidated uh on Monday morning June 13th the Vault was topped up with an additional 4 000 wrapped Bitcoin sending the new implied liquidation price down to eighteen thousand dollars Bitcoin and a new collateralization ratio up to 185 000 as Bitcoin fell to twenty one thousand dollars Monday night Celsius added an additional 2K wrapped Bitcoin to the Vault lowering the liquidation price to seventeen thousand and this is where we are today the situation remains precarious because if Bitcoin like they can't keep on generating collateral lot of thin air and so as the Bitcoin price gets lower and lower and lower they aren't paying down their loans Ryan they're putting more collateral in there which is like saying okay we took the loss but I'll just double my bet and put it on black which is already crazy uh but that is only one half of the story the other half of the story is staked eth Celsius is also a large holder of lydo's steak to eat June 13th Celsius held 445 000 steak to eat 500 million dollars and but there is less liquidity for steak to eat than there is on ether one decentralized exchanges so there's only so much steak to eat that you can swap for ether for to uh to allow for users to withdraw their assets and so since the state eth Pegg has started to slip uh safety has started to trade at a discount many people are facing insolvency issues and so and so they are liquidating their steak to eat to get ether back to pay down their debts Celsius being one of them uh and so there isn't sufficient transparency to make authoritative claims about the solvency of Celsius and an unwind of this proportion uh would if Celsius had to unwind further would certainly impact all of crypto markets um and so uh like like we've seen before if there was indeed a Celsius allowed users to withdraw there would likely be a run on the bank because users want to get their funds out before others and so that's why Celsius had to Halt withdrawals basically they are on the brink Ryan and if prices go down too much more they would face just a trigger a significant liquidation event which might trigger further liquidation events which is pretty damn scary the scariest thing about this Ryan is that basically Celsius is a a like a yield farming a centralized yield farming app so you deposit your money into Celsius and then they go and farm defy with it which is the same thing as a bank you put your dollars in Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo go gets yield out in C5 with it and then they pocket that yield and give you a little bit of difference what Celsius is doing is they are leveraged yield farming so they are juicing up the yields in order to attract deposits and then they are going engaging in very risky yield farming behavior and defy which works great on the way up and it's why Celsius has tracked billions of dollars of users deposits but it doesn't work so great on the way down especially as yields come down but also as they lock up users deposits inside of things like um uh inside of things like maker doubt and also staked each which is a one-way deposit right now so like and so they're going late they leverage up they get a ton of yield and and then they lock their positions and in a down when prices go down too fast they just can't unlock their positions to to give funds back to their users uh so like if you have money in Celsius users that currently have money in Celsius because of the whole staked thing because they can't withdraw staked ease until post merge and then and then about six months after that with when withdrawals are enabled on the ethereum Chain they need to wait to get that money back so there is money there uh but like you can't access it uh and so they are kind of in a rock and a hard place and so they have to pause users users withdrawals to maintain their solvency which is kind of crazy yeah in fact they're probably they're probably insolvent right now right is is the case they're probably underwater on the depositor's assets and so basically that's what they're doing they're generating yield and you just you know Park your Ethier park park your usdc here will generate yield but they were taking those funds and doing all of these speculative risky things with it in order to generate that yield now I'll note that that is actually the opposite of what D5 does now D5 does generate yield but it's fully transparent it's fully on train you can see an audit log of everything that backs an individual position or an asset you can right click view Source Celsius it was kind of just like here put it in the black box will generate interest trust us please trust us and we all know what trust us uh how that ends up going um there were some takes here as well about the way Celsius oh my God positioned itself in the market so bad and uh where should I start this David yeah tweet number eight it goes uh but even worse than the pseudo crypto vibe that is Celsius dangerous use of meaningless platitudes and stride and anti-bank rhetoric this is a tweet from John Wu out of Aztec that I'm reading uh so here's some of the marketing terms that that John took from their white paper and website banking is broken unbank yourself replace replace Wall Street with Bitcoin 99 versus one percent first off those first three things is a complete farce because they're just a bank they are using defy terminology defy like memes but for their C5 app and so like it's in disingenuous versus for what is actually going on like these are the things that we chant about defy meanwhile defy again highly efficient and highly orderly while all the C5 is breaking and then the whole like 99 versus one percent thing is just the populist tactics that we've seen so many times these are the populist tactics that do Quan used to advertise Terra is the populist tactics that Danny Sessa used to advertise Wonderland it's just a consistent red flag across so many things that all ultimately come to break uh John from asset continues saying worst of all is this in your face focus on safety security and transparency and most of all trust military grade security withdraw your crypto at any time keep your crypto safe Next Level transparency like these are defy words and it's completely the opposite of what is true of Celsius so they're using defy talking points for their C5 app which is malicious disingenuous uh and so again people that do these things like this is called icarusing Ryan where you fly too close to the sun it's just a little ridiculous uh and then again for this is the lesson to take away for those that are just unfamiliar with all these tactics that are going around in defying crypto all the time and even even in centralized this is a truth about the centralized world and John continues therein lies the problem the promise of sky high yields comply combined with a veneer of literacy legitimacy with regulated on-ramps premium access for creditor investors and regulator logos this cleared the way for Celsius to pursue truly degenerate trading strategies with investor funds and again something that we've seen before just a few days before pausing withdrawals on on uh on Twitter the CEO Alex machinski is attacking Mike Mike dudas uh formerly a CEO of the block uh and Mike says I hope retail can get out of Celsius I am hearing about accounts being locked that would be similar to Luna we shall see and Alex Goes Mike do you even know one person who has a problem with drawing from Celsius why spread effect spread flooded misinformation if you are paid for this then let everyone know you are picking size otherwise our job is to fight tradfi together uh and then ironically two days later everyone had a problem with drawing from Celsius because it was actually tradfy in d5's clothing this is the crazy thing too is Alex's tweet got like three times as much likes as as Mike's tweet it's because you always in these cases have kind of an army of Defenders they're saying don't pick on Celsius right and like uh it just it's it's very it's very sad for all of kind of the people who uh deposit into Celsius without actually knowing the risks of of doing that um I do think it's you know a fun fact Ryan if we got I've been attacked by the Celsius trolls it hasn't happened in a while yeah it was like back in 2019 2020 uh maybe early 2021 but like they were like oh have Alex machinski he's like he's like super into defy and I would go and look at Celsius like this isn't defy and so like Celsius had Celsius yeah it's crazy yes I agree and that that's always a red flag it's like like in the future I mean it's it's kind of feel like we've called it every time every time there's a red flag Community it's just like it turns out like this and it's just all happening all at once um these days the thing of it is I'm not against a centralized lending and borrowing um companies either right like I'm not I'm not also like I know this show is called Bank list I'm also not against Banks I do think Defy is better um but if you are depositing into a bank into a Celsius or a block fly or a nexo or anything else you have to be aware of the risks it just so happened like I don't think that this is going to happen to the the block fives and the nexos of the world we don't really know to be honest it just me it just depends on how they manage uh the assets that you've deposited with them and clearly like Celsius and the Alex and his team were taking like he was more Degen with his depositors money than I am with my dgn portfolio that I have my little side pocket where I'm playing around like just taking extreme crazy risks that I don't understand why anyone would take with depositors funds to generate interest I don't think the block fives of the world and the nexos are doing this but the point is we don't really know that's the point with defy you know it's transparent it's on chain you can see what the risks are that's why we're Advocates of defy also like you know centralized lending has a place certainly but I think we deserve more transparency and probably and this might be unpopular with some more regulation right on the central because if there is centralized trusted third parties we need some transparency and if they won't provide it on their own as part of the free market right we need The Regulators to step in right this is a place for rate but what I'm worried about of course is as always is you know this all gets swept under I saw some uh forms on on Reddit and such when people are saying oh all the defy Advocates look what just happened to Celsius I'm like that wasn't D5 right stop don't get me wrong we get hacked there are bridge attacks or it's like multi-sig problems but like not this one though not this one all right and transparency is not a problem with D5 constructed decentralized Finance all right we we've got that one locked down uh so anyway how does this resolve it's a sad story right now I don't think it's the end for if you are a depositing Celsius and you have your funds in um just stay tuned all right I don't think this is a terrorist situation where you know it's everything's gone to Zera and you you lose everything I'm sure they are underwater probably at some degree with their collateral but some of these assets are like staked and just being held you can't withdraw it but because it's staked inside of Ethan withdrawals aren't enabled on the beacon chain yet but I do expect depositors to get at least some of their money back maybe the vast majority of it maybe 80 to 90 percent this is a hope that I have but the proceedings are going to like it's probably going to go to bankruptcy court or or somebody could step in and uh it appears like nexo is another centralized lending company that's actually stepped in and offered to buy uh by Celsius so that might come about too uh anyway hope is not by selling list but not by Celsius but by Celsius is distressed assets so take their illiquid assets off their hands and give them liquid assets so they can resume deposits which again like some people like yield farming is scary some people don't have enough money to pay for gas prices there's a place for C5 lending uh and there are good C5 lenders and there are bad C5 lenders and after crypto has an 80 drawdown and nexo has the capital to buy out Celsius distress assets I think you can tell which one is the responsible centralized defy app here that has the funds to back up their users deposits so pretty Chad move by nexo uh yeah it would be interesting if Celsius basically does like bent the knee and it's like okay competitor here is our assets at a steep discount because you are responsible with your funds do you know another fun fact David yeah I'm ready for it I have a little bit of funds in Celsius no way yeah so as part of that like just a very little right so as part of you know bankless Journey going like talking about centralized protocols and all of these things reviewing blockfi and nexo I have a little bit of funds in all of them where I've just kind of parked it to test it and like you got to treat this I guess so I don't know if I'm getting my youth back Alex is the winner yeah it's a little bit I'm not worried at all about it but um but you know I'm I'm right there with you guys if if you were um if you're in Celsius I can't wait for the breaking co-founders I also have some funds in blockfy full disclosure right it's like I you know it's definitely far more in D5 but I'd like to use everything someplace that you don't have your funds Ryan is with three arrows Capital also caught because no don't do that I know that one okay you know I have nothing in three hours Capital what happened to them yeah so uh prominent crypto fun three arrows capital is facing possible insolvency after occurring at least 400 million dollars in liquidations coindesk reports so a very useful thread got put together by Danny eight BTC so we're going to go through that thread because uh Ryan I did not have three arrows capital insolvency on my bear Market bingo card I thought they were extremely capitalized for people who don't know who three areas capital is okay these are like the legend like these are like the chats like Chad like the bull market right the biggest fund held in the highest esteem like the biggest whales on the planet not necessarily like high respect like whatever you talk to it depends who you talk to not in our like not in kind of the settler Builder holder class but definitely like their rotators yeah they're big big Traders Traders think they're Chads and the long-term people kind of are frustrated by their constant rotations exactly so that's the context these guys are a big deal and so a lot of eptc he puts a thread together uh and he goes here's what happened between three hours capital and what we know so far from November 2020 we entered and so this is an individual that has a relationship with trier's capital from 20 November 2020 we entered an agreement with free arrows capital in which we would pay them a fee to use uh in which yeah to use their trading accounts as a delta neutral Market maker in the crypto markets we are very sensitive to trading fees when you're trading at nine figures USD per day even a one bip on 100 million dollars is ten thousand dollars if you're doing that every single day it adds up very quickly so our agreement with them was we withdraw whenever we want a hundred percent of the p l belongs to us they are to never move our funds out without permission because it increases the risk of our positions getting liquidated and in return we pay them fees for their service this was a mutually beneficial relationship over a year and a half we have known them since 2018 thought they were competent and didn't think that they would be Degen enough to lose billions and not employ basic risk management you hear that oof on June 12th with a market dropping and needing some funds from the account for our positions on other exchanges we we asked for a withdrawal from the Ops Team which was honored the operations team which was honored on June 13th with a continuation of the drop we asked for a bigger withdrawal there was no reply but we didn't think much of it at the time after a while the market stabilized so we just no longer needed the funds we thought maybe they were just busy turns out they were just busy uh fast forward to well not just busy they were busy very very busy fast forward to 24 hours ago this came out a couple days ago or yesterday actually our funds monitoring scripts notice that one million dollars was missing from our accounts with them we reached out to Kyle Davies one of the two co-founders of three hours capital and the operations team on telegram about the missing funds no replies we tried calling them they were online because you can see the little green dot in telegram but they did not pick up then our Traders noticed that there were some a few rumors circulating on Twitter about speculating on three hours Capital insolvency since we were directly involved we felt uh the need to tell the world about what had occurred engaged the extent of the three arrows Capital contagion a lot of people have reached out about what they know many of the whom have direct relationships with three areas Capital as well what we learned is that they were leveraged long everywhere and were getting margin called instead of answering the margin calls they ghosted everyone the platforms had no choice but to liquidate their positions causing the markets to dump further however they still have assets on the number of platforms you know who you are in parentheses we we call for you to freeze their assets so that three hours capital uh to those that three arrows Capital owes money can be paid back in the future after legal proceedings for what it's worth for the most part they aren't speculating with clients money like Celsius was maybe a threat another day about our dealings with them in 2019. however they did use our funds a million dollars to answer their margin calls so three hours Capital use this trading from funds to answer their margin calls losing a bet is one thing but at least being honorable and not dragging others into your bets who have nothing to do with it is another certainly don't ghost on everyone since potentially they could have helped you oof oof and then of course uh suzu from Trio's Capital put out a single tweet After People notice their complete silence on Twitter which is generally silence on Twitter is the sign of somebody's got their tail between their legs suzu tweets out we are in the process of communication communicating with relevant parties and are fully committed to working this out no context about like that so assuming that other people know the context the people who are working with that who are working with Heroes Capital totally knows the context uh and so the uh confirmed three errors Capital down probably the baddest out of anyone at the point at the peak of the market Ryan no one really knows this number for verified fact but the highest number I've heard is that at the peak of the market when three hours Capital was up the most they had 18 billion dollars wow they are closer to like maybe below half a billion dollars at this point in time so imagine losing like almost 18 billion dollars dude really like some of these numbers are speculation we're not entirely sure but like these definitely the order of magnitude uh for sure what's crazy about the story here David is so we've seen an algo stable coin a d gen algo stablecoin kind of backed by nothing just you know a meme potential die we saw Celsius which is basically gambling client deposits on dgn defy yield activities we saw that die and we see three arrows Capital likely insolvent due to Leverage due to margin right it just seems like this bear Market in this back to Spencer news tweet and this Cascade of liquidations that we've seen in this very harsh dip has been caused by like things that are preventable like you don't have to go build a 15 billion dollar algo stable coin that's backed by nothing just memes and promises you don't have to take out margin the way three hours capital Did you don't have to go dgen on a depositor's funds in order to juice your yields that's called being greedy that's called being irresponsible that's called being like diving into the risk pool all the way to the bottom like it's not like what what's happening is some of these companies these firms are just living with the consequences of this now I think like Celsius and Tara are probably the most egregious because retail gets caught left holding the bag people I'm talking about people who should like didn't know better and they should have and they learned a very harsh lesson through this exercise the people people that Regulators protect right right um this is a take from Robert lescher I'll read this out I became a default he's a D5 founder of compound of course a D5 protocol I became a D5 founder in order to create a more transparent autonomous and safer Financial system watching the implosion of UST Celsius three hours capital and more all of which are opaque and trust-based reaffirms the need for decentralized finance more than ever bolded that decentralized Finance more than ever and this is back to the theme of the episode David is like C5 down bad defy holding just fine the protocols I mean sure the tokens were down bad too but the protocols are healthy and fine and collecting a ton of fees yeah so again CFI liquidated defy orderly and orderly and efficient this was a great meme I'm pretty sure you put this one together Ryan this is the reaper coming to knock on the door meme where it's got three doors it's already opened up and there's uh just blood flowing out the first one was Luna the second one was Celsius the third is three hours Capital the next on the door that the reaper is knocking on right now is Tron and the the caption is don't answer the door Justin uh Justin son of Tron and the reason why I'm pretty sure you put Tron here on the door behind is because Tron is copying the algo stablecoin model of Luna yes which is ridiculous zero just like a couple weeks before Luna imploded and Justin Stan and Tron decide to duplicate it to pump the price of Tron right right some people were mad at this meme from Bank list but we decided not to take it down because they were mad they said it was great tweets they said it was insensitive okay you know what's insensitive though when people like Luna like dokwan like Celsius like three hours Capital took ludicrous risks with investors money because they were short-term and greedy that's ludicrous not this meme they're just trying to like warn people about this the risks of centralization the risk the trade-offs that you're making when you deposit into black boxes that you don't fully understand I think it's a good lesson for the crypto space but there might be some other shoes to drop before we're done and this is my like final tweet on this subject I guess or final thought on it is a bunch of people got dumb and greedy during the bear Market the bull market and are being liquidated now this isn't the end of crypto this is how crypto gets healthy okay that's exactly right this is what interest rates do they burn the brush so that we can rebuild so yeah like Tara was never going to be long-term sustainable it collapses the first moment that interest rates go up three hours Capital levered to the absolute tits was never going to work and sorry for the word uh it was never gonna work with high interest rates all the people that are getting liquidated because of high interest rates we are returning to fundamentals this is what bear markets do we go back to the fundamentals we go back down to the basement and we rebuild the foundation stronger and stronger and stronger every single time there we go there we go guys uh we're gonna burn through this too there have been some layoffs in crypto that's our third uh story let's talk about a few coinbase they laid off 18 that's a fifth of their staff uh crypto.com five percent of their Workforce another centralized exchange block fi cutting 20 percent that's another big move and then in the midst of this here's CZ from binance another crypto Bank let me remind you but one that is in a pretty cash strong position I say CZ tweets this out it was not easy saying no to the Super Bowl ad Stadium naming rights large sponsored deals a few months ago but we did flexing on the other centralized exchanges and he's saying today we are hiring 2 000 open positions for binance so you know you know the funny story about this tweet Ryan what is it this is a good good job good job Cece I'll give you your praise for being responsible in an opening position wait responsible we don't know that but like we've got some money yeah and so like for the podcast listeners there's this photo of CZ and a blue button-up shirt reaching out his hand to shake your hand with a with a tag we're hiring I want to work there it looks very much like a stock photo a blurry background very corporate like you definitely know this this isn't binance's offices uh and so like people are like what's up with this photo dude uh I remember I think Mooney uh commented like what happens if I if I shake that hand just because it's like you want to shake that hand and then Kobe on Twitter uh he finds the stock photo of this other guy who is not not CZ who's it's actually a stock photo and so what they did is they just took a picture of cz's face and Photoshopped it all into a stock photo this is absolutely nuts oh my God I love her anyways was this intentional I don't know man it's good Photoshop work yeah so yeah big layoffs in the crypto space um but I will remind people that these are the old institutions not old old like crypto institutions coinbase has been around for a while coin crypto.com has been around for a while block Buy has been around for a while they have already scaled up bigly they've already hit their point of saturation of growth and so when the market turns over because they were already saturated with growth that actually does impact their ability to pay employees that is so it really the playoffs are only coming from the big institutions that have been around for a while there are newer startups that have a ton of cash like we been saying every single week and those people are doing just fine interesting dichotomy in the crypto space right now and of course brings us to job time because they're like I said there are people hiring jobs and so this is coming at you every single week if you have a job if you're hiring in crypto go to bankless.palot.com drops and post your job because we're really good at getting people hired and if you are looking to get hired in crypto and you don't believe me about how many jobs there are also go to banklist.palot.com jobs and look at all the jobs available to you or go to the talent Collective and post your resume so jobs can come hunting for you the job the labor market in crypto is hot and so yes some parts of crypto or layout are laying people off other parts of crypto are hiring big Ryan who's hiring this week let me know uh there's a lot from Alliance down this Dow this week which is a really cool company I've learned much more about recently they're hiring a CTO at Alliance Dao also a software engineer full stack senior software engineer full stack Alliance Dao two of them executive assistant Alliance down it's non-technical a solidity engineer that's very technical outer space and a front-end engineer at abstract Ventures we've got a founder and CEO you can you can hire a Founder at Boolean Labs we've got a Twitter specialist at bank list come make memes research engineer at blockchain Capital a tech lead at Swell Network solidity developer unlocked senior product designer streams a whole lot more go to bankless.palot.com jobs and also sign up so you get these via email you don't just have to hear it from David and I yelling at you to get a job in crypto every week guys and just just for the record those are only like the first like 25 to 33 percent of jobs that we read out on the jobs board so there's so many more that you do know if you don't read that much that's the tip of the iceberg that's great and so like I say fundamentals are stronger than ever and you can be a part of building that fundamental base so we can kick off the next Bull Mania so we can all get liquidated then too coming up next in the second half of the show second half Jesus so it's already an hour long optimism wintermute hacker update there's an update there some drama good drama good news this time uh Jack Dorsey

optimism exploiter returns 90 of stolen tokens and here's a quote from this article out of the defiant over the past few hours the address opened a line of communication with wintermute on chain that's pretty cool and 17 million of the 20 million op tokens have now been returned says optimism the attacker has kept 2 million op tokens as a bounty and the 1 million Ops were by the exploiter were sent to vitalik buterin uh so I'm assuming Vitality just like sent it to him oh and when the uh winter mute optimism token hacker sent the tokens to vitalik he also included a message inside of the transaction fun fact you can actually do that by the way uh hello vitalik I believe in you just want you just want to know your opinion on this by the way help to verify the return address and I will return the remaining after you I don't know what that means and after you oh okay and hello wintermute sorry I only have 18 million and this is what I can return Stay optimistic interesting uh hacker so that was like a forced Bounty it's not like the optimism team gave him he just kept two million as a as a bounty is that the case I guess so I guess the optimism is like hey we will not pursue charges if you just give us most of the stuff backed I don't know one million or two million tokens of reward is pretty pretty damn good I guess yeah it's you keep ten percent that's the the hacker fee the white white hacker fee black Hat's away hat I don't know what that's right I think that's great that's a great hat that's pretty black actually that's pretty black they sold the money they just didn't steal all of it it's definitely stole the money all right update with the ethereum a difficulty bomb the difficulty bomb is being delayed for two months uh and the difficulty bomb is coming at the end of August what the difficulty bomb is is it slows down ethereum block times it's been in ethereum for since day one it's been the pressure the ab fire under the butts of ethereum developers to make sure that proof of sake ultimately gets shipped it's a part of a ritual to kick this thing back over and over and over again they are kicking it back one last time for two months because we cannot ship the merge fast enough before the difficulty bomb came uh so that means that overall a longer wait for them so from August it doesn't really matter wait it's from bear Market anyways August to when November is that one is going to be put is pushed back to yeah the end of November early October I think yeah got it got it got it yeah um I guess that will have some bearing but probably no bearing really and what's this this other thing maker adding yeah our ether's collateral it's a decision yeah this is really really cool so our eth from rocket pool rocket pools liquid state to eat so when you deposit your ether into rocket pool you'll get our eth back in return same thing with steak teeth out of Lido but rocket pool uh in the difference between lotto and Rocket pool is that you can also add your own node to the rocket pool Network which is the difference from Lido there is a vote to add our eth as a collateral type in maker Dao allowing you to deposit our Ethan to maker Dao and borrow die against it uh and so I'm a big fan of uh of competition in the staked Arena Lido has a ton of staked Ethan people are worried about how much Supply that they have and in order to get other steak to eat Alternatives we need Integrations into defy and this poll ended literally like 30 minutes ago at the time of recording midday Thursday and we have an overwhelming yes in 40 800 mkrs voting yes 22 000 mkr tokens voting no and so our eth is going to be added as collateral in maker Dao probably with a really or a low collateralization ceiling as in not that many Die it can be minted against our eth to start this is normal but the idea is that this helps incur our eth liquidity and so as a result of this this is a liquidity mechanism for our eth puts uh more demand for our eth creates more dye supply for maker Dao and ultimately will help our eth become more liquid so bullish Ryan on the competition between staked each derivative tokens I'm glad we have Alternatives because we need Alternatives because competition is always good for the consumer congratulations to rockapool adao for getting that done absolutely and speaking of competition it feels like uh you know centralized Finance traditional Finance is a competition for talent with D5 this is uniswap Labs announcing that they are welcoming Stacy Cunningham who is the former president of the New York Stock Exchange as an advisor to uniswap Labs so taking her from uh Trad Phi to defy and this is Hayden talking about that higher it's critical that D5 learns from both the successes and failures of existing Financial systems former New York Stock Exchange president Stacy cunning's experience and excitement expertise and excitement in the transformative potential of amm's part of why I'm so thrilled to welcome her as an advisor to uniswap Labs poaching from the New York Stock Exchange that's what unit swap is doing right now some people will call this like very corporate though David do you like what do you think of that sentiment they'll be like oh we don't need Trad five people like you know let's leave this in the hands of kind of the geeky crypto nerds who really care about this stuff what do you think no I think there's a case where where Stacy Cunningham is a frontier Enthusiast and so she's leaving the non Frontier and she's going off onto the frontier you can actually see her Twitter account there on the right she says in her bio markets Enthusiast and I'm a fan of that sentiment I'm also a Market's Enthusiast so Stacy Cunningham welcome to the frontier and thanks for joining us absolutely we uh we're gonna take more from Trad five before this is all over speaking of Frontier enthusiasts Jim Carrey has now minted his first nft called Sun shower and he has sold speaking of things I did not have on my bingo card yeah Jim Carrey to nfts uh Jim Carrey of course the actor um and uh I don't know Ace Ventura this is like some of his favorite the math detective yeah the mask right yeah so classic 90s stuff and now he's getting Bruce Almighty I love Bruce Almighty speaking of the nft world David how's the nft world doing like from a Market's perspective like board Apes crypto punks we got to be down too I haven't even looked at the jpeg prices because I've been consumed by other things what's that looking like yeah I saw a report from the defiant that I thought was pretty useful with that reported some numbers of common nfts uh markets so board ape Yacht Club down 14 to 76 eth crypto punks up three percent to 48 eth and that is the only nft project that's up this week other Deeds down 35 percent to two eath moon Birds Down 30 to 15.5 each clone X down 34 to 8.2 each azuki down 20 to 9.4 that's just this week right yeah that's that's a very recently yeah uh and so um this definitely lends itself to the argument that uh nfts are leveraged eth if you believe that uh but also crypto punks you know returning to fundamentals right right guys right away do you think do you think that um that's true nfts are just leveraged eth guess it depends on the nft doesn't it I definitely think so my jury is still out for that but this is something that Eric Connor uh chants and uh I'm I'm waiting to be convicted on that more I think you could make that case for something like nouns that has like actual eth backing uh backing in its treasury maybe that makes more sense but like I know some people a lot of people who've mentioned to me that they're they're waiting for some generational lows to go buy some of these OG Blue Chip uh nfts like a crypto punk you know when the time is right but I always wonder about them I'm gonna go like check back because you say that now but when you are in the depth of the bear market and these nfts are trading super low will you have the guts to make those purchases at that point in time because that's where I always falter because I'm like it's just a jpeg what do you think it's uh it's when Bitcoin had its first price run up and then crash imagine being in the first Bitcoin Bull Run and then the first Bitcoin crash there is no precedent for the Bitcoin ever coming back and so the people that bought the first Bitcoin crash down to like I don't know what it was a hundred dollars they had to have just brains of Steel right because there's no guarantees that these things come back and the nfts are the same there's no precedent for these nfts ever coming back in price right our nfts part of the future or are they just a part of 2021 or will it be a new crap a new crap a new crop of nfts right that's the thing that people didn't slip Mr non-nft look I got an nft right behind me all right this dude kneeling that's an nft David it's not a crypto punk you by the way you gonna put your crypto Punk up somewhere in your new place yeah totally as soon as I get my hands back on it yeah you don't have your crypto Punk no it's with all my others oh the image of your crypto Punk right the image yeah have my crypto of course my ERC 721 here all right all right leaning into what's next Jack dorsey's Bitcoin Venture TBD unveils new proposal for decentralized web platform this caught crypto Twitter by storm and reignited the feud between Jack Dorsey and Andresen Mark and driesen and so Jack Dorsey releases along with square releases web five web five five yeah so here's the perfect literal name for it right let's see yeah web five the decentralized web platform a new Evolution of the web that enables defense decentralized apps and protocols uh so like sounding a lot like defy right uh so here's the pitch deck but web 5 came from the math behind web 2 plus web 3 equals web five oh I see that map right yeah that Matt the math does check out yeah I ran that I ran those numbers myself uh but really the tldr here is Bitcoin plus decentralized identity uh and so decentralized identity is a thing that's a conversation outside of crypto decentralized identity was a topic of conversation and topic of research and development before crypto was a thing and many many companies around this around the world have worked on decentralized identity uh there is a there's an identity Consortium like identity standards just like the World Wide Web standards this is a concept outside of crypto so it's not native to crypto however decentralized identity pairs really really well with crypto our defy apps our nft orgs our Dows are definitely bolstered and enabled and uh just great fashion by Design would you say this David crypto gives decentralized identity a use case a huge use case not it's not exclusive to that decentralized identity works it would be great for web 2 because you can like the meme of owning your own data and like charging Mark Zuckerberg for accessing your data that is the meme of decentralized identity Ryan not crypto right and so decentralized identity is useful for web 2 and individual sovereignty aside from crypto but when you marry web3 Jack Dorsey with decentralized identity you get an explosion like that the Renaissance explosion that Josh Rosenthal leans into like that's what well I think this is true I think this is true of the money use case too right it's like uh Bitcoin is cool on its own but when you have a a Non-Stop like when you have a self-sovereign money inside of a decentralized financial system then you actually give a use case for that money and that's what ethereum is doing it's giving a use case for ether I think that the same is true of decentralized identity it's just like where do you use decentralized identity in the real world I mean I have a passport I have a driver's license I have a Gmail account I have an email like I have a Facebook login whatever what do I need did for well you need it in order to like do pseudo Anonymous governance in a dow in order to actually vote in order to like um actually participate in some of these nft uh communities the metaverse requires decentralized identity what's Jack building here yeah so this is this is why like this is in my mind a little bit skeuomorphic you need smart contracts you need a variety of tokens you need metaverse real estate metaverse land all the metaverse things metaverse games and you need a decentralized identity in there to actually make a self-sovereign metaverse but Jack is trying to to just add an identity layer on top of Bitcoin uh and he somehow claims that it's making like defy like kind of like decentralized finance apps Etc et cetera once you add in identity to bitcoin I'm confused about that um but uh with like uh di dids decent tries identifiers and verifiable credentials which are terms you might have heard from our recent show with Evan McMullen and vitalik buterin if you want to go down that rabbit hole they are applying these things to Bitcoin in the Bitcoin blockchain just to create a world of self-sovereign identity on a Bitcoin standard which is confusing to me although it is it is the appropriate use of dids and VCS yeah again not not venture capitalist verifiable credentials but then it's like injecting it into the Bitcoin blockchain which is uh where I get confused yeah I can't so I kind of like it I like the concept of having a self-sovereign identity now whether it takes off like do you have the use cases actually supported or not like a jury's still out but I like that they're pursuing this the weird thing about it is kind of the uh the wrapping of the whole thing which is very anti-web three and very I would say like it's wrapped in this like almost Bitcoin maximalist like all we need is the Bitcoin chain for everything sort of persona which is just like doesn't make sense to me and there was this back and forth that you mentioned between Mark Andreessen who came on Bengals podcast recently made the case for web3 and um and Jack Dorsey he says this is Mark Andreessen wait what happened to web4 because we skipped right to web five right and then Jack says same thing that happened to web three I don't know what he means by that he just me he means like it's irrelevant or gonna fade to existence no I wasn't a thing in the first place right uh which is you know definitely a Bitcoin Maxi take and so and the thing is like people started just making fun of this like the the joke was not accepted by the the like not even the inside of crypto but outside of crypto Melissa Chen uh she's actually somebody out of respect because she reports on China she's not really a crypto person she's like a Chinese markets and and commentator critical of China uh and she goes can we just go skip straight to web 69 like throwing a hole like farce out of the whole like web did you see Snoop Dogg sweet you talk no oh he tweeted something about getting ready to launch web eight uh he just reads this the same day we've got a lot right yeah so the joke did not land Jack Dorsey so swinging a Miss on that one but the uh yeah it's interesting right the technology is real the technology is real and I'm the joke is bad I would actually love to um to have somebody from web 5 or Jack Dorsey on Bank list to explain this a little bit more as we exploring like uh decentralized identity and verify credentials uh David um yeah real quick here coin Center suing the treasury plus the IRS coin Center our favorite crypto lobbying firm filed a lawsuit against the treasury Department and the IRS claiming in crypto tax reporting requirement contained in the infamous infrastructure bill is unconstitutional the lawsuit claims in 2021 the Biden in Congress amended a little-known tax reporting mandate if the amendment is allowed to go through it will impose Mass surveillance or dream on ordinary Americans the provision in the infrastructure Bill regime last summer would require individuals and businesses receiving ten thousand dollars or more in crypto to report that person's date of birth and Social Security number so Ryan if I send you ten thousand dollars of crypto I have to report your birth date your name and your Social Security number of which I do not know to the IRS and the treasury howdy would you feel about if I did that how would that make you I think that would that would suck I think that is like completely needless right and do I have to do that if you send if you hand me over ten thousand dollars in cash and this is very much surveillance State like unnecessary so I'm glad uh somebody is standing up to this and this is why we need to do a lobbyists protector ten thousand dollars of your nft sale you gotta report your counterparty to the IRS like like whatever we create AML kyc the entire world here um we don't need to either it's also not the point have it at the Fiat gateways right that's where we have it today that's what makes sense um Jeremy alaire just announced Euro coin so Jeremy Lair of course one of the the main people behind uh Circle and and usdc which is a very popular centralized stablecoin now launchering the Euro version of usdc and what's cool about this is immediately because it's Circle they get binance bit stamp support they get D5 support they get custodian support wallet support uh kind of cool for Euro to have its own stable coin I'm also surprised it took this long feels like you know I should have already been there but I guess um US dollars is still the world Reserve currency so most people are holding it there um David we got some releases this week too what do we want to cover yeah we got a vampire attack on Twitter uh lens if you integrate your lens protocol with your Twitter you can automatically post your tweets to lens protocol with lens share so there's a link in the show notes there is probably a lens protocol token coming Ryan and so more footprints on lens the better and so you can vampire attack Twitter by posting your tweets automatically to lens and allowing people to consume your tweets on lens protocol so there's that coming up next as well claim your hop tokens Drop It Like It's hop you can now claim your hop tokens ladies and gentlemen there's a link in the show notes to get that done uh and so that's at app.hop.exchange uh oh ah Ryan you're an ethereum user so you got a thousand uh hop tokens so congratulations on that oh wow that's just loaded up cool yeah you didn't even know that and then last release of the week openc has required acquired C Port we covered this a couple weeks ago and now that is finally being uh migrated over so openc is now a front end to just like the seaport protocol and so as a result of that we are saving a bunch of money on gas because Seaport is just so much more gas efficient than open sea and so some of the details here you can now make offers on items in an entire collection or buy items with a specific attribute and which is the first of its kind for ethereum nft marketplaces you can display floor prices and percent Rarity by attribute now as well also there are no setup fees for Seaport accounts when you made your first trade on openc you would have to initialize your account which was an expensive gas intensive Endeavor and so you people are already saving money because they don't need to set up uh initialize their wallet on openc with Seaport saving users at this current rate 1220 million dollars a year in gas and also there's other features coming as well like listing many nfts in a single transaction and creators also being able to Define multiple payouts on openc basically open C getting a lot more expressive a lot more composable doing a lot more cool things there's speculation Ryan that openc will never do a token probably because they're probably just this not the right Vibe for them but but Seaport a different entity might still do a token I'm still kind of skeptical on that outcome but the path is there for that and interesting guys we've got more coming up including questions from the bankless community we'll get to some of those and of course some hot takes from Twitter vitalik has his own take we give you some takes about the bear markets make sure you guys like And subscribe we'll be right back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible Arboretum is an ethereum layer 2 scaling Solution that's going to completely change how we use D5 and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to Arboretum and a D5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrum as their home all the while D5 protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrum has never been easier especially with the ability to deposit directly into Arbitron through all the exchanges including binance FTX Kobe and crypto.com once inside you'll notice arbitrave increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrum.io developer to start building your dap on Arbor drone if you're a djin many of your favorite daps on ethereum are already on arbitrum with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrum.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free the era of proof of stake is upon us and Lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lydo is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using Lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral and defy with Lido you can have both using Lido you can stake any amount of your eth to the Lido validating Network and receive steth in return SCE can be traded used as collateral for Lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite D5 protocols all this without giving up your eth to centralized staking services or exchanges lado now supports Solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof of stake asset is Lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your East Soul or Matic and get liquidity on your stake go to lido.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o dot f i to get started hey guys we are back with a new segment we call questions from the nation of course to get your question in you gotta follow us on Twitter and wait for this every Wednesday sometimes Thursday we post we posed a question to the community which is ask your question do you have a question for the weekly roll-up and we try to answer some of the top questions David this was one of them I'm going to read this out and then uh you want to take a shot at the answer here this is from cloudy.eath uh Christina claudy1 hi Ryan and David I would love to know your opinion about staking eth on merge via Lido you still consider it safe or do you think that Lido and so that s t eth is in Risk thanks to the problems with Celsius so this uh listener is wondering whether we think that s t Eve and Lido that's the stake derivative each version on Lido is in Risk given Celsius and all of the turmoil what do you think about this the answer is very definitively no there's nothing wrong with Lido this is only to do with Celsius staked eth is trading at a discount to eat right now because people like Celsius entities like Celsius and other people that have used steak eth as collateral had to sell their staked uh on the market to get eth back to pay back their collateral but that has nothing to do with the actual protocol of Lido itself it doesn't it doesn't mean anything so like they're they are completely immune from that it's just Market shenanigans that is a byproduct of the fact that ether on the beacon chain is locked for the foreseeable future so people that needed liquidity had to sell their steak to eat for a discount in order to access that liquidity that does not mean anything about the solvency of Lido that is just completely irrelevant and just not related to the to anything to do with Celsius and so this is not only is this not a risk this is an actual an opportunity and so some people are forced sellers of staked eth I think the staked eat rate right now is something like 0.94 steak to eat to eat when those things should be trading at one to one and so you can actually take if you have like 10 each for example and you take it to curve where you can get stake teeth liquidity you can turn 10 eth into something like uh 10.6 eth and so if you are if you have a bunch of ether and you're ready to be locked up and until the withdrawals are enabled at an unknown time in the future you can actually count that you can actually get that Arbitrage and turn your 10 each into like 10.60 for free you're basing that because every St eth is redeemable for one eth once withdrawals are enabled right so you're kind of basing it on that you're saying like steth is depegged from the price of eth um but if you're a long-term holder of eth and you want steak deep you just buy that and you make maybe like five percent more ten percent more in terms of your etholding at the end of this the only person the only people that are really affected by this stfegging are some of the degens right so if you have a collateralized loan that's nominating Ste because you're trying to get leverage in your stake teeth you might want to check on that like that's not a good but if you're just a Lido depositor right S one steth is still worth one eth and uh once the merge happens once withdrawals are enabled there should be no problem withdrawing that at this point in time that's kind of good news right because people are worried about that if you have cash this is an opportunity so not only do you get like that five six percent premium because of the state discount you are also getting the staking yields on top of that as well yeah so bullish bullish how about this question David but note on that actually that doesn't mean you go and stake your East in Lido you don't because then you will you will get if you take 10 each and you go stake it in Lido you'll get 10 steak Ethan return which are only worth points you should buy it you should buy steak to eat you should stake your eat with Lido that's a different thing you want to go buy off the secondary Market because that's where the discount is okay there you go uh dragondad.east one thing I'll say about that though is there might be some tax implications of doing that oh yeah I don't know I don't know thank you none of this is financial advice all right she's next question next question uh what should retail investors be doing now huddle borrow dollars and buy sell and buy back later so this is a hard question because it always depends on facts and circumstances who you are what your financial situation is is going to depend on what the answer is and I don't know your financial situation Dragon dad.eth but I do know the only thing I do know is that ether at one thousand one hundred dollars is a better price than it was at two thousand dollars and three thousand dollars and four thousand dollars uh and so it really depends on do what what are your outstanding liabilities how much you have to pay in rent how much you have to pay for your mortgage do you have like do you have to pay for your kids college uh do you have to pay for your food what do you have to pay for in my opinion and it always will be ether is the greatest asset of all time and the world is a slow to figure that out so if you have everything buttoned down I am a big fan of dollar cost averaging because we are down so bad that we're probably not going to rock it up off of the ground I do not know the future of course but I would lean into you having long more time two dollar cost average into crypto rather than less because when there's so much pain in the markets things just don't recover instantly and so again I don't know who you are I don't know your financial situation but I would say that you have time to make slow and conscious and calculated decisions how do you feel about that answer Brian yeah I think that's a great answer and I'm going to be like give the crypto dad answer that's going to work best for like 95 of people right which is like um absolutely hold is the question so hold yes borrow dollars and buy no do not do that there are people that the answer of borrow dollars and buy the answer to that question is yes but it's not to the people that ask the question yeah that nobody already answered this margin is just like look at look at experience three hours Capital right the best crypto fund managers hedge fund managers so you just got liquidated because of margin all right so borrowed dollars and buy no 95 of people if you're listening to this you're probably one of them um sell and buy back in later also a no that makes you a Trader that makes your Trader are you a Trader or are you just you know an investor you got it we've said this before you got to pick your character class and as we're talking about the top of the episode right so like if you're in the acceptance phase you're going to be tempted to like um trade these dips the ups and the downs I think a lot of people will lose a lot of money doing that you're better off dollar cost averaging in holding what you have at this point in time none of this is financial advice just our personal takes on it this this kind of thing probably works for the vast majority of bankless listeners um all right David let's get to some takes of the week this is a hot identity take from none other than vitalik he's talking all about identity now yeah since he's come on the bankless podcast you know and uh this is a really interesting take what does he say yeah he goes please stop using real name to refer to your passport name your government doesn't get to Define you who you really are if you use a different name in most day-to-day interaction interactions that is your real name passport name legal name slave name to be edgy are all fine and so basically he's just saying like yeah your government doesn't dictate what your name is you dictate what your name is now wow I so happen to have the same name that I have on my passport but if the government told me that my name was different I would reject that and that's basically what vitalik here is saying yeah I think that's a really interesting take it it just um I think it brings to light how much we are like we we are in the water we swim and we don't even recognize there's water around us right like what is our name oh that's the State issue it's the thing on my birth certificates the state it's also the name that your parents gave you most of true most of the true but um let's say let's say the state changed my name but my parents didn't right and I didn't decide to then what is actually my name a lot of us would default well my real name is whatever it says on the birth certificate is that your real name wow the the nation state and our institutions have a lot of hidden Force exertion on how they're how they're controlling us and this does bring up a new Avenue for decentralized identity and what who are you as a person well maybe it's about who you decide to be maybe it's about like what you're like consent and also the consent of your community and maybe it doesn't have to be top down nation state uh push down to you anyway you know just opening that what is a thought what is the source of truth of your name exactly the nation state because right now we are in a that is the actual source of truth that is the Paradigm in a decentralized identity Paradigm it's whatever you put down exactly right exactly right okay so here are some related takes as well and this is kind of the Silver Lining uh of the bear Market that we've seen so far and that's D5 didn't break David this is the first take on the silver lining from you what are you saying here yeah I say take note everything breaking right now is centralized meanwhile Defy is orderly and efficient defy not C5 like I said at the beginning this is like the one of the best tests of defy of all time billions of dollars getting liquidated gas fees were not that crazy if gases were pretty reasonable everything got liquidated extremely efficiency efficiently except for all the C5 companies so if you're C5 you're down bad D5 is down bad too but at least D5 is orderly and efficient and it's the Mandate of the SEC to have orderly and efficient markets and so doing your job SEC we took care of it like we don't need you anymore well I do think that's not true we do need you in some instances we need to where things are centralized right and I think a D5 can be your best friend if you are a regulator because you get to right click view Source what are you know what are the assets what are they composed of um this is my take on the the same theme two words Celsius and Luna had in common trust me right right trust for those that don't follow me on Twitter because they're not on Twitter Ryan can you tell them what my Twitter handle is David is at trustless State you gotta follow okay it's a great account between some good things sometimes here or there but like okay trustless State what did that what did that come from and I always wondered David I've never asked you this when this I get the trustless part right it's obviously decentralized it's just the opposite of trust uh trust me it's you know trustless no trust required the state part are you talking about the state machine are you talking about like um nation state or is the answer that question yes that's what you're about to tell the answer is yes brother did you plan that 100 I did yeah well done then the state of being trustlessness and the nation-state in the clouds is created out of a trustless paradigm uh yeah I created that that Twitter handle in like 2018 when I barely understood crypto and I'm actually like super I'm super proud of that that like that understanding of like very early here I am with my Twitter handle it's just my slave name my nature state slave name Ryan FS Adams you got to get your metaverse name brother I know I know I gotta come up with that all right what's this last take on the same theme yeah this last take is coming from the Twitter handle which I'm not going to even try to pronounce who says on-chain transparency is the biggest winner during the UST that's Tara Celsius three hours Capital meltdowns the parts we understand best are because of the blockchain data and it gives incredibly valuable information to the market tradfy will never have this you will never get this you will never get this no you won't but uh come on over we'll we'll hire you we'll help you out a little bit um and the bear Market's a good time to come over even though you probably won't be listening to this during the bear Market um David in all of this this entire episode has been a bear Market episode but what do you bullish on where's the silver lining for you well Ryan I am so glad that you asked because on this week on Bank list I put this article titled eight projects that I'm bullish on in this bear market and so I've literally listed these out eight different projects that I think are both like underreported underrated under acknowledged some of you might know them but uh many of them I bet you you don't uh and these are projects that span the entire crypto sphere so we got each staking technology and mobile Finance we have Bridging the infinite infinite number of chains an infinite number of apps across the infinite number of decks aggregators with li-fi we got interest rate swap amms we got block natives which is like predicting the future using the mempool we got new money markets in Euler we got Aztec which is a diva which is a privacy layer too that unless you use D5 apps on the layer one we got Tracer Dow which is a meta derivatives meta protocol and disco which is decentralized identity for the data backpack for the metaverse and the real verse and I summarize all of these things into one great big article and not only that Ryan I put in further resources for diving down the rabbit hole of every single one if these have jobs I put links to the jobs that they are hiring and I also put the win conditions for how each one of these projects can win and claim market share and mind share in the future and so is this is this what you wish someone did for you last bear Market 100 though all of the stubs like took the notes and were like hey go here go here check this out right this is literally eight different rabbit holes from across the crypto space defy apps layer twos cross chain money markets non-crypto stuff at all and so yes like and the thing is like okay disclaimer I'm an investor in all of these pretty sure Ryan is too uh but this is also why I know they're not gonna rug me and they're not going to rug my my readers or listeners who want trusted rabbit holes to go down and so you can go down this rabbit hole with trust and trusting there's not a trap at the bottom wait wait I thought you were trustless state we have to who we trusting here do you know what's cool about this though all these all these things when you say rabbit hole you're not just talking about the project itself you're talking about all of these are completely different categories right right bridges are going to be huge so it's huge so learn about li-fi but then learn about hop learn about all of the other bridging protocols and actually li-fi is an aggregator on top of that so it's even another category um Tracer this is on like arbitrim other layer twos and it's a a new spin on derivatives like permissionless derivatives Opel this is a shared secret validator type technology it's going to help a protocol like each of these cat are categories of rabbit holes that you can go down that are like typified by these projects but open up a new door for you like new new areas new other projects to explore new areas in uh like the crypto space that you didn't already know that's what's so cool about this yeah and I had a ton of fun writing this piece I actually put out a tweet saying hey uh if you think there are other rabbit holes that go down let me know I'll go and research that project I think I'm going to turn this into a semi-reoccurring irregular because I can't make promises but I'll keep on doing stuff like this because rabbit holes are fun and Ryan we are in a build market and for the crypto newbies who are trying to gain conviction for them we are in a research and development market and hopefully resources like this can help those people gain the conviction that we have Ryan absolutely Ryan what are you excited about look man I'm excited because we're gonna make it notice I didn't say we're all gonna make it because some people will quit like the tour sleeps away happens yep uh so I've never like we're all gonna we're all gonna make it a nice thing to say but the reality is like some of us will make it those that do are here because they have conviction but like what I what I really mean is this feels a lot different than 2018 to me um some people that's the number one question people ask of like those that were around in the last bear cycle is like oh is this 2018 how does this feel how does this compare to that and here's the difference in 2018 we didn't have product Market fit in crypto or defy D5 was actually nothing at that time we had like maker maybe it kind of worked we weren't sure though only we didn't have enemy on the down downtrend yeah yeah we barely had nfts right no one is actually like using these we had cryptokitties and that wrecked the entire chain ethereum had no path to scalability or staking there are ideas like plasma State channels no real path staking was distant we didn't know how distant at the time but like there was no pending merge that was actually going to happen with a beacon chain that was live in 2022 we have all of this the the difference here is we've been punched down by macro and self-inflicted leverage wounds that's what you saw Celsius I don't feel self-inflicted leverage run from Thrones Capital by the way just for the record I feel like they inflicted that upon me well okay so maybe they they inflicted that on themselves and like you're getting like I don't know the the characters of that the collab yes the collateral damage of that so in 2018 I was fearful and you know I was fearful David because I wasn't actually sure if we were going to make it at that time because we didn't have the the hardest thing which is like product Market fit we had Ico people couldn't come back after like these Ico things and so I was a lot more fearful then I'm not now because now this is just a matter of of macro this is just a matter of like self-inflicted leveraging so they'll take some time to heal but they will heal like we have product Market fit now and um I'm not I'm not concerned in the same way I was in 2018 in fact I'm like I'm like bullish going into this this bear market so it's a totally different vibe in a totally different feel at least for me I don't know if you you feel some of that but yeah you know as a result of this treat Ryan I think I'll stick around for the bear Market I convinced you I think I think I'll stick around awesome man well let's see let's see what happens I'll see what happens on the other side we'll see this again what do we got memes of the week what are we looking at memes of the week this is life comes at you pretty fast and this is the man uh triggering a dominoes within the dominoes get bigger and bigger and bigger right and so the first Domino is a bat in China and then the middle Domino is I'm worth a hundred million dollars and then the last Domino is I'm homeless uh and you know good memes package up data pretty damn well and this in my what I hear is a bunch of whiplash so what I'll say back when I when we did our bear Market emergency live stream I blame the FED for just whiplashing this market around like spraying money everywhere say hey free money like don't worry about the pandemic we're giving you free money and then they raised interest rates like give that money back and everyone was like I spent it all uh and that's and so like I blame the fed and so yeah if you are homeless sorry if you're homeless blame the FED they're they this meme encapsulates the three segments here we had covid we had like meme stocks money doesn't mean anything anymore and now we're moving to like recession hopefully not something worse we just we sped around that so fast look here's another uh another uh GIF that's uh we'll end with this one the meme of the week this is about uh transitory inflation what are we looking at David yeah uh and so this is a bunch of people I think this must be like I don't know the sweps else or something they're speaking English also the sound on this is really scary which is why we're not playing uh playing it but you can definitely tell that all these people are looking at something over the mountain they look like they're at a ski resort and then you see the snow coming in it's like oh wow there's an avalanche happening over there on that mountain over there and so they're all looking at this Avalanche and then they all at the same time realize that they are about to get blasted by this Avalanche because it's coming for them and it took them like a really long time to realize that they were about to get blasted by this Avalanche and so the caption is is that inflation uh and then yes and it's transitory we won't even notice and then in the last frame they are just completely blasted by Snow Yeah it's uh that's kind of how it felt like we got blasted by an entire Avalanche uh inflation not so transitory guys we're gonna get through this this has been our bear Market episode hopefully the worst down bad week of the year but as always gotta end with this none of this has been Financial advice of course Bitcoin and eth are risky as we've said before
