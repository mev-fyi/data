decade in crypto what does it take to survive in crypto how have you made it so long when people ask this question it's very easy to use this like sort of hindsight bias and we're like oh well i did this and i thought this about the world and blah blah blah i think it's more useful to observe all the people i know from that time that didn't get to this point in the market and went and did other things and i think the first thing was that most people that have survived through the markets have is like a healthy balance of skepticism and like curiosity and the second one is like people don't like to talk about it so much because they like to think that they're smart and stuff but it's just like luck and not like when the lottery flipped a coin look but it's right place right time right life circumstances kind of luck in my case i was at university and the amount of money i put into crypto was so small which meant i didn't need to ever sell my crypto in order to fund some part of my life and i think most people that didn't make it that back then believed became forced sellers somehow
