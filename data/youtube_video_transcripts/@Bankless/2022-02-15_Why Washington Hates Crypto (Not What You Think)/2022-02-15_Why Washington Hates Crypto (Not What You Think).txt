why does it feel like washington hates crypto if you feel that there's an anti-crypto sentiment i i don't want to go there yet it really is the pro-government anti-government split a democrat would typically believe that government should provide the best solutions to our problems a republican in the truest sense of the word would say that no the individual provides the best solutions the truth is the answer lies somewhere in between it's people working with government and you left something out earlier at least that i would add which is uh fear and i think that drives them with their policy making too if they don't understand crypto so to conclude david yes you do have a small group i'm not going to name names people watch them they look incredibly foolish and ignorant when they talk during hearings about things that make absolutely no sense in the crypto space someday you know those will be the ones that people say hey remember when you said the world was flat
