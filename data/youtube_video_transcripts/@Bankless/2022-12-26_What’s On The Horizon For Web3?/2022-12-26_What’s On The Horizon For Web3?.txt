what are you seeing on the horizon colliding with web3 like where the rubber is going to meet the pavement as we start to understand more and more utility restaurants using it as exclusive membership or Golf Course to get in but then you start thinking about what we can do even if it's just allowing people access to online communities we know that communities already in Reddit is a great precedent for this where there is no incentive other than we have a community we have a culture you're part of it we know that those work at scale massively well seeing the infrastructure gets built up around enabling communities in web 3 is one of the things I'm most excited about over the next year or two things I'm betting on are the things that are creating this kind of infrastructure around Community or these communities themselves we will see real utility evolve we'll see technologies that will make it even more valuable to own nfts with robust communities again if we know it works without real ownership then by adding that really important element it should grow even faster and even stronger
