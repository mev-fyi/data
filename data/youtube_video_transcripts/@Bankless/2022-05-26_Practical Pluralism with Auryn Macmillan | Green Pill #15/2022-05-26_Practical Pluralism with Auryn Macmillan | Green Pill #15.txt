[Music] hey hey coordination i've got a really fun episode for you and i think a pretty meaningful episode too with or macmillan the founder of clear fund who also works on gnosis guild in this episode we talk about clear fund and get coin we're both quadratic funding protocols that are designed to help fund the public good in the ethereum ecosystem quadratic funding is a mechanism that allows for the optimal funding of an ecosystem and i think that what's really interesting is that aaron and i are both working on different flavors of quadratic funding and we use that as a launch pad in this episode to talk about practical pluralism the philosophy of client diversity the philosophy of aiming for anti-fragility and capture resistance for your ecosystem we've been really inspired by the work that superfiz in the prismatic labs team and the lighthouse team have done at creating client diversity at the base layer of the ethereum network and in this episode aaron and i talk about what would it look like if we took that philosophy and we scaled it to other parts of the ecosystem in public goods and quadratic funding where arnon and i are working but also what if we embraced practical pluralism in the nft d5 endow tooling ecosystems what kind of beautiful things could we create with modularity and well-documented interfaces in forkable code this episode is all about practical pluralism we've got the theory in the pluralism and we've got the actual practicalness in the practical part of the episode and i think this is gonna be like this is gonna go down as one of my favorite green pill episodes i think so coordination i think you're really gonna enjoy this episode with oran mcmillan the founder of clearfund without further ado i give you oren macmillan if you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem alto ira can help you invest in crypto in tax advantage ways to help you preserve your hard earned money also crypto ira lets you invest in more than 150 coins and tokens with all the same tax advantages of an ira they make it easy to fund your alternative ira or crypto ira via your 401k or by contributing directly from your bank account there is no setup or account fees and is all you need to do to invest in crypto tax-free let me repeat that again you can invest in crypto tax-free diversify like the pros and trade without tax headaches open an alto crypto ira to invest in crypto tax free just go to altoira dot com bankless that's a l t o i r a dot com bank list and start investing in crypto today when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your default trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets what's up aaron how you doing good man doing really well how about you uh pretty good i think that you and i are in opposite parts of the world right now i'm over here in colorado you're in australia i'm having coffee it's nighttime behind you right yeah it's uh it's i don't know 11 25 11 now and i think what seven yeah i am for you so yeah it's uh office at the end of the spectrum right now yeah well i think we're in opposite ends of the spectrum but here's my segway we're in similar parts of the ethereum ecosystem so um tell me about what you're what you're working on yeah uh a whole bunch of different stuff um but i guess maybe relevant to to the conversation today uh i mean i've been my primary focus for the last year year and a half has been on uh zodiac which is this kind of composable uh dow tooling standard and then a whole bunch of tools kind of built to that standard and it's it's really intended just to make all of the existing dial tools play nicely it's it's a way of kind of enabling much more flexible uh and future feature proof organizations kind of that can grow and adapt to whatever their environment looks like in the future and then kind of on the on the side as a passion project for the last couple of years i've been working on clear fund which is a quadratic funding protocol built on macy the minimal anti-collusion infrastructure which is this really neat framework for collusion resistant voting quadratic voting quadratic funding uh built using zero knowledge proofs very cool um deeply respect both projects that you're working on and i want to talk about the gnosis stuff but actually the reason that we're having you on greenpill today uh is because of clearfund being a quadratic funding protocol um and for listeners who are skilled at reading between the lines git coin also has a flagship product bitcoin grants that is a quadratic funding protocol and one of the things that i think that you and i are really excited to talk about is to drill in on the shared value that we've discovered that we have uh over the last several years you and i have had this friendship and it's kind of blossomed into clear fund and get coin both being quadratic funding protocols and we've discovered that we have this shared value of practical pluralism so um you and i have written an essay about practical pluralism that we're going to be releasing it's going to be in the show notes if people want to check it out and and would love for us to like go through that essay together and to um and to sort of talk about why that's a shared value and what it means for us to be working on something bigger than each of our projects together so i don't know anything else to anything to say about that before we we dive into the essay or yeah i mean i i love the way that you frame it um we we obviously have been kind of working uh in and around the same kind of things for the last couple of years and both kind of have this deep uh respect for an understanding of the value of uh of pluralism of kind of diversity in in uh ecosystems like web3 and the the value that that uh can bring across a whole bunch of different aspects of the ecosystem but i mean maybe we maybe we'll just dive into reading through the essay rather than uh kind of beating around the bush on it or kind of musing on it uh beforehand yeah totally uh do you want to do the honors yeah sure let's do it so yeah the essay is titled practical pluralism uh i'll just dive right in the ethereum network is secured by block producers currently miners soon to be replaced by validators they're the foundation of consensus in the ethereum network upon which there are trillions of dollars of assets and untold and untapped potential for human coordination having well-designed secure and dependable block producers to protect this value is a great strategy to defend the network and one of the key strengths employed by the ethereum community to ensure secure and reliable block production is client diversity this means more than one implementation of the specification they can be differentiated by language architecture features or which part of the network network they specialize in so if a single client were used by two-thirds 66 of validators and experienced a serious bug there's this very real risk that this could lead to uh chain instability for users and monetary loss for node operators by treating client diversity as a public good and fostering an environment where many independent client teams are incentivized to implement the ethereum protocol in disparate code bases the ethereum community bakes in a measure of anti-fragility and resilience against bugs in any one implementation so client diversity is pluralism in practice pluralism is the understanding that diversity of people beliefs opinions mechanisms approaches implementations etc within a given context generally results in better outcomes than in the absence of such diversity nowhere is this more evident than in ecosystems with rich biodiversity ecosystems where radically different flora and fauna work in a harmoniously competitive act of mutual regulation and perpetuation this can be seen in how the success of one species feed feeds and is kept in check by the success of another species and so on so pluralism itself is a primitive for anti-fragility resilience and regenerative systems as an ecosystem ethereum has done a great job of fostering diversity in its mining and validating clients but similarly we should insist on pluralism across the full stack of web 3 technologies and culture so this includes discrete products like rpc nodes dow tooling public goods funding mechanisms like econ grants and clear fund automatic market makers stable coins developer tooling as well as the intangibles that influence intangible influences like the people groups communities and opinions which participate which we participate in and which hold sway over our ecosystem so we're writing this essay because we believe in client diversity we believe in pluralism as a primitive and we want you to join us in extending the ethos of client diversity and pluralism to other layers of the stack by having pluralism as a core value of each vertical we make it more likely that the space tends towards capture resistance not fragility participants should be able to choose to use or not to use any one of a number of options for any given need by having pluralism at the beating heart of each niche we ensure the space is anti-fragile if there is a major bug discovered in one system the resulting cascading harm can only go so far because there'll always be another dap ready to pick up the slack for web 3 to truly express itself diversity and pluralism must be core values so to all those who seek to build and enshrine and defend moats in this shared virtual machine to build systems incapable of composition incapable of componentization and capable of being permissionlessly replaced by some alternative we say this is a pattern of the past it's an anti-pattern in web3 and it's a pattern enabled by permission to access to and control of data this pattern will be made redundant in our version of the internet made redundant by our shared virtual machine and the future will be dominated by much more emergent systems organic compositions of many discrete and interchangeable components built by disparate people in combinations never dreamt of by their creators and it's through this diversity that we build anti-fragility and a resilience to capture censorship and stagnation we challenged the protocols at the center of the nft d5 and dow tooling ecosystems to adopt practical pluralism as part of their design philosophy and their broader ethos beautiful i think you have a future as a voice actor also or i was realizing as you as you read that um so this was an essay that you and i wrote together and we wanted to send a signal by having you on the green pill podcast and talking about practical pluralism together that signal is that at an intellectual level we believe in client diversity and pluralism that creates anti-fragility it creates capture resistance it creates a right to exit at each of these layers of the stack i think that for me writing this essay i was very inspired by superfiz and the prismatic labs in lighthouse and other client teams just the fact that they're all working on clients that is gonna secure this multi-billion dollar network and none of them is competing for client share they're actually trying to create an ecosystem in which the entire network can thrive and they know that by having a tactical retreat on trying to have too much of the network they actually create a strategic asset in the the diversity and the capture resistance and the anti-fragility of the network so at at the client layer if there's a bug in say prismatic or in lighthouse then the network can still continue because the system is not captured by one client and our challenge is to extend that from the client layer of the ethereum network to the nft ecosystem to the defy ecosystem to the dow tooling ecosystem and then also to public goods so um you know i think that public goods is is really important to to do that for because we don't want to have one tool like if we're gonna build this civil civilizational scale infrastructure for funding public goods there's not gonna be just one one mechanism that can solve for that but also you wouldn't wanna have just one implementation of that mechanism solve for that what you actually want is have this rich diversity of pluralistic mechanisms and pluralistic projects that are that are supporting that that stack and i think that um there's no clearer expression of that than i think the like our friendship over the last several years in which you're running clear fund and i'm running bitcoin grants although now that we're a dow i'm not really running much bitcoin grants anymore but um yeah those are the major takeaways for me from the essay a curious kind of where your head is at after reading through that that essay yeah i mean obviously the the um kind of the way that gear coin grants and cliffon have had this i don't know interesting a very kind of mutually beneficial relationship over the past few years has been uh fantastic and i think is really really great practical example of of pluralism in practice um and of uh two two ecosystems really trying to foster that kind of uh two two products in the same kind of niche or two to communities in the same kind of niche uh trying to foster that type of pluralism and then being kind of really supportive of of that kind of pluralism i guess like for a backstory there um for anyone that's not aware of it a clear fund has been a recipient in in uh qikon grants i think since the second or third round um so it's it's uh been been receiving funding from that the funding from that has been almost exclusively used to uh back a bunch of the early uh funding rounds that that clear fund ended up running essentially was used as matching funds for those rounds um which was uh incredible because it was uh essentially one quadratic funding around uh supporting another quadratic funding round that was running on some really you know super experimental software at the time and it's still still very early days but like in you know ukraine grants around i think around two or three was when clear fund first got in uh you know it was it was i'm sorry i was gonna i was just gonna interject like can we say that was the first quadratic quadratic funding like quadratic on quadratic right yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely um and then uh the the git coin dao uh ended up uh giving a grant to clear fund to kind of continue this effort to continue this research into that that grant from clear from uh get going dow is is funding the the current development or part of the current development on clear fund and then in turn clear fund is now uh working with bitcoin to to spin up a kind of sister round or a kind of trial round using clear fund stack to to go along with one of the future uh get going grants around and so yeah has this really uh i don't know great uh cooperative relationship between these two uh communities and two uh sets of products that you know in in the traditional world and in a world where you're not kind of embracing this pluralism and kind of understanding the the benefit that it has for the larger ecosystem um yeah we we have kind of developed this this fantastic cooperative yeah plus one and and i've just got to say that like through the years i think that even as clear find you launched you came up to me at east denver and you're like hey we launched this thing like just wanted to to let you know about it um and we've just kind of like continued this conversation about where our values align and also where um where our values differ and the diversity of that makes up a stronger um strong stronger ecosystem and and yeah plus one to all the different ways the projects have interacted in the in the past um i think the ways that they differ is that git coin i i foolishly built as centralized back in 2017 and 2018 and that allowed us to iterate faster on creating a web 2 style user experience i call like git coin the the original platform as like web 2.5 in that it's crypto enabled but it's hosted at a data center in in oregon on aws and uh clear fund from the beginning has been very um maximal decentralization or at least much more on the decentralization spectrum than git coin um and then has also um used a different mechanism for preventing collusion git coin uses pairwise bonding which is an idea from vitalik and uh clear fund is using macy which is an idea from vitalik also um we're all just vitalik's brain children i guess but um and the other thing i'll say about macy is that it creates much stronger privacy guarantees about what you're funding which could be important in a lunar punk future in which we're funding public goods but we don't want other people to say um who's who's been um been funding public goods but but the one thing i will say is that as get coin decentralizes and we're working on bitcoin grants 2.0 y'all have kind of proven that it's possible to do in a much more decentralized uh permissionless modular way and that's been an inspiration for us as well yeah absolutely i mean i think uh we've talked about this for years now already but uh for the benefit of everyone else i think they essentially get kind of clear fun just to attack the same problem from opposite ends of the spectrum you know like get coin was very focused on getting something into production so that it could be iterated on quickly and uh and focused on solving the user experience of it like figuring out how you put a quadratic funding around into production and like what all those interactions look like and so clear fund uh was able to leverage a bunch of those learnings when we were thinking about how how we think about what the the user interface should look like a lot of the interactions that people would would uh expect when they're participating in a round like that um and because we had the advantage of being able to leverage those learnings we're really able to focus on the other end of it where we say okay what what are the things that we can put in place to uh maximally uh you know focus on collusion resistance and and like maximally decentralize this you know like build a software stack here where someone could potentially take this have it be owned make a deployment of it that's owned entirely by a dow and and uh you know have this thing exist as a as a illegal cross-jurisdictional kind of totally autonomous uh quadratic funding round we haven't gotten to that stage yet as in in terms of actually deploying that kind of instance of it uh but it's i think that the stack is is now at a point where it could be uh which is is really really cool but again like we we were able to do that because i think a lot of the um there was a lot of uh preliminary work done by by git coin in terms of all of the user experience type stuff we we use that as inspiration and then modified it in a lot of places where we didn't have access to the same kind of data and stuff like that and then obviously we also benefited incredibly from all of the work that the ethereum foundation had put into macy the middle anti-collusion of frustration yeah totally um and by the way i gotta say that macy is so inspiring for me i'm getting a little bit of fomo not being able to work on macy's stuff but uh it's it's on the road map over the horizon for grants 2.0 so looking forward to benefiting from your work uh if and when we get there um i i guess i i i would love to turn the conversation towards what the listener can can learn like say you're working at an nft project or at a d5 like you're you're a founder of a d5 project what are some practical tips if you want to embrace practical pluralism like obviously you can read the essay and tweet about it um one of the things that like reverse engineering my in your experience that i think is mattered matters is is having that like social interop from the start like you and i have just like kind of been friends before get back before git coin had bitcoin grants and back before um you were working on clear funds i think that social interop at the base layer is important before you have technology interop or like a philosophical or economic interrupt um and and i don't know like does does client diversity like does pluralism scale out of the most out of the most hippy-dippy niches like you know public goods is is kind of this like really infinite horizon that we're all shooting towards um you know is it does it does this this philosophy of practical pluralism can it be implemented outside of public goods um and outside of outside of science diversity yeah yeah absolutely i mean it really is is uh a net benefit anywhere where anti-fragility is is a benefit right you know like any way that uh you you get a benefit from having a fall over system if if the the system that you're using uh backstopper is no longer available you know so i mean a really great example of it uh in like the dow tooling space is uh that the front end for compound framework compound governor or open deaf and governor uh there's there's three kind of well known implementations of it there's the compounds uh implementation of it uh there's simple.org and there's tally it's like by having those three things all uh all expressing uh essentially the same dowels uh if one doesn't expose a function that you want or one of them goes down because their web hosting fell over or one of them is using uh i don't know using a cdn that's blocking your ip address or whatever it is then you know you can you can go and uh interact with the same data from another framework uh and i mean like beyond that there's there's a whole bunch of other uh dow tools that uh are exposing again those same sets of dials in in different ways exposing the same sense of data but potentially different uh different interactions or different data points from those dials so you have things like deep dow and boardroom stuff like that that are um exposing more kind of analytic style data on those uh on those those same sets of thousands so i think like that kind of client diversity makes uh makes the whole ecosystem much stronger and and that's true of of dow tooling that's true of d5 tools that's true of just about everything in web three yeah you know um the compound example is great git coindao actually uses compound style governance and it was great to just be able to plug in our governance to all these different frameworks when it launched um i'm actually realizing that git coin when we first launched had a bounty product uh and we were built off of standard bounties which was built by my friends vil will villanueva mark bailey and simona pop who launched standard bounties and one of the things that happened in that relationship was that we actually iterated away from standard bounties because we i didn't have some functionality that we wanted and therefore we we just kind of abandoned standard bounties and and went went our own way um and you know recording this episode on practical pluralism now um realizing that we deviated away from that pluralism with the bounty standard i think the lesson for me is that you can have practical pluralism once the specification is fixed and you've kind of reached product market fit a little bit more so in terms of like the practical part of practical pluralism my lesson from that standard bounties experience was that it can sort of be done once a once a protocol or an interface is relatively mature and then the coordination cost of staying on top of that standard is is much much less so um yeah yeah that's a great point i mean standard bounties was was interesting um but the i think like as with a lot of uh a lot of things that were made i don't know between 2015 and 2000 i don't know 19. it they just didn't factor in you know the outrageous gas spikes that we started seeing uh 2019 through now um and so yeah like the the the ux that those kind of things introduced just uh made things made a lot of projects kind of not viable on uh on mainnet and i think standard boundaries was one of the things that really suffered from totally yeah um but you know still i have that lesson there of like we have the social interop between the git coin and the bounties teams and then you know like the get coin and the clr clear fun teams and then we're we're kind of like building technical and economic interop on top of that um and i think it's like you know it's just interesting to sort of like map out our values and to try to figure out exactly what we're trying to build together what is the world we're trying to build together with um when we're embracing this practical pluralism i know are there any other examples that come to mind for you or any sort of uh takeaways about about how to how to how to shoot for this goal together yeah uh i mean i think the a huge part of it so you talked about uh you know standards kind of crystallizing a little bit and that making it much easier but even prior to that happen i think a big part of it is just building in a way that enables other people to uh to go and build essentially the the alternate to what you're building or the alternate interface to what you're building you know if you're writing smart contracts then uh writing them in such a way that someone else could uh expose you know you can write a contract that exposes the same interface and then plug it into the other tools that you've built uh or conversely if you're right you're writing a smart contract then write in such a way that uh someone else could go and replace your interface for us and like your your ui so modularity i think is what i heard there yeah yeah exactly modularity composability i mean obviously i'm really biased on this because of uh zodiac and this is kind of the message i've been trying to drill into people's head for the last i don't know six months eight months something like that uh but yeah this this idea of kind of modularity and composability and what particularly kind of composability is is i think one of the great value propositions of of web 3 is this ability to essentially have this shared execution environment where we can um we can all kind of build on top of the things that other people have built we can we can kind of leverage um mean yeah leveraging the existing uh kind of deployed systems uh built on top of them to create these kind of really uh emergent systems that are kind of well beyond what the the original original deploy i kind of intended them to be used for kind of how they imagined them being used um you get kind of much more emergent uh ecosystems of applications with this this kind of small modular composable type systems as opposed to large monolithic systems um so yeah i think like practically then for someone who's building something building in such a way where it's it's friendly with that like leveraging existing tools but also exposing uh interfaces that other people can interact with uh making your stuff open source like putting your interfaces off making them open source so other people can fork them and change them and modify them and host an alternate if yours goes down or you know run it locally or yeah anything like this so you've got some money but how are you gonna use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits [Music] set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] is a member-owned digital employment cooperative offering payroll health insurance and membership perks that go beyond the basics that you would find at your normal

thousand work and a thousand bank tokens when you become a member of opolis by may 25th 2022 and get started working your self-sovereign life [Music] so it seems like you know one of the mistakes i think that we made in early in get coin was a building at centralized but b building and this monolith that wasn't really didn't have well documented interfaces and i think that i i i i think that we're aiming to be more modular in grants 2.0 when that launches um and i think that what will be neat about that is it'll enable interop between different components of the clear fund or the bitcoin system and this is all very high level and hand wavy right now but i know we've talked about you know an interaction between the two registries as one of the first modules that we're going to have that that interact with each other so going from that social interop to the technology interop um yeah is is is a step aside just just for listeners what uh what we're talking about there is this um kind of universal grants registry we have one registry that uh anyone who wants to be a recipient of of grants kind of just across the border at least like web 3 grants can kind of create one profile profile on that registry and it be shared across a whole bunch of different platforms a whole bunch of different groups yeah i'm actually of the mind that there will never be one registry because we have this l2 ecosystem and i think just having like multiple registries from which you can pub sub from them we can we'll never be able to bless one as the canonical registry because that's not how the ethereum ecosystem works i'll be curious for your take on that yeah so i guess it depends on on what you're considering one so like i guess when i'm thinking about this registry like acknowledging that there's going to be this this uh huge ecosystem of different networks um the i don't know maybe this is getting too in the weeds but i've been envisioning essentially having uh this this kind of registry contract deployed anywhere the evm exists and then um probably consuming that with something like a sub graph and using some the the graph's upcoming subgraph composition feature to merge all of that into one master subgraph so it doesn't really matter what network you you add your registry item on it should all end up in this one kind of master right that's interesting but yeah these are the kind of conversations that you can have when you have social interop for your project you start planning for the technology interop of of the platforms and i think that the end result if we're successful and by the way there's no guarantee we'll be successful it would be that a person who's running a grant can can put it in this registry and then any uh other project that's embracing this practical pluralism in the ethereum ecosystem can can pull those grants in which hopefully meets creates more funding for more public goods uh in in the future so in the end the the citizens not i'm not gonna i'm gonna call them citizens not not consumers or users the citizens of the ethereum ecosystem are the ones who stand to benefit yeah yeah absolutely um i i would have to assume that you've been uh reading vitalik and glenn and i can't remember the third author's name the soulbound tokens oh yeah yeah yeah zoey wrote the original qf paper um i believe it was it was uh puja who's the third author on their their silvante yes yes yes yes um yeah and this uh this whole sound like there's a whole bunch of alignment i think between what they're what they're suggesting and uh and this kind of idea of uh pluralism as well i mean like they obviously talk about pluralism a bunch in there but this is uh they're talking about it mostly i think on the the social layer uh as opposed to the kind of technical layer which is what you've been hinting at as the kind of precursor that's the necessary precondition for um for the kind of more technical layer to to actually emerge right and we'll uh we'll include in the show notes a link to glen and vitalik's paper which is probably worth its own its own episode it's entitled decentralized society and it's in the show notes if anyone wants to check it out let's see yeah i think we only have uh five minutes left so where should we end um i guess the call to action for the listeners is check out the essay if you believe in practical pluralism please tweet about it we want to expand on the work that superfiz and the client diversity advocates in the ecosystem have done and extend that to different layers of the stack this this ideal of practical pluralism to different layers of the stack so that's my call to action what what do you think where's your head at yeah i mean i'd echo that uh just just shout about it um but then also i don't know be about it like also you know if you're building if you're if you're designing something then then take take this to heart this is this is the practical side of it it means actually using it in practice so like if you're if you're designing something if you're building something include this as one of your design goals it's one of the things that you want to build for you want to build to enable this kind of pluralism at whatever part of the stack you're building think about how you can essentially make your tool one of many that might be performing the same function uh how you might make it replaceable how you might make it interoperate with other competing tools or you might make it uh you know make it so that others can build tools on top of yours or alternate uh interfaces on top of yours or yeah anything like that to to again move from pluralism to actual you know practical implementations off right totally so um modularity well-documented interfaces can being involved in the social layer of the ecosystem that you're building and also you know recognizing that cooperation is a competitive advantage uh in web 3 i think this is something that people are coming in from web 2 need to grok is that we're competing to uh we're we're we're coordinating um a lot more in this ecosystem because of the modularity in the shared evm whereas in the old ecosystem it's all about building moats and and edging your competitors out so i think that shift in mindset is super important for those of us who are coming from web 2. yeah absolutely all right well if you and i are on exact opposite ends of the world in exact opposite time zones and we can do this then i think other people in the ecosystem could do this as well um so great to have you on green pill i'm so looking forward to the world that we're trying to create which is more public goods and more funding for the commons for everyone thank you for being on the uh podcast um where can people find you online where can people find your work uh on twitter at oran underscore macmillan is probably the easiest way to find me uh at gnosis guild is uh the the organization that i'm mostly focused on at the moment uh or at least like that's that's consuming most of my time and then uh at clr fund uh is is the quadratic funding protocol that we've been talking about a bunch here so yeah any and all of those uh feel free to reach out uh always happy to chat with folks and kevin thanks for having me on the show it's uh it's always fun thanks for being on i'll see you later [Music] you
