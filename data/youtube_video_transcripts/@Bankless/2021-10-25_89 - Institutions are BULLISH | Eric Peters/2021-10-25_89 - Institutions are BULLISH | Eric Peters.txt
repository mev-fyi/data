[Music] welcome to bank lists where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david fantastic episode this is with hedge fund manager eric peters really enjoyed this one got a ton of insights even more than i thought actually going in i knew this would be a great conversation it turned out even better than i thought what were some of your takes yeah eric is just a really pragmatic thinker which is rare in this space especially somebody who's in the hedge fund world that yet is it almost as bullish on crypto and and defy as we are uh picking eric's brain uh really showed me that there are pragmatic thinkers out there who think uh in in pretty real terms about how this uh crypto revolution is going to unfold uh eric and and us were totally aligned on us uh thinking that this is a crypto renaissance and he did that without listening to our crypto renaissance podcast and so we pow out on that for a while and overall had a deliberate discussion about how people that are not going to want to see change in the world how they're going to have to deal with this whole crypto thing and we talked about that from the perspective of governments and taxation of federal reserves and monetary policy of you know the the wealthy boomers who have everything to lose versus the younger generations who have nothing to lose yet everything to gain and how that sort of friction between these very polarized parts of the world how they're going to deal with this whole crypto revolution so overall a very um pragmatic and interesting discussion with eric peters here yeah it's super cool it's very cool to see eric come to many of the same conclusions separately that we've come to it's like about money you know the history of money about even this idea of crypto being a renaissance about the you know the core value proposition being decentralization about how the us adoption might work so he came to many of the same conclusions that i think we've come to on bankless only from a separate angle the other piece of this is this is um okay so uh eric's firm was uh in 2020 was like the first the largest institutional allocator to crypto okay now he talks about in the in in the first part of the the conversation about how difficult it was to buy the amount of crypto that they were buying it's like 500 million dollars or something like that 500 600 million so uh he talks about that and i just i i just can't get over how um big this is for crypto right like this is really the institutions are coming and they're not just coming for number go up like i feel like eric and his team really understand this asset class and why they're buying the space it was also funny because uh i made an embarrassing mistake at the very early phases of this by like uh anyway you'll have to listen to hear what that mistake is but it's another example of like the crypto world doesn't have a lot of ties into the financial institutional investing world and they don't have a lot of ties to crypto so this is a very i think bankless listeners who've heard us talk to all sorts of different crypto native companies and funds will get a lot of value from this specific conversation because eric comes at it from you know a traditional hedge fund manager how is a large uh allocator of capital that's done very well in the traditional world how do they think about crypto and what realizations are they coming to about this asset class so stay tuned for that we talk about quantum change we talk about young versus old and the generational stresses that might be a macro theme here we talk about the story of the us versus china how they are playing the crypto thing how this is going to turn out from a regulator's perspective um we asked eric if he's worried about regulation in the u.s you'll have to tune in to hear his answer to that and then finally we end with the case for digital assets this is just a fantastic conversation we think you guys are really going to enjoy

river digital asset management this is a traditional hedge fund that gets crypto really understands crypto they've been a massive buyer a voracious buyer of both bitcoin i believe ether too investing in change political economic technological change quantum change as eric calls it we're going to get into all of that today this is our opportunity to pick the brain of a hedge fit fund manager that's been crypto red pulled i think eric how are you doing today it's great to have you on bank list it's great to be here uh i yeah i have never been accused of being red pill but that's this is not usually the type of podcast i'm on so uh so this is awesome well you know what this is gonna be fun because we don't often talk to you what we would call you know eric is you know may i don't know how you think of yourself but it's kind of a traditional hedge fund manager right so like we talked to a lot of crypto hedge fund managers we talked to a lot of vc companies obviously people in institutional space but i think you have a really unique vantage point in that you've got kind of a bridge in the traditional hedge fund world and also in this crypto world so we want to learn as much as we can from you but like i guess my first question is so you guys are based in greenwich connecticut right and that's been called the hedge fund capital of the world there's a lot of big hedge funds out of greenwich connecticut uh what does everyone think about crypto in greenwich connecticut like do they all think we're crazy is you know is there a recognition that you know some of this is is actually happening crypto's a real thing or do they just think we're flat crazy um well number one i love it you call it greenwich just because it's just that it's greenwich so it just shows the total like the total disconnect oh my god like this is all about you know filling gaps right so your world and my world are colliding and uh and they're colliding in grenwich connecticut um so sorry to every all the greenwich listeners out there in bankless uh yeah it just shows my ignorance no i love it yeah they're all just a bunch of you know wall street guys that are in the city anyway um no uh it's excellent so look i there there are uh uh there are a growing number of people i think you you know you see them paul jones is on cnbc today i don't watch the nbc but everyone sends me his quotes all the time so uh you know he's he's been a big advocate of this space and uh you know and he's he's based here so um increasingly i think i look i think i think people who are who have built their careers around identifying emerging trends and good investment opportunities are on this thing and institutions are puzzled as to what what to do but increasingly or being drawn into it and so place like you know like where we are and and quite frankly our firm is kind of at the center of of of that transformation and i think it is a transformation i think it's incredibly exciting it's the most definitely the most interesting macro opportunity macro investment thesis i've seen in my career and uh and so a lot of it you know a lot of it will happen here right i mean a lot of the really exciting things in the technology side are not happening here but the connection to the legacy financial system let's call wall street with new technologies is is going to first happen in the pools of capital that are directed by a limited number of people as opposed to some kind of big investment committee and those you know those faster moving limited group of people investment teams are you know are sitting here in in places like greenwich not certainly not just greenwich but that that's kind of how the capital moves do you guys feel like you guys you're leading the the way in greenwich like with run one river capital is there anyone else that's doing what you mentioned paul tudor drones right i know he's got some exposure in the space but are you one of the first well uh i think i think that we are we are the first traditional alternatives manager which is otherwise called hedge fund but we're the the first firm that's that's built a business around that we're over eight years old so i built it i started this from in 2013. but we're the first uh alternatives firm that uh that is recognized the opportunity that digital assets need a dedicated fiduciary so there are a lot of there are a whole bunch of terrific broader financial services firms in uh in digital assets and and a lot of those names are you know are pretty well known um but when we entered the space so we we made our first big allocation uh last november and uh right after the election and as we did we we worked with one of our big clients to try to identify how to best access this space what became clear is that yeah you could go out and buy you could go directly and buy these assets but if you're a large investment firm that needs to work with a fiduciary there really weren't any dedicated fiduciary so there are firms that look like let's say diversified investment banks for for digital assets or crypto and they tend to have a a whole range of different services that they provide they may be doing prop trading they may be doing custody they may be doing merchant banking they may be market making they may have some asset management products but there's there's no one that is just just coming out and saying look we're focused purely on connecting our clients to the opportunity the investment opportunities we see in this space we have no conflicts of interest we're working purely on behalf of our clients and so that was the op that was the business opportunity that we saw and so when i when we made the decision to kind of enter this space we felt all of our clients should be allocated to these assets um i'm sure we'll cover that over the course's podcast but the reasons why but but there just was no one that they could really reasonably work with in order to get that exposure and so we decided to start building out those products that's how we entered this space well that's super cool a good timing too right november of 2020 and i believe that was at the time one of the maybe the largest ever institutional asset allocation to to crypto at the time yeah um i assume what did you guys buy at that time i don't know if you can go into all the details yeah no no i mean a lot of this is public we bought over 600 million dollars of bitcoin and eth wow just right after the election and yeah and and it was it was a five day it wasn't 24 7 because i i don't stay up that long but uh but pretty much uh yeah it was that was a lot of fun is it hard to buy that much like i've never tried personally david probably has but like how difficult is it to buy 600 million dollars of bitcoin and eat it was uh it it was well number one i didn't know how hard it would be either uh we needed you know we we really needed to be extremely discreet um we work with multiple counterparties right now but at the time we worked directly with uh with the folks at coinbase on their institutional desk okay and uh and they were terrific and uh quite frankly we kept all of it quiet until we were pushed to disclose it about a month later um but but yeah you know it was it really it was such an interesting period you know kind of it was such an interesting execution if you just look at the whole thing in totality and said look we have to get this position on we decided that it was important to get it on fast um because if there was any news that leaked out we thought the market would fly and quite you know when when news did break in december that we had made that allocation that was the day that bitcoin broke through the old highs and and so that didn't really surprise in the sense that there have been a whole bunch of years where people have been talking about how institutions are going to come institutions are going to come yes and we were the first institution that came right so we kind of knew that if word trickled out the thing would run away on us and i didn't want to be having to buy that much in a market that's running away so we yeah they're all kinds of you know games that we played with the market which was really fun to do i think it actually was ironically it was uh it was probably an advantage to not not be someone who has grown up trading these assets at size because i think a lot of people are super dependent on um algorithmic trading and lean on their algos we used a lot of different algos that that coinbase had actually um but we used them in kind of unique ways and um and that that helped us kind of mess around with the market so they that i think they were a little confused as what was going on and and that worked to our advantage so we got it on we actually got the whole position on without moving the market um in fact we they we ran an analysis afterwards we got in below you know kind of below average prices during that period which um yeah amazing it doesn't matter these these assets move so much you know a few percent here there doesn't really matter i don't think but uh but it you know whatever is great it was gratifying that we got it on quietly discreetly and we learned a lot through that process well and congrats on the timing it's really good timing of course we've seen big moves in both of those assets since now here we are at the time of recording we're uh just at over all-time highs for bitcoin and approaching all-time highs once again for eth so the timing could have been better i'm curious about the allocation at that time i don't know if that's public too but it's like how much uh eth versus bitcoin what was sort of the the uh the split there yeah we don't really go into that but it was it was uh it was weighted more heavily toward toward bitcoin interesting okay and now we've seen obviously uh you know quite the appreciation of these since then but i also wanted to ask like because you have a few other notable things i think at one river capital we're gonna spend a lot of time on kind of the thesis and your general thesis for the space why you're doing things in digital assets but before we do some other interesting tidbits i think is uh you've got a guy by the name of alan howard backing you as well uh i understand that's a very big name in the institutional investor space we uh and also uh jay clayton whom of course uh we recognized in the crypto world former sec commissioner um someone else is a former cia legal counsel so it's like a lot of the established institutions right of the world are actually coming into this fund which i think you know says something a former chair of the sec somebody's former been like deep in government the cia side legendary uh you know fund manager in the past what do you think they see in this space do they just fundamentally believe your thesis for this space is that why they're jumping aboard here um that's a great question and it hasn't been phrased that way to me just you know uh the question is kind of whether there's a common thread i would say that they're they're all interested for overlapping reasons but they probably uh are weighted differently so so alan uh alan and i have known each other for the last decade he actually invested he took a 25 stake in one of our asset management before we entered digital assets but he's since taken a bigger position in our the digital um subsidiary that we have and alan is one of the greatest investors uh hedge fund investors of of all time uh he you know he he has he's known for having kind of a unique ability to identify opportunities and really size up and manage risk extremely well and those are very difficult things to kind of have in one person i think and you you know you rarely rarely see that and so he you know he's done a tremendous job of jumping on all sorts of trends over the years uh and capitalizing on them he was the earliest traditional hedge fund person in digital uh he tends to remain pretty quiet about it but he was the first one and so he has he has interesting investments throughout the ecosystem um and has spent a lot of time on that and so i think he and i have wanted to be in business for a long time so i took a position in one river with the you know the the parent company initially and then was even more excited after we entered the space so i after we we entered the space he and i spoke about i didn't tell him what we were doing ahead of time of course um but uh but so i think he you know he sees the market opportunity and the business opportunity um you know jay jay someone i hadn't known jay until i i and i look i i generally don't want to spend much time with regulators they've well like just to be clear you know we've we've had a couple routine examinations and and you know we're uh we've come out squeaky clean and but that's kind of the extent to which i ever really wanted to spend time with regulators but i recognize after we enter this space that if we are going to uh if we are going to really uh be the best firm we can be for our clients and have a positive impact on the industry and i think there's a national interest element to this as well i felt that we were you know really under armed from a regulatory perspective just because having spent my whole career not really wanting to spend time with them entering a space that where that's such a big driver i felt like we really needed to have the right uh and certainly advisors and so i actually just picked up the wall street journal i saw an article that he'd left the sec the day before and i just cold called them and said i'd love to chat and uh uh um he said let's get to get you know let's let's get together uh i you know i think he uh and then and then we you know we had a number of of uh of lunches uh over the the next few months and and uh you know before he agreed to do this i think he just wanted to get whatever we both want to get to know one another and what was evident right out of the gate is that he and i the thing that we share more than anything is the belief that in order to uh in order to continue to have the leading financial services sector in the world the u.s has to get the regulatory foundation for this transition from legacy finance to digital finance has to get that right that's right so so you know they're there look there are a couple approaches to this i think some of the purest and and i i have a lot of respect for people that were in this space really early i've paid attention to it my whole career or my you know throughout the the life of you know bitcoin onward but i think that there's a there's an element of people who think that this is the system that is there to be able to build something brand new after the old system crashes and burns and at one level they're right it could but i don't think the old system is going to crash and burn i think what's that and certainly that's just not the approach we're taking th this is i think what we're building now and what you guys are you know what you guys are building and what your whole world is is seeing is an opportunity to rebuild a better financial system but i i think it's going to be built upon and will displace the legacy players and systems in ways that contribute to healthier society much more efficient financial system etc and that i believe that that has to happen by working with regulators which is not to say never pressing regulators it's just to say to to kind of coordinate cooperate so that's kind of how that all that all went down and and and then and so that's jay and uh and then courtney ellwood uh she said she was the general counsel for the cia and uh i think her you know her position she's not a um an investor like alan howard and she wasn't a regulator uh like jay she looks at this from the national security uh perspective and as do i by the way as a macro guy and one of the most interesting frictions is the one between the us and china right now and we'll probably talk about central bank digital currency but you know there there is a concerted effort to try to unseat the u.s dollar as the global reserve currency and i think that that would not be in the us's best interest nor our allies and they're all you know they're all sorts of other um kind of adjacent tensions between those countries but i think from courtney's perspective i i always hate putting words in people's mouths but i think she shares the view that getting all of this right is in the u.s national uh interest and uh and and so so we all share you know i mean she recognizes that that's probably also a good investment opportunity for people involved because that's obvious but that's not a driver for her eric i think we need to unpack what it means to get all of this right and in some of your writing that both ryan and i really truly enjoyed you called this decade one of the most uncertain decades of our lifetimes and so you are betting that we are going into this major transition not just for you know uh investing but just for how the world works this isn't some like new social media platform this isn't some disruptive fintech company this is uh this is what you are calling a quantum change uh which i think maybe uh if it were my words we would be calling this a paradigm shift this is a new paradigm and so can you just unpack and elaborate on what you mean by a quantum change and why you think it this change that is happening is uh of the magnitude that that you think it is sure um i'll we'll let's go with the the kind of abbreviated version because we could spend you know time where your listeners would would certainly fall asleep uh but i don't know we're pretty into quantum change but but yeah well look we'll try we'll try the short version if you want to if you want to dig in any deeper so let's let's take digital crypto let's take all of that let's take blockchain just out of the picture entirely for a moment so so i started my career in 89 and we have uh from apa from a global policy uh standpoint we have been pursuing a um a consistent policy through that entire period of time and that policy has been more or less driven by central bankers and and so we came you know when i started my career inflation was pretty high this wasn't 1970s high but still by today's standards well sorry by today's stamps we're back to those levels but like roll the clock back a year um by those standards and by the standards the last couple decades inflation was high bond yields were high et cetera and and starting with greenspan uh a policy was really introduced to a kind of every economic hiccup um the the federal reserve would lower interest rates in a material way kind of never ratchet them back up to the the starting levels as the cycle progressed and so and and kind of inflation came down interest rates came down the big the really big macro trends were increased globalization and deepening kind of technology technology deepening throughout our whole society and by the way you couldn't even you couldn't even have globalization at scale without that technology so all these things played played in to one another um and amplified the impacts and what that led to was it led to this this period of kind of large income inequality as i said lower inflation lower interest rates very high overall debt levels and leverage right because you could just hold more debt if interest rates were low inflation was very stable and it was it was kind of this these big macro forces were pressing us to a point where that monetary policy which was really monolithic uh had run out of it you know it it was no longer as effective as it had been from a much higher starting point of higher interest rates is this eric like the morphine drip kind of effect where like patient gets a shot of morphine and then another one and then another one but but it gradually is less and less effective until basically you know patient no longer feels the effect of morphine yeah it it it's yeah it's like that i mean it's it's a little bit more mathematical but it i mean it's not the wrong analogy and the only thing that i would say with that type of analogy is i think that there are a whole group of people that look at that kind of policy and just say it was just morally bankrupt or you know it's terrible and when you start talking about morphine you're i don't know it has certain connotations i think that what we witnessed was we saw a real leveraging of the of the us financial system and it was a policy that wasn't it wasn't a dumb policy it just but it had a natural end point by the way if you look historically through economic and market cycles going back hundreds and hundreds of years there are cycles right so and cycles play out because these dynamics happen because it you know naturally societies want to take on more debt because what does debt do it kind of pulls demand from the future to the present it all feels good like there are a lot of things that conspire to push society you know into these cycles and it wasn't all the fed's fault it's like a lot of things work together but the fed was the dominant driver of these policies and because the the dollar is the global reserve currency every other central bank in the world more or less certainly of the developed countries more or less had to follow the fed's policy because otherwise if they diverge from it their currency would get really strong and their exporters would go out of business and they would scream at the politicians and the politicians would pressure the central bank and so you ended up happening after 30 years of this this policy you ended up with central banks whose tool kit no longer really worked and you had the whole globe on the same system okay all these guys went to the same schools they all read the same books they all you know went and begged the nobel group for their you know their prize and economic they're all like they all thought this is being unfair but you know they they all more or less had the same paradigm and or the same kind of mental model in terms of how to think about monetary policy right and so all of that drew us into this um or drew us into this point where we had the longest economic cycle in the u.s and the longest bull market up until the pandemic hit and for the preceding two years every central banker in the world was crying out for politicians to start spending money because they said listen our tools they're never going to say they don't work because that would spark a panic they kept saying our tools don't work as well as we would like them to you have to start spending money but politicians couldn't really spend money because everyone was kind of stuck in this quasi-austerity mindset all right pandemic hit and that was the most remarkable catalyst imaginable to just get politicians to say throw out all those old rules everything that we've been preaching because we now have this global pandemic and we need to save the world and we need to do that with huge fiscal spending not i don't know what i would have done if i were in that spot but i probably wouldn't have been hiking rates and you know cutting budgets so it's they i think the the actions were rational right but what that did is that that shifted us from a world of this monolithic central bank policy so i i would call that policy homogeneity so the whole world was driven by a group of people making decisions that had the same mental model more or less and it shifted us in this world where the central bankers don't control what governments spend politicians decide that and so if you look at it if you if we grabbed a group of 50 um politicians from across the world and 50 central bankers other than their accents the central bankers would be almost indistinguishable probably the same age they went to the same schools or you know the equivalent in their countries etc you took the 50 politicians or 100 be wildly different okay even in the u.s like donald trump's fiscal policy is different from joe biden's okay if it hadn't been if it had been bernie sanders instead of joe biden it would also be different the point is that that policy becomes very very heterogeneous when you shift away from a group of central bankers to control everything to a group of politicians across the world interacting with their own political systems interacting with their central banks so that that change alone would be the biggest uh we'll we'll use yours dave paradigm shift instead of that would be the biggest paradigm shift that we have seen since certainly since the late 70s into into volcker in the in the 1980s okay okay can you break down why so so i get so there's no contrarians among central bankers they're all doing the exact same thing right politicians they have all of these contrarian ideas but why is this move from sort of monetary policy money printing let's call it to fiscal policy money printing why is this such a quantum change and such a departure from what we've seen over the past 30 years isn't it both still kind of you know money printing uh dollar supply go up it's a really good question and and here is the simple answer to that is that maybe a multi-part answer the simple answer is that the the paradigm that we were in was one where there was a lot of money printing but the velocity there was a lot of money printing there was a lot of debt accumulation but the velocity of that money that was being created as more money was being created the velocity was declining and so what happened was you ended up with a lot of liquidity in the system that wasn't actually moving through the system very fast where it was f where it was finding a home was in asset prices and so so that policy wasn't really lifting real economic growth so you saw in spite of all that qe you saw inflation become very low and stable economic growth became became very modest and relatively stable and asset prices were the things financial asset prices were the things that were going up what happens when you you say actually we're going to start spending money is that that shifts the whole equation because you go and instead of just a bunch of you know a bunch of 65 year old center bankers saying we're just going to print more money and buy more bonds and then a bunch of 65 year old baby boomers go well you just paid more for my bonds than i thought they were worth and now that i don't own those bonds anymore i'm going to go buy some stocks all that's happening with a bunch of 65 year old people right all of a sudden you go no here's what we're going to do now we're going to we're going to keep doing all that bond buying all that money printing but we're going to have the the largest economy in the world the us economy borrow 15 of gdp for two years running and we're gonna start spending that money we're going to give it to people we're we're not just giving it to the 65 year old people who have an equity portfolio they represent the top one percent of wealth in the country we're giving it to everyone okay and so that that we haven't even begun to see the consequences of that well sorry we've just only now started to see the consequences of how dramatic a shift that is that's something that was just inconceivable um even a couple years ago i mean just completely inconceivable that we would do something like that by the way we had we had expected a move toward this fiscal monetary coordination if you'd asked me and we were positioned for it which is great for our investors if you'd asked me what are the probability pre-pandemic of seeing two years of 15 budget deficits out of the u.s fully funded by the fed i would i would have said in the in the absence of a of a world war by a one percent probability oh wow that's what's happening yeah and that's what okay okay okay so um let's talk about this this i guess paradigm shift because like i like the point that you made earlier i mean we can get out of the habit sometimes crypto and other people have the habit of kind of moralizing these things right maybe the morphine drip has some moralizing connotation like yeah don't keep giving the patient morphine that sort of thing but i think your broader point as an investor is just like hey this is just cycles this is the flywheel if you were a individual in that system what decisions would you have made probably the same decisions and now we have this massive wealth inequality and you know in the u.s people are like hey you know the one percent got their cut of this thing through asset play price increase over the past 10 years where's my cut right where's universal basic income for instance where's the distribution how can we get uh minimum wage to increase and so a portion of that is now going to to labor so and you understand why the cycle plays this way right like if you're individual in the wheel you probably make some of these same decisions but let's talk with as as investors so what are the implications of this is this basically is what you're saying maybe we don't know all the implications but is one of the things that you're saying that we're about to see massive cpi consumer price index type inflation over the next 10 years or what are the sorts of shifts that we should expect given this monetary to fiscal policy uh regime change so the first thing i would say is that if it were only that regime change or that paradigm shift that that were affecting us it would it would be the biggest one that we've seen uh certainly in my career spending over 30 years but it's not because everything i just said is happening with the backdrop of blockchain technology on the cusp of rewiring the global financial system and spinning out of that project are a variety of assets cryptocurrencies that uh you know or various tokens that i think represent fundamental change in in probably how the whole world operates that will take decades to manifest but in the here and now it's affecting financial markets and investment opportunities etc so so the first thing i would say is that that you you have these these enormous potentials for change that are kind of colliding in a super interesting way um and and so the outcome of that is it's highly uncertain which because because it's not going to happen in a totally free market it's not you know you're seeing like just look at what china's done right i mean you're going to have you basically have this this paradigm shift from monetary fiscal policy that's going to change the way that the economy operates it's going to change inflation it will lead to higher inflation and much higher inflation volatility so we've come off of a couple decades where inflation volatility has been extremely low and stable that will start moving around a lot that doesn't mean inflation just goes straight up okay could but i i think it's more likely that we see a lot more inflation volatility but it's going to lead to some really wild moves in markets we're starting to see that already it'll it'll lead to things that we haven't that will be very confusing to people in markets an example of that will be that that that i think is is really interesting is that gold hasn't participated in this whole move in inflation and and yet look at what digital assets have done they've gone you know they've gone bananas right so so a lot of things will will change in markets but i think to to for me as a macro investor to to wrap my arms around something that i know i can't fully understand and anyone who ever claims to is is either megalomaniac or just lying but what you can try to do is i think understand what are the biggest most important things that are happening and then kind of understand how they interact and then stay mentally flexible around well what are some of the things that those could mean and then then you're supposed to kind of look at markets and say well what are markets telling you some of this stuff means and that you know and then i ideally invest alongside those trends as they emerge you know super interesting to me it's like some of the stuff you set up you know reflects other macro thinkers like ray dalio comes to mind for instance and so interesting when i read ray dalio he's like he gets um the diagnosis right but then the cure he says he's like go buy this you know shiny metal object and it's more complicated than that but like he's a big advocate of gold and not yet digital assets which is somewhat interesting right in this kind of scenario and so it appears to me you're not just betting on this monetary regime change that's not the only quantum change that you see you see that but then you also see this whole advancing technology and i think in your quantum change letter you call this like almost betting on decentralization and decentralized power you make the point that some will try to subvert this like in co-op this maybe china but you make the other point that for others that kind of embrace and open their arms to this maybe the west is an example of that that story is yet to be written we'll see i hope so but for others you said such a path holds the potential to produce another renaissance another renaissance is what you see so talk about that in a little more detail so what is it about this decentralized technology that comes into play in in um in blockchain and crypto that could bring about this second renaissance and you know how does an investor position themselves to capitalize on that yeah um that sounds like a like a big bold statement i but i i entirely i don't think it's an exaggeration at all i think that the the power of these technologies hold the potential to lead to dystopia or renaissance and i think when you look at what china is doing i think what look they're the first ones to develop the the cbdc um really i mean there are a couple other countries that took it a bit more seriously early on like switzerland and canada and um but you know the u.s has been late right but the well if you ask yourself why did china do that it's because they looked at that technologies that oh my god this is seriously powerful stuff right and so if we could take this and we could we could impose this on our popul on our subjects which is i think how they they think about it uh then we get to see every single transaction throughout the economy i it i mean it it extends the arm of their control over their population in ways that are that would have been unimaginable even a decade ago and so they saw it and so you kind of get you know they've showed their hand in terms of how they've chosen to implement it and i'm not saying just because a central bank issues a central bank digital currency that that they're they're doing it because they want to dominate their citizenry there are other reasons for their other efficiency reasons for doing it it's just my the point that i'm making with china is that i think that the reason that the the dominant reason that they're doing it is because it gives them unparalleled uh insight and control over their citizenry and i think to the extent that they can export that i think they'll fail at this by the way but to the extent that they can export that globally i think they think it gives them the ability to maybe unseat the us dollar as the the global reserve currency so that's kind of the the the kind of the dark path of these technologies is that in a world that becomes increasingly digitalized in our lives that become increasingly digitalized that these technologies give the state a lot more power potentially the the path toward renaissance is i think consistent with uh with the development of bitcoin and and that technology which is that look there's a way there's a way using the technologies that we now have and the the system the cloud that connects 7.9 billion people on the planet um if you take firewalls and everything out there's a system that allows people for the first time in human history to connect with one another trust one another even if they don't like one another they speak different language they're there there's a way to to have trust between people that is completely decentralized and if you think i think that that is the most important thing to think about when you consider an investment thesis for the long haul forget about trading opportunities we have i think it's hard to understate how important that is because if you if you just go for a go for a half an hour walk or an hour walk and think about everything that's touched your life whether it's a company that you've shopped at or worked at or a church or a synagogue or any kind of religion that you've been part of or the government system that controls your town your country the you know international networks of the un or imf there literally is i would challenge you to think of anything that isn't material in your life that has that you know even your family structure like there's nothing that isn't centralized in some way in terms of kind of control and power and it it's like the sky is blue and that's just the way the world works right but what just happened is for the first time in human history at scale something just popped up that said actually it doesn't have to work that way really just doesn't have to work that way now it it's natural that that realization is going to take decades to manifest fully but and you guys talk to a lot more of these people than i do and you guys probably are these people but you probably look at well i know you are because i i i listen to your piece on um on uh uh eath and the metaverse like we are we are moving to a world which is which is will become more or less fully digitalized and i don't know like what's the what's the place for the traditional nation state in that world the qu the answer is i have no idea all i'm saying is that these technologies for the first time in a real way open up the possibility that we can ask that question and deliver a solution okay so that's like big big picture where we are in 50 years i think we'll look back at this and we'll say we'll say that this was as important as the invention of a computer um maybe more in terms of how society is structured and operates but in the more immediate term it it that kind of recognition that this is that important and and its implementation in society and kind of how does like i'm i'm more focused on how it takes over wall street and the financial system and i want to play a part in that and we're building out a firm to take a very pos to have a very positive impact on leading to much more efficient financial system inclusive opportunities for people all those good things right but they're what these technologies do is they connect people and they take they slash the middlemen out so when you talk about or when i talk about a renaissance it it's like what did the renaissance do okay and and someone who's around who teaches the phd program at harvard would probably argue with me about this and that's fine but the renaissance you know the we just had the dark ages and you you built up this kind of culture where where wealthy patrons would give promising artists money to kind of do whatever the hell they wanted to do and some of them wrote books and some of them painted beautiful pictures etc and some of them thought about all kinds of new scientific innovations and that was incredible because you just started funding people right we now have systems that have taken out the art dealer they've taken out the the music company they've they've connected literally 7.9 billion people around the planet have the potential no matter what country they're in to do something and connect to capital and get funded to do something that they're most passionate about and their aptitude is highest to do without having to get a work permit and do this and do that i don't know what that leads to but i'll tell you if it doesn't get regulated away i i think you would be short kind of human innovation short the almost the human condition you would be sh you would be sure to bet against that i think is it's a terrible bet to make um but i don't know exactly what that will lead to i think we're seeing glimpses of it in the nft market but that's like literally just scratching the surface oh my god like we couldn't agree more with that obviously it's like do you want to be on the other side you want to short the renaissance do you want to short human ingenuity like bad move especially when we're moving to the digital area by the way um have you listened to our podcast this is with a phd professor uh josh rosenthal it's called uh the crypto renaissance um one of our favorite podcasts eric we're gonna send it to you it's like editor's choice let's move on i think david's got another question yeah so i mean as ryan said we are completely in line with this whole renaissance future that that we think crypto brings uh and they're in this future that we think inevitably comes and we encourage all bankless listeners to undergo this revolution and have this revolution happen to you but there's a lot there's a lot of people in this world where they're not going to undergo this revolution and in fact change really really scares them and on theme with i think uh a lot of other things that we've seen in 2020 and 2021 the world just seems to be overall extremely polarized the difference between the one percent and the 99 is huge the difference between the left and the right is huge the difference between cbdc's and true cryptocurrencies is massive the difference between generations is also massive so there's a lot of people out there that this whole renaissance thing which we think is extremely optimistic and bullish on humanity actually causes a lot of the incumbencies of the world to miss out on on this future so eric can you talk about the obstacles that you see ahead of us for all these people of the world that really are not incentivized to see this renaissance occur yeah the for starters i encourage uh i encourage everyone at our firm and i encourage our clients and i encourage you guys and you probably do look at it this way but i encourage you to think about the the resistance as the opportunity right so if so we just did a financing round recently and uh and the investors and it included coinbase goldman sachs liberty mutual insurance so kind of like we do with all of our business we're looking to bring the smartest best people and thoughtful firms together to help help us hopefully lead this institutionalization of of these assets and and so it's natural that we're going to get some of the the kind of ones who have put a lot of work into this space but they may not be ready to fully embrace it because of regulations or whatever they you know they they may prefer to do it uh with a thoughtful partner that they trust um but if they could all do it right now or they're all comfortable doing it right now the three of us i mean i love you guys but you probably wouldn't want to talk to me because i wouldn't be involved i would have no no business position in this space right because the big incumbents would have would have capitalized on that opportunity coinbase wouldn't exist if the legacy financial institutions were willing to take the risk that that those guys took and wasn't even that long ago and look at the value that that they've created i you know their market caps are 65 billion dollars right now right and um and i think it's going to go much my you know my guess is my guess is they're just beginning uh because and they have such a head start over the legacy group so i wouldn't get hung up with how are the legacy firms going to you know why aren't they joining or why aren't it's not joining why aren't they embracing opportunities in this space in some cases they can't because the regulatory environment doesn't really allow them to in other cases maybe they could but the risk reward just isn't high enough relative to what their perceived opportunity is and i think they just misjudged that but it doesn't matter because we actually we really are a better country and a better economy to just have creative destruction define the future because it's inevitable that the legacy players that have structured their tax policy they've structured by their lobbyists you know certain regulatory moats around their businesses and protections it's natural that they don't really want having invested so much in that there are very few people who are willing to just kind of tear down what they've built to because there's a new opportunity so this whole process just a very natural process i think it's i think it's phenomenal it's exciting uh but i you know i wouldn't like there's no lost sleep over why aren't these guys uh getting involved i think what happens is the the companies not getting involved will lead to much more innovative people look i'm 55 years old i you guys are i don't know you're a lot younger than i am and you you guys are probably you're probably talking to people who are younger than you are and there's something so powerful for society to have really young people who aren't as jaded as guys like me and have you know great fresh ideas be the ones to deploy capital and they're going to waste a lot of it and that's fine there's there's an abundance of capital in the world right now and there are not enough good ideas and not enough people who can execute and so all these changes are going to happen and then then the other thing is that they're all these older investors who are scared of these assets and that's why that's probably why gold is not going anywhere because all the old people own it and the young people are going why would you ever want to own gold why why if we're moving to a digital world why wouldn't you you know why wouldn't you own a native digital asset that like it just doesn't make any sense why you would own gold and and so there'll be a lot of confusing things that happen in this world and you know that that's what's unfolding now that i see you you know one one of these uh dividing areas that you you you mentioned in one of your recent i think weekly letters is um the young versus the old the generational stresses in fact you call this one of the you know uh the many lines that divide or fractured fractured world we call this the darkest is the separation of young versus old i wonder if you could talk about that from a macro perspective because i know you look at the macro and these kind of generational changes um do you feel like the current system that we have favors let's say the older generations let's say baby boomers at the expense of the young and what does that mean and is crypto kind of a a result of some of that like pushback and some restoration of the balance can you talk about that yeah so there are a lot of lines that divide society there's there's rich poor big ones are rich versus poor young versus old educated versus non-educated and they're intersections of some of those lines too um but if you think about what what uh yeah and you guys have done a lot of work on what is a nation state what does it even mean and but if you think about if you think about at the macro level like what are different economic philosophies try to do and what they they try to whether that's free market capitalism whether it's socialism whether it's communism and there'll be others like china is attempting something it's kind of a hybrid i think but if you look at what what do they try to do they try to create the greatest pos in in its p in their pure sense they try to create the greatest possible prosperity society-wide and then they try to figure out how to distribute the spoils of that economic output in a way that is sufficiently fair to create the incentive structures to kind of prevent an upheaval and create the incentive structures that that propel the system forward and and so that's if that's in their purest sense what they're trying to do and they they each have different answers for that right and there were plenty of people that thought communism would do a better job than free market capitalism and and i think that they were kind of wrong um but we we probably and we probably have become overly confident about the ability of free market capitalism just be the winning solution there's probably some balance like anything anyhow um if you if you think about what societies are supposed to do they're trying to find those optimal points but but then when you go into practice they're obviously are all then we have a lot of humans who you know some of whom are greedy and some of whom are scared and some of whom are you know have different drivers that motivate them and and so you end up with with flawed versions of those systems and oftentimes they they trend towards a lot of uh um corruption right without good check and balance and so i think in in the case of the us um we quite clearly have a system where there there's a lot of inequality between rich and poor and it's not that any individual has necessarily been corrupt but when you have a lot of wealthy people that are protecting their interests and they think that they're protecting their industry and they you know have their lobbyists they do all these things in in aggregate it just unless you kind of rebalance that system money tends to just go to the the winners and and unless you rebalance it and then i think what happened with the old versus young in this is you know we had the greatest and by the way i it's unfair my parents are baby boomers it's like i feel bad i love baby boomers i know i hear you guys i hear you like the individual let's just say we love individual baby boomers or parents or baby boomers group there's a group as a group yeah so look that you know their parents fought the war they're the greatest generation i think they came back and they had a certain set of values and then and they they did whatever they did and then their kids grew up and kind of embraced more uh you know they they learned how to protest through the vietnam war they you know they like had a very different life experience and but they really learned when they were young they really learned how to advocate for things they didn't by the way they weren't really a revolutionary youth they didn't have the technology and the incumbents looked at them as a joke i think they looked them like okay great these guys are out at concerts they're smoking weed they're protesting the war but like they're not overthrowing anything okay they're just making a lot of noise and we got to deal with it okay so fast forward a few decades they got tired of protesting that very stuff and but they were really good at organizing and protesting and they started advocating for themselves which is why if you if you look at a macro level at kind of how much society spends on old people now well relative to children and education etc and you kind of went back 30 40 years it's totally distorted even if adjusting for different sizes of population so the old the baby boomers advocated brilliantly for themselves and their you know more or less relative largesse in retirement relative to the young people and so so now we have this rich poor divide we've got the the young old divide and what's so this is just another one of these paradigm shifts what we have now actually ironically is we have the youth that is revolutionary and it's through blockchain technology so unlike unlike go go read a time magazine article from 1970s or you know 60s or early 80s or something about about these people like they had no they had no real power okay now look at people look at some of the multi-billionaire guys who are in their 20s and 30s right now who are saying actually yeah the you know the protocol that i'm building could take down the entire financial system they actually have the technology they've got compute power which is going parabolic they've got the entire infrastructure they have the program ability and a capital light business to do this and they have the intent and they have the capital and they have like all the young people are rightly saying you know what because the older people have kind of screwed us because they own all the assets we own nothing i can't even believe we have the opportunity to go invest in this whole thing that's gonna topple that whole you know kind of uh quasi-corrupt um edifice that that was built to not favor our interests but favor all these old people like we're just not doing it and so what's absolutely incredible to me is when you think about you think about how systems it's almost like i've always looked at the world as as a super organism in a way and so we have this this huge imbalance created between rich and poor old and young etc and now all of a sudden this new technology it almost like just magically appears that can provide the lever to rebalance that system and so i think that is i really think that that is what is being played out here now china is obviously terrified of that but i think what's so encouraging and incredible about the us and we've just seen it recently which to me is why these asset prices are going crazy now is the u.s just said you know what you know gensler working with uh because of course gensler has um has uh you know he didn't do what he did with this bitcoin etf just in isolation he's talking to yellen and they've you know there's a whole government approach and they're like okay you know what we're not going to take the china approach we're not going to stifle innovation we're going to let the market decide and i think the market is going to decide and it's going to be this is rebel like now we have actual revolutionary conditions i don't mean in a way that disrupts society and destroys it i mean like very positive disruption this is the renaissance theme again but you know that that's how i see it playing out eric a quote that i recently heard you say uh on a different podcast is that um the fed is making the bet that they can unburden the economy without losing people's faith in the currency and this with regard to like uh money printing quantitative easing uh we can print money because uh we need we need to and also they've made this bet in the past and it's actually worked out it's worked out for a number of decades that they make the bet where they can print money and people won't lose faith in the currency yet now what's different about this these choices being made now is we have crypto we have an alternative a place to exit and a way to express our loss of faith in the system and as we have this generational divide where the federal reserves and monetary policy kind of just almost exclusively favors the older generations we have this younger generational strife and frustration about a lack of inclusion and a lack of like viable investment opportunities in the legacy system and then just like you said almost at the perfect point in history crypto shows up as this vehicle that's outside of the system that the older generations don't understand that is literally a system built on the fact that you don't have to trust it you don't need to deposit faith because it's a a trustless based system and it's something that is is digitally native right for this um this younger generation to be able to comprehend way quicker than their parents so my question to you is does the mere existence of this opportunity make uh the bet that the federal reserve is making that people won't lose faith in the currency simply a bad bet uh that the the short answer is um there's always a risk that people lose faith and fiat and that has been a risk that's existed throughout the history of of of mankind uh and even even gold-backed currencies you know that just it's like why why do people there's always a risk that people abandoned faith and gold right there's no necessary reason that people had faith in gold but that's all the way down yeah like that didn't happen right but that more or less didn't happen i think it might be it might happen by the way um that people abandon faith and gold and kind of you're kind of seeing a bit of that right now doesn't mean it goes to zero it just means that it might be really uninteresting for a long period of time even in a world of expanding amounts of fiat um but uh look there's there's that risk to the dollar you know i earlier in my career i um i don't know early in my career i was probably more apt to just look at the dollar as something that people could just lose faith in and abandon and then the but kind of the more you learn about how the world operates and how how the world looks and how you know how systems work and what the alternatives are there really aren't very good alternatives now the the the kind of bitcoin maximalist would say no dude you don't get it because what happens is everyone just gets out of the dollar and and everyone gets into bitcoin and bitcoin goes to you know 10 million dollars bitcoin or or 100 like whatever whatever the number is like come up with a number right um because in that case it's not really about bitcoin it's about how many dollars have you created um and and so and if you create enough dollars then bitcoin could go to any number of dollars but dollars aren't worth as much all of those things could happen but i think what i think what's happening that is this is the 55 year old to me as opposed to 25 year old what's happening is that the government the government wisely looked at the situation and said okay we can't ever let that happen and so what do you do if you if you decide that you can't let that happen what do you do you go okay um we get to tax bitcoin and once once the government goes all right if this thing this thing is either gonna be here to stay or we're gonna shut it down okay if you decide to shut it down there are huge risks because you actually can't shut it down all you can do is make it illegal all right if you make it illegal it might be the case that that was a really bad decision for your entire economy because let's say that that technology represented some new innovation and the u.s shut it down but europe didn't shut it down or u.s made it illegal rather europe didn't and then all the european financial companies went on to just do all of these great innovative things and the us was left behind and then the u.s has to turn around three years later and go that was a really dumbest decision governments hate making dumb or hate having to admit they made dumb decisions so you don't want to do that okay what you want to do is you want to say okay let's just imagine that it's here to stay all right how do we wrest control from it in a way where we don't lose control of senior age and the dollar because that would be very bad thing for the us and so the answer actually is really simple and we're seeing it play out in real time the first thing you do is you say we want to understand who owns what and once you understand who owns what then you go okay now that we know what you have we actually know what your capital gain is on that asset that you own and we can choose to tax it at whatever we want no one who invests in crypto right now would want to hear this but i'll just make the i'll just make not because of any insight but if the government at some point in the future said you know we're going to tax digital assets at 80 capital gains they can do that because governments can do whatever they want to do okay so the 25 year old in me would have said yeah but the government you know then then everyone will start breaking the law and people won't tell the government what they have i don't think that will happen the government has done a very smart thing in in that they've pursued a regulatory path that before long will allow them to know where certainly we're every american but probably more or less everyone in the world they'll probably more or less figure out who owns what and then if they do debase the dollar and the dollar does collapse well guess what politicians have this huge pool of capital gain that they can tax and so that that's where we are i think that that's that's a healthy balance so so where that leaves us it leaves us with a with a digital asset ecosystem that provides a sanity check on government policy which i think is super healthy for a dynamic political system in other words if the government becomes reckless in terms of its monetary and fiscal policy you're going to see it with digital asset prices appreciating significantly and people go wait a second what are you doing with my money and that will help create i think more sensible policy but if at the end of the day the government really messes up and the dollar were to follow a long way and digital assets went crazy they're just going to claw back a bunch of that through through taxation this is an incredibly reasonable take and i'm glad you articulated it to articulated it this way because i don't think i've i've heard it explained this way but it's like i think what you're saying eric is like the horse has already left the barn right you know there's all these thoughts in the early days that the government will never lose its seniors so it'll never let bitcoin be a thing it'll shut it down well it hasn't horse has already left the barn it's not even going to pursue that policy at least the us government has now that china has gone and pursued it by the way makes the u.s even less likely probably to pursue that policy because they get all the miners in the u.s they get competitive advantage but they still have the i guess lever of taxation so they can always still tax their citizens and you know you get a capital gain on crypto you know 10x cool the government gets a piece of that so thank you very much right um that's what you're saying and so there's really no big threat from your perspective of you know regulators or the big bad us government coming and squashing the entire industry you think that threat is uh is overplayed uh they're not going to do that is that the case yeah well i think that i think what just happened is that they decided to not do that for bitcoin and and i think that extends to eth i think for the regulatory uh wrestling match is going to be years in the making and every incumbent industry that's threatened by these technologies trust me is gonna be rolling out their their uh you know lobbyists to try to make sure that their business isn't you know isn't completely destroyed by these technologies so it's not that they're the the regulatory issues are not fully settled but what i think what we just saw the government do and remember this is a biden this is a biden sec chair it's not you like no one it's not like biden can throw gensler under the bus and say he he was a rogue agent this was a this was a i don't have i don't have ins i don't have specific insight information i'm just looking at this as a as a macro investor who pays attention given the level of scrutiny around a bitcoin etf the fact that they just approved one tells you that the government in a holistic way just said we might not love the we might not love bitcoin we might might not like it we might even hate it but we are not at the point where we think the u.s government and our financial system and our political system should be in the business of regulating interesting new technologies out of existence we are not in that business and we're gonna let the market figure it out and that doesn't mean we're never gonna hear from them again it just means that it means that that's what they said and that's a really really big thing so i think people underestimate how important that is i think it's just it's seismic um now by the way i expected that as the end game so i'm not sitting here going oh my god i thought that was going to happen and now it's not but it's one thing to have a strong view and an informed view that this is what would happen and it's another thing for that event to play out that event has just played out i think that's super interesting so the implications of that are basically the government is saying you're saying this is much more coordinated than what we see if like you know the sec saying okay bitcoin etf you're saying look the entire administration everybody in the government power were kind of in on it right it's treasury talking to sec talking to fincen and they're all saying okay you can have your bitcoin people here it is and so now maybe they'll have a different perspective on like privacy chains right so like cryptocurrency absolutely because taxation is a concern or maybe they'll have a different perspective on something like usdc or a tether or stablecoin right because you know that gets into some other areas but when we're talking about these the biggest crypto assets the ones that matter the ones that are the base layer for everything else the bitcoins and ethers of the world right that's gone that horse has left the barn now maybe they'll invest in like blockchain analytics companies right in fact there's all these contracts with the irs and blockchain analytics so they can trace and see you know how much assets their citizens actually hold but that's on the kind of the taxation path um yeah that i i think all of that is a really interesting take eric and and feels like an informed observer because so often in crypto um we get regulatory fund probably every two weeks okay and there's like headlines in our crypto media saying so and so evil you know government official is going to like kill crypto and like when you zoom out and you take this position on it like this is just temporary noise and flood and we don't really don't have to worry about that in the short run i want to ask you another question before just to tie off this thread on kind of like the the generational divide and young versus old because you made this point in your weekly that i've really loved is and you talked about this and i think this will speak to a lot of our listeners the advantage of being young and broke okay i might say young dumb and broke okay because that's you know it's popular song i guess um but like what are the advantages of being young dumb and broke do you think right versus um the establishment cast because like i mean young people maybe they don't know a lot about finance they don't have these preconceived uh notions they also like don't have a lot of power and they don't have a lot of money and you actually couch these things as an advantage why is that an advantage in your mind for starters i don't i don't think i don't think it's ever going to be done um but i think if you use if you use dumb if you use dumb as a um no preconceived notions yeah the world works yeah yeah because i you know the the best early trade in my career actually was uh was when i was in london as a prop trader working with uh hold was i that would have been knife i would have been 28. um so i i i was i was young i was dumb and i was dumb on a lot of dimensions actually but i uh and i wasn't entirely broke but i mean more or less uh but i was i was uh i had the advantage when i was trading against um a lot of older guys uh when it came to this thing called the erm which is the exchange rate mechanism which was it was a mechanism that that was an agreement between european countries to keep their currencies toggled to one another through this exchange rate mechanism in very narrow ranges and i saw all kinds of imbalances that were being built up and i mean i honestly i didn't really know what i was talking about but i was an econ major and i did read and i remember i went up to to our chief economist i had lunch with him and he served all this sushi and i was like wow that's how these guys this is how they roll um and and i walked him through it'll the ins the unsustainability of italy's finances and i said i'm just looking at this and like to me these guys are going to go broke in six months and i'm if he used to work at the imf i'm expecting him to say oh that's not that's not possible he's like actually it's a fair point and so i ran down on the desk and i just started i started putting all these trades on and the old guys none of them could conceive that this rate mechanism could ever break because you had central banks on both sides of it and it was very it was one of the it was like one of these systems that just converged everything into these tight ranges and as it did it created all the all the older guys who just saw the invincibility of it would make bigger and bigger bets for narrower narrower spreads and or small and smaller profits effectively and it created a highly explosive situation if the underlying economies fell out of balance right and so i was just dumb enough to to actually be able to to see that that was a real possibility and so and i was young and i had i really had nothing to lose um and so you know i had my job to lose and at the time i i just i don't want to say i didn't care i just but i i i cared less about say when i walk into work every day right now i care about all of my clients i'm their fiduciary i care about everyone who works here i care about my fam like there's so many other considerations i'm thinking about what's in the best interest of the us when i was 20 years old trust me i didn't think about anything so so now the thing is a healthy society needs a lot of guys like me right now at 55 but it also if you're going to have a vibrant economic system particularly when technology is enabling the potential for so much innovation and what does innovation mean innovation leads to higher productivity work which everyone society should want to be able in in a sense to work jobs that are less strenuous and maybe for less amount of time and yet have all the creature comforts and food and every shelter that they want so all these things are amazing for society but you kind of need to have you know the 28 year old young dumb and broke guy who just walks in and says well this is stupid i can't believe you guys don't see that it's so stupid let me actually do something about it right and i'm not i'm not going to say that like i wasn't the only one who participated in breaking that system it wasn't even that i broke it it was a system that was on its last legs and so george soros um you know became very famous for for making a billion dollars when that system broke in a day and he wasn't 28 years old he was older but like it takes an ecosystem of of people who you know who have who can afford to make mistakes and not have it destroy the rest of their lives like to me when i think about mistakes that i could make at our firm right now and trust me we're willing to take a lot of risk right we've talked about some of the risks that we've taken it's not that we're not risk takers it's just that it's just a little bit more measured and thoughtful about how we approach things right but you need to have that whole kind of you need to have that whole ecosystem if you're going to have a really vibrant economy and so i think that if i made huge mistakes running this firm right now would would society give me the chance to start another firm like this it probably wouldn't realistically right when i'm 28 i didn't even think about that so you need you know you need those those characteristics now the last thing i will say about that is that in relation to the piece that i wrote what makes that interesting for markets right now is because you have real one of the big tensions in society is that you have the baby boomers that we've already talked about how they in many respects have have rigged the system or you know nudged the system to favor their interest by the way they're the ones that own all the assets and even amongst baby boomers they're still wealth inequality right but they're the ones that own all the assets and the younger people don't nothing and and this isn't just a normal state of affairs this is historically we're talking about huge dispersion between these groups relative to what a healthy society or or relative to long-term averages in this country so what what happens is the old people what they want they just want to stay rich and so they are tending to not want to take risks with that money and so they're owning bonds but the young people are saying you know what we are done with you guys we do want universal basic income you guys screwed up the planet we want green energy we want to remake everything and i know it i know that it's biden leading that and he's a million years old but it's the young people in his party that are kind of pushing those policies so the youth is fighting against the old people so the old people own all these bonds and now inflation is going up and they're they're becoming less wealthy this is a disaster so if you're old you're going i want to own bonds because it's going to pay me my coupon and i can stay wealthy what you what you're terrified of is when someone goes actually no if you own bonds you're going to start becoming less wealthy year by year because inflation's going to eat away so you're going to have to go take risk okay you got to take risks so what does that mean if you take risk it means that you might buy something and it might fall 50 in value so you don't want to do that and that's that is this dynamic that's happening in markets right now that is it's going to create a lot of opportunity by the way but when you look at what's happening in the digital asset markets the young people are saying i'm not even playing your game if if you bought all that gold after 0.8 old guy because you were worried about inflation because you were expecting me to work my my butt out off for the next 10 or 15 years so that i would pay an even higher price for your gold guess what i'm not doing it i'm buying bitcoin so you can own your gold and you can figure out who you're going to sell it to you want to sell to some people in india getting married good luck or some chinese like good luck but i'm not buying that and so that we're seeing some of those tensions in in markets right now and and how those i mean it really is this is a terrible terrible market environment for older people for that reason and the young people like look even if i buy a bunch of crypto and or i i invest in this project or i build this company and it fails 28 who cares you know what i mean like they're literally not even thinking about it it's beautiful it's beautiful eric i feel like you're nailing it completely right so you made this uh you know statement in in your post there as elderly gold owners ride in portfolio pain confused why the price of yellow metal is falling with inflation rising our young people look to the digital future buying bitcoin ether solana nfts that's exactly what's happening and just to put some color on that because i didn't actually know this you were talking about like how much pain the older demographic is with with bonds basically when they're you know not in full risk assets when they're not in stock so us inflation over the past year was 5.4 percent you said so older people who own the risk-free 10-year treasury notes to secure their retirement they lost 11.1 11.2 percent here actually they're losing money right by not investing in crypto essentially or at least having a portfolio with these risk on assets like stocks that is some of the generational pain that we're talking about here and i guess the opportunity from being young dumb and broke the the other thing i'll say is like there's fractals of this also eric that play out even in crypto and one of these things uh dave and i have been exploring is like this whole more recent trend when i say recent it's like three to six months of new d5 2.0 um portfol like uh protocols right and these defy 2.0 protocols right some some people are calling it zoomer fi because the kids who are building it are like teenagers they're 18 they're 19 they're 20 okay and they weren't around to buy bitcoin or ether when it was cheap right and so they are they are the new fractal of the new like people that need to take risk in this world yeah and so like the older d5 people like you know maybe not so much david and i because we're trying to understand all the perspectives here but like we are kind of the baby boomers of decentralized finance because there's this new cohort that's coming to the space and they're questioning everything and they're like yeah we like what you guys built and that's all great and it's less risky and it's all safe but like we're doing this other thing over here right and so it's very funny how these uh these things play out in fractals and they just keep repeating arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbetrom you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many d5 applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defy apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the d5 apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space uh you know we don't have too much time left eric this has been an absolute pleasure to talk to you about these things just want to tie a few more things off because i think throughout this conversation you've really made the case for digital assets in particular like bitcoin and eth and i want to get into maybe the entire thesis of of um your firm on this on both bitcoin and eth um and like i guess maybe uh you come to a conclusion on it um so much of what we've been talking about with the monetary policy change the you know technological change that crypto and bitcoin uh brings is sort of a a new way to think about money and you wrote this in your case for digital assets um money is an illusion perhaps the greatest the world's greatest mass delusion you say money is not real it never has been it never will be it is our collective faith in the meaning of money that gives it value i want to talk about that because that is uh it's not contrarian in crypto circles right but it's still got to be institutional contrarian right like not a lot of people have given much thought into what money actually is so tell us how did you come to this conclusion what's been your thought process this idea that money is an illusion uh mass mass the greatest the world's greatest mass delusion and what the nature of money actually is uh money i've i've studied money my my whole career i've studied market history i've studied manias um and i you know one of the great things that trading does that is a little unique amongst professions is it just man it just forces you to just have to confront your mistakes and your errors or you die and there are a lot of other industries where people can probably persist with with making mistakes for you know perhaps way too long um and it's all you know so over over that that period of time i think i've just i've had to confront the this fact that central banks can just kind of keep doing what they're doing and it kind of works and um [Music] and there are no rule there's no like there's no notion of what's fair unfair in markets and you kind of you just you get forced to have to look at you have to get you you're forced to look at all these different issues like markets and manias and money and you know what what do they all mean how do they all fit together you're kind of forced to just keep hammering your head against the wall and just looking at it from all different angles and what what you ultimately conclude and it really is a conclusion which is why i wrote it i mean money there there is no such thing as money there is a there is this notion that we have of what money means and it's a little bit like the sky is blue we just you know it's a it goes back to some stuff we were talking about earlier where you know we assume that the world functions based on centralized power and we assume that money money means something and it's so it's so central to just what we think about throughout our lives because we use it all the time that we we kind of can't possibly fathom that it isn't real and that gives the government enormous power over us because they can then play with something and that we misunderstand and if you start on you know if you look at if you look at what governments do with fiat through that lens a lot of things start making sense that might not have made sense in markets if you didn't see it through that lens so that's kind of how maybe that was a little obtuse but that that's kind of how you end up getting there and you and you you come to see it's like obviously money money is useful you have to pay taxes with your money so there's you know there's certain things that the government can government forces you to have to make money because you have to pay taxes in it right um so the you know there there are reasons that you have to have it and the reasons you have to work for it but in terms of what it really means it doesn't like how could something mean a whole lot if the government could just create seven trillion dollars of of new money i mean like what does it mean right um and then and that's what's so interesting about the case for digital assets because i tell you we've talked a lot about the technology today but we haven't really talked about just owning assets like how do you how do you invest now right how do you what do you do if you believe in some version of the of what we've all talked about today so then what do you do with that right you can you can go out and you can create a company and build a new protocol and you could do that you could you could build an asset management company i'm doing that um you could build infrastructure in this you know you could you could build a chain analysis kind of kind of there are a lot of things you could do you could build right you can also just buy some of these assets and so when you start looking at these assets just take bitcoin it's just it's unlike anything that i have ever seen in my career so it has no it has no tangible value but has a limited supply and what you what you come to see is like something that has no tangible value but limited supply that's credible it could become invaluable and that doesn't really make sense in traditional investment world people go that makes no sense because if i buy a piece of dirt and i put a building on it then it you know i have rents it's like yeah that's true i mean that's true but uh that you know but when you look at most investments and then you look at something at bitcoin it's so utterly foreign and why is it so foreign it's like because it actually has limited supply so every other thing that i've ever invested in other than other than fine art and i don't really own i own art but not fine art like i don't own the mona lisa there's only one mona lisa in the world right and and so that could that could be as valuable as people choose it to be right because there's only one of them in the world but there are a lot of dollars in the world and they can just make more of them so i would you know like what is that value really worth but there also there are a lot of really nice apartments in new york city and if the price goes up they're going to build make more of them and there's a lot of farmland in the world if the price goes up they'll level another forest in the amazon and you know there everything in the world has a supply demand and a supply a supply function relative to price gold does everything does bitcoin no matter what the price does if it goes up or down they're not like we know how much is going to be made and that and so that creates that actually forces you to then if you think about bitcoin in money terms it forces you to kind of look at fiat for what it is and it's like well that that actually i mean fiat is a real illusion bitcoin is an illusion and bitcoin forces you to have to have to admit that it has no real value but for like it's pure it's like okay well this is what we're going to we are assigning a value to it and it means nothing like that there is no tangible value other than this network effect of what we agree on and so it's a really cool thing in that way because we don't really ask those questions of dollars or euros or yen or our rmb even though those are all fictitious but we were forced to ask those in digital and i think older people are looking at that and they're going i reject that and younger people looking at it and i think they're saying wait a second you guys make money out of thin air and we have this thing that we all kind of think is pretty incredible and there is a limited supply of it so maybe this is actually more real than that um and so so for younger people anyway i think that's the that's the the thesis for it and then and then more savvy older people are coming around to that and and that that that's what will drive the value higher it's this sorry that's the red pill my friend that's the red pill i was talking about eric one thing i really appreciate about this conversation and and how you think is everything is very pragmatic uh nothing is too too crazy to out there and the crypto world definitely falls victim to people that think in too much of a crazy terms and so i want to uh put one of my most pragmatic takes as somebody who's known to be a little bit pie in the sky i want to give you my my most pragmatic take as to how this future comes and there's a there's a line that i like called uh that's goes um society progresses one grave at a time which is a little bit dark but the basically it's more just like hey like the future that we're envisioning it'll come especially when everyone that doesn't believe in it passes on and leaving behind everyone that does believe in it could you could you reflect on that uh perspective as to how this future actually arrives well i i don't disagree with what you just said uh and it is it is grim but it's true but that's i don't know i mean hopefully we all have good lives and when when we're you know we're we're when we're old we'll just go right so there's nothing wrong with that and and um and so yeah like i think there's a certain progression to life and it's great to see younger people i have four kids i i just want to see them all do do so much better and more interesting things in their lives than than i do and so and so when i see young people you know young dumb and broke people like i was talking about my 28 year old self i i think it's amazing and i think that there are new ideas even if i don't agree with all of them they're going to lead to something better so i i i think that this you know kind of this new future that is coming number one i think it's inevitable but i think that the sooner it comes the better i am i think it's in the u.s national interest to bring this forward and to be the leader in the world in this whole new you know digital innovation um and and so i think it will come by and hopefully we'll play our our you know small humble part in in educating and then working with government and regulators to you know create a a firm stable but always evolving infrastructure upon which all this innovation can be built and i'll probably focus a lot more on what happens in the financial services area but i think getting that foundation right the thing is finance is so integral to the way society operates is if you can get you can kind of get get the right foundation for the financial world all sorts of other things will be built around it on top of it with greater endorsement by political systems and all the parts of government and it'll be more widely adopted by a broader group of people so i think like it will happen because the it it won't it's not a total revolution where the old system just crumbles and the new system takes over it's this it's going to be this transition period and i think it will it makes sense to me that that there will be crossover players like we would i would view us as a crossover player right we're not a huge firm we're a multi-billion dollar firm but we're not you know we're not the big legacy financial institutions and and we'll kind of help bring in large pools of capital to this space to make all sorts of investments and bridge legacy players i think a lot of the weaker ones will fail in the coming you know 10 or 15 years and so there'll be a lot of dead companies but there'll be legacy companies that transition and become more efficient and better um so i think that will i think that will happen it's not some crazy revolution but i think it will be a time of of enormous change and then if we get it right i think we will have a renaissance that comes out of this i think we're seeing the early signs of that already but for me it's a very optimistic path that said you know any transition period seems really bumpy and and for people who resist change which is almost 100 of people i mean i probably do too but i'm at least know that humans all resist change so i kind of try to see that in myself and just say okay i gotta blow through that because that's my job and i have to help yeah and so anyway but i think when so much change is upon us most people are going to really struggle with that even if it's leading us to a much better place and i think that that's what's going on well eric through the course of this conversation which has absolutely been a blast i think you've you've served as the bridge from greenwich thank you for teaching us about that teacher to crypto i got it right by the end of this podcast and so we appreciate this i want to end with this question because we love asking macro guys about predictions you guys are famous for your you know fantastic predictions give us a prediction in terms of where we're headed and you know choose your own prediction you want to do the price of uh eth bitcoin end of the year or in a couple years do you think that we're going to have another cycle like a 2017 cycle and then things are going to bubble up and we'll have a blow off the top or do you think we'll be in a super cycle or just give us some prediction that you feel you know reasonably strongly about making right now um i'm a longer term uh and by the way i've i've haven't shied away from day trading over the course of my career but at this stage i'm uh i'm a longer-term investor uh investor in macro um and i think that i have yeah i have competitive advantage in that space so that's kind of what i stick to um i think i'll leave you two things one is that i think the mark when it comes to bitcoin because i think your listeners are really interested in that i think bitcoin people currently look at bitcoin as digital gold and i think that it's a it's helpful for people to have a mental model or a framework to think about anything brand new because otherwise they're just lost and i think it's i think it's a reasonable mental model to have and they say well bitcoin goes to 575 thousand dollars it'll be equal to gold that just assumes that no one sells their gold by the way and you know but anyway um i think that i think that eventually bitcoin will go is will be way more valuable than gold and that uh and that as we approach that level or maybe surpass whatever that goal crossover level is people will begin to believe we'll begin to start seeing that it wasn't the right framework but i think for the time being it's it's fine because it's a it's a price that's way far away but i think we'll end up seeing that that gold is an inert metal it hasn't changed in i don't know in however many billions of years and uh and bitcoin will evolve over the next couple years so i so i think that's that's one thing which makes me you know really positive on on this this whole space the second thing that i that i will tell you is that i have studied financial manias over my career and what i see from the macro inputs from the technological change and from to use david's term the paradigm shift that we see the inputs that i see are un are unlike things that i've seen historically i think we could i think we could legitimately have the largest kind of speculative boom in human history and i know that you know that plays out over the over the coming decade and i think that a lot of it will be based on on technological developments that are incredibly valuable and a lot of it will be garbage um because that's just the nature of things but i think it's i think we're in we're in a period like that and so the important thing to consider when if you believe that you're in a period like that is that you need to you need to be very open-minded about what prices and all sorts of things could do and uh and i think we're seeing signs of that like in nfts you start seeing things that most people can't comprehend and i think those those tend to be the things i paid most attention to because i think they're reflecting some underlying change in the way markets operate in the world and uh maybe how humans operate and some of these tensions and how they're playing out but i so those are the those are the two things i i'm i'm very attuned to that i think we i think we could be in the the you know early stages of of just yeah remarkable moves um so maybe that's not specific that's not certain that's but you know that's great love it that guys uh eric peters bitcoin bigger than gold the largest speculative mania possibly in human history get prepared for that you are prepared if you're listening to
