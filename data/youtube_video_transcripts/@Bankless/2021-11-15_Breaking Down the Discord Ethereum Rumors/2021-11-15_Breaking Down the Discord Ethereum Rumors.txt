all right big news of the week let's start with a discord man i would discord is where i spend so much of my time it is the the office for crypto that's like i'm going to the office and basically log into a discord server what did they tease this week yeah they tease an ethereum integration the ceo of discord says probably nothing with an image of the discord icon plus ethereum and it also has metamask and wallet connect right next to the connections page so some sort of like address authentication address integration into discord uh being teased ryan they're they know what we want they know they do know what we want they do know exactly what we want sadly there is a very sad part two of the story uh part two after uh let's see about a day later the same ceo tweets out thank you for all the perspectives everyone we have no current plans to ship this internal concept for now we're focusing on protecting users from spam scams and fraud web3 has a lots of good but also lots of problems and we need to work through at our scale more soon so like they tweezed this they teased this thing and then they had to say like don't worry guys we're not actually doing this so yeah what the hell happened you wanted this is a two-day period this is by the way these are like tweets from the ct from the ceo jason citron who is the founder of discord right this is the guy who who would be in the know it almost feels like um something happened within that 48 hour period of time to like chill him on the concept or chill them on the concept they get it like a call from a regulator like what do you think happened uh they got i think we know what happened is that he got absolutely mobbed by the anti-crypto folk of the world right no way yeah so here here's anthony xerox saying on a tweet this is uh this is wild there are literally hundreds of quote tweets like this people quote tweeting the the um discord ceo and he also says imagine being this uninformed about something but also still have such a strong opinion about it so there are four tweets in here okay so uh somebody somebody who's not in crypto twitter says so this is the discord ceo teasing some sort of crypto integration make sure to let him know discord know how much you hate this both on twitter and here go there make a thread yell tell your friends to do the same thing nfts and crypto belong in the trash that's just one there's another one let's go on uh i don't like to use my platform for big statements often but discord recently had a work in progress uh yeah a work in progress blog post about a partnership with axi a community that exploits people in an mlm structure embedding new users and making them share personal data this is the antithesis of trust and safety we could go on there so apparently the discord yeah uh i am canceling my nitro subscription immediately and will be encouraging all my friends and followers to do the same i will not support a platform that aligns itself with crypto and nfts not to mention mlm schemes and sharing of personal data oof rough mln is multi-level marketing yes big oof big oof the ceo of discord informally teasing integration with ethereum while it's ethereum misspelled isn't surprising discord is a home of number of nft griffs masquerading as exciting projects and it's end vogue about know nothing tech lords but it's definitely a disappointing development damn i want to swear no nothing i want to say everyone f off you don't know what you're talking about like ugh it's so frustrating and like this goes back to the cognitive dissonance that people have about cryptos like oh you didn't get rich off bitcoin well you hate it because the environment oh like you haven't made any money off nfts that's because they're a scam oh mlm schemes guess what the dollar is an mlm scheme like it's so frustrating it's so frustrating and the fact like i understand as a ceo why he had to capitulate to this here's me saying capability but like damn is it is it really frustrating because like that could do like sign in with ethereum self authenticated like self-sovereign identity where you don't have to sell your data to google or yahoo or facebook to sign in is the exact opposite of what they're talking about david here's the thing dude it's just a login with metamask if you don't like it don't freaking use it yeah if you don't like it don't use it why are you getting mad that somebody's building an integration to something like look the biggest discord server in the world is axey infiniti right right don't you think those members of discord those users of discord would like some integration with their metamask wallet i asked this question because i saw some of this pushback i actually didn't read everything that um that you just put up but um this guy said discord is pausing nft plans after the huge backlash apparently some people in the gaming studio totally hate nfts and i was previously unaware of that but you read some of the the quote tweets so i asked the question of um one of the guys who uh was tweeting this why like why do you hate it um and this is his response oh well she's gonna be unable to view it i i may have just gotten blocked open it open it up in a private browser then i didn't even respond to it anyway you didn't get blocked wow i got blocked by basically saying okay so just so people know here's my response um uh he ryan tweeted this and he linked me to this thread and i said i appreciate this reply this is exactly what i was looking for i'm not going to use this thread to push back against these points but i hope you stay tuned into the nft community to hear the counter arguments apparently i got blocked over that yeah um anyway so it goes but basically the the thread now that i can see it in um incognito mode nfts are harmful to games and the entire thread is basically a few points one um energy okay so like the environmental issue every nft um that kills the environment right um which by the way in six months the ethereum merged that will no longer be an issue ethereum will reduce its energy expenditure by 99.9 percent if you know anything about this you've done any research then you obviously know that nfts are not on bitcoin also like individual nfts don't actually add more carbon to the air it's just like ethereum c ecosystem as a whole it's not nfts yes exactly that's another subtle point that seems to be missed and then going through it it's basically like play to earn is is um toxic to the gameplay mechanics right turns it into a multi-level marketing type scheme right and it's like my response says well then just don't play those games you're not losing anything from the existing games that you play like you don't have to play an axi if you don't want to and uh and then um they basically don't believe the premise of we control you control what you buy so they're like it's you already control what you buy in a centralized database and if the gaming company goes away then like the nfts go away anyway right so that's another point not really understanding the difference between like like property rights and being able to port your nft from game to game um also the one good point in this thread was basically a point that we've talked about before which is like what happens if all of the games turn into like these grinds for um for money right right what does that do to gameplay does that remove the fun right so like a whole massive thread of criticisms maybe a few points but mostly misinformation like big swing and a miss so again i i don't understand why there's this disconnect and i didn't even realize until this discord thing that some of the gaming industry actually hate crypto like they hate nfds and they hate what we're doing here i didn't realize any of this was the case but i think there's a massive amount of um misinformation out there and just like like lack of education on what crypto is actually trying to do any other thoughts here yeah the concern about like what happens if these games just turn into a grind and they suck out all the the life out of the game you know what else is a grind working from below poverty wages in a country that doesn't have jobs to support you that's also a grind and that really sucks and so like gatekeeping's like oh i don't want to dilute the art of my industry to the point where like you actually are like revoking people's ability to make an income for themselves if they do not know that the reason why accident infinity's so incredibly large it's because it's supporting an entire like country's gdp right now it got people through kovitch in the philippines yeah so like sometimes this is why like these i understand that people have cognitive dissonance about accepting crypto there's a lot to swallow it really breaks people's brains but also you are doing so much harm by just jumping to conclusions that these things are harmful you are it is extremely frustrating i will stop there it is yeah it is extremely frustrating but now we know this pushback exists so uh we could talk about a little bit more hey we hope
