welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is David Hoffman doing an extra show this week without my AI co-host RSA but regardless we are here to help you become more bankless and also perhaps more gamer because that is the subject of today's episode there's an exciting new announcement out of two of the biggest powerhouses as it relates to crypto gaming and crypto gaming chains uh this is a partnership between immutable and polygon two massive chains who are coming together to align themselves rather than be competitive and as it relates to this partnership I don't know who is really left building out the world of web 3 gaming these are the two biggest web 3 gaming pioneers and now they are joining forces and so you're going to get all of these details here in this episode uh in this episode we are talking to Robbie Ferguson who is the co-founder of immutable and Sandeep who is the co-founder of polygon talking all about how these two Brands these two chains are melding their technology and melding their effort to become the same vertical the same stack so I'll drop the punch line here using polygons ZK evm immutable is building their own ZK evm using polygon technology and so we're having this combined BD Force to push web3 gaming onto the immutable ZK evm so that is that is the announcement you'll hear all about the nuances and the details and the second order effects and the topology of these networks because of course the layer 3 conversation is related here and all of these details are coming in this interview with Robbie Ferguson and Sandeep uh quick disclaimers here both Ryan and I are investors in immutable Ryan is an advisor to polygon I am not so those are disclaimers there and let's go ahead and get right into the interview but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make

and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February thanks this nation welcome to this special show we're recovering some pretty cool announcements out of both immutable and polygon so we're going to talk about exactly what is going on in this neck of the woods and with me I've got Sandeep the co-founder of polygon who we've had on the show before Sandeep welcome back thank you sir and also we got Robbie the co-founder of immutable who we've also had on before Robbie welcome back great to be back David so I got this email from you guys saying that you guys have this special announcement about a collaboration between immutable and polygon and my first reaction was like well I thought they they were competitors uh so who wants to walk us through what this actual announcement is and how this turned from competition to collaboration uh Robbie can I throw this to you first sure so maybe some context which is you know we've been building for a very long time now uh in in the blockchain and specifically on ethereum we started in 2017 building the first decentralized game on the blockchain and it was an absolute Nightmare and we realized we had to start working pretty aggressively to make this easy for developers to build on but also to have this scalable for billions of users One Day At first we looked at the solutions like plasma we looked at Solutions like stay channels neither of these really worked some of these teams rolled into some of the scaling Solutions available now and we looked at side chains we were never really happy with the security trade-offs that they had and then we saw ZK Roll-Ups and for us this is really the end game uh and we've been on an app specific ZK roll up up until now which basically means we have only been able to have very limited Logic No smart contract compatibility and for us this partnership is the end game which is we get to build on you know essentially what we think is probably the best CK attack in market right now um the the ZK VM powered by polygon but we also get to have a go to Market Force that is really going to be a very considerable sort of mechanism how can we actually take all the ethereum gaming mainstream I think there's been a lot of infighting uh between competition and not a lot of focusing on who the true competition is which is ultimately the hundreds of billions of dollars spent by players on in-game items they don't own so I think this will be one of the biggest Partnerships in the space to date uh we're extremely excited to be working with the polygon team and Sunday but Sunday feel free to add any color on this yeah I mean for me like I've been a big fan of uh immutable for you know since their early days right like you know I mean they have been two pioneers of uh ZK Tech uh you know like they took this plunge uh on on building the ZK and taking the hard route I remember speaking to James and Robbie both trying to convince them to you know come to the you know polygon or Matic chain Matic Network that time and they were very clear that you know they want a uh like a very full-blown layer too and everything and I think they they you know in my mind they are one of the biggest ethereum Maxis uh you know out there like you know they are like so all in on ethereum and uh you know when we kind of started approaching our main net on ZK it automatically you know made a lot of sense for me to you know reach out to IMX because in gaming like IMX and polygon are kind of like the biggest of the names right like uh you know by far uh and Orders of magnitude bigger than anybody else in the third place right so uh so so it was basically I thought that you know let me uh you know take this shot and you know speak with them also like you know what where they are up to and obviously they are as Robbie was saying that they are currently on an app specific roll-up where you know there are few only only few functions they can support whereas on ZK VM it's like full-blown evm programmability available to them and uh you know and they like you know we speak to the games they we have a we have a lot of games which are which have the some part of them built on polygons some part built on IMX and and then you know things like that and we have always heard very positive reviews about them about their relentlessness to provide the best developer experience and all that so for us it made like total sense and uh you know I'm really glad that you know I reached out to them instead of not thinking because you know that's where our web3 ethos come in right so I thought that you know what is comp like as Robbie was saying there is no competition here like we are all in this small bowl which is rep 3 and the world is like a big ocean right so I just read out uh to them and then you know this uh and here we are today and you know probably arguably the largest uh you know kind of inter or intra web3 partnership uh you know which is going to happen and hopefully we are able to do some good work for the uh you know game developers who want to come into web 3 and build nice games where people gamers and David I might just add one thing on which is I think we actually launched on a bank list which is our cross-roll of liquidity infrastructure because ultimately what immutable wants to do is create a One-Stop shop for gamers that they can build with apis if they want to strive like ridiculously easy or they can build with custom Smart contracts our viewers this will probably be the sort of five percent of advanced long tail devs building infrastructure for everyone else to use but the second most important thing is that even with DK evm even with five 10 000 TPS it's like hitting sort of the upper limits fortnite alone will take up all of that on a single roll-up and if we have hundreds of different say ZK edms then what we're doing is we're fracturing liquidity across hundreds of difference of Roll-Ups and so really I think the second part of this is we get to bring a lot of that value to polygons ecosystem we can have hundreds of zks which can be specified for a game or for financial infrastructure or the running housing in the future but you can buy buy assets with any currency from any wallet on any individual roll up completely atomically and with zero loss of security and this is kind of our cross wall up cross Marketplace liquidity infrastructure which is really at the heart of what we're trying to build out because I think that's probably the the least paid attention to layer of the stack today so guys as a moderator I really appreciated all the uh context and all the backstory here but I think we've accidentally kind of buried the actual real announcement uh Robbie you kind of said it and stuck it in there but I wanted to like kind of zoom out and just drop the punch line what is happening whoa what's the announcement and what Robbie what's going on here sorry we are expanding from our current roll-up on stockx to be building across polygons version of CK evm using this technology to create the immutable zkev app the immutable ZK evm brand new spiffy zkevm chain correct and so in addition to uh beyond the app specific chain that you guys have been talking about there is a new uh chain which is polygons technology operated by immutable and we're calling this the immutable zkevm this new chain that we're talking about just really wanted to drive that point home precisely maybe we should put this this chunk first and in addition we're gonna be able to offer hundreds of custom ZK edms to say uh an Activision blisters or uh Ubisoft or you know major Enterprise company who might want to have you know their own version of this roll up and our goal is we'll be able to unify all this liquidity with our infrastructure have them build on incredibly easy to build apis and we're bringing this easy to use just polygons in ethereum's ecosystem and continue to run all of our services to make sort of games incredibly successful everything from economics assistance tokenomics passport which is so of custodial email onboarding for end users we'll also be joining forces with a lot of the go to market arms so working on helping to to onboard more games onto ethereum and really take I think like honestly this is for us the end game I think people have been iterating scaling Solutions and iterating approaches to to what will be the final Tech architecture that goes mainstream this is it this is CK EDM we have full custom Smart contract compatibility you have full scalability and we have now user onboarding technology which can take a user playing a game and they can earn assets and they can sign up for a self-custodial ethereum wallet without ever even knowing what an nft or a blockchain is and and that's really what I think is needed to take this the next billion users beautiful and and if I remember correctly Robbie the way that uh immutable interface with starkware your previous uh and and still you know that that will continue to walk absolutely right yeah and it was like immutable licensing star Square technology is that how we should think about this with polygon the polygon ZK evm or like how does this relationship uh work out so let me take that so this is basically so polygons technology is fully open source right so there's no licensing agreement instead like when immutable base chain right so immutable chain uh this immutable ZK VM when it decentralizes it will have matics taking on it and that's the only uh you know kind of the the the the the the token economics model for polygon where thus taking you know polygon wants to be or polygon validators want to be the the the the the the infrastructure engine which provides uh you know infrastructure to run these chains and they get the the gas fees in return and we are guessing that with with the way mutable today is like 150 tier one double a triple A games uh you know we expect like hundreds of millions or you know in fact billions of transactions during a year and all that gas fees will go and go to the Matic validators so that is uh that has been like the you know that's the main thing that's the main end game fun fact we had 20 billion API requests last quarter um sure okay well Robbie that begs the question if if this is a Matic chain what does the IMX token fold into in this new world yeah so if you go to immutable.com IMAX hyphen token right now you will see four boxes and and for us the really exciting thing is because this is now a smart contract compatible change rather than just an app specific roll-up we can basically add on a whole ton of utility that was previously impossible for us at so uh medical with a call staking uh token um but the gas token which is effectively used to sequence and priority transactions on immutable DK EPM will be IMX so for us that's extremely exciting you know that's effectively like taking the the utility of a Solana or some chunk of utility of an ethereum or an app dose and adding that on to the existing utility of IMX um each month we then have two more sort of forms of utility we'll be announcing like I can't share more deals on those right now but we will be sharing those very soon okay so the idea is that uh Matic is the staking token it operates the validators it receives the gas fees of the network the gas fees are paid in IMX is that correct absolutely correct absolutely absolutely and and it's like you know David for me like not only for IMX like the general idea that is emerging is that you know for the uh you know like middleware platform like IMX or app layer platform just like it's like basically asking what is the utility of let's say uni swap token right so uni swap is on the app layer uh you know IMX utility is much much bigger uh they are a middleware they are plugged into various you know hundreds of games plus now they have the gas fees also uh in in their token and all that so this is basically if you see on a higher level the idea of like you know where polygon is evolving into is that polygon you know simply only wants to play on the infrastructure layer right which where you stakematic you provide the security to run the a network right but on top of that on the app layer all the utility goes to our you know Partners uh like like you know IMX or like you know whoever like you know I mean they wrote they're going to be many like that right so so that's the base model here like you know we polygon remains on the infrastructure layer everything else above it is fully IMX to you know uh capture in terms of the utility beautiful and and Robbie you mentioned things like uh if Activision Blizzard or EA wants to come in and build their own zkevm they have that optionality through immutable can you unpack that relationship and how that relates to the whole economics of the whole system of course so I think one of the biggest reasons we've the the only reason we really would sort of lose a gaming deal um today it would be lack of smartphone Rock compatibility and I think for the biggest Enterprise companies in the world they typically want either one of three dicks they're either one they're handheld and the entire thing to be white glove or they want basically a playground then to build an experiment with and a lot of these larger companies also want to control their Destiny in terms of being able to have influence over their own uh tracking the exciting thing I think we can now do is we can essentially build them their own Customs EK evm and they can have their own 10 000 transactions per second uh they can have you know their own nodes they can have their own uh process of sequencing transactions but importantly they're not on an island all of their players can still be interoperable assets and wallets and fines with every single other roll-up built on immutable and also it means that we'll be able to basically take this scale customize that specific game and then let them have a huge amount of Destiny over it you know use their own tokens involve to the chains as well and so for us this is sort of if you look at a broad spectrum you can either have sort of complete white gloves you can have complete control of your own destiny or you can have very very simple infrastructure to build on um and appealing to this entire agreement is really important to actually take this mainstream David a simple mental model for that also is basically these are these chains will simply be l3s right right which are like you know which might be Matic strike like you know if they want to decentralize their mathematic stick or they settle back into the IMX uh you know base chain which is the immutable uh ZK VM chain and you know they're also like again they contribute back to the liquidity they contribute back to the gas fees and things like that right so this is basically like the layer three like a lot of people have you know kind of talked about layer threes and things like that like we are not talking about that but you know uh polygon like I mean I I we have like higher double digit layer threes which are getting ready across the year and you will see so many of them launching uh with them and then you know with with this with with this uh you know kind of strategic partnership with IMX like imagine IMX alone itself will be able to launch like tens of them them right because all of them are then uh you know utilizing IMX middleware platform and things like that right so that's where like you know it becomes very strategic for us because as an infrastructure provider as a you know fully decent class protocol and things like that you know uh we cannot provide a lot of Hands-On service whereas IMX is built in a way where they have a you know kind of a studio and a you know uh Equity company plus the decentralized middleware protocol right so they can actually scale with hundreds and hundreds of such large scale uh you know games which which build with their technology and can also provide because it's Revenue making for them they can provide close handed White Glove services to them right so uh you know that is where the the the the biggest Advantage comes to comes to polygon so for us like immutable becomes that partner which you know can then you know not only like this one single partner but they can actually uh you know help people run like tons of uh polygon chain so that's why you know it's very exciting for us so let me show you what's in my imagination of like the topology of this whole network and make sure that I get this right and so okay so this zkevm the immutable ZK evm settles to the layer 1 ethereum does not settle to the polygon proof of stake it settles directly to ethereum it's the ZK evm which is polygon technology staked by Matic but it's the immutable domain the immutable ZK evm and immutable and all of its uh on-chain gaming can exist on top of that layer 2 the zkevm layer 2. again it's Matic staking IMX is the gas token and then also if you people have been paying attention immutable's BD skills are strong and so the idea here is that independent uh game studios whether they're like as big as Activision Blizzard or as small as your you know local mom and pop indie game studio if that's the right word to use it they also have their ability to make another ZK evm also polygon technology that settles onto the zke evm the immutable zkevm and they can become their independent zkevms per game studio for whatever they desire for that to be and the rules of how that becomes validated or staked or whatever is probably up to the individual Studio itself but that is the service that immutable is offering towards the greater world of gaming and so immutable is offering it's like perhaps like top of funnel BD skill set to the underlying polygon technology the polygon ZK VM chain so that's what send it for polygon and then immutable gets the whole uh technology to really scale out and onboard all of these game studios onto a ZK evm with polygon is all is all that correct because that's my interpretation I I think I think bang on David and maybe I can kind of share a bit of insights into why I think this is such an easy kind of strategic choice and an easy pocket which is you know essentially the layer of the stack which we're building out is I would say you can break the layer of the stock into three today you have nft marketplaces which is where people actually tracked you know these are openc these are the wearables of the world and these are the GameStop marketplaces and ultimately I think with games we're going to see a whole ton of sell side liquidity that is in-game Marketplace or contextual marketplaces and a lot of buying on sort of big aggregators but this is where our Global audible comes in which means we can take all these marketplaces provide them the same source of exchange liquidity and every single participant can take their own fees so our goal is really actually like a a sort of the existing way nft marketplaces is built is quite limited and they'll actually struggle to have volume over the long run because they won't be able to tap into people say a 13 year old earning a skin in fortnite and wanting to sell it then and there in the context of the app and what we've built actually allows these people to monetize far better and maximize liquidity and then at the bottom you have sort of like actual scaling protocols people working on consensus mechanisms on ZK Tech itself you know this has never been our business I I think it's it's pretty clear that um with polygon in their two previous acquisitions that they're going to be a front runner in this race um and so for us it's completely complementary for us to expand and build crosswalk liquidity but the major benefit we get is polygon and mutable have really been sort of fighting quite hard and and competing quite doggedly um you know it's underneath and I I had laughed over this for the last couple of years and I think that's been um fantastic I think it's been we've really had to hone our skills and and learn what is the most appealing to web free game developers but now I think it's time for the industry to mature and realize that the real competition are the giant 100 billion dollar Industries in gaming built off exploiting players and giving them zero rights and with the Final End Game technology stack we now have and with the Final End Game sort of go to market movements this will be the year that we see games with tens to hundreds of millions of players and we start to see web 3 truly go mainstream mm-hmm yeah the the uh like I said earlier the two biggest BD forces I think that exist in all of crypto are polygon and immutable like immutable you guys have uh you guys got Tick Tock I think like Warner Brothers a few other game studios and everyone knows uh polygons ability to land it land some very big non-crypto importantly non-crypto uh teams and now these BD efforts they're not combining into the same BD team y'all are still two different companies but now the idea is like the BD teams are pointed towards the same goal uh I don't really have a question on that but if either of you would like to reflect on like what happens when these two gargantuanly successful BD teams are aligned towards the same vision like what happens next you know so I I always used to say like you know uh with especially in gaming like you know polygon has a much expensive portfolio but on the gaming like you know obviously because IMX like with such bright people and like you know they have a massive like you know 250 people team only focused on game we'll have like 10 people so it's like you can imagine like you know they have given us very you know kind of tough nights in that and I used to sometimes joke that you know it's basically uh you know whenever there is a you know a competition for a particular let's say client building on this one I always used to say that this is to the to my team that this is basically uh Unstoppable Force meeting a immovable object right which which is Unstoppable Force which is IMX and if you will object that is polygon and uh you know obviously now suddenly when these two things join hands like you know polygon ecosystem and the immutable stream and all that I am I'm not sure like you know uh it becomes very difficult to compete with that combination but yeah like I mean for us basically polygon as I said that is a much larger uh you know kind of this thing B5 and this and that like so many things are going on on multiple fronts so we are very happy to have a partner like IMX uh on the gaming side so you know you can we can be rest assured that you know polygon technology on the infrastructure level keeps winning uh with them uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the game but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregate letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon-free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menemask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web3 and so um who's left in the world of web 3 games when immutable and polygon are now on the same team like what there's there's gaming on Solana but Solana the ecosystem is not super healthy right now I remember Once Upon a Time Avalanche was going after gaming but I haven't heard of anything in avalanche so like who's your guys's biggest competition that's left in in the crypto Arena well I think I think the real competition are the the massive you know billion dollar games companies who are ripping players off and I think this is the whole point which is um there's a lot of sort of introspection and infighting in an industry that is ultimately should be collaborating and working to just make this stuff mainstream like we have you know 30 million Mao in crypto at Max it's it's terrible and like this this technology is incredible but really the only thing that I was mentioning fraction today is payments the first actual mainstream application outside of payments are going to be gaming and we have a single mainstream game which is you know 100 million players is not even crazy that's like the 100th biggest game in the world as soon as we have one of those we triple cryptos now overnight and we make sure that its value proposition can be heard without requiring people to know what a private key is What self-custody even is We on board them through the actual value they experience rather than shouting at them hey the future is decentralized which might work for people who love talking about everyday and VCS and tech people but really for the sort of 3.1 billion Gamers out there all they care about is hey do I now have the ability to sell some stuff that I used to spend money on and completely have as a sun cost and what we've heard is as soon as those Gamers switch and they try again like God's Unchained or eluvium if they feel sick going back to old versions of those games because they realize what what essentially a scammy one-sided economy it is it's very similar to the you know Fiat to real money conversion that I've seen I think uh was it Balaji or was it um uh someone else who said this recent crisis showed there's only two banks in the world today there's the fed and there's uh Bitcoin and I think it's it's getting pretty clear that there's only going to be two forms of really economic ownership and there's one that's scammy and people have been using the last 30 years and there's one that will actually Empower players beautiful beautiful well uh just something I've personally come to the realization of recently like I've heard the The Narrative of like oh gaming is going to onboard the next billion people it's going to be gaming gaming gaming gaming and for a long time throughout 2022 is like okay fun narrative we'll see we'll see how that rolls into this uh a few things lately have shown me that this is more than just a narrative at this point and that was one seeing how far along some very beautiful games are at East Denver with uh game native people who have now discovered the utility of assets and then also uh just all the maturity of the underlying infrastructure uh that has allowed for kind of what you're talking about Robbie which is just like uh abstracting away the complexities that non-crypt owners don't care about so like it's for me it's gone like okay this is a fun narrative we'll see how this plays out to like oh no this is way further than I thought that I was uh so Robbie I'm hoping you can kind of just like give us a snapshot lay of the lands of like what is the current state of gaming and as it relates to people who are Gamers but perhaps they're more crypto people than their Gamers what's going to be the first thing that they do like what's going to be the first exposure that they have to this world of crypto web 3 gaming yeah and Sunday feel free to add on but really to me Webster gaming is the before the flood stage right over the last two and a half years there's been 15 billion US Dollars invested into web 3 gaming it is the most invested in category of crypto and this is basically more investment in any nascent Tech category than we've seen over the last couple of decades and all of this money is building games and infrastructure that typically has a lead production time of between two to four years so this year's web 40 to 50 of them actually start to go live and I think the most interesting thing has been despite the bear market and and you know you hear this language all the time this is the bear Market where we've seen people still going to conferences still building developer activity and traction is up no more is that true than in gaming where even the Enterprise companies we are talking to are still more interested than ever in learning how they can actually utilize this technology all the bear Market has done is give them breeding room do not have to show face to public markets about expertise but instead build products that genuinely consumers love and so for me I think this is the year where we have 200 to 300 games each with at least 10 million dollars in funding start to go live and one of these are going to be a hit right gaming is massively power logic a lot of these games a lot end up being successes but that's fine because the five percent that do will redefine use attraction and Mass Appeal for web 3 for the rest of it Ravi um what's next for this partnership how does this partnership roll out is there like phases or like what's what are the actual like near-term next steps here I think like the obviously the the most important stack uh step is that you know when we uh actually like when when Amex fully launches their uh immutable middleware Solution on this one plus we have a lot of like eco ecosystem uh relationships that's being built uh you know this in a way because uh you know for gaming you don't only need one particular part of the stack there are multiple other Stacks so people are looking to integrate into this there are Community like you know ygg NDG and multiple different like you know who are like looking to partner uh into this kind of Consortium or something so uh you know so I see a lot of collaboration already happening and once First Step One is the platform going live and then I think some of the I think IMAX team and also polygonly like you know for polygon games also because this is you know for us on an infrastructure level this is polygon chain only so there's like you know many of them would also choose to you know work on the IMX middleware which allows them to have this cross chain liquidity and all that right so we expect uh you know obviously the launch of the platform then some top games launching over there from IMX side I'm pretty sure from polygon side also some of the games looking at the overall proposition of the of the platform will might end up choosing uh to build uh and and that's where like you know we are uh that that's where like the the main like you know uh I would say end game begins where after that now we have the scalability now we bring as many games as possible as when experimentation that happens as possible uh you know we also have a infographic like what where Robbie was saying that you know how much billion RAV Robbie has been put in in the gaming side and I think if you see that that graph itself looks so interesting like the top three is ethereum polygon and IMAX like I think that includes the 80 of the funding that has gone into these games and uh and and you know like many of those like are double a triple A games and uh many of them are and you know some of them are going to figure out the Real Models like you know in gaming it's like once somebody figures out a particular model let's say premium model or all the previous models everybody then jumps in and I think this is as Robbie was saying this is just that stage where the flood gates get open and uh that's why also it's very exciting and we hope that you know some of the games building with us are able to crack that and are become the Pioneers uh in that interacting that model and then from there on it's just uh you know kind of a game of bringing or bringing and can I say I've mentioned this now to immutables like the majority games we have this ckvm with polygon coming out and the level of uptaken in Simon has been insane I think people are extremely excited to have say swaps which they can use in their games now or D fights be incorporated under the hood and for us our timeline is launch uh immutable ZK evm launch custom ZK EVMS for sort of you know major partners because I think David as you said this is just one part of the ecosystem but together immutable and polygon are actually quite a deep layer of the platform stack where we have sort of you know easy apis to build on we have this crosswalk liquidity infrastructure and obviously we have all these services but ultimately there's going to be a whole heap of people building on top of this they might be platforms which are helping games to launch they might be uh Community gaming guilds uh they might be people who are building on-ramps or compliance Solutions and I think the goal is to help really to onboard each of these and the third piece hopefully by the end of the year is to have cross-wallup liquidity expanded for uh the immutable DK evm and all other versions of zke EDM which were custom spinning up and for us that is pretty much Essential you can already see through our Global audiobook so the unifying sort of marketplace solution more than half of all trades are created on One Marketplace and filled in another that's with like 10 games live imagine with thousands a huge amount of sell side liquidity is going to be in game and a huge amount of buy side is going to be on these major aggregators um and and giving them the volume that ultimately they're creating the user experience for our second thesis is cross-roll-up liquidity will basically multiply liquidity by however many roll-offs you're aggregating like we have more than a trillion dollars in TV owl in crypto today if you take every single chain providing cross roll off liquidity of it actually gives us a level of exchange liquidity that compete with the big boys in real financial markets or the gaming markets in the real world and this is what is necessary for crypto to not be this sort of you know fragmented series of solutions where we have inferior crisis ultimately for assets but to be the default place that unique value is exchanged and gaming is the Vanguard of that well guys I can hear the excitement in your guys's voice and uh anytime really just like successes always comes from alignment right and when we can get our protocols to align uh if you believe in crypto uh everything else becomes easy after that so I'm excited to see what happens in this future and like I've been saying from the get-go like I just want Diablo with assets man and so if this gets me closer to that uh that gets me excited Robbie Sandeep thank you so much for walking us through this video like I I know Robbie and team they are working on so many such kind of ips when you hear you're like oh or like like you know yeah these people are beasts and we are also we so we are going to do some cool stuff in the gaming stuff like really cool I'm excited to get very distracted from my job here at bank list so go play some video games and when they inevitably do come uh if people are curious and they want to learn more what's the website that they should go to to dive down this rabbit hole um well to come and build I guess on on boat Solutions it's it's immutable.com I think there'll be a bunch of um press going up obviously everything gets on polygon.com and for you guys as well yeah yeah but then on this platform this is called IMX immutable ZK VM platform and I think immutable will host like extensive documentation and everything around it for the developers and uh you know both on the cell service or like kind of the Enterprise side so yeah they are the perfect place to go there David if I can make one final plug I think ultimately the the greatest Affinity that I shared with the polygon team and part of the reason we were so Keen to make this partnership happen is since day one our solution was always to scale and work with ethereum rather than competing with it and that was actually quite a like now I think it's a reasonably popular view back then it was extremely contrarian because VCS wanted L1 chain hypothesis value accretion thesis they wanted you to make a competitor uh they wanted the next kind of beef killer I think it's pretty clear that ethereum is going to be the default liquid smart contract platform that future polygon is going to be a huge portion of that scaling and we want to make gaming the mainstream part of that and I think that having aligned with ethereum is part of the reason we've been able to have the community success today a lot of games want to make sure they're building on the biggest platform and my goal is really how can we just make that easier than ever for game developers to build on and help make not only ethereum but the entire crypto ecosystem win David like people say like you know polygon BD is great and all that but I feel that you know like you know that everybody is same but where polygon has an edge is that we really feel for our relationships like you know for IMX like we will put like as a part of this relationship we'll put every bit of our effort to make sure they are successful if they are successful we are already successful right so that's where like I think the the biggest attraction because that you know for a lot of Builders come to polygon because our core DNA like it's not only me talking like you know all my team feels like that and once we have a partner in place we are like and we want to make sure they win and they win and we win with them together and that's why like you know uh you see so many people building a polygon we'll do that for IMX also you'll have to hear the alignment and uh I know both these teams were building before this last bull market even got started and here we are the bull market is definitely over and and y'all are still building so all right guys thank you for walking me through this very very cool announcement uh risks and disclaimers everyone as you know crypto is risky gaming probably also risky not only can you lose what you put in in D5 but you can literally die in crypto gaming but at least you might also respond uh respawn excuse me this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you are with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you thank you
