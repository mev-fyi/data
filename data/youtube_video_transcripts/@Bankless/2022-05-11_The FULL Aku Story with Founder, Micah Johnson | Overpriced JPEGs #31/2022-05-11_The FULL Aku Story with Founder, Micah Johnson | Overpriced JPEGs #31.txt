[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs more like underpriced jpegs these days actually uh i'm carly riley i am so incredibly excited for today's episode uh i have micah johnson on the podcast for anybody who listens to this show i think i've talked about aku and akutars for like the last three episodes raving about them been very excited about this project so just so uh honored micah to have you here to to really dive into it more well thanks for having me i always enjoy talking about it and always appreciate a chance to talk about it so cool you're outside on a beautiful day so things yeah first time outside all day too so extra good yeah yeah get the whatever vitamin d so for anybody who doesn't know micah is a former mlb player turned artist turned i don't know ceo you have a whole company built around aku at this point uh i have not been shy about my love for this project it's really been a couple of things that i think drew me to aquitars and aku when i when i first discovered it like such an obviously genuine why you see so many projects out here where they're not intending to be rug poles but on some level you know they're trying to ride the hype of nfts and aquitar doesn't feel like that at all it's like i know why this character should exist in the world the art and and it's you know there are these um like not gifs but they're animated you know they've got music to them like it's so evocative so you're immediately like oh i see what this world could be which really really drew me in you have this incredible community that are like big time diamond handers you know it feels like and uh and you just like we're not chasing hype like what's so been so amazing to me is you've been building all this stuff you've gotten some mainstream attention but i feel like the nft community like didn't catch on to you totally do you until we until we lost 34 million the best marketing move you could have done micah lose 34 million dollars everyone's paying attention well i wasn't going to start there but let's start there that that is why people may some people may have heard about that you all had a smart contract problem 34 million dollars currently locked up in a smart contract never to be accessed by anyone what happened what have you learned coming off of that process arguably it's probably 70 million now the way that eighth is going so yeah there you go full kind of guy no i i mean it was a massive learning experience uh hurt obviously personally i think it's something that uh in the moment i always we have we we have had a film crew with us a lot of those times we've been since aku started uh not since it started but at the point we realized like we're onto something special here that and day told them to not come so i think that's the biggest regret of it all uh because it was it was look nothing you can do about it right like i i i played a sport that was predicated on failure and i woke up every day played 162 games out of a year knowing i was going to fail that day so failing and overcoming adversity is never a thing it's not a new thing to me you have to look you have to move forward sure you always want to think about it it'll linger in your mind but you have to move forward and when that happened look it was a uh as a non-technical founder you have dependencies that you know uh on technical and sometimes uh you know things happen and you just don't um you don't do the proper things needed you know in this case getting a contract audited and that whole thing and mistakes happen in this case very fortunately people were able to get their refunds and we issued refunds personally issued close to 2.5 million dollars with an additional refunds um on top of the refunds that came out of the the smart contract our money was locked up is locked up and uh it was a a learning experience for me in life to move move correctly and not quickly and to have different levels of of of checks in place along the way as you build even you know from even across the board across the board at life and that's it was an unfortunate situation i think that will be a learning experience for a lot of people entering the space the fragility of this technology that it's in beta still it seems like and the level of detail required um uh in this in this space and help that you need in this space and so it was it i take it as a learning experience and and and how do we go from here and how do we shape the company from here and move forward and uh which you know we've done no lie it's hard you know of course it sucks you know that's uh i have to make decisions now and i have to make trade-offs now from a business perspective that i you know wouldn't have had to make and so i i burdened that personally um but yeah i think you've from what i've seen there's been a lot of grace from the community very rightfully so because i think people recognize that okay you are a non-technical founder but more importantly like you you so clearly are not rug pulling anybody here like you're so clearly an incredibly genuine builder who's in this for the long haul and so i feel like that that came through to people and so that was my impression i don't know if you feel like that's how the community has responded but i i do just want to push on you're like you know what can we do there were some people who flagged this on twitter beforehand and i think that there were some people who were frustrated because they're like you had folks calling out that there were bugs in the smart contract what was the breakdown there of you you had these warnings and and they didn't get heated no so there was a lot of people that reached out uh i would say a lot i was in the heat of the moment there was one person in particular uh hassan had reached out got him on the phone rather quickly very quickly there was a moment this site went down we were able to get on the phone in that moment and when that happened you know it's decision time in real time become wartime ceo first instinct shut it down i don't know anything it's possible cancel the contract whatever it is developer walks him through um the contract you know on the phone they check out this withdrawal function so that basically our developer had put it in there so that if in three days if we die that day everybody would get their funds to back so it checks out you know hassan checks it out okay it looks good incredible dudes helped us out the whole time um puts together puts puts out another tweet saying it's all good reviewed it looks good that wasn't the issue though and so like that's it wasn't like we you know was flagged and we said you know forget this it was let's check it out do what you need to do you know cancel this if you have to no big deal like let's cancel this was you know checked it out everything checked out the issue was the fact that there was just wrong code from the level was it an accounting error was it essentially like a counting error that that's right that's right that's right so funds funds from jump street weren't going to be uh be able to be withdrawn people would have been able to issue receive their refunds uh uh but yeah our funds were from judge street weren't going to make it so that's what it boiled down to the stuff around you know we dismissed it it wasn't that wasn't how it went down it wasn't like this was the thing that we could stop it it was done from uh from that whole thing and assad was incredibly helpful the whole time like you know sat on the phone and walked us through it walked me through it attended more importantly like understanding a whole different perspective on where it was and there was a moment where you know he realized like wow actually you guys it's locked i think the other reason you received a lot of grace again rightfully so again from my perspective is you made right by the community you know like we you know it happened to get out there was this error in the smart contract people knew but if you were just a community member who had bought into this drop like you you were made right um was that like i mean there's millions of dollars locked up like has that impacted business plans for the immediate term or moving forward like your money you're going to reinvest now y'all are you know i wouldn't know because because i've been i've been building for a year i'm not going to go spend money that i don't have that's not that's just a bad business practice in general so from the everything we've been developing was already you know paid for you know aquitars were expensive build pure and simple is over a 40 person team worked on the occupators like we're not going to go spend money that we don't have uh chapter money you know uh was reinvested into a company formed a company um and i you know over 15 million dollars in primary sales and chapter money ready to be deployed into development sure it would have helped but like the most important thing that people need to understand about what's 34 million dollars go to right 24 million dollars is going towards film development uh ownership of the ip develop it as far as you can as big as you can as long as you can so whether this trade-off has to happen trade-off has to happen now on my end you're gonna have to give up some things around the ip you have to give up some some it's becomes negotiations at this point with less leverage that's what that's a personal thing that that for me i have to deal with um which you know it is what it is you'll have to dilute yourself you'll have to do certain things but from a development standpoint back back to business everything so and this this will be my last question sort of around this and it'll segue us nicely into the ip front because i think that is what stood out for me you know you could argue virtually every project in the nft spaces is angling to be ip you have to maybe have some exceptions where it's clearly like a community membership fly fish club is maybe you know just getting you into a cool club in new york but in general they're all trying to vip and i think there is something magical about aku the character the the look of the nfts like it just has that spark of like this could be big ip and i think that comes along pretty rarely um i'm curious on this front like are there sort of trade-offs you've made or was was the sort of situation that went down partly like y'all are so focused on the ip building part that that you're you're thinking less about the tech and you've now recalibrated that to be more balanced was was that a part of it at all you think no no it was just a sonic it was a mistake because because the team we brought the team in uh to to our time zone um to work on this for several months and then brought the team to london to work on this together leading up to this to mitigate all mistakes yeah so everything was in place to it wasn't like we were focused on ip building because i'm the creative like my it's me and now we announced kerry hart stephen feeder like i'm the creative there's a whole bunch of other people under the hood you know working on this and everything was done with the tech in mind it's just a mistake that um you know was made it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and

believe yeah carrie led curated the whole divisions across star wars on creative and then steven led uh film i mean that's incredible what was the moment was there a moment or was it a slow build that you know in building occurs that you're like oh like we have something here was it the moment of conception like when did you realize like oh my god we're gonna get ex lucas people to build to help build our story when my daughter started seeing space helmets and she's two and a half and started saying that's the aku helmet and like just and and everything she's every time she saw a helmet of anything it was aku's that's when i knew this was special because you can't you can't force ip like you can't force a kid to think that this and know aku's name or kids to like ah you can't force a kid to do anything in life let alone like a character or uh recognize a character so that's when i knew it was it was really really special beyond any monetary association with with it and when was that moment in the timeline of you building this character oh it was um pretty early on pretty early no because i've been dropping nfts since early 2020 um this was a moment of like i i always believe in myself like i'm not going to do something that i don't think is big and i think aku i really said his art i'm not going to lie to you uh leading up to the first drop of chapter one of february 24 february february of 2021 i uh i didn't do any marketing i was just like we got this drop coming on nifty like this is something i care about like check it out if you want to and then the summer my partner you know he started reaching out to everybody push the t and upscale vandal and they evangelized it and and really got everybody excited but uh for me it was more personal a personal message i want to get out to the world and as an artist and marketing wasn't my thing it was just this is what i this is what it is um but i don't know i i think having the kids see it and recognize it and really appreciate and just to be consumed in it is is what's special about it like you can't fake that you can't fake that okay let's do a proper timeline i'll give people a little nugget here which is you just referenced that first aku drop i think it sold like more than a million dollars in seven minutes in like february 2021 you said it's like that also had to be a pretty wild moment i don't know we'll talk about maybe pre that moment in your art history but like damn to be an artist i mean make more than a million dollars in your art was that like a really like wow feeling no this is back to work more pressure more pressure when you when you do something like when you do something like that it's not it's people it's people investing in you as an artist yeah so why would i go do you know i'm a millionaire now and like my brain there's a sense of responsibility when someone takes time out of their day to show up and and invest their heart and money into the thing that you're doing so like immediately this is this is dead on a serious uh the drop ended and it was me and my boy dirk who were working on the aku chapters call him immediately like drop eighth minute like boom hey let's get to work like we gotta go and it's just like okay what's next what's think about boom boom boom it wasn't a moment where i was like this feels good to chill like no cause like that's when the pressure that's when the pressure starts what about a moment though of like validation of wow you know you you made this career from being a professional athlete to an artist okay it's resonating for folks oh i can make this work like did it have did it have that you're just like a worker you're just like just work get down and do it just work yeah so and i think i read somewhere and let me know if this is right that your plan had been to release these you released 10 chapters which are really 10 pieces of art 10 nft series you know collections um over the course of your initial plan was to record release over the course of some longer time frame and then you condensed that because of the success is that right yeah yeah i just think that the original idea was to do a couple 10 chapters over a couple years uh just because nmts weren't mass adoption at that point so i was like okay in order to prove market fit and like people like this it's going to take a while uh especially doing it in this format and then of the success you know really had wanted to get through ten um and and and we just pushed it like we really pushed it and uh shout out to the whole creative team that you know and we really got into it and how many people in your first drop how many people were on your creative team two me and dirk two okay it's you and derek and tell me who's dirk what's his what's his uh dirk vandermeer um he he originally you know it was like hey do you want to you know help build this character out you know i drew the designs on it like he's a 3d 3d uh art i call him a 3d 3d generalist superstar he can do about anything from modeling to texturing to asset building uh to environment building you name it um it's like no problem you know and uh we didn't know like we didn't know what it was gonna become and and uh and to this day you know we still rocking you know and he's really kind of my like right hand when it comes to the quality and creative control across across the board and then we brought in jason bryce um who is a sequencer and that's when we transitioned to unreal engine and really got into that with with jason and uh it was just us three sometimes two yeah well i'm you know there's i want to you're you're touching on points i want to talk about unreal engine i want to talk about that but i i do want to maybe stay well let's do a better chronology here just in case there are folks who haven't tracked your story or haven't listened to me tell what i know of your story on this podcast before so 2018 you leave the mlb and and is that when you do you make a determination in 2018 like i'm gonna go be an artist and pursue this thing full-time or like how did that transition from i'm a professional athlete to i'm a professional artist happen oh not luxurious by any means uh i didn't make much money playing baseball because of you know i was always up and down and you don't make that much money in the minor leagues a couple hundred bucks every two weeks uh wasn't anything and uh so when i retired i never had i didn't have a skill set never had a job before so um it was pretty the first year i was cool i was chilling there was nothing you know i was playing golf and practicing painting were you on the pga tour did i hear i was trying to be i thought i could be oh man uh so i i gave it a shot you know uh but i couldn't break 80 so i figured i might as well figure out what's next but um but i was just practicing and then it kind of hit hit like you got to figure something out and that's when i really started diving into my craft and practicing painting in my garage uh 2019 and didn't have much success either it's just but it was just creating and exploring different styles of different mediums um and then uh late 2019 i discovered nft's digital crypto art and what it was called i don't think nfps was like a very popular term it was crypto art um and released my first nft in early 2020 uh jimmy bought it um and supported me and and 3e 900 bucks and really just fell in love with the fact that like in this world i could i started animating my painting i could release my art freely um and connect directly with collectors and have you know real ownership over you know my creativity and the things i was putting out into the world and i didn't need the validation of somebody to say like this was worth this much uh or you know uh it belongs in this gallery and then i was then i really um i really wanted to get into a gallery um and i really thought you know i really want to take my art i look my paintings are completely different you don't really see them in the nft world but my paintings and my uh pursuits in that world are much different uh i like the traditional route like thinking about museums and being in institutions and that whole thing so i was able to leverage some of my success in the nft world to get into a very uh renowned gallery and and then you know kind of realize that the power of leveraging nfts to do things in the web 2 world did you ever think about being an artist when you were growing up or did you always think about being a professional athlete high school baseball when did that switch like did you when did that switch happen of like maybe i'll go try and be a professional artist it sounds like 2019 but when did you start getting into art and did it ever occur to you like hey maybe i'll just go like be an insurance guy like i'll just get like a normal job or were you always gonna do something interesting like this i always needed to do something that i could see myself get better at it's not about it was never about like art i got into art art in 2016 uh when i was with the dodgers but it was never about the art itself it was about the the practice of getting better at something every day and art is something that you can see yourself get better at every day like if you draw an eye for 365 days in a row that eyes gonna look better on day 365 than it did on day one then you'll look you can see the evolution occur over the time and that's what i fell in love with about art same thing about baseball i didn't like the i didn't love the games like the games i i love competing i love the games for sure but practice in the time suit four like that was my thing like six a.m five a.m like hitting off a tee like going into like hit off the tee at three in the morning that was my thing and so i'm just a person that really likes the grind and likes the process much more than the end result and that's like that's for me that was art it was something very tangible for me that's so interesting and i was actually going to ask you what you felt like you took most from professional sports into the nft world like what and and that makes so much sense it it's that concept almost of um what's the what's the term what's the term um like deliberate practice is that a concept you've like heard before yeah you have to be like from a very young age i've been very intense since i was very little and there's a there's i released this nft recently on artifacts it was at home videos of me when i was like three very intense like kid on like you know i wanted to play matrix baseball uh and that intensity is just this thing that i carried over to it's gonna be carried over to anything if i did do insurance like yeah i would do it very in intensely um and try to do things you know differently but uh that's just kind of how i'm wired what percent of your day now i mean are you still doing like actively making art on a regular basis or are you you know it's your business growing this idea building this brand business this is something i think about because i i definitely am like a how can i get better at my craft of podcast and call it and it's you're good oh thank you i appreciate it really good i want to get better like i want to get so much better you know and but it's hard because i think i i've compared it to sports or thinking about sports i was never a great athlete but like where maybe of coaches or even art or violin or something where it's very clear like here are your scales you know it hit 10 things off the tee box whatever and it doesn't translate perfectly into being a ceo like i'm just going to do these six reps do you think about that how do you think about practice and getting better in a business sense being intense like you are versus the way you can do it in a in a sport say or in a great that's a great great observation i don't know if i've mastered that yet and that's the reason why i work at the rate i do and i don't think the work the rate i go is healthy i'm not going to say it is and this is something i aspire to always work at this rate it's just i don't i haven't figured out the right way to measure metrics of my success yet um and so i'm constantly feeling that i have to do something at all hours of the day or every minute or any time i'm chilling it's like i should be doing this so i don't know if i've mastered that yet in terms of be able to measure metrics to go to the next thing you know i i think it's such a it's a tough position because it requires doing things that like haven't been done before so you don't have something to look back on um in in reference um but i can look back on some of the creative stuff we've done and say yeah we've definitely gotten better creatively but uh it's hard to look back on and say business-wise what how we measure those metrics i heard you say in another interview that you work like you were working like seven days a week i think the interview you gave you'd taken like your first day off in a long time sounds like that's still true you still are sort of that person do you worry about burnout i think it's something that you hear a lot about in web 3 people burning themselves out we just hit a bear market you might see some people burn out in the bear market like how do you think about about that um because i absolutely love what i do like this is a hobby this is like a hobby you know when you go do something and my wife's always like you should go golf or go do something but like i wake up and this is what i enjoy doing like i wake up and i enjoy you know doing the things that i'm doing do i worry about a burnout i do obviously i don't worry about burnout because it's something that i'm hyper obsessed with um but i do i do always want to i always want to get better at scaling and scaling teams and delegating um and and building a better organization uh that doesn't require me to always have to because i don't think it's also beneficial for any company to be reliant on any any human being right it should be uh different kind of commanders in different tents you know and so that's something that i'm actually focused on you know readily right now is scaling out the organization so that um if i do if i want to focus on something creative i can i can focus on creative for a couple days or a couple weeks if i want to focus on just the film i can just focus on just the film you know how many people so you said it was two the first aku drop happens and it's you and dirk how many people are in the organization now um so it kind of depends because it scales up and down when needed so we can get into like our creative but like the creative's always going to be the most most robust part of the ecosystem because for the occupators for example when we scaled up to 40-something that was because of there were so many different roles and so many different things to be done but then it can scale back down when it's at dead time and then so um 15 maybe right now 15. wow 15. one of the things that i'm also like how i'm structuring kind of like the things we do and how we move in from a business perspective is i believe in the past you had like have proprietary technology or software to have a to build enterprise value right but i what i'm fascinated about is how we can build real value and drive value back by leveraging things that exist already so for example uh the technology you know we use unreal engine that exists already with epic so we build a great relationship with epic uh when we do it uh irl events we have an incredible partner that's also fit very deep into unreal engine and so they can spear ahead and work with our team on creative and whole event side pr team and marketing team and brand team everybody's kind of interlaced they all got their own thing you know what i mean and i think that's what's fascinating about the way we could do things is it doesn't require scaling teams and spending all this time scaling you know internally except leveraging things that exist in this ecosystem sort of a modularity in building you know what i mean that's awesome yeah that's really cool well so you now brought up unreal engine twice so i'm i'm gonna ask you because i in a recent interview i was asking a team about unreal engine i keep hearing about it it's it's very clear this is gonna be an important piece at least for the early days of the metaverse you know until a better piece of tech comes around why why did you build a guitar maybe give people a little context you would aku you then just released akutars that was built with unreal engine why did you go that route why is it important so for us um we had this big meeting today about this but so for us linear content and storytelling um is just something we're passionate about so you think about film you think about tv uh that's something that's important to breach the masses i don't believe the masses will be reached without that i truly don't i think um that's our end of our road map right but how we get there is being smart and resourceful from the assets that we build and so what unreal engine allows us to do is to prototype um and scale virtual worlds and assets that are reusable across the different verticals that we play in so if you look at what we did in miami at art basel there was a 30 000 square foot interactive exhibit built in unreal those assets were used in the chapters then those could be used in future content or virtual worlds and so it's more about scalability across uh different verticals in our ecosystem versus in the past you know us building maybe a irl exhibit or an immersive experience you build something for that then you have to go build something again for a tv series and then again for the film and then for a game it allows us to build quicker and ship prototypes and iterate in real time and the word that's coming to mind for me as you're saying that interoperability which we hear a lot about you know we talk about meta versus like interoperability like you know this character becomes interoperable from from a back end perspective y'all can take him and and and plug him into different places not just us though not just us it's going to be yes go say what you're about to say not just it's not we didn't we didn't design these it's very important for people to understand interoperability interoperability between platforms and i'm not the most technical when it comes to this but i do have some very smart people around and just trying to learn and educate myself around it interoperability between platforms is just not a thing sandbox has a different visual language than fortnite has a different visual language than call of duty etc etc so you need to build them for your world right you need to build them for your world but not in the not so distant future a lot of these things are being built in unreal engine should in theory be interoperable if you use the right use cases so when we built the occupators we built them in unreal um and rigged them in unreal and we utilized we have our own skeleton we use for animations and thing of that but now we re-rigged the skeleton a meta-human skeleton that you could anybody would be able to use and drag and drop animations and do sequencing in unreal and so that's what we're building out because when i say not every like the goal is for everybody to be able to use their aquatars and tell their own stories using their aquitars similar to how we can and and that's where this is headed is when you give people the tool sets in the toolbox to build environments and create and shoot inside these worlds and these environments that they're watching in the movie or watching in a tv series that's what that's where this is headed you're you've met with and we're really gonna dive i think into the the film and the the tv and as much as you can you're willing to share about how you're building out linear content with akutars i said this to you earlier but as a quick side note i think it's hilarious like i feel like i discovered you late i think a lot of the nft community was sort of late to discovering you given how long you've been building but it's hilarious to me because i'm like all these nft projects out there that have you know maybe had more attention or more hype or whatever all are like the holy grail is i wanna you know i wanna be ip i wanna have movies i wanna have tv and secretly you've been over here all along literally you're building you know you've got a deal you're making a movie you're making tv so i i want to dive into all that but you know you've spent time now in hollywood in la talking to major major players in that space um what is their reaction to nfts as you've seen it and then i want to ask you a question about like is there a paradigm shift happening in hollywood do you think because of nfts and this kind of content um what is there they just want to tell good stories they don't care what form it comes in they just they want to tell good stories they don't care they don't care how much uh nft the floor of nft project is that's the most important piece of information is nobody knows or cares the full price of aquatars when it comes to what we were doing with what we want to do with epic or what we want to do in film or tv it's the ip is so strong and the story is so strong that it needs to be told and so at the core of it is its creativity is reigns supreme strong i.p that the world cares about and needs is what reigns supreme and so do they are they interested in ft's i think they're interested in the terms of the way of of building a collective audience around ip and building or consumers that are orchestrating around this token right that can help evangelize the ip um but it's very important to note they don't need nfts like they don't need nfts these are billion dollar companies multi-million dollar companies i need nfts right like how am i going to have leverage in these conversations they don't need that you know pixar doesn't need nfts fortnite doesn't need enough to use like they don't it's their businesses that already exist and are very successful so when i think about everything that we do it's all about story because then then i can have a conversation with the epics and talk to them about why it's important that aku is ip that is being built in unreal or these studios about why this story or raqiri who who carries the one of the best in the world at what she does doesn't just need to do anything doesn't do any doesn't do anything but i can have a conversation with her about story and it's it really intrigues her enough that like i want to devote a lot of time to this you know and i think um i just think that movies and movies and tv aren't for everybody aren't for every project i think there's can be wildly successful brands while they're successful games it's not the holy grail i just think that it's uh for us that is like for us it is making a great film and doing that way but there's so many other ways to do it let me get your reaction to something that i i i have mentioned a little bit on the on the podcast but i want to probe more um i have a friend he's also been on the show a couple times john rogers he worked at lucasfilm he worked at disney for many years he was like they had a franchise working with pirates the caribbean you know what is a 10-year timeline for this pro you know those kind of things um and he has this concept of i think he calls it an architectural innovation and the idea is you've had these essentially paradigm shifts that have happened through the life cycles of hollywood that can mean like a shift in consumer behavior or maybe tapping into a particular kind of consumer behavior that means the the the company reorganizes the way they do business so one of the examples would be the summer blockbuster which i think was like a 1970s 1980s thing suddenly these hollywood studios realized they could make more money by putting a lot of eggs in like two big blockbuster summer hits rather than scattering their resources across like films coming out throughout the whole year and that totally shifted the way that uh the business of hollywood was run and the the studios that tapped into that sooner and realized that sooner did better and there's he's got a couple examples like that so his hypothesis is that nfts are are just such a frontier that there will that the way the world is changing to be interconnected where you go from watching the movie to now playing the game to living in that world in some other context is a total shift that for epic games or you know pixar doesn't need right now but there are going to be a couple players who are going to recognize that early shift their business models around it and they're going to win you're smiling so i think you agree with this and you're not in your reaction a thousand percent a thousand percent it's always on ecosystem and everything you need for that ecosystem is in a wallet that's the future of this that's the future of it if you want to go see a movie it's in your wallet if you want to buy some merch it's in your wallet if you want to buy the same merch in the virtual virtual world it's in your wallet it's an always-on ecosystem that is held together with a wallet and and that's really is really on the most basic of fundamentals of levels uh what this is and now you think about how do nfts play into this now right how do ocutars play into this ecosystem because you get that i get that a lot it's like great kiri's announced the film takes a while game takes a while like what do i get now for owning akutar the most important piece of this is when you have an always-on ecosystem that is held together by a wallet the possibilities are endless at the levels of tiers and levels of privilege and access that you can give people because if you can know what every single consumer has always bought or how they've engaged with your ip forever then you can create opportunities and access and privileges and rewards and all this kind of things um pretty easily you know and so that's what that's how i want people to think about when they hear us talk about these long-term visions but how does that play into it and what do these pieces mean now well there's going to be things you can do now but in the future like the system we're building is always on ecosystem is connected by by a wallet you i heard you in another interview again say something that like totally blew my mind and you were like and and i don't this is i think from a little while back so you can tell me if this vision has changed at all but it was like this big hairy audacious goal i'd call it right which is like build the aku community big enough so that you could distribute an aku film directly to the community the token holders is that still the dream and then i really want to dive into what that looks like and means yeah i mean so so i think that it was really fascinating about distribution right and why do why do i why am i out here championing unreal and epic and what they're doing and there's others out there doing is just they have an audience built in audience base right they have you can bring you know powerful ip into that ecosystem right and and reach audience and then you just do these things and build your audience and consumer base and intelligently uh around wallets you know around a call to action to maybe join a wallet create a wallet boom that when it's time for a film you can go to an amc you go directly to theaters and say because i believe in theaters like whatever that's a personal thing i it's i love going to a movie theater and i think that's the thing and say look we have this many people who are part of our ecosystem like we've developed this like internally like do you want to distribute this we're going like we have this many audience you distribute these movie tickets as as nfts now and so you go to the first weekend and it's a banger like it's like you can't miss this movie and now the only way you're going to go see this is because you have the nft i think this is cool i don't know if that's like it'll play out this way but it's just something i think about a lot is if you have three million people that own a movie ticket but now there's a mark secondary market for it and it's the hottest thing out there like now you put the power in the consumers to tell you you know if i want to see it or not i think it's interesting i think there's a major risk on on film when you think about a lot of the the money comes from the first weekend there's so much emphasis on the first weekend well if there's a uh uh uh a snowstorm on the east coast and the first weekend sucks like you can't control that but how do you mitigate that well you have these nfts that act as movie tickets and now they can go see it whatever now there's a secondary market for them that's what i think about wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into the multi-chain universe ahead of us available on flow tazos polygon and of course ethereum wearable is the perfect place for nft newcomers profile picture collectors and experienced nft traders wearable has a variety of nft features that set it apart from other nfc marketplaces they have a native messaging function allowing you to dm your friends or haggle with

download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 yeah i i think it's so interesting so i want to separate out the theater piece for a second because i do want to dive into like distribution make getting a movie made in the traditional world which you're an interesting person to talk about because you're it's hard well you're learning it firsthand and i'm excited to kind of hear what what that's like through your eyes um but even separating out the theater piece the thing that struck me is so interesting here is you know you if you give all your community holders an nft or no if you're all your community holders you're nft holders right and then you say great this nft gives you access to watch this movie and you've got i think you know a million copies of the movie and a million holders like you're talking about something on that scale right um it is really cool to think about and i think the theater piece does make it more complicated but it probably can be working around cool now there's only a million copies that film to watch it you have to buy an nft from another holder and the thing there is not that that's sustainable for the first people to buy the tickets to make a bunch of money it's more that they could sell it you know there'll be a price that it's worth maybe it's 15 bucks and then i'll have been able to watch it for free because maybe i paid 15 bucks to watch the movie now i can sell it to the next person for 15 bucks so it's a way for me to get free content but then the royalties you know like or or not maybe not free but subsidized content if i sell for 15 bucks i bought it for 15 bucks i make eight bucks on it i've now been able to watch it for seven bucks cheaper whatever it is but now you as the artists are still getting money on it so like i can have a more cost affordable experience as an audience member and you as the creator can still be rewarded like that's fascinating i never thought about that is that like that the piece that gets you excited is it like just like wow that's such a difficult yeah yeah it's all just some wild stuff okay here's my understanding of how like a hollywood like movie works which is a bunch of financiers come in and like cool sure we'll give you money executive producers whatever we'll give you money for this film you go make that movie with like a studio who i believe probably owns the ip rights for the thing maybe all right you're gonna correct me and then when the movie's made you either like sell it direct to a streamer who then like owns the publishing rights to it or you sell it to distributors who like distribute it theatrically you know all around the world and then maybe a streamer then also still comes in later to buy it after is that like a correct overview summary correct pieces of that and then let's talk about yeah is that the process you've gone through with aku like how did the no no not therefore all right not that far out not far out we we so we're developing independently um we have an uh we develop independently and what that means is i look at it like two phases of development i'm not a hollywood expert never made a movie before don't know what it's like to make a movie uh which i think it's so cool to get your perspective on this like you know like yeah you're like all about like none of us have made you know we're like how do you do that no uh you know we did the deal initially with anonymous content and permanent content it was great they're great partners halfway through it though i realized that look this isn't the end of the road that i believe this our potential could be the end of the road and eventually if we do go down this road i'm gonna have to you know sell the ip and i won't have control over this ip and no longer be able to drive value back to the thing i care about most and that's my community and so but that deal expired and that's when kyrie and steven came in and and developed it internally and what that development phase looks like is story outline you pick out a test scene you this is how our process works i can't speak from any other movie so i'm so excited this is fascinating so we sat down for hours days developing a story outline come back no that's not working that's not working and there's still stuff in there right now that's not working right develop this outline from that outline now we take a a test scene we say let's do this one let's let's go give this to the creative team what's the visual language look like this is where unreal is nice because we can prototype and iterate in real time uh i think unreal could eventually produce a feature-length film inside unreal but right now it serves the purpose of of test scenes um and getting the visual language the style you know all that down and then from there you know just congruently or at this uh a little bit after we start going to script development and you know script and then boom uh then it goes to the main thing make the thing you know um and at that point that's when you you have those conversations around financing uh but up to this point uh uh i'm paying for it you're still finding it wow so let let me just get specific here you said you said you did a deal with anonymous content which is a you know a big deal great big names behind it all when you say you did a deal what does that mean you optioned it to them is that right that's right they had basically what that means is they have an option to be able to um develop this um and uh what we're doing now what we're doing now and and then they would run that process of everything you're doing fund it yep and then and then take it to a studio to uh develop it and make it but you realize if you walked down that path at some point the ip would no longer be yours it would be would it be anonymous content would it be the studios yeah that's right it would be something around the studios um and that's really how it how it shakes down um we'll cross the bridge when you get there on how you want to finance this thing i'm very i bet on myself i always will and i bet on i always will bet on kiri and steven uh and the team we got over here on the animation side that you know it's a it's a film now i mean it's we we've been reviewing the outline this week and it's like and this is good like this isn't this is no like this is this is unique and it's really good so we just been on that and and bet on the fact that someone's gonna want to show this do you have like can you give any insight like in into i guess there's i have sort of two competing questions here one is my guess having listened now to interviews with you and read a bunch about you and stuff and feeling like i have a certain sense of you is like part of the maintaining the ip is it's really sort of so also the holders can maintain the ip we'll talk about commercial rights my understanding is that we don't actually have rights over the akus or akutars the way you do with a board ape ecosystem but you are obviously incredibly community oriented so by you maintaining control of the ip that allows you to figure out how to how to incorporate the community do i have that right can you speak a little bit about how you think about that yeah um that's that's it it's so that we can evolve over time like everybody wants to see a road map right everyone's a road map and the one thing i hate about road maps it does not allow for innovation and five months from now i might come up with something or learn something that we could do that boom is going to really ignite this thing you know or in three months or two months something might just boom like that that makes sense let's do this romance constrict you to certain things that you have to execute on that are just kind of like uh set in like time that now i can't predict what this world or the technology's gonna allow us to do in a year but you know so so i don't like that um but but i do like rewarding the community like i always say uh like i could have gone and done the movie route right after the chapters and kicked my feet up hey the chapters are going to be the chapters because you know like it's tied to the aku's story it's like comic books and kicked my feet up and made the movie and been this thing right but we didn't do that like like we said no like we're going to bring this back we're going to do the hardest thing we could possibly do develop it independently and we're doing that because we want to drive value back to the community like pure blank simple i'm gonna have to make sacrifices my family make sacrifices so like whenever somebody says like you know whenever i saw this stuff afterwards like this team like how can you build and rebuild or are you how how focused or dedicated you are it's like dude we had him we had the path like with an incredible ip could have just been chilling it will catch you in three years when the film comes out we said no like we're gonna do that and so when i think about that it's it's because i just want to be able to innovate and integrate the community and all the value drip driving opportunities that we can create back to them pure and simple and around commercial rights um right now yeah like we contain commercial rights over occupants that's not to say in the future that those don't uh unravel and give them to the community i just think it needs to be done thoughtfully when you're dealing with an ip at this stage it needs to be done in a way that uh isn't just free-for-all there needs to be really thoughtful conversations and with the community as well around different different ways that you can see these being utilized i think actually commercial rights around aquitars would be massively powerful it'd be some of the first fully 3d rigged highly visceral characters that people can create stories around even if it just was to make a fun nft with their family uh i think that's about that's that's really crazy especially with the tools that we can deliver them that makes it simple i really like that answer because you know i've said i i think you're gonna have to see really interesting and successful ip come out of this you know the nft world with a whole range of rights attached to them like i think you've got the gary vee model on one end which is sort of where you fall right where he he retains a lot of that control and i'm like very okay with that because he has a vision you are somebody with a vision like i'd rather you you guys go make this character valuable because i trust you as the driver of this and i trust your vision and like that's really valuable to me and then there are other projects and you've got obviously board apes and world of women and really cool things where i think there's tons of potential for really cool stuff to come out of um you know the community owning in and and then there's cco projects that are totally in the creative commons i think there's cool stuff that can come out of that but it's understanding what you're what bet you're making in each scenario and in a case like this where this character is so personal to you the story is so personal to you like i'd rather just have you go drive it and create the value and i'll sit here as a holder and like enjoy the community like i think that's but but i think being thoughtful and there's probably individual places where you can share it out that's great you know and lucasfilm i mean they were very very protective over their ip for a long time and i think over time kind of had to relent to like okay there's fan fiction this is actually good for us let's let's loosen our ideas around this a little bit so yeah i'm actually a big fan of of of all of it of of creative giving creative control of freedom to the community i actually am because it it it's exciting to see people tap into creativity uh it it unburdens us from having to constantly produce creative content that it keeps them engaged and i'm not against it i just think i think you know it has to be thoughtful and i think the tooling has to be there to make it uh something that you know there is quality control over things as well you don't just want a bunch of bad things with with your brand floating around there's quality control yes i think there's there's such a distinction to be made between letting fans go and create again things along the lines of almost fan fiction or things that they love and monetizing that up to a certain point there's something very different between that and then losing control of your brand's identity because you have a ton of people making a ton of different storylines a ton of different projects and losing the the core of what makes aku so special which is this like this feeling that it has that is clearly sort of something you've is you you know let me ask you a question though let me ask you let me ask your opinion on something do you think that aku do you look at aku differently than you look at akutars well that's really interesting so it depends on what context you're saying i was actually going to say i've had this this thing for a little while where i felt like aku's were so obviously undervalued because the akutars were getting bit up you know looking at like three and a half eighth and you had these aku sitting there like point four eighth and i'm like man these are the these these ten chapters the originals like you've been really upfront being like hey i will always reward my original holders i'm like this is the obvious play like they're so undervalued compared to the aku dars that's not what you're asking i don't think but i am curious to get your reaction to that um no i i think of them i guess i think of the aku's as like collectible items and the akutars maybe is more playable characters so so in that standpoint i think of them a little bit differently but i i think of them both as just doing well as the aku world and the character of aku grows in prominence one thing i actually do think about it real time is aku the ip aku the kid that we all come and know and the aku tars which are so v vastly different and have distinct real personalities to them i think about them differently and sometimes more recently uh as one you know explain that explain that for folks well i think like aku right when we build out the film it's not going to be it's going to be geared towards families right the ecosystem that they play in will look maybe differently than you're gonna have two and a half year olds and three-year-olds in the theaters right uh we're also making it super dope so you're gonna have all kind of like this it's a cultural moment i look at it like but um but then you have the occupators that have a lot of distinct personalities and styles and like ability to create backstories with those um and i actually like today i would say i see them as like independent in a way sure akutars will always always be attached to aku themselves right but i also see us being able to do things with akutars that we couldn't really do with aku the brand and i also see things that we could do with aqua the brand that necessarily don't make sense within the akutar ecosystem aquitar ecosystem is you know i look at it as like the core base of adults who have like real uh stake in the thing that they are watching be built aku is what my daughter and my nephews and you know families will enjoy and recognize for years and years to come hopefully and so i often think about if we did what if we did give commercial rights to our guitars would it really hurt if so you know the brand of aku if aku is really this thing over here and akutars are here playing in this world think about it i think about it a lot yeah i mean i think that's the those are kind of thoughts that should be going into this stuff you know like i think it is a really serious decision to make is like how can you make sure you don't dilute a central brand while still allowing people to so you know optimizing people's creativity and the community for what it is do you follow the deadheads project at all i ref i've written ref i've interviewed them but i've also referenced them on the show a couple times because i think they've done some really interesting things they're an animation studio they're creating a show uh based on these characters deadheads they're like zombies and they you own your individual character but if you go and make something unique with it you can't use the deadhead's name and then what they have is basically like it's sort of like staking where you can stake your character into a casting pool and then they'll cast your character you know into if they pick your character and cast it in the show that's a way they can get around like sec stuff to like provide you with royalties and whatever because they've now cast your character in in their series so that's a really interesting like fun way that i you know creative way i see people playing with characters in ip yeah i got some ideas around that how if we if we wanted to pull this lever here i do have some ideas on how to make sure that it stays in bounds and respectful and things like that i i i like that you know whatever like at the end of the day i like that  like i like i like the stuff to you know seeing uh people come up with the board apes and i i like what you know seeing like the pixel vaults and i i envy some of the stuff that they're able to do uh and i'm a fan really a fan well i think there's some really cool things you can do because you already do have the relationships with hollywood and you are you have some of these really like the akka movie comes out it's a big success like you you sort of plant a flag around what aku is and what it stands for and you let that build itself up first before you start deluding it then you know somebody in the community does have this amazing backstory they've created for their akutar and now like that does get incorporated into like the netflix series now that comes out like that's the kind of future that's so amazing when you think about you know community and you know content creation well you know the thing about what we're kind of the way i'm trying to move is not so dependent on streaming platforms like you said i love this maybe maybe it'll be on the netflix it doesn't need to be on netflix to reach the mass audience people on tick tock got more viewers and more followers than shows get on netflix people on youtube got more views and followers and shows get on netflix there's no knock on netflix i think it'd be great to have aquaman netflix it's just i think there's other things that you could do to distribute content than just looking at streaming platforms that don't don't require any kind of deal or negotiation you know if you're thinking linear content like i think of linear like tv and film maybe that's to narrow a view of it yeah where when i when my daughter wants to watch tv she cuts on youtube you know my nephew's gonna watch they cut on youtube you know um i think there's ways when i think there's ways for communities if we didn't want to say okay everybody has you know the ability to create content here are the tools here's your 3d rig here's your skeleton here's your sub you know base animations to make content there's distribution out there we're building worlds and environments that are are can be used in content should be used in content will be used in content the distribution is not going to be an issue when you have a hyper visceral community that wants to see the next the dopest content with that with the characters that they own distribution's gonna be wherever that community goes yeah you know you're this your doodles who i really respect as a project tremendously poopy said the same thing to me i i like did the same exact thing i was like netflix and he was like whoa whoa whoa i'm not just thinking about netflix i don't know if i care about no and so it's really interesting to hear both of you who i think are some of the savviest people out there and the way you're thinking about this both of you said that now so um you know as if netflix needed any more hit to its uh brand and stock things it's just that it's just that when i think about board apes i don't know how many followers they got i don't know anything about the community all i know is when somebody famous or somebody does something they tweets about them is pandemonium when the board says something it's pandemonium how many times you see the board ace founders saying something the community says it for them and so if you think about you build a community that visceral and that like hyper-engaged they're gonna go to whatever platform they go they want to go to to see their these acatars or these you know characters come to life it's gonna be it's gonna be it's pandemonium especially when they're like real good quality you know it's not just some rinky dink thing it's these are designed by the same guy that emmy award winner they're lit by the same guy that lit jurassic world and ready player one it's like they're created by all these amazing people and now you get to go enjoy them and create content with them i don't know i'm saying i'm interested in it totally all right and i know there's probably a couple years but you've given us a sense of where you are right now you're in this development process thinking through storylines starting to do some test scenes how long does this take and and you got both the movie process and then i know you you're talking gaming like i know you've got to hold things you're building out we're talking a couple years we a few years what's your what's your timeline estimate you want the road map probably gonna hit me with the roadmap i didn't use the word i hear you know i knew it was triggering so and i didn't use the word roadmap no it's it's not it's not as it's not what people think it is that we're really building is everything we're building is building towards a film okay everything we're building is also building towards the series that will be before the film and so when we think about these environments and you need scenes and i think about environments think about if you want to make a scene in aku's city you're going to need to make the city and animate in a 3d version of it that's an asset that could be used in virtual world oh that's so cool and then like yeah you can kind of easter egg this stuff out to the community you know all day long and then and then you you just do things very methodically you have to know what the series is you have to know you have to have a story bible to understand what the story is so that you don't aren't making things harder for yourself down the line once you have that then you can do this then you can run this play of building out environments that are interactive and then all of a sudden the world starts looking like this and like this and like this and then it's like damn like that was the word i was just playing this whole time and we could ship updates over time constant updates i don't think the tech's there yet from the ability to create uh these immersive experiences and unreal like our immersive experience that i'm talking about whether you're going to really have these real-time rendering you're playing with guitars might be a couple months might be six months maybe eight months right it might be 12 months until there's a series but there stays out there right now that we can deliver and ship to people that uh are engaging but then when the lights turn on to this space trade boom i got you like you want to come here to your spot here's your spot because i also don't believe in in high priced in-game assets and these i believe in accessibility of micro transactions uh that's this what i believe and so when it comes to this like i i just don't want to you know take advantage of people and just and we build this this is like here you go man just go have fun yeah two final questions one's a little bit of a pivot just the the on the athlete front you know you were sort of talking about this leaving professional sports trying to figure out what you were going to do next i think this is a story you hear commonly from athletes even athletes sometimes who've done incredibly well and made a lot of money you know and then you hear the story where a decade later you know they're hurting from cat they're cash strapped or whatever do you think there's a place for nfts you know for for current athletes now you see a lot of athletes getting into the space ways they can leverage building up their community with nfts things that can help position them for post-athlete lives or transitioning i think it's hard right now because of the nature of the industry is so demanding and it needs something at all times that i think it's distracting for an athlete to build its own community and own basically start their own project because they're always going to be hit with when announcement when product win when utility when utility and and there's going to be so much pressure on them to keep the floor price up i suggest to athletes and friends and influential people to always look for communities to join and integrate into because it's much better to add value to the thing that's already cooking than to try to launch your own that you're responsible for all day every day awesome okay final question my understanding is your nephew asked can astronauts be black that was the inspiration behind aku is that right yeah sort of my paintings first though okay oh your but your paintings were inspired from hearing your nephew ask that right how's your nephew today what do you think of aku give us the the update on that story he uh he's really fun um has no idea that i'm behind any of it or anything but he always comes over and he loves to watch it like he doesn't know you're behind it and then loves the character yeah yeah yeah yeah he just wants to see he thinks it's just it's always on how old is he six six that's the best that's the best thing for me you see a lot of times in interviews i don't reference him like i say a young boy but i don't want him to ever recognize that i think it would be really special for him to enjoy this as a kid uh this character and just be inspired by the character independent of yeah you know he just loves it he really does like he loves it yeah are you going to tell him some day that you're like behind him you know yeah he'll figure it out at some point yeah he'll figure it out at some point my hope i don't i just want him to enjoy it just if you go look back on super rare look back on super
