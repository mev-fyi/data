the millennial pause is this very brief moment right when they hit the record button and they wait for it to start recording and then they take a breath and say hey guys it's me I'm on this Tick Tock video Blah Blah Blah we got Taylor Swift doing the millennial podcast hey guys it's Taylor it's that pause it's just a hesitation the Gen Z's got the Gen Z shape when they hit record they put their phone down and they continue to talk to the camera okay so this is the Gen Z Shake that's not the Gen Z Shake which is what I just did in the air I mean that was very exaggerating she's doing it on purpose but yeah Millennials watch this camera technology go from to good when we hit record previously you would wait for the recording to start yeah now if with modern iPhones it's instantaneous but we still wait I just think it's so cool how like both hardware and software that improves over time impacts the people that use it
