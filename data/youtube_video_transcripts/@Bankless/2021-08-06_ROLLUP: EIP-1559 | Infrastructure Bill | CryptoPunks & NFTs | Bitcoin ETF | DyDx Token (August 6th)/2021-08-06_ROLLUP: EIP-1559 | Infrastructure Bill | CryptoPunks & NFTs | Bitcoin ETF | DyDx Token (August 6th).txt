[Music] hey bankless nation happy friday to you it is the first week of august david it's rollup time this is the eip 1559 edition 1559 1559 however you say it it is the day that we have deployed eip1559 actually we we will have deployed it one day after you guys are listening to this david that's pretty exciting dude i'm i'm pumped there is so much to talk about and so i'm going to try and refrain from talking about it right now but it is has been a long time coming and the fact that eip1559 is here and we have things to talk about that it's actually live is just absolutely stellar and i'm really stoked to get into the weekly roll up this week okay yeah do not drink a swig of coffee every time you hear eip 1559 or you will be coffee drunk by the end of this episode before we get into the show we gotta talk about pool together because it is summertime and it's all time to get into the pool if you don't know pool together it is a no loss lottery which means you put your stable coins your comp tokens whatever tokens that pull together accepts into a pool and then you have a chance to win the accrued interest that accrues weekly from everyone's collective funds so you don't lose your principal you might lose your opportunity cost of money but you also might win everyone else's interest as well it's a fun no loss lottery on ethereum every single week roughly fifty to sixty thousand dollars gets awarded in uscc and that is just the usdc pool there is usually a drawing every single day of the week they have also recently deployed their polygon implementation where you can deposit tusd tether into the polygon pool together pool together pool and they are also rolling out their l2s coming soon in the future so check them out there's a link in the show notes so you can have fun in the pool that's a lot of pool time guys this is if if you haven't yet tried many defy apps this is one that you try and tell your friends super easy to use and you can't lose it's a lot of you can't lose so check that out guys all right david you ready to get into bitcoin markets my friend yeah let's do it bitcoin is down on the week starting at the high prices of roughly 42 000 touched the low price of just below 38 000 to where we are currently at right now at thirty nine thousand three hundred dollars for one bitcoin all right let's talk about eath price eath price doing a little bit of the opposite started right around two thousand five hundred dollars on the week and that was roughly about the low uh and it is currently at the high price of roughly 2 800 feels like it's pumping on the news of eip1559 finally going live which is always kind of funny to me because there's no way you've been able to pay attention to a theory without understanding eip1559 we talk about it all the time and now it's live and now people are buying it's like yeah why did you wait so long like people people who just bought eip we bought eth after eip1559 like why right they wait do you think there's some like worry that maybe it wouldn't ship maybe the hard fork wouldn't go right i have no clue man but uh i mean i know i wasn't waiting so we we we knew this was coming guys we also know the merge is coming on the horizon too so that'll be another catalyst in the future uh we'll get to a bit more of that later but let's review some more metrics so each bitcoin ratio how's the eth ratio doing yeah listeners will remember last week that we talked about how there was a descending wedge if you want to use again trader terminology which i'm not very good at using trader terminology but i'm gonna do it anyways there was a descending wedge that ether looked like it broke out of versus bitcoin and turns out that that continuation just happened even further this week ether is above .07 each per btc at the price of a .0712 looking really really strong and there's a lot of traders that i know a lot of people that are looking at the east btc ratio looking like oh man it just looks like it's going to resume going higher versus bitcoin back to the highs of maybe point one eth btc just speculation here but uh eth btc looking really strong as you would expect during eip1559 week yeah also not surprising given these head tailwinds right these eth catalysts let's talk about total value locked in d5 that is also up on the week i remember hanging in the 50 to 60 billion range now we're at 70 billion yeah uh that is the theme of markets this week at least on the ethereum side of things is up it's really nice to see that seven number leading a total locked value back in d5 i remember i think the the peak that we set back in may was just around 90 billion locked in d5 we are back up to 70 billion locked in d5 all right let's take a look at the dpis this is the d5 pulse index this tracks some of the top uh d5 tokens in crypto to give you a sense of that we are up on the week as well david 18 on the week 18 green for dpi at the price of 360 dollars which is the local high for the week so congratulations to dpi holders okay well it seems to be east season over bitcoin season that's what that ratio is telling us but is it defy season david what are we looking at oh we're are we below your amount we're we're below your number yeah i mean no horseshoes hand grenades like we're around my number we are currently at point one two eight uh dpi ratio uh which means that it is eighth season not necessarily defy season i'm okay with that give defy a breather for a bit okay let's talk about the bed index so the bed index of course composes all of these assets together you get one-third bitcoin one-third each one-third dpi all-in-one token that you have to hold that is up on the week because all three of those assets are up on the week where are we right now uh we are up ten percent on the week started uh dp excuse me bed started at a hundred and thirteen dollars and we are currently at 130 so that is the summary of the crypto markets at large up 10 on the week again the bet index the best defy crypto index that there ever will be i'm pretty sure tell your friends guys easiest way to get exposure to crypto at least the premium assets the least assets you want to be part of on the bankless journey uh david let's talk man eip what do you want to talk about ryan i look we have something to talk about i know you flew all the way to san diego last night but you woke up early in the morning to be available for this it was like what five o'clock your time yeah woke up woke up at 4 30 because eric connor and anthony suzanne were like why isn't the zoom up yet i'm like hi it's an hour before the fork i guess they were really excited to get the livestream up and running yeah kids in front of the christmas tree just like waiting for santa to come down the chimney i mean they were really excited about this but we're excited too so uh eip 1559 got deployed today as part of the london hard fork for ethereum this is a massive event there are a slew of other feature updates in that but eip1559 was the one we've all been waiting for that means a number of things but one thing it definitely means is we are burning eath effective 8 30 or so at eastern time this morning we have started burning eath and we will continue to burn eath until maybe the end of the ethereum network like this is going to uh last into the the future upgrades and it's going to be it has become a core part of the protocol and david there are so many like dashboards where you can see eve getting burnt in real time that i've become addicted to these things so like here's one etherchain.org slash burn we could see look man eight almost 800 eth burnt and we are only like four and a half hours into this eight hundred eighth in four and a half hours burnt gone and remind folks why is eath getting burnt and people are asking the question like uh that seems weird why are you burning eat are you like wasting it like why is this a good thing why are you so excited about burning money yeah so so here is like a kind of a 400 level uh bankless content take is that if you listen to our podcast with vitalik buterin on legitimacy the same reason why bitcoin has a shelling point of zero issuance and a hard cap is the same reason why we burn eth it is just the best default option because if we didn't burn eth then we would have to figure out where we should send it to who gets it who gets it and that is a very heavy political decision that bestows a king maker like that's a king maker decision like who gets the eth and so instead of just like deciding who should get all of this eat which is a ton of money we're like 3 billion or three million dollars every like four hours or so it's just easiest to say that no one gets it and everyone gets it or everyone gets it right because if no one gets it then everyone gets it right and everyone i mean like eath holders which is one of the benefits of holding eath so eip1559 changes the way that we allocate each when you pay for a transaction you used to pay for a transaction and that money used to go to miners and now instead because we have decided that eip1559 is a stronger security mechanism and an overall ux upgrade for ethereum we've decided that the best thing that we should do is we should burn that eth and not give it to anyone and if you want to dive deeper into the subject definitely listen to our podcast with hazu eip1559 and that will go into further depth as to why we burn eath and when you ryan you and i talked about this like multiple years ago we really just framed it in a conversation of the last puzzle piece the last really important component of ethereum's monetary policy it makes ethereum more secure it makes ether more valuable it's just overall a net beneficial change and now it's finally live in the time that i have been ranting we have burned nine more eth the the ticker just went up from 799 to 808 now it's at 810 that is a lot we burned 5 000 in the time that listeners listened to this remind me we got to check it again at the end of this episode or maybe continuously throughout the episode i know we will empty people every five minutes like there's so many places you can you can look at this burn rate uh this is probably my favorite david ultrasound.money go check this out like fantastic meme around this ultrasound money not only has uh the cumulative eath burn rate but also has a burn leader board right so we see like uh some of these nft platforms are burning the most eth right open c crazy nft is burning more ethan defy not not cumulatively but just has open seas burning more east than uniswap like cool i'm less mad about high gas fees from nfc launches now a lot less mad about that i might be okay with it you can also see it on of course your favorite block explorer like etherscan for example and this is cool because you can dig into the actual block david you're pulling it up here and you can see the block reward of course that is issuance but then you see the amount of eth burnt on this block which is super cool nice breakdown for you and there's so many new metrics in the block explorer now and this is uh kind of front running what i'm going to say later in the episode with what i'm excited about but there's new things to look at which means more things to talk about which makes me so excited more numbers more metrics more it's of course it's open and available to anyone i think micah put together a fantastic dashboard on dune analytics where you can see ethernet per block base fees over time all of this is open and available so check that out they'll be in the show notes and this is cool too david we just we had this morning our first deflationary ethereum block you might say our first ultrasound ultrasound ethereum block because while we issue just over two eth or so every block according to the protocol exactly two reasons exactly two eth that generally goes to minors um we burnt more than we issued in this particular block so like the amount burnt per block will fluctuate uh based on kind of the you know the formula algorithm that's set up in eip1559 this particular block i'm not going to say the number 12 million something you guys can look it up yourselves but there was a eth burnt of 2.078 and each block reward of course of two so the net is actually deflationary that block that's not to say ethereum as a whole is deflationary right now uh because it's not it's it seems like we're issuing like we're probably burning what would you say 25 or 30 percent of proof-of-work issuance i said that's about a good estimation uh i think there's a lot of like settling that needs to happen like we are still kind of in this uh period of a little bit of uh chaos because like miners still have to update like wallets still need to update they're shaking out yet yeah we're so we are still settling we are watching this play out in real time and that's going to be one of the fun things about the next week is seeing where things settle seeing how full blocks become seeing miners get on board seeing wallets get on board because something to talk about is that there's actually two transaction types now there's the legacy transaction types and then there's eip1559 transaction types both types burn eth but one is just a little bit better for the user one one's a little bit easier and so it's really up to wallets to update how they allow transactions to occur on ethereum and they should update to the eip1559 over time because that's beneficial to the users metamask is now updated my crypto is now updated so people are doing this pretty quickly but it's going to take at least a few days for everyone to get on board and synced up with eip1559 yeah absolutely and so so the net of that is ethereum is not net deflationary at this moment but it is uh more deflationary so we are burning a you know maybe 25 30 as david said this will take a while to pan out but post merge it's sure looking like things are going to be deflationary when that happens that merge we're referring to is when proof of work gets fully turned off that four percent or so issuance per year goes to zero that's going to happen and fly just buzz right um anyway you were talking about uh wallets so for the typical user right this is all backwards compatible so if you're using metamask and it has not updated then you can just send a transaction the way you always change no change it might be a bit more expensive relative to using the new transaction that david was mentioning but once metamask rolls out they've got a fantastic eip 1559 helper page to show you um how to set transaction priority it's actually i think it's going to be more intuitive and easier to use if you're if you're doing that second um transaction type the eip 1559 transaction have you made a transaction yet on ethereum ryan i haven't got it it's like this pseudo like speed update it actually feels faster just because like your transaction gets included into the next block by almost by by default so like it it's not faster but it feels like it is which is kind of actually the more important part yeah that's awesome and like gas fees aren't going down as a result right like this is not a improvement in probably in terms of gas fees there's some intricacies there that we don't have time to touch again listen to the hazu eip159 episode with bankless yeah absolutely but uh you noticed this david yeah and well you can actually see it twice you can see it on the lower right hand side of the screen as well eip1559 is straight up trending on twitter again like think about that for a second that's right ethereum improvement proposal to this random esoteric little known piece of like internet corner which is going to be larger in the future is trending on twitter eip1559 is on the front page of the internet that is absolutely crazy yeah that's really cool and such a yeah strange esoteric name like you are like what is eip 1559 but that's the question they should be asking right now uh david let's get this take from hayden adams yeah it's hayden tweets out it has been two hours since the launch of eip1559 and he tweeted this out a few hours ago uh and he says uniswap both v2 and v3 is doing its part burning 80 eth so far again these numbers are already outdated at this rate unit swap alone is burning 350 000 eth close to 1 billion dollars worth per year and then he says congratulations to everyone who made eip155 now it happened huge win for ethereum and great great tweak great piece of content but also what i want listeners to take uh and take note of is this is just uniswap just uniswap is burning 350 000 ether per year remember just a reminder there's roughly around 115 000 or 115 million ether total and just uniswap is burning a little bit over one third of a million ether per year that's just uniswap and so like imagine when there's just more applications imagine all the other applications imagine in the applications into the future imagine the killer apps that we haven't even thought about yet uh imagine when like completely trustless like composable oracles comes online and we can get any data from the world onto ethereum think about that because imagine how much ether we will be burning at that point in time it will be a large number i'm thinking about it you know what and this is absolutely a massive upgrade to ethereum's monetary policy and it's kind of the conclusion of a lot of work that a lot of people have been like put in at the time i i just want to give a special bankless shout out and thank you to all of the developers in the ethereum community coordinators uh you know even even some of the people who are sharing the gospel and and spreading the the news of this and garnering community support this community uh are the the people who made this happen and it's like hard to get work done in a way in a decentralized community it's also better easier in some other ways and the fact that the ethereum community pulled this off is uh is pretty phenomenal pretty exciting i mean this is a live network right like a 250 billion dollar network and this is a pretty major economic upgrade to it and it took like years of literally years of research to to come to this point and uh a ton of work went in so thanks to the community thanks to the devs that made this possible thanks to the researchers we did it we did it fam did it fam the ethereum upgraded the ip159 upgrade it feels like we are having this 250 billion dollar jet that we upgraded the engines on while in flight uh and so like that's kind of the degree of complication and that's also the degree of the skills of the developers that we have in this community so just like ryan said thank you for everyone who played a part in getting this out the door the world is literally better for it i will make that argument yeah that's super cool as by the time when the time we started talking about this let's see how much we burnt 55 more ether since the last time we brought it up in in conversation let's just keep on doing that every few minutes there you go there you go all right guys moving on from eip1559 which is hard to do so we're very excited about it we'll be back do this we'll be back 221 million crypto users all right that's how many crypto users we have this is according to a study put put out by crypto.com kind of charts crypto users uh over time the market size of course this these are all estimates no one could tell for sure not sure the exact um you know methodology they used for this but it feels ballpark it feels about right and that's an absolutely massive amount of crypto users now we say users that's super broad we're talking about anybody who has ever purchased a crypto asset this does not defy users these are not people who even necessarily know what they bought but these are people who have interacted with maybe purchased a crypto asset possibly done something more it's not just a fad 221 million that is starting to become critical mass this is moving from like early adopter uh like the very early stage adopters to kind of this this you know mid-stage mid-stage adopters range yeah 22 uh 221 million is not a low number this like you said this has got to be like the lowest threshold for what is considered a crypto user right so if you like bought 20 worth of bitcoin on coinbase and then and then you left it and didn't do anything you're a crypto user i'm guessing i would like to know more methodology about how crypt crypto.com came about these numbers um maybe maybe on the website they have more details the other important point to make out is that this is in june 2021 and in january 2021 just six months ago it was a hundred and six million users so we have more than doubled the entire like entire user base of this entire industry in just six months and so that kind of illustrates kind of how crypto moves in waves like it moves in it moves in step functions like like nothing will happen for two years and then all of a sudden it's an order of magnitude better more order of magnitude more users and ryan 221 million users that's a a lot of people that can go and make transactions on ethereum and burn e through eip155 now that's right uh all right let's talk about open c speaking of more burning of eth open c which is one of the top uh in the ether burn charts right now um they they did this is a tweet from devin fincer who's been on the podcast before in 2020 openc did about 21 million in total transaction volume that's the total for the year in the last two days he's tweeting this august first we did 95 million two days 95 million it in an entire year in 2020 they only did 21 million the growth curve for nfts is insane yeah it is insane absolutely going bonkers and open c is crushing it yeah no wonder openc had that monster raised not too long ago nfts are definitely hot uh turns out the bear market was this is what i wrote in the market monday this week turns out the nft bear market was just a meme and it turns out it was an nft land grab opportunity for the people that believed in it and then the market realized it all like all in the last like two days that devin was talking about sadly those two days where open c had such insane amount of volume was before eip1559 so we didn't burn that eth but all future volume going through openc will indeed burn more eth look at this this is worth a quick gather to ethereum addresses using d5 rose 65 last quarter so more east addresses going bankless using d5 up and down wait is that not what you're gonna say oh okay no all right guys we will be back with some more burning eath talk but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the una swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's dot aave.com hey guys we are back with the releases dave there's so much to talk about we still have some eip 1559 to cover but we want to get to regulatory so we're going to burn through some of these releases and get to the the regulatory section get to the news uh the first is this starkware and so rare are teaming up they are releasing the so rare as a scalability solution on starkwear so so rare is another nft project for soccer football in europe and it's been doing super well it's good to see them deploying on layer two with starkwear as their scalability tech layer two summer continues and so does nft summer so awesome let's keep going yeah absolutely brand new ethereum application now on mainnet thales a binary options trading platform has deployed it's got a seed investment from synthetics so communities seeding other communities so that's pretty cool there's a lot to talk about there but unfortunately we don't have the time if you are interested in binary options trading go to thales t-h-a-l-e-s dot market and see what it's like uh i have not tried this out yet so if you are a binary option straighter ping us on twitter and let us know what you think guys speaking of the synthetics world the derivatives world uh dydx just dropped their token this week so this is a governance token for dydx david we've written tactics about dydx number of times most recently when they deployed their layer two technology i think that was like april or may or so and the good news is they're doing a retrospective airdrop so if you have ever used dydx you might be eligible we actually put out what we call an alpha alert uh two bankless premium subscribers on the newsletter with all of the details of this retroactive airdrop what it includes you can also find some of this information on the dydx website uh again you're eligible if you paid fees dydx and then you have to use layer two it looks like they are also receiving some bumps in adoption post governance uh post governance token launch so this again is a story of kind of the the previous d5 summer when the comp token launched and comp usage went off the charts this is now also happening with dydx so go check that out you might be eligible for that retrospective airdrop there's also there's also future ways to earn dydx token if you are a liquidity provider and some other things so make sure to check that out here's a quick bankless self-shill we told you this was going to happen like six months ago so shout out to the guys in the bankless discord who said that they started using dydx when we when we guessed that dydx was going to list an airdrop and they got the airdrop because of that so sometimes listening to the bankless weekly rollup gives you alpha david one sad part for residents of the us is that residents of the u.s are not eligible for this retrospective airdrop so this is uh jake trevinsky saying i feel so safe and protected in response to anthony cesano saying the u.s investors are missing out on this air drop because of stupid regulations david uh this doesn't feel great that the sec is protecting us investors from free money i mean they're definitely here to prevent scams and to help make sure that markets are transparent this does not feel like those either of those two objectives no that's that's exactly right u.s investors are people just like the rest of the world um i was a previous user of dydx before they implemented the the ip ban and so i did not get my dydx tokens which i feel like i should have gotten because like i said i'm a user um but i'm glad other people were able to get the tokens dydx unfortunately but also fortunately for them did a very good meticulous job of tracking ip addresses and linking that to ethereum addresses and so if your ethereum address was associated with the usip address you did not get the airdrop and you can thank the sec for that one there you go in other news bitwise has just launched two new d5 funds one for uniswap one for ave so investors who are accredited investors because of course bitwise is kind of this bridge from old finance to defy they can invest in these assets without having metamask without taking self-custody sort of an easy way to do this through kind of brokerage accounts and traditional finance great to see bitwise investing further and expanding further in the d5 space and giving more exposure to traditional investors there yeah basically this is just a wrapper around ave and uni tokens making them available to accredited investors in the tradfy world uh it's progress i guess um but again limited and hampered by regulations so yeah we're gonna have to we're gonna be talking about regulation here in a second ryan soon yeah i feel like we got some axes to grind here okay argent though this is great news arjun one of our favorite smart contract wallets they are now going to layer two this has been probably the biggest feature the ux problem with with argent wallet smart contracts wallets in general is high gas prices well no longer right now they have a layer 2 wait list uh you can enter that they've got prizes almost 300k and crypto sweepstakes to celebrate so it's not out yet but you can enter that waitlist i can't wait to see what they have in store i'm pretty excited about this one yeah also definitely go listen to vitalik's smart contract wallets on layer 2 that was a fantastic episode about why specifically layer 2 is very good for enabling smart contract wallets i was a heavy user of argent wallet when back in the early days but as soon as gas fees on ethereum stopped being one gray and for the ethereum like newcomers like it used to be one gray which is kind of insane now uh so the argent worked pretty well like gas feeds were basically nothing and you didn't have to wait too long but now gas feeds with arjun are really expensive and the transactions take a really long time this is something that really needs layer two to work uh so i'm really excited to see what argent on layer two is like i'm gonna keep us moving david uh rocket pool is going to testnet which is super exciting a new decentralized staking protocol rocket pool going to testnet on august 2nd i hope they can keep shipping there are a lot of i think staking organizations that have come up and deployed solutions ahead of them we've been super excited about rocket pool because of their their focus on decentralization it's good to see them progress to testnet um david do you want to talk about this this is a new eth modeler maybe like a risk modeler of some sort what is this yeah this is an e-supply simulator a little bit like ultrasound.money but just a few more things to tinker with a nice little graph and so you can change the validator how many validators there are you can change when the proof of stake activation comes you can change the gas fee and then it will model out the future supply of eth for you so don't let anyone tell you that you can't predict the future supply of eth it is capable of being done and you can also see how low that number goes which is where i get excited yeah you can model this based on your own assumptions whatever those are also cool david in continuation of layer two summer uh diversify which is a decentralized exchange is now bridging directly to polygon which is super cool to see remember ethereum is a economic nexus we have the main chain we got layer twos we got side chains all those things are going to interconnect with each other in different ways and so this is one of those many bridges that just got built you can now go straight from polygon to diversify without even touching ethereum and so no longer can you say that gas prices are an issue because you can just go to the l2 and stay there absolutely guys uh david let's get to raises so this just in missouri which is a crypto media company crypto analysis company just launched just released information about their 21 million series a funding which is cool in and of itself it's also cool is that another billionaire has joined the banks is investing in that series a steve cohen so you might know him from 0.72 a large kind of crypto capital or sorry a large traditional capital firm um in july there was news released that point 72 is hunting for a crypto chief after saying it would be remiss to ignore digital assets so it's there it's a link there too again this is the story of of traditional finance billionaires starting to get into crypto and deploy capital there not just in the assets themselves but in some of the infrastructure companies in this case in messages it's kind of cool to see another d5 protocol since finance announced their raise of 5.2 million dollars they're saying to add a new dimension to d5 so this is essentially creating fixed income types of markets so similar to element finance if you're familiar with that sense has a kind of a different take on it but also building out that fixed income primitive it's super exciting to see david uh you want to talk about crystal this is a d5 platform that raised 6.1 million what are they up to yeah this is crystal out of kyber so kyber moving out of just being the liquidity provider to ethereum to also being a kind of a defy dashboard we've seen a bunch of emergencies of new d5 dashboards out on the scene especially as d5 becomes more rich and more complex so crystal is going to be a new place to interact with all of defy we've been joking about and jim bianco really gets credit for this joke is like people are looking for like all right i downloaded coinbase where's the defy uh and there's actually more and more like people out there working to provide the defy for people and this is uh the new product out of kyber called crystal and let's see where it goes people want their d5 button where's the defy button we say it every time but if you are looking for a job in crypto the way to check that out is through the bankless job sports got a lot of fantastic jobs featured there senior product manager at immutable gaming crypto gaming company full stack engineer at pallet a senior solidity engineer at quant finance chief investment officer at yield app a software engineer at arbitram a designer at pool together and of course bankless is still looking for its editors so there's tons of opportunities to plug in during this uh season this i guess crab season bull market season still on but crypto firms are hiring like crazy big bull horns big bull horns on that crab all right david you ready to get to the news yeah let's do it all right man let's start with this um this is the a blog post entitled the road to trustless eat staking we've been doing a lot of deep dives on eat staking recently we had that eat staking panel one of the panelists was from lydon this is a blog post from live lido they are kind of moving really quickly in in the east staking industry and they just rolled out this post about becoming more trustless david what's the tl dr of what they're attempting to do here yeah basically basically the tl dr is that there is a few low hanging fruit things to be become completely trustless as a staking as a service provider and maybe just to back up as context is there there are two main significant um staking as a service providers that aren't just like a centralized exchange one of them is lido which we're talking about now the other one is rocket pool which we talked about earlier rocket pool has always had the ethos of being maximally and completely decentralized without compromise from day one lido has made some sort of compromises to trustless staking by starting with a dow multi-sig model this is the same critiques that you know a polygon has been getting for being secured by a multi-isig and rather than being a protocol but the the the ethos behind lido is that well if we wait to become a completely decentralized protocol the uh the stake the centralized uh exchanges like coinbase and kraken might gain too much of a lead and that is kind of a threat in of itself and so in order to get out the door quickly lydo started as a dow with permission validators and now this blog post talks about the way that they are going to further their trustlessness further their decentralization and turn into something closer to what their ethos behind rocket pool is and so they talk about the problems that they have ahead how they're going to tackle them and what the various routes towards the trustless future that they want out of lido it's really awesome to see lydo have that commitment have that ethos and so that makes me excited there's also some pretty cool cryptographic ethereum stuff uh shared secret validators is something that i am paying attention to which has a mention here in the post so if you are interested in seeing how a dow can turn into a protocol shared secret validators is one of the points here and if you are into that world definitely check out this blog post it's a very just educational one to read we definitely have to make sure each staking remains decentralized remains trustless so this is an initiative we will continue to support at bankless uh david interesting news zoku who is kind of lead zuko sorry who is the lead founder of zcash um ask this question on twitter this is a governance question should zcash switch from proof of work to proof of stake it's kind of interesting here right even that this question is being posed i have to ask myself does this mean proof of stake has won or is winning like when a long-standing proof-of-work chain you know raises this question you have to ask yourself why right totally and zuko the zcash community and the ethereum community have always been really really close you and i have critiqued zcash in the past about like does privacy need its own l1 and to some degree i think this is actually an illustration of that because proof of sake is just like made just a leaner consensus algorithm which is just like making the whole thing just leaner and smaller and more condensed which kind of goes to show that like no you are just trying to optimize four zero knowledge proofs which should be an app on ethereum that's really a different story i take your point that a long-standing proof-of-work blockchain and it just started with proof of work because that's what zcash had to work with at the time is now saying like hey proof of stake might work better for us and there is definitely a stronger a very strong argument to link proof of stake with cryptography cryptography is easier with proof of stake i'm not technical enough to explain how i the justice might got to take i mean but i think there's a huge efficiency gain and that might be it like i know um zcash spends a whole lot of money in terms of block rewards in order to fund the security of of of itself z cash and so if you transition to proof of stake you you don't have to spend as much maybe like one-tenth the amount it's kind of the estimates with uh that justin drake gives for a switch from proof of work to proof of stake so we'll see how that goes david let's talk nft stuff because that's a big story this week as well crypto punks are just pompin kryptopronk's price rise 53 in the week after ethereum whales a feeding frenzy that is the title half of the top 10 crypto punks have been sold over the past two days this happened last week what is going on in the crypto punk world yeah this is what i wrote about again in the market monday there was uh people thought it was the nfc bear market but the convicted knew that it was an nft like land grab opportunity and so there was a bunch of people that were bullish on nfts that were buying up the cheap nfts as people left the nft like mania from from earlier and then enough people realized what was going on that nfts weren't actually bearish and they were quite bullish and then all of a sudden the market kind of all realized it at once and people descended upon first crypto punks which were kind of like the you know the bitcoin of nfts the og nfts uh and uh that's the crypto punks got bought up first uh the first event that happened was that uh gary v paid 2.7 million dollars for a knitted cap ape uh and then he tweeted out uh some something like here we go or something and then and then people connected it and that kind of kicked off the frenzy i was part of that frenzy i got the fomo so i bought my crypto punk right after uh right right after i saw this frenzy like pick up because i kind of felt i was part of that like i was part of that environment where people thought that nfts were bearish and then realized that everyone else is also bullish on nft so i fo-mode into a punk and iphone into a punk friday morning and the and the punk mania just absolutely continued for the next like 48 72 hours where if you go there there's a duna analytics dashboard for punks that compare to all time volume and just the the last week of volume is like three times higher than any other candle there's a and there's and then millions and millions of dollars got purchased it got spent on on uh crypto punks after gary vee bought the the ape knitted cap nft for 2.7 million another ape gold chain crypto punk got sold for 5.5 million uh an alien punk got bought yesterday for a thousand ether a new alien crypto punk got listed available to be sold for 90 million we'll see if that gets purchased and then we also saw three arrows capital come in throw in a bunch of money crypto punks in art blocks and some other nft projects we saw the floor price which is the lowest price that you can buy a specific nft for for so many different nft projects run up board apes got purchased like art blocks got purchased cool cats got purchased and so there was just a bunch of reallocation rotation into the nft industry and that all happened last weekend is still kind of happening to this day are you ever going to sell your crypto punk david well so i realized like right after i bought my crypto punks like great i got a crypto punk now i'm really bullish crypto punk now i'm going to put it as my avatar and now i realize that i only have one and i can't ever sell it because i is my only one it's become it's like it's part of me now and so i can't ever sell my one crypto punk so i bought relatively expensive crypto punk and now i can't ever sell it so you do expect us to appreciate it over time right in ether terms yes in ether terms oh not just terms absolutely ether terms and ether terms totally more bullish crypto punks than eth wow crypto punks are just wrapped ether interesting uh wrapped ether in pixel form is uh i guess okay cool um yeah anything else on crypto plugs um bullish bullish i'm talking about this more more nfts uh polygon has become a sponsor of the new york knicks that seems super big what um wow new york's next twitter account can i say sponsor probably yeah you said sponsor yeah proud proud to power the nft collection they're powering the nft collection yes sponsor but yes so they are powering so new york knicks are using polygon tech in order to deploy nfts that's what this looks like absolutely while we're talking to nfts david uh tell me about triverse what is that yeah treeverse i've heard i haven't played this myself this is a new game on ethereum that is a token enabled i've heard this described as like a runescape a new runescape which i definitely played when i was younger and it is a token enabled game play to win actually infinity type game and while this is kind of in its early stages just wanted to call attention to this if you want to explore the play to earn games version of ethereum side of ethereum uh check out triverse uh the twitter account is the treeverse all right david let's talk regulatory uh you wanna start with the infrastructure bill man so this infrastructure bill has been just huge it seems like there's momentum to pass it uh and the problem with it is there was a provision that got added to the infrastructure bill uh bill in part of the pay for section that put in some handcuffs i'll say um some just stringent requests unrealistic requests on crypto in particular tax reporting of crypto that could extend to individual wallets maybe wallet providers maybe even exchanges like uniswap doing things that none of these protocols actually have the capability to report like the requirements don't even make sense in the bill and so there was a huge crypto rally and push back against this we had folks from coin center for example uh working with with senators to try to change this information to change this this bill have it amended and uh looks like there's some progress here could you update us on what that progress is yeah first off just just to reiterate the the bill made anybody that ever provided any service to any user of any cryptocurrency it labeled them as a broker which means that they had to do reporting on all of their users which to some degree is really really hard and not even relevant and then the best case scenario and then worst case scenario is actually straight up impossible right so like that it would make meta masks defined as a broker which means metamask would have to do reporting requirements uh jerry britto who is at coincenter he tweeted out that they have made improvements into the language and so they were able to exclude validators which means like node operators are no longer required to report uh hardware and and software uh wallets are no longer required to report so that's like ledger and metamask there's still many more things many more battles to be had to make this legislation make any sense at all but it's made a step in the right direction we've had i've heard some interesting takes about um just straight up the logistics of this the other thing about this david is it's really nice to see some u.s senators on our side so senator wyden senator loomis senator toomey uh they were part of working through this amendment changing the language working with coin center to really understand the crypto industry so we do have some senators that are crypto sympathetic and seem to understand this and of course senator loomis was uh the individual who in wyoming had uh some dow legislation passed in her home state so that's cool to see that said i mean this is a great example of the crypto industry kind of rallying and saying like pushing back against us i heard tons of people call senators um like tweet about this uh you know um write letters this sort of thing write emails this sort of thing and i think part and parcel like part of that action was actually why we were able to get this amendment language in place um it was definitely put out there as a fire alarm like everybody in crypto come react to this and make sure that this this legislation doesn't go forward and at the end of the day it seems like it is being resolved there's still some action that people can take to call their senators in fact we have a link in the show notes um to call your senator to save crypto and make sure that this uh this doesn't happen that this amendment does go through and i'm curious to hear your perspective on this david do you feel like this is um this is a crypto success story or do you feel like at some level this is um i don't know a bit of a false alarm or like we were overly worried the crypto industry was overly worried about you know language that was going to be changed at some at some stage anyway and there was you know too much regulatory flood going on what's your take on this yeah so the the take that i kind of agree with but i'm not really highly convicted in this in this belief is that the legislation was so incredibly just nonsensical and like i feel like you could see this in the markets because the markets did not negatively react to and legislation that could like in theory completely break the industry but the legislation was so bad was so uninformed was so like nonsensical it didn't even make sense that like as soon as like in regulators would try to enforce this legislation they would realize what absolute like storm they accidentally caused for themselves imagine going to like dan finley at metamask and saying hey dan finley like give us the all of the like reporting tax details of like all like 50 million of your users which you don't collect tax informations on by default like it is and that's just one example right like the ledger doesn't know what your addresses are in your ledger like ledger can't report so it can provide you the wallet and therefore in theory it should be a broker and providing the information to regulators but it has no idea so like to some degree this regulation was so incredibly nonsensical that as soon as any enforcement attempt would come it would be so easy to defend in court it would be so easy like regulators would just be overwhelmed with what to do and that's why i think the markets didn't react because the nonsensical nature of this was so incredibly crazy that like it was going to be impossible to be enforced anyways it didn't seem malicious it just seemed inept it seemed it seemed like just straight up and like uh what's the word uh in if there's a great word and it's a great word right and so to some degree while like you know very very important efforts were taken to rally the community to get good legislation in and we should always as an industry always get good legislation in when we can it was i'm very glad to see that crypto the crypto community the crypto industry rose to the occasion and actively participated in governance over a nation state which impacts our industry our our industry is kind of branded as they like this anti-state anti-regulation anti-government like uh industry and like to be fair like the crypto world is is a straight-up anti-regulat uh non-an anti-nation state is it really anti-it's a non-nation state technology so like that's what you get it's extra it's an extra extra nation state right like non non-biased to their nature and say it just is and the crypto community regardless of that branding showed up to like senators telephone showed up to to like where regulation gets done and participated and so that makes me bullish on the community when we need to we will rally and get what we need to done that being said was this a not a drill or was this a drill and it's one of those things where like if this wasn't a drill we acted accordingly and we kind of turned it into a nothing burger at the end of the day i think that's like a tape yeah i mean it's like you have to treat every fire drill as if it's real because one of them like will be real right so you have to react to everyone and i i'm really proud of what the crypto community has accomplished guys but still um we'll have a link in the show notes for fight for your future.org where you can contact your senator it's like pre-made information they will help you through the process to make sure this amendment sticks in crypto but like i think par part of the reason we're so worried david is because it just seems like coming out of us lawmakers they just don't understand this asset class at all so this is a headline from uh senator elizabeth warren she uh she said crypto markets might need bailout someday uh without the proper regulation so she's making the case essentially that hey if we don't regulate crypto tax u.s taxpayers are going to be on the hook the next time krypto wants a bailout and i'm like what like no literally the opposite you're thinking of banks right elizabeth warren banks are the groups that need bailouts crypto has never asked can't even ask right for too proud to ask fiat system i wouldn't dare ask regulators for for a bailout like but like how could that work i i just it's just a fundamental mismatch understanding if this is part of the reason you're you're saying this is um a case you're making to support crypto regulation because crypto regulation might need bailout some days like no i mean we've gone through 95 99 price drops not asking for a bailout d5 gets hacked all of the time no bailouts was there a bailout for mount gox david like no bailouts are coming we know that everyone in crypto knows that and that is a feature it is not a bug and that is absolutely right it's a feature we need inside of our existing financial system this is why we're going cryptos because big banks and plutocrats and oligarchs cannot be built bailed out that's why we're doing this so it's like swinging a mist man totally whiff on the point absolutely absolutely why we're worried it's like we're worried this just like gives you such a great insight into the inner workings of elizabeth warren's brain thinking just like oh they might need a bailout like that is straight up like like in inert inner circle just like incumbents paying off regulators the reason why bailouts happened is because people who are insiders were able to make them happen who is literally the not insiders of the world it's the crypto people we are the outside that's why we are here we are too proud of an industry to ask for regulations we would never want them in the first place we are building our protocols to be regulation resistant and bailout unnecessary like the whole point and so like the fact that elizabeth warren even would associate like bailouts with crypto just tells you what mindset she's in she is in an mmt mindset she's in a nanny state mindset she thinks that we're going to ask for reg for for for bailouts and therefore we deserve regulation when really we want neither of those things we don't need bailouts we get rug pulled and then we carry on the next day that's what it means to be a crypto person like yeah it just puts you too much insight into how elizabeth warren doesn't understand at all what this the ethos of this industry is and she's using this whole like oh they're gonna ask for a bailout now we need to regulate them i i you know what i you know i also want to lend the hand of like hey come learn about this to us senators i don't trust other other people i don't necessarily trust it like i i i don't know but like i i just want them to know that this open finance thing is not a way to escape um like regulation like you know um this brings me to maybe the the gary gensler letter and we should talk about this uh you know for for a minute but like so gary gensler put out a so he's the new sec chair and he put out a new uh a letter um and i think this was a speech given at the aspen security forum and there are some concerning things in here um you know one of the things he said that that stuck with me is that uh some people in crypto are trying to shirk the the legal system and that is the reason why they use crypto like david i don't see very much of that at all like that just we're not trying to shirk the legal system in crypto we're trying to shirk the shitty banking system that we have in place like if the banking system was better and if it was if it was digital if it had the features that crypto had like we would be using the banking system right it's because the banking system failed that this bottom-up movement is happening that's that's one thing that stuck out for me from this letter but what are some of the other things for you david one point that i'll make on that is like one of the reasons why there's this inherent like like tie to being anti-regulation is that banks the incumbents are making the regulations to protect themselves and so if we want to be anti-regulation we don't want to be anti-regulation we want to be anti-banks we're just frustrated that banks are buying regulations that they want that protect them and so who do you think they turn everything into banks they turn everything into banks they take away our individualism they take away our self-sovereignty and then they just extort us that's the natural organic pattern of banks over the centuries and that's what we want to get away from and so let's make good crypto regulation happen and this and this was my last rant on the last weekly rollup is that we the crypto industry would love fantastic good precise clean regulation please provide that regulate us in an educated fashion so you can come get your tax money but if you come and regulate us by saying that any wallet provider or any node is a is a broker and needs to provide information you're not going to get any tax money because it's nonsensical and you're just going to f it up and then there's going to be resistance so we should shake hands we should rally behind people like jake schravinski and the other lawyers in this space who are informing regulators about how to properly do this so that the regulators can get the tax money from this industry that they want to pay for the infrastructure bill just do it right rather than come in heavy-handed i think the mistake that this uh tax bill made was thinking that like the crypto people are just like this corner of the internet they don't care about society they don't care about government and we'll just tax them just because we can and we'll bully them like oh no wrong crypto people are some of the most and like politically engaged people on this planet because people think that this is a money a revolution in money and finance and it totally is but this is also a political revolution these are all political people in this industry social revolution we're fighting for hearts and minds here and i think the big question with this gary gensler letter is like he's the new sec chair taking over from uh jay clayton the question is is he crypto friendly or not so there's some takes around the crypto universe on the back of this letter like you mentioned uh uh gary gensler mentioned that he agrees with the previous sec chair that most icos he said in the letter are probably securities right so that was one uh point that stuck out there are a few other points here but here's a take from uh nick carter somebody asked him like what's your explanation like how do you what what do you think of this letter and he said it's not clear that the sec can actually fulfill its agenda given current resources but at minimum a crackdown on exchanges both onshore and offshore might be coming this is sort of what he took from um gary gensler's letter he also said gary gensler it seemed was expressing a need for additional legislation so it could be the case that the sec actually doesn't have the power or authority to do some of the things that that um gary gensler is suggesting um but there were some more upbeat takes here david so this is a take from uh a you know crypto twitter lawyer preston byrne what did what did preston think about this yeah he and this i've heard this sentiment echoed by other lawyers as well is that preston said that genzler's speech today was straight down the middle and entirely consistent with what more conservative legal advice in this space has been for years this guy at the top 100 understands crypto we knew that and i and and preston finishes saying i think this is actually bullish for prospects like the bitcoin etf and so if you were what he's saying is that there has been generally like more conservative legal advice in this space and if you were following that legal advice then gary gensler is not doing anything unexpected for you and so like no erratic icos like you know know your customers don't sell the us investors sadly um and but then i think the take here is that gary gensler he's going to be a stickler he's going to be strict it's going to be a bit of a hard ass and he's going to let this industry progress forward at the same time which fine we'll t i'll i'll take it i'll take it yeah it's definitely not the worst it could be for sure uh this is a headline in bloomberg saying gensler signals pathway for a bitcoin etf with tough rules this is from partially from his speech and i think the the key clip here is um this gensler is hinting that he'd like to see a filing this is an etf filing all of the previous etf filings have been denied for a bitcoin etf but he's hinting he'd like to see a filing that seeks approval through a 1940s law that governs mutual funds most of the pending applications have been filed under a 1930s law back to your point about like being a stickler right like it's like hey if you fill out the right forms and you do it the right way then i'll give it to you but you have to do it the right way right this is maybe the signal that he's sending uh to crypto in addition to the signal of like i want more legislation in this space unless he gets the legislation i'm not sure how much more the sec is going to be able to do right and i think another very telling comment towards the bottom of this article is he says we don't have enough investor protection in crypto gary gensler said it's more like the wild west and this definitely shows you the difference in mindset and disposition of people in crypto because he's saying this it's more like the wild west as if it's a bad thing and ryan you finish off every single bankless episode is we are heading west it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey and so kind of yes we don't have enough investor protection in crypto to sometimes sometimes some people when you say the words investor protection we hear incumbent protection not investor protection that's exactly it that's exactly it and and we like the wild west it's fun out here there's 10 000 x gains and rug pulls who knows what comes next but we're here for it because we're self-sovereign and we're individuals in control of our own money it is the wild west but we do have an investor protection that they don't see they they think investor protection means like like regulatory action and new legal codes right like investor protection is an open source transparent financial system where you can view source in every asset you can see exactly what's inside of it that's investor protection right so yeah it's the wild west but you know what i'll take that over the closed like financial system where i have no idea how the money is is moving right like this is all open this is transparent that is our investor protection i wish they would acknowledge that more in some of these statements you know senator warren and even gary gensler is like take some of the good like that is coming out of the system we've built a more transparent financial system from the ground up and regulators again should be falling over themselves in support of a system like this it's going to make their jobs easier you know what the best investor investor protections are is soft is financial services built by code where no one is allowed to break the rules and so that code is enforced equally transparently across everyone and so there's no the whole point about ethereum is that no one is the admin everyone is a user everyone is treated equally everyone can audit the code that is the best investor protections that money can buy it's code protecting you like investor protections is a human to human thing where like oh there's like privileged information somebody has somebody like big wealthy whale has privileged information entices a lot of retail people and then and then rug pulls them and takes all their money in code if we can enforce that against that and i've never been rug pulled i've stuck to the major defy apps like compound maker and ave i've never been rug pulled code has protected me from rug pulls and also my own due diligence uh and so to some degree like there's going to be the same tricks in every single financial market and we need to avoid scammers and fraudsters and all that but the lack of appreciation for the fact that code is protecting all of us uh is frustrating and but i also understand that's a complicated subject yeah i agree all right so that's what the take the us is is taking right now it's a little bit of this a little bit of that some virtual against crypto maybe some support kind of wishy-washy definitely not a policy towards crypto yet um but china definitely has a policy to crypto and that's i want crypto out of here we want crypto outside of our borders they've been putting pressure on miners on exchanges we've talked about that in in the past um and they say the pboc that's the people's bank of china saying it's going to continue to keep high pressure on crypto trading david i just want to highlight our podcast that's coming out on monday it's already available if you are a bankless premium member you can listen this podcast now we recorded it last week this is uh with a gentleman by the name of richard turin who wrote a book called cashless all about what china is doing their plans for digital currency a digital currency revolution as he calls it in china and something that's interesting that i learned from this book and from the podcast is that china's digital currency strategy is explicitly a deterrent against cryptocurrency okay they don't want capital flight they don't want a free money system that is outside of the pblc's control inside of their borders so in addition to pushing it out they're actually trying to build a controlled centralized crypto alternative this is the uh china central the bank digital currency essentially it's explicitly part of their strategy instead of like not replacing it with um you know they're replacing all of the crypto stuff with something that looks a little bit like crypto it's digital in the same way but it's completely controlled and centralized that's their approach and it's a pretty smart approach if you are a you know centralized a you know authoritarian kind of power and uh you want to go down this route so anyway eye opening podcast fantastic podcast i think we need to learn about china's approach because it's going to uh make waves in terms of what the us does next as well and it's going to be pretty important to the world yeah i can't recommend this podcast enough it opened my eyes to what really the true story is behind the china chinese central bank digital currency and if you thought the last section made you like question a regulator's competency about how to approach defy listening to this will make you question it even more because of how it's all over it china's all over the central bank digital currency the recently the there was a uh i can't remember what it was they're contracts dude yeah they have smart contracts coming and meanwhile like not too long ago there was like a u.s banking regulations panel that talked that was headlined cryptocurrencies what are they even good for meanwhile china saw crypto and applied it to the central bank digital currency and is releasing one of the most powerful forces that this world has ever seen in decades as on in the east and then meanwhile in the west people are questioning if if crypto is even useful and then just a fad and then just allocating like terrible regulation to it when they when they have forced themselves into a corner where their only option is to leverage defy inc to combat chinese banks digital currency i need to stop or else i'm going to explode well look man this is what happens when your average senator is 65 years old right is exactly what happened nice nice um all right let's move on david so we got to burn through this yep all right wealthfront is offering grayscale bitcoin trust that is a robo lender wealthfront a lot of people use pretty cool to see them doing that it's continuation of the story also germany institutions they are allowed to hold um i think up to 20 million in crypto now so germany is coming down the pike with some crypto friendly regulation legislation it's kind of cool and you want to get this last one david yeah uh richard uh no excuse me ricardo spagni the one of the original uh members of monero uh not the og monero person because that's a very interesting story uh was actually arrested for things unrelated to crypto apparently defrauded a company in south africa and was extradited to south africa so basically he's considered basically the founder of monero even though he's technically inaccurate got arrested for unrelated to crypto reasons which is an interesting side quest of a story look there are still some shady people in crypto definitely have to acknowledge that um for the regulators listing in here okay guys we're going to get to the takes in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

takes that have come out in the last week this one comes from eric connor who has a bunch of screenshots from a different uh bitcoin maxis and he says the bitcoin community has gotten so pathetic that they have actually actively begged regulators to classify eth as a security this has been going on for for years and then he has some examples and so he has some examples of you know some of the most like maximalist of the max bitcoin maxi camp uh samson mao from block stream neil jacobs um uh pierce uh pierce i can't remember his last name um talking all about how ether is a security uh and making jokes about how ether is a security and then asking gary gensler to classify eth as a security and i want i want the listeners to and here's why i feel so passionate about this i want the listeners to think about the sec is supposed to protect uh protect uh individuals investor protections who is protected if ether gets classified as a security or is if ether gets protect classified as a security is this just bitcoin maximalists being really happy that the second largest biggest threat to bitcoin is being classified as a security like who is it are they do they care about investor protections or are they trying to like you know cope with the fact that ethereum is extremely successful and so i really just want shame on bitcoin maxies who are trying to protect their own bags by begging gary gensler to classify ether as a security when they should be talking focusing on themselves focusing on their own merits focusing on their own blockchain rather than looking over the fence and being jealous about all the cool things happening on ethereum and they get jealous about it and so they beg gary gensler to classify ethan's security because they're insecure about their bags that's my take about eric's take about the bitcoin max he takes yeah and ultimately like i i i would just say like it doesn't really matter what they think right they don't get it it's embarrassing this the cftc um chair also pushed push back in general and this is partially in response to i think gary gensler's comments about um certain icos being securities and he said hey like many cryptos are actually commodities and um the sec has no jurisdiction over the things that are commodities bitcoin is a commodity cftc has said as much so as ether the cftc is as said as much so i'm not even sure why this is a conversation like maybe you could have this conversation in certainly 2015 2016 maybe 2017 but like this conversation has already been had right like it's over it's done uh the cftc um you know are the are the regulators for ether the asset and bitcoin maximums don't get to decide so it just seems like a bunch of cope and i i don't know man massive coat massive this is the stand samson mao is the guy behind uh liquid which is basically trying to be the ethereum version of bitcoin as a side chain which is already just compromised on the values but like bitcoiners are known for being the the uh the uh the cypherpunks who are very anti-regulation extremely like extremely nation state they're one of the anton nation state there's one of the reasons why this whole entire industry has that branding in the first place even though i don't agree with it yet they are begging the nation state to protect their incumbent investments by classifying eth as a security to me it's no different than the bankers having like regulation against like the same against our industry trying to protect them the bitcoin maxies are just trying to do it for their own purposes it's just embarrassing it's a compromise on their values compromise on their ethos and it's just a bad look for the space yeah i agree ultimately won't amount to anything but i agree it's a bad look uh david let's let's take jeff dorman's take so what's his take away from everything that's going on so all of the news he said his internal slack is blowing up with tons of positive information about crypto but also negative information about crypto what's his takeaway david yeah gary uh jeff dorman we had him on to talk about uh coinbase when coinbase went public that was a fantastic episode his takeaway is that it doesn't matter positive negative news every single news outlet and investor in the world is not now talking about digital assets every single day and he finishes up with betting against growth from here would be insane and so this is why i've been saying like regulation it's finally here and it's bullish it doesn't matter what it is good regulation bad regulation we prefer good regulation it's bullish either way just because the attention is on the space they're not ignoring crypto any longer they're forced to reckon with it and that is bullish for the space for sure um let's do this take it's kind of a regulatory take i suppose but this is from joseph young finance futures trading not allowed in germany in italy is one of the biggest advertisements for defy this year i could not agree more that finance squeeze we've been talking about right where binance has to de-list assets uh is not available in certain countries that's just pointing the world to d5 this is why we need d5 we need something that is outside of the borders of a nation state that doesn't have a geographic jurisdiction or a geographic location that's just public freely available to anyone with an internet connection huge advertisement for defy and this also largely impacts binance smart chain just as well because the only on-ramp to finance smart chain is through binance and so if binance gets restricted binance smart chain gets restricted which is why we were always harping on binance marching in the first place because it's just a masquerading as decentralized even though it's actually not yep absolutely uh let's see this next take this is from tasha she has a whole thread about this i just thought it was a fantastic thread and the crux of it is this maybe i'll read the first tweet or so the us is in big trouble with twin deficits and high debt we know that but few realize that fed issue digital currency usd token can change the fate of america how she says grab a coffee and read on do not have time to read the entire thread but she makes the case that actually the biggest export from the u.s is not technology export it's not a manufacturing export it's not like military arms dealing do you know what the biggest export is david a dollar the u.s dollar that's what the us is exporting to the world right now everybody wants the us dollar right now that's not necessarily a long-term product so tasha says we might have like 15 to 20 years or so left to go on the us dollar's reserve currency status but she said we the u.s should use that uh well well it well it can essentially create a central bank digital currency of some some sort support crypto in some way and export this to the world to stay ahead if they don't for our previous conversation man china will and they're in it to win it the us has this asset why not use it uh they absolutely should i thought it's a brilliant take we'll include that thread in the in the show notes here the tldr is that the american empire has its interests and it can use crypto to leverage those interests rather than fighting it and if it does choose to fight it it's just going to hasten his own demise absolutely um all right david oh this is a good one yeah i thought this is like so we've been talking about eip1559 by the way david how how much have we burnt since the the start of this record well you're looking that up i think eip 1559 i said this uh is the ultimate jiu-jitsu move for ethereum why dude because in order to copy it competitors have to get the one thing they've never had and that is actual block space demand david so you can't copy and paste this eip1559 feature like sure you can start burning some of your transaction fees but you have to have transaction fees to burn in order for it to be meaningful now you're about to tell me that the number of youth that were that has been burnt since the beginning of this episode how much is it yes uh i'm gonna say it was it was 880 since when since we last talked i believe how much how much do you think is that now we're i think okay so i i said 200. well 950. how about that so gas prices have jumped significantly since then gas prices are currently at 277 so something's going on yikes and the most recent block that just got mined burned five ether we are at 51 1500 ether we are at 1500 ether what happened for the last few i don't know something's going on something's going to check the price nft yeah holy  like is it up or down i have no clue but yeah uh for the last like 10 20 all the blo all the blocks that i can see right now have burned more ether than issued that's insane that's insane i don't know what's going on but bullish bullish okay i mean and here's the thing that's not the price price is stable the thing that's impossible to emulate and the reason why this is a jiu jitsu move for ethereum versus all eth killers other competitors is ethereum's biggest strength blocks based demand people will pay to get a transaction in and they've been building this for the last five or six years it's already flipping a bitcoin by far on that count um like no other chain is even close in terms of transaction volume right like in terms of block space uh revenue or demand um ethereum is the only chain that can essentially pull off eip1559 and use it and pump it into its its asset so dude game set match right i mean like you got to work hard and get that block space demand that's how you compete against ethereum if you want to do that yeah the the avalanche community has always been teasing a theory about how they implemented eip1559 on avalanche like nine months ago and in the first three hours of eip1559 going live on ethereum eth more ether was burned than in all of nine months of avalanches eip1559 being live right and so like cool you guys got it first but like when as it takes two seconds for us to catch up with you once it goes live and that's the power of block space demand you got to put the hard work in and the hard work is block space demand uh so get there let's see this last take from hasu david why don't you read it out yeah hazu says success is a muscle every important upgrade that ethereum has successfully merged the beacon chain now eip1559 increases the chance that future important upgrades the merge sharding block propose or slash builder separation will also be successful another way of framing it eth prices in a ton of execution risk i know because i was that was a big part of my own thesis every milestone makes that execution risk go down this is what we have been saying on bank list forever if you're cool with execution risk buy eth early but every time we successfully hard fork that execution risk goes down right and so you should plan for that accordingly in your valuation of ether and honestly at this point with the beacon chain behind us and eip1559 behind us two very complicated updates in the rear view mirror the last major update is the merge and like maybe sharding but like not that major and very distant off into the future like how much execution risk is left before people fomo and maybe that's why people have been definitely fomoing into ether right after eip1559 went live and they ether went from 26 to 2800 in just an hour or so success is a muscle ethereum is proven out that it executes upon its roadmap maybe late but it does execute and so betting against ethereum at this point is just completely irrational again in my opinion there you go got nothing to add david what's exciting this week for you vip one five five nine sir i would like to go back two years and say like there was there was a time where eip1559 got introduced a few people like latched on to it you me anthony cesano air connor who introduced it dc investor a few others they all saw the power in this we all like wrote articles we made podcasts we tweeted about it we tried to do our best to shout from the rooftops like this is coming and now it's finally here which makes me feel really good is in one important step forward to ether as ultra sound money and what really excites me that's specific and nuance other than just saying eip159s here is that eip159 has so much metric surface area there are so many new metrics that have come alive now that eip1559 is here eath burn rate the base fee the tip amounts like uh the block the the how full the block is there's so many things and numbers and variables to talk about and honestly like what gives more people more confidence in in an unknown asset are like numbers and metrics to like consume and analyze and discuss and not only that it gives new people confidence it gives older people like us more things to talk about this is what i said earlier there's so many more metrics that we get to talk about on the weekly roll up so like we're going to go back and like talk about how much eath has burned it's probably going to be part of the the uh every single week since we last talked about how much eath was burned we burned 70 more eats so that's pretty cool and so all these metrics are legitimizing in of themselves even though we literally invented them out of thin air like we just the industry invented this thing called cryptoeconomics ethereum invented this thing called eip1559 now we've invented this metric called ethburn ray and now because we get to talk about it it's legitimizing it's cool people get to talk about it i can't i can't wait to read all about it in goldman sachs next white paper on why you should invest in eth we're gonna see burn metrics right in these in these like analyst papers now super cool yeah ryan i think i have a guess what you're excited about why don't you tell me look man it's gotta be eip 1559. oh really eip 1559 roll up and i'm just gonna riff on what you said i feel like um you know coming off of the the 2017 uh 2018 crash right um like everyone i think a lot of people recognize that the ethereum network was amazing and there was this whole mantra of ethereum not eth like if you're in the network is amazing eat the asset who cares that thing sucks by bitcoin instead it's just a means to an end and like some of us felt like that was uh a massive mistake right baloney like like it didn't even make sense doesn't make economic sense if you are striving to become um a strong highly secure economic network you need the price of eth to reflect that as well that's where you get your economic security and so we pushed back against that um i think there was this concept david you remember of economic abstraction right the idea that we don't even need to even pay for minors why is it even there it can collapse to basically zero and no one would care we can use stable coin maybe bitcoin to pay miners we pushed against that well now we no longer have economic abstraction like i think we've never had it in reality but the protocol has enshrined you know what's the uh opposite of uh you know abstraction like concreteness now have economic concreteness of ethy asset i don't think that means gonna stick i don't think it's gonna stick either but like that's what we have and this is um this is really exciting because i think there's been a renewed emphasis at the protocol level on ethi asset that uh we've been pushing for since uh 2018 2019 2020 2021 now it's here it's being baked into the protocol and it's just super exciting to see and like this is why it's important is because the end game we want to build a bankless open financial system for everyone and in order to do that we need high security right we need uh the economic bandwidth to support all of the world's assets all of the world's transactions and uh man that in the armor that ether had a great network didn't have a great asset completely like equalized right now you got the you got the ying and the a you got a great network you also have a fantastic asset and people are starting to realize that and i think they'll realize it more as those metrics are going to be displayed everywhere and we're going to keep refreshing those burn pages to see how much eath we're going to birch and then it's onward towards the merge that's the next live stream we're doing david um in the live stream this morning last question for you did you hear the dates what are like the anticipated dates for the eth2 uh merge and the end of proof-of-work what do you think that's going to be yeah justin drake who's uh famous for giving out dates a little bit ahead of consensus said q1 2022 which is the date i've been giving out more or less uh if we hit it in q1 2022 that would be actually well the first hard fork that we actually got on schedule for some reason maybe i'm naive i actually believe in it um so q1 2022 all right you know i thought uh we had a good shot of hitting july uh for eip 1559 and that was like some early estimates like two months off so still pretty close right and i think this is going to be if it's not q1 2022 it's gotta be q2 right right it's gonna be really close to q1 anyway just like kazu said success is a muscle and now our core developers are getting better and better and better at hitting hard fork deadlines yeah totally even though there's not there's on a deadline but like not delaying too much david let's talk meme of the week man what is the meme of the week i'm gonna share my screen this is one from robert leshner and some of the d5 builders some of the crypto native builders right so robert lechner randomly tweets out who is in crypto in new york city right this second and wearing blue wearing blue i need you for a mission and then later hayden adams tweets out this photo how it started and then new photo how's it going so the first photo is that that weird meme going around of bill murray plus three other actors kind of just like all awkwardly standing weirdly plus with interesting outfits and there's this one lady in this like very very vibrant fiery blue suit uh looked like an absolute rock star and then like everyone kind of has their own deal going on nothing really makes any feeling on this this is definitely a vibe going on definitely if there looks like there's four vibes going on for every four actors and then then robert uh and uh excuse me hayden adams tweet this tweets this out we got from from uh left to right we got hayden adams we got kane from synthetics we got jameis johnson from pleaser dao and then we got robert lesner on the right and they are just recreating the meme which is hilarious because this is a decentralized industry kane is from uh australia hayden is from new york robert lesnar i'm pretty sure it's from san francisco uh and they they all made they all made it happen and then interestingly uh kane was the only person that had a white-haired crypto punk before this image but for some reason they all decided to buy white-haired crypto punks and put it as their avatar and so now this is the white hair crypto punks moment the other cool interesting like little bit little easter egg in this photo is that bill murray for some reason is wearing two watches and so is robert lesner the person that's bill murray's correlate yeah robert lester got two watches on it was just i think this was a fun little moment uh when when robert lesnar tweets out who's in new york city wearing blue right this moment we get jameis johnson showing up looking like an absolute g in a blue suit uh i thought that was pretty cool yeah that's awesome all right guys this has been the weekly roll up special edition eip 1559. as always none of this was financial advice ethan's risky crypto is risky all of d5 is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west and we like it
