welcome bankless Nation to state of the nation where we dive down into a topic that is currently floating around the world of crypto this week on state of the nation we are talking with Dan Robinson head of research GP at Paradigm and recently across my Twitter feed I saw a tweet thread from Dan Robinson about how there are five big ways that uniswap X changes the game for swapping in defy swapping in crypto and I learned a ton in this tweet thread and I thought it would be super useful if Dan Robinson came onto the show and explained each point himself here and so that is what you are about to get here today because uniswab X doesn't just stop at uniswap X it also brings with it a bunch of new changes for the Dex landscape that impacts so many other things across defy across ethereum it impacts his Bridges it impacts Roll-Ups it impacts Mev it impacts market makers and so there's about to be perhaps if you believe in this new intent based Paradigm which is something that we will to find in the show it flips a lot of what it means to be a DEX or to be a deck swapper on its head so you're going to learn about all these details in this coming new meta for defy as well as what it means for you the user you the swapper and also perhaps you the lp if you are an LP in this world of D5 as well then we also open up some other doors is what does the future of elping yields in uniswap look like what can uniswap V4 do for LPS well uniswab X is focusing on swappers and why swappers and LPS are the two parts of a Decks that need to be held in the highest regard and why everything else is secondary and then also we open the door to what flashboss is working on with Suave which is at the very end of this episode overall you're going to learn a ton about the Dex landscape that is changing quickly both with unison V4 and with uniswap X as well as some other things in the intent base World which is a Hot Topic in the Dex and Dev landscape quickly before we get into our interview with Dan uniswab is a main focus of this episode in uniswap is also a sponsor of bankless bankless also holds a supply of uni tokens which you can see at bankless.eth and also

and head of research at Paradigm he over the years has done a lot of deep thinking about markets auctions and liquidity and D5 with a particular Focus I'd say on uniswap new Swap and uniswap V3 recently uniswap Labs released uniswap x a new Dutch auction mechanism that Dan thinks changes The Meta for swapping assets in defy and also Mev chain interoperability and many more things the last time we had Dan on Bank list was September of 2020 almost three years ago if you've ever heard Ryan or I say the phrase ethereum is a dark Forest it came from that episode Dan welcome back to bankless thanks for having me Dan you recently wrote a thread which triggered my imagination and was the impetus for bringing you onto this podcast that was titled five reasons I think uniswab X changes the game for decentralized exchange Mev and interoperability and this already kind of gave me um a model an agenda for this episode which we want to get into but just I really want to start at the highest of levels can you maybe Define the landscape for why something like uniswap X is needed in the defy sphere uh what it what are the current variables or the current things that are producing this need for uniswap x yeah so I can talk about that and and I think it'll also talk a little about unisoft V4 and why I said where I see that fitting in so from my perspective decentral exchange research which is where I've spent a lot of of um my career and my research Focus has been um at Paradigm and with uniswap do you Subs exchange research in my view has to be about reducing the amount of value that leaks out of the system um The decentralized Exchange system and so with uh uh when you were in a decentral exchange was particularly with automated market makers you have on one side liquidity providers and on the other side swappers and swappers are coming in because they can get the most liquidity from or the best prices from your decentralized exchange and the query providers are hoping to earn the best uh uh returns from um from these trading fees being paid and a lot of what I would say uh in research in decentralized exchange design um that I've seen happen elsewhere has been focused on trying to tip the balance one way or the other between take money out of the swapper's pockets and put it in LP's Pockets or vice versa um and I think when you when you see a lot of reactions to some to the centralized exchange resources often saying oh you know this hurts LPS uh to benefit swab versus swab versus benefit LPS and in my view I think it's just sustainable Dex research is going to be about reducing the the value that leaks out of this system entirely it's not going to be about you you can't just like benefit swappers by making lpus make less money you can't just benefit LPS by having um swappers get worse prices you actually have to find where where is the parts of the system where you can benefit both or reduce the leaks that come out of the system and almost all those leaks go into Mev and so I think the types of decks research the valuable lines of Dex research correspond to different types of Mev that come out of the uh of the system now um I think there's three kinds of Mev there one is just eip559 um uh uh burn just East it's been that's being burned gas cost from the transaction um and that's being paid by both swappers and LPS effectively um that's I think a really important one and unusual V4 and unusual X both address that one but for the other two one is uh loss versus rebalancing and that's um uh losses that liquidity providers suffer to Arbitrage or someone's coming in and they're trading on this pool at a better at a better price than the liquidity Rider baby should be giving them so liquid dividers is losing money to arbs and that all goes basically to Mev um in the modern system um and so you just saw before and I can talk later about a little about how we think about that is about uh addressing those losses to um uh uh to Arbitrage I mean opening up new ways for developers uh for amm designers to reduce that but uniform X in my view is largely about uh the other side is trying to help the swappers and one way that a couple ways that swappers lose money um they can be sandwiched uh you can have your transaction actually executed the worst price because somebody traded ahead of you you could have just ordinary um slippage you're trading at a price um and you know the prices moved away from you on the decks and so you're getting worse price than you expected and you could just be getting a worse price that is available somewhere else and in my view if if uniswap the system is not providing swappers with the best possible execution they could be getting anywhere um then what are we even doing here and so that's the um that's the motivation for me with unison X is how can we actually protect swappers the swapper side of this from from getting worse prices than they could otherwise I think to reword I thought what I what I heard from you research in amm and and just you know dexes on on ethereum and encrypted broadly has two players that you think need to be held as first class citizens of the highest regard and everyone else should actually be minimized and these two players are swappers people that want one token and have one token and want a different token and then liquidity providers who are providing liquidity and I think what you're saying is that research in the realm of dexes in in crypto needs to figure out how to optimize for retaining value by the the net between these two players and anyone else Mev arbitrages the ethereum protocol with eip1559 needs to be men while these two players are maximized that's how I would reword what you were saying is that fair yeah I think that's that's basically how I think about it and then uniswap X is specifically a technology that benefits swappers the most it's yes largely focused on benefiting swappers but I think again in a way where you're benefiting primarily retail swappers right it's not about it's not about helping Arbor Treasures um trade against you know Universal LPS more effectively it's it's the people who we care most about actually helping here okay so I'd actually like to take this opportunity to start with your your Tweet thread and number one because I think this is where this goes your first tweet in your thread goes the architecture of uniswap X opens up a vast design space for dexes and so maybe we can talk about like I think the the secret sauce that unit swap is uniswap X is bringing to the table uh we might actually need to Define what unit swap X is for people that didn't listen to our episode with Hayden um but I definitely recommend that as well so what what is the new thing that uniswap X is bringing to the table what's the new Secret Sauce here yeah so first I'll say I I don't like to use the term new because I think a lot of as people as many people have pointed out a lot of the ideas in unit swap acts have been around in ethereum deck space actually some since before uniswap um and I think some of the concepts especially around sign signed limit orders I think are um uh you can trace back through through Xerox or even before um and so I think part of what Ubisoft X is about is are we actually at a time when some of these Concepts that have been around for a while make really make sense and start to um uh be worth integrating into how into how Dex is actually done on ethereum which right now again is dominated by Design chain flows on um on amms um and I I'm I think actually that there's a lot to be gained from from going to into the into these digging up some of these uh ritual ideas so yeah so so the key idea for me of you know swap X is that we're moving from a system where all transactions created by retail order uh users are expressed as transactions with a specific um uh path you know imagine just like a an itinerary of here's I'm going to take exactly this this route on the subway um to get from 0.8 about B to an intent um uh or a limit order and an intent if you think about it is just it's just a statement like I want to get to the point I'm at Point a I want to get to point B but I don't necessarily care um how I get there and um you know there's been a lot of of discourse on intents and I think um and and you know a lot uh prior even just on the on the more General concept and decks of of limit orders but I think it's very important that we start actually operating um with user intents I think they're they're incredibly flexible and powerful and you're gonna swap backs the main thing to me that it achieves is um starting to move toward uh toward users expressing their trades as intense as limited or saying I'm willing to I want to trade at the best price possible no worse than this particular price rather than um expressing I want to trade on this exact amm so people who have swapped on universal before do you you open up with the asset that you have you open up the asset that you want and then you click confirm and then you like approve that transaction your metamask your Ledger or whatever and then you like go to etherscan to watch that transaction get verified in that what you're saying is that is a specific the user has chosen their point a and their point B and then the app the web app actually codifies that into a specific transaction and then the user commits to that transaction and then that is committed to on chain and then a bunch of Mev happens in the background that you the user it doesn't really see but definitely does happen and so I think that that's the current meta of swapping and what you're saying is there's this new alternative called intense which is can you explain like how that actually gets expressed and then how that actually turns into the outcome that the user wants how is that different from an actual codified transaction and how does it actually achieve the same result right so the way it works is the user you know the user still sees a similar interface on the on the web interface and but when they go to sign um to sign their trade instead of signing um a an ethereum transaction that is again constructed by the by the interface um they sign just an off-chain message they sign they sign um you know a message in a particular format um but that isn't an ethereum transaction and then it's the job of the entire Mev superstructure um out there to get this turn this trans this intent somehow package it in a transaction that somebody creates um and get it included on chain but this can this could you know in intense in general could include anything it's it's a more General format than a than an ethereum transaction and um this the unit X uses a particular format where the user commits to a particular um uh uh price the price that they're that they're willing to trade at um supports the ability to do a a Dutch order which is um a a kind of off-chain Dutch auction where they sign this order like uh they say here's my Decay rating basically it's going to change the price to make it more basically get a worse worse or Worse price the longer goes uh goes on until you hit something until you get some limit and that's in order to do it to facilitate some off-chain price Discovery for it and then it also allows the ability to pick a particular filler um uh who gets exclusivity on the trade for for a couple blocks and that's in order to to enable them to um potentially through through a request for quote like system off chain find someone to fill this this quote better but all those all these are details about how this particular transaction format works and it's I think how we see um uh this is sort of the initial way that usobex helps find users the best price but again to me the key is you're moving into now I'm signing a message that just says uh expresses my my trading intent and it's up to the system to try to find the best price for it so in the example that say just for round numbers ether's two thousand dollars uh and in the old way is you would have uh 2 000 usdc and then you would say hey give me one ether and then you would ultimately get like 0.987 either before a number of different reasons one of them would be gas fees one of them would be slippage one of them would be front running and a bunch of different participants both humans and protocol eat away a little bit at that and and I think the way that this intense system works is you actually since you don't broadcast a transaction you actually uh excuse me you do broadcast a message but you do not make a transaction and so I I would guess maybe this like this package that you're talking about you're just saying hey I have 2 000 usdc the minimum price that I'll take is one ether for that but if anyone can give me more than that then you are allowed to fulfill this order and then Dutch auction is just to Define index auction is you set a high price and then over a period of time that price comes down little by little by little and I think that's kind of the magic can you can you elaborate on why that's so magical for how that actually reduces Mev yeah yeah so the idea there is but when I want to set I if I want to discover the price suppose I don't know at all what the price is um and this by the way I use Dutch auctions all over in like every mechanism because I think they're just a fantastic um uh way to get decentralized price Discovery um uh but I think this is what it's you know it's one component of a piece of uh of your sub Expo but the way it works is um when you put if you publish this order to the world um with some particular starting some particular starting price if that price is is uh if anyone in the world can actually fill that their incentivized to do it as fast as possible um and so you'll you'll actually get include they can fill that profitably so you'll get that included um as quickly as possible if nobody can fill that then okay maybe that price is too high I'm going to start lowering it um and as soon as if if the um uh system is sufficiently competitive and there's enough there's enough potential bidders out there and nobody um and people aren't censoring multiple blocks at a time and again I think these are assumptions that are worth worth uh questioning um but in that case basically as soon as this order becomes profitable for anybody in the world to fill they'll fill it and we have the assumption that basically once you hit that point that's the right price to actually fill it at now again like it there's some there's some possibility you could lose you could lose a little the slippage from the system like if the price you know uh moves in the other direction at the same time that your price fails you maybe don't get the best um execution possible and I think there's that's why there are these other systems as part of it um and to me unit sub X again is not about just the Dutch order it's not about the RFQ it's about this General concept that we actually get a lot more flexibility from intents um but Dr what that's that's one mechanism that unisubex uses to try to make a competitive market for filling orders I think another way the way that resonates with me in my brain is is that the Dutch auction mechanism say say ether is 2 000 price two thousand dollars give or take but like you said you actually don't know in the in one single moment of time you actually don't know what the fair price of ether is so you start at like 2010 and this Dutch auction mechanism lets that decay you know 10 cents every second until till someone fills it and I think the the idea here is that the the the most profitable person who can make that trade profitable first at the highest amount at the highest price possible will fulfill that because they can squeeze a profit out of it and and it allows the margins of what you call the system like this Mev system the market maker system it allows the first reasonable rational person who can make a profit will fulfill that order first and that's how you're coming to the conclusion that well yes that was the best possible price for this swapper right that's exactly right okay and so I think this is this is why you come into the second tweet saying it's a better foundation for order flow auctions order flow auctions versus what's the opposite of an order flow auction what's the other half yeah well so right well so so backing up a little about order flow auctions so I think we've seen some systems um and flashbots uh has one called Mev share and I think there's some others out there um with the ideas right now when users trade on decentrals exchanges often they um they may get sandwiched they may get front run um and one way that you can potentially just make the user strictly better off than they otherwise would be assuming already that there's submitting a transaction is instead of just letting anybody in the world um uh fight around the transaction or even maybe instead of just letting this transaction get included and see what happens um we can auction off the right to background your transaction and a background happens because uh you know when if I trade on an amm I might push the price it might be such a large trade that it pushes the price to a level where it's profitable to trade after me and so I could potentially get a rebate on my on my transaction um by if my transaction gets included by basically selling off the right to say you're you're allowed to trade immediately after me that's a right that I in some sense have although it it can be hard to facilitate this Market between me and somebody who might want to background me and so if I can get someone to pay me for the right to backward me I will get a rebate effectively on um on my transaction so this is how order flow actions have been implemented um by flashbots on others um with the transaction model um now the thing is I it's sort of a hilariously inefficient way to actually pay somebody for the Mev that's being created by their transaction because what's actually happening there is I'm I'm trading at a worse on on the amm at a worse price than I actually want to trade at I you know I want to trade maybe like at the current price or at a or at a better price but um uh I'm trading at some at some bad price on the mm such a bad price and causing so much price impact that actually is profitable for somebody to pay me to be the trader afterward um to trade the the amen back in the other direction and this is you know this involves at least two transactions on chain um it involves fees being paid to liquidity writers who haven't actually really done anything because what's happening in this transaction is economically is that I the user I'm actually just trading with some with some backgrounder I'm I'm buying a token that they are selling and I'm buying you know at a at a such a bad price for me that they can sell it back to the amm at a better at a price that is profitable for them and so we should just cut out the middleman here we should actually just have the user and the the background are basically trade with each other but the transaction format doesn't allow this kind of um order flow auction and so that's why when you move into an intent suddenly you know all I'm saying is I want to actually trade I'm not saying it has to be on this particular amm so that you have to extract this value from you know by back running and then making a side payment to me you can just come in and trade with me at a better price the the metaphor that I'm getting here maybe you'll you'll like this one is is like it sounds like we're trying to build a ship design a ship that doesn't leave a large wake and it sounds like in this um if the current Paradigm of uniswap trading where the reasons why um the pools get balanced or who we're trading with is because in order to fulfill that order there needs to be enough wake for uh arbitragers to come settle the waters and right now uh with with this off-chain intent model we actually are just designing a ship that doesn't disturb the waters that much is this a fair metaphor yeah I like that I think I think that's the idea is you're ultimately getting more efficiency from from doing it this way because it's just a more flexible format and so these things that people are are it's so needed that it actually getting hacked into the current model and I'll give you another example which is just in time liquidity or jit liquidity which I've been going on like a like a rampage about for about a year um partly in preparation for for anticipation of Unison X coming out I'm talking about how I think so jit liquidity the way it works is when somebody's trading and they're going to trade at a bad price um someone can come in and provide concentrated liquidity uh right around the current tick uh right before their trade and then withdraw it right afterward and what they're functionally doing is they're improving the user's price impact they're actually helping the user a little bit um you know by trading against the user but this is this too very gas and efficient a lot is being paid in 1559 um and uh it's not in this case like not actually going to liquidity providers um who's it going to it's basically just being wasted or it's going to to gas costs um all the inefficiency of this of the system was really what we want is okay okay if I'm if I'm a user I'm about to trade at a bad price can someone just come in and save me and again the intent allows us to do this more efficiently your second tweet your second point in your five point uh tweet thread is it's a better foundation for order flow auctions that return Mev to users this is what we're discussing correct that's right yes so if you want to if right now the way that those work and the way they fit into the unit swap model uh involves like this this multi-transaction expensive um and often inefficient uh protocol for for like back paying someone to background them when really again like when you've got an intent it's much easier to just batch these together and and match them against each other so maybe to summarize points one and point two to the best of my ability there's two there's kind of two birds with one stone in this intent model we get the Elegance of the Dutch auction model which like we said earlier naturally emergently finds the most profitable actor who can give you the best trade and still be profitable themselves and because it's not on chain we don't have all of this wake in the transaction so there's not just in time liquidity there's not back running there's not two trades that help settle a first trade it is all done off chain which helps retain value from going to eip1559 and has helped retained by swappers and also therefore liquidity providers so that's my summarization of your first two points would you say that's fair that's right although we're gonna I think I would separate out the Dutch auction Point um as being maybe maybe part of yeah it's part of Point yeah it's part of point one where it really is like this is the kind of thing you can do with intents that you actually can't do with um with ordinary transactions on amms beautiful okay let's go into number three which I love love is so simple it's still early which is you say that we've opened up a new frontier of of exploration so what so elaborate on like what this new frontier looks like what's needed in this new frontier what kind of infrastructure do we need to settle on this new frontier like what's left to build here in this new design landscape to help this efficiency become even more efficient yeah so I think part of so part of the motivation for you to sub X is okay we see all this Behavior that's happening on chain with say like jet liquidity or um or people like designing Mev uh order flow auctions of like you know MAV action background in actions right and thinking okay like this is a sign that actually there's some serious inefficiency here that should be that should be streamlined that should be improved and I think in my view the the design I think does this and and gets users better prices um and uh and say you know it is more more gas efficient in many cases um and I think that's that's you know why why I think it's I'm excited about it out right now but really once you're now we're up in intense space um this guy is really the limit on just like how you can actually uh match these orders and um and uh process them so for example right now the way that usubex works every every order is um well there's there's there is there's a star of Q processors I alluded to earlier where um you can um use you can choose a particular filler to fill your order and give them exclusivity for a couple blocks in exchange for basically giving you this this good quote early on um but right now that's you know the trades are being matched primarily against these um these fillers what what happens when you actually start to match uh user trades against other user trades um when you do something more like a batch auction um like like cow swap uh innovated I think what happens when you start to do um uh you can do some sort of more interesting math with that right like when you have a bunch of when suppose you have like a bunch of user orders you can execute them all at a common clear advice so there's algorithms for trying to do that um you can you can do like you know match ring trades where you have multiple um uh uh assets being traded and you try to like maximize the total amount of volume these can be you know you can encrypt these orders right like you can um and I'm not sure how much other some of these other Solutions have have done this yet but you can actually say like all right we're gonna have everybody um do a sealed bid batch auction that's actually enforced by cryptography um where you encrypt your orders you you do a this homomorphic computation on it to try to compute basically the the common clearance advisory or you unseal it by using a using a group or some multi-party computation um and that gives you like a like a more decentralized or Fair potentially fairer um auction you can match it against on chain uh liquidity using it using a particular algorithm um you can uh put it in trusted Hardware uh which I got in a moment but like you can you know it's much easier potentially for uh trusted Hardware to operate on orders because they didn't conclude basically all the information you need about them right in the order without having to involve interaction with a bunch of ethereum State um like for all these reasons they're just more tractable and so I I think like in the long run I have no idea actually what these things will look like um but I think I know I'm pretty sure it's going to look like some kind of intense some kind of um when users Express their their desire to trade it's going to look more like an intent I think than a particular on-chain transaction and that's because they're just so much more flexible so there's just a lot more room to explore yeah it's the flexibility of the expressivity of an intent as in it's very very open ended I think maybe another way to help Define an intent is it just provides like kind of a the bowling alley guard rails as to like here's what I here's everything I don't want but anything inside it in this specific specific landscape of what I do want you're allowed to give me and so basically saying you just write the rules of like hey you can't give me less than this and then the mechanism will naturally give you as much as possible and but not codifying it I think allows for a lot of expressivity and I think that's one half of the magic um that I think you're you're talking about the other half is that like since it's off chain the cost of computation are zero if there's no there's no gas costs to matching orders of user a to user B to user C we you can compile every single order together all at once and all of that computation that it takes to clear those orders doesn't have to actually run on a blockchain that can run on some local market workers server and all of a sudden we get really good order execution from not having to be encumbered by blockchain computation and that's my intuition is this right is this right that's right I think just off-chain computation is incredibly powerful um and we actually saw just with with the rise of the of the professional professionalized MAV ecosystem it's a tremendous amount of of ingenious work being and not the position being done off chain um and I think this is this is something where you know a lot of people see Mev as a threat but as a as a protocol designer often it is you know that if you leave some opportunity open to be to be optimized um versus for MAV uh someone is going to take it and so like you can't be lazy as a protocol designer and maybe as lazy as you could have been uh maybe in like 2018 but it also was a huge opportunity it's a it's a massive um support and I I uh think of it as like um a swarm of Nanobots that's always in the air around us and if you just were to like leave out an apple on on the table it suddenly just in your it becomes a core right like because the nav is like the Swarm I needed and if you you know this is scary because he's like you can't leave your food line around but it also means okay like this is useful it's like if I want to like you know clean something I can just like spread you know spread some jam on it or something and you know that the Nanobots are going to come um eat that and then do that task for you and um that's what that's how we how we rely on the system in the in with Dutch orders right in unit swap X is you say okay we know that with a Dutch auction if we auction this like it's a it's a an efficient enough Nev Market that like someone's going to take it um someone is going to pick up this money that's lying there and as a result we can we can rely on this and the user it helps the user right that like this this opportunity for profit is not going to to be left unclaimed because if it were then the auction might clear too late at a worse price than the user would otherwise get but because you know that this is efficient off chain um you can rely on that and that's like that's something I think is is really has changed in the past couple of years where there were a lot of protocols and uh people were talking about and like 2017-2018 where you couldn't actually rely on just there being efficient every efficient Arbitrage being taken and like oh someone is incentivized to like Chow do it you know challenge this thing so they will um that's something that today is actually much more realistic than it used to be who are these Nanobots who are the players that make up this like swarm of Nanobots when we open up this new frontier what are the like verticals that actually compose this form of Nanobots I'm sure we got like market makers we got me V Bots what composes this swarm yeah so I think there's I think there's professional that's right there's professional market makers there's a lot of especially for Atomic nav a lot of amateur uh Mev Searchers um who I think you know it's just like the it's just sort of amazing how you've seen this actually happen where by lowering the barrier to entry to becoming a map Searcher you actually just found that um basically all you know Atomic MAV gets gets extracted pretty quickly by often people you know who are um in in high school or um or in the basement somewhere um or you know I don't I really don't I don't actually know um that's part of the beauty of it and that's you know when we're talking about the ethereum is a dark Forest post uh before that's that was this this realization that we had that actually um the Bots are a lot smarter than you might that you might even have Evan dissipated um and so you actually you know this this someone has if there's some Behavior out there like you should suspect or worry at least that somebody's ridden a bot to take advantage of it um but again like once you get to this uh uh once you're once you're in this world yeah again like you you can sort of just treat it as a force of nature the the kind of efficient market hypothesis here that okay if we if we're creating meth here then it's going to be claimed and we rely on that for example and like blend is a protocol that I worked on with the with the blur team um where we also use Touch auctions because again I love Dutch auctions but um if you know you might get your nft liquidated if there wasn't an efficient market here because because uh if somebody closes out a loan um what happens is there's a Dutch auction to continue it and if nobody was out there just looking for opportunities to um uh to lend at a profitable interest rate then like potentially someone loses their nft but you can kind of rely on have to do a trust fall onto the Mev search or ecosystem and just know that somebody's going to actually claim that are you a metamask user well you're

important uh player in this in this role and this is it brings us to your fourth point in your Tweet thread which are bridges and your fourth tweet you say seamless cross train and especially cross-train swaps will be revolutionary so how does unit swap Act in this intent based meta change the game for the nature of ethereum's roll-up Centric roadmap how is this a player here yeah so um one way one way I can talk about this okay so I I'm I'm really excited about this it's something that that yourself is planning to roll out later this year but this is for cross-train swaps using U.S web X and you can use uniform X for in you know it's in the white paper the description of how this protocol works but it's pretty simple adjustment to the algorithm where um if I'm you know if I'm I express my intent to on ethereum um to have eth on on optimism rather than just to have like die on on ethereum or you could say you know have you found ethereum and I want to have Dion optimism or something like that you just Express uh where you want to actually have the the asset and the thing is if there's a message passing Bridge from the place that I want to go to to the place where I currently am um that can pass basically the the proof of the Fulfillment of this through then I can have my order claimed on on you know uh on ethereum and then uh uh filled on um on optimism and then and then the uh the success of this is actually passed through and the couple cool things about this one is with the Dutch order mechanism uh this can actually be a really decentralized um uh competitive market for how to get money off of uh from from one roll up to another so like the prices is set by the market and anybody who who actually has assets on both chains um and wants to run the strategy can do this um you don't have to depend on on being like a trusted party um or having or having like on chain liquidity or anything um second I think the the liquidity can be off chain um and uh I think that's just it's much more efficient for one thing if you just have Bridges and you're trying to Bridge Over You Know East from one from one uh chain to like some wrapped you found another Chain Bridge do you thought another chain um if that involves a huge uh amm pool like a lot of liquidity providers with just static bridged assets there that's a massive honey pot you just have to hold have exposure to this to like bridge deepth over there and I think it's actually a much cleaner model to have the liquidity be off chain and like I'm holding their native asset on this other chain right or I'm holding um some uh something else you know or die or something like I don't actually have to have a huge pot of Abridged asset over there and I think that's just like hugely valuable but with rollups again often you haven't canonical eat there and third is um there's a really nice property where I mentioned going One Direction but if you go the other way for fast roll exits on Roll-Ups this is like there's a design we talked about for fast Roll-Ups on X it's like on on plasma and Roll-Ups like years ago uh but it's but it's uh it's a very neat feature is you can um uh I there's a fast Bridge from ethereum to optimism right like there's just a a native bridge in optimism you don't have to use the the slow exit for it as a result of that you can actually build a fast exit protocol from optimism to ethereum where if I have ethon optimism I can get onto ethereum or onto another roll-up for that matter you can get it over to let's just talk about ethereum for now um really quickly and the way that works I have my my Ethan optimism and I basically auction off the right to um uh do a Dutch auction and say send me eth on on ethereum um and once someone does they will basically be able to they'll be able to send a message a fast message from ethereum to optimism that then claims my um it takes five minutes or 10 minutes or whatever uh whatever it does um that then claims the uh my trade so the filler um I'm sorry the swapper in the happy case the swapper immediately basically is like faster than um uh even this bridge uh you know within like within like a minute uh gets the gets the money on on mainnet the filler can actually conclude this swap by the time that their transaction their message has moved from ethereum to optimism um and um and yeah so in the happy case generally like this this uh all concludes within you know like uh within 15 minutes or something I think that's just going to be incredibly efficient for for getting money off of Roll-Ups one final really cool thing I see about it is um if you want to go the example I started with you want to go the other direction you might actually get paid to bridge from ethereum to optimism because you can effectively rebalance somebody who wants to exit so if somebody's trying to exit um optimism whether they're they're maybe they're a market maker um uh who previously bridged somebody on to optimism for uh or off of optimism for a few so now they have optimism Eve um they might actually be willing to pay you more than one eighth to get your eth um uh I made Netties and so you might actually I'm not sure how the economics will work quite yet um but they're it's conceivable that you might actually get paid to bridge your money onto a roll-up how does this change the nature of bridges because they're they're I remember in 2021 2022 the building a bridge across Roll-Ups was like a big movement right we have a socket we have li-fi we have hot protocol we have a cross all of these Bridges how are these Bridges if we go into this intent based Paradigm how do the nature of bridges change so I think some of these Bridges and I'm not an expert in how all of these work I do think a cross actually has some has some similar characteristics to how Unison works and other other ones do um so I'm not I'm not calling on any particular Bridges um either positively or negatively uh here but I think some depend on on this kind of like on-chain liquidity and this is ironic for for me and unit spot to be to be sort of uh talking about moving away from from having non-chained liquidity for um for Bridges but um having having uh uh yeah like having if you imagine just oh you you actually get some like some canonical representation of like optimism youth on um uh optimism Bridge teeth over on arbitrum and then there's an amm on on arbitrine where you can like trade that um I think that for one thing it becomes a Honeypot where if this bridge there's a lot of money right now that rides in the security of this bridge um and potentially could get could get hacked by this and we've seen we've seen catastrophic the most catastrophic uh hacks of course in in crypto history are bridges um in part because you just have a lot of money um that's just that's just sitting there right it's sitting in like one contract because the money's off like after doing something else but like the representation of the money is is going somewhere else but here it's like it's just like sitting in this bridge contract that it's exposed to this um to this thing in what I like about us uh for security perspective is only the only money that's at risk is that's exposed to the bridge is um it swaps currently in Flight in Flight Yeah so basically like once the swap has concluded so somebody somebody starts say starts a swap right um and then uh the a swapper a swapper expresses their intent they want to Bridge Over a filler on on that chain claims okay it says I'm going to I'm going to fill you they basically make a promise to fill them now this right now this Whopper is exposed to the bridge risk but then the filler immediately hopefully fills them on the other on the other chain and now the swapper no longer has Bridge risk like they they get there they've already been filled so they it's like they're exposed for like a minute and then if the uh if the bridge gets hacked like people should stop swapping on it um but you know like there's that minute maybe when when they're exposed um and then for the filler um they actually now they they use the bridge they have to use the bridge to actually send a message back to claim the swapper to get the swappers money um but once once they do they're no longer exposed to the bridge risk they don't have any money like like overnight if they turn off their server and they stop uh filling stuff they're not exposed to the bridge so they can they can sleep easier and I think that's getting rid of that honey pot quality of uh of ridges is just is just a huge Improvement to make sure I understand this there are certain bridges that when you use them you create a representation of the asset on the chain that is beholden to the bridge that put it there correct and so like that's right say say we have Bridge just to make up a bridge name Bridge like Bridge one two three Dune bridge I just invented Bridge one two three and then you have ether on main chain ethereum and you use Bridge one two three to get your ether onto optimism it's not optimism ether it's Bridge one to 2-3 ether on optimism and that is the Honeypot because it's this bridge that is now this persistent custodian of this ether that is a IOU on optimism but it's not canonical ether and canonical ether we would say is ether that's deposited into the canonical optimism Bridge correct yeah exactly and and you know it's possible for the swap maybe the swapper trades immediately from that optimism into uh oh sorry from that one two three eth into optimism um so maybe the swapper doesn't have long-term exposure to the bridge uh to the bridge by someone if that liquidity is Unchained if the liquidity is Unchained it might be like they've got an amm right like some anyone could provide liquidity on this amm on a particular roll-up between one two three Ethan opes and that's exposed as long as somebody's providing liquidity on in that as an LP in that pool they're exposed to that bridge risk whereas if that liquidity is off chain the way that it is in unit swap X they're actually not exposed while they're not actually currently executing a trade so this um I would it logically concludes in that it assets that are on layer twos or you know non-etherium chains are most likely going to be assets that are represented by the canonical bridge for that change like the optimism Bridge the arbitrum bridge the actual bridge that creates the layer two not another ancillary bridge that isn't relevant to the layer two that's right and that this is why I think it's it's incredibly um powerful in the roll-up case specifically because so every every roll up uh has a canonical Bridge a message passing Bridge from mainnet to um uh to the roll-up um every roll up has uh canonical versions of uh of all like EOS 20 and Ethan nft assets I think generally uh from the from ethereum that have been bridged over to that right so you don't actually have to have a remote representation of the you know the way that you might with Solana you have to have some remote ethics like so like how do we get there I think there's a lot of challenges and how to and how to figure out how to do that securely we don't actually need that with with Roll-Ups because there's there's the canonical Bridge um and so uh it becomes really useful to say let's just we we don't have to solve that problem we only need to solve the swapping problem I've got eth over here and 80th over here um and then we just try to reduce all the risks around um around that and then you know I think the the other benefit is because this bridge to mainnet the nice thing is the bridge to main from mainnet to the to the roll-up generally is a fast bridge and like the the big one of the biggest downsides of especially optimistic Roll-Ups is the exit is slow um but the nice thing here is this uh optimism I'm sorry uh uniswebex turns a fast Bridge from uh message faster Bridge from B to a uh into a fast asset passing Bridge from from A to B right um and so it makes it it's designed basically to to create these trustless um fast exits right um which I think is very nice would you say an intent based swap Paradigm is also a bridge minimalism paradigm um I would say they they fit together very nicely and um yeah I'd say I say they fit together very nicely cool okay and then I was just I would assume the nature of this just like it's probably one of the big uh ux UI problems ux problems of just like bridging is not bridging is a burden bridging is a chore it's not like friendly for users and so this is probably one of the many things that we need in order to improve the um composability issues that ethereum's role of centric roadmap brings to the table yeah I mean in my view it should be really easy if you want to buy a token and that token happens to be native to tour some roll up um and you had your money is on some other roll-up it should be basically like you know it should be transparent you should see that that you're buying this asset on this on this roll up so you know actually the exposure you're getting but it shouldn't be any harder than buying an asset you know you should just go to uniswap where you already maybe going to buy the asset and you can just trade from one uh from one chain directly to a different asset on a different chain um I think that I think that's it's a big ux problem right now that you actually have to even think about bridges at all yeah so of course this isn't a Panacea for solving the cross roll up composability issues but man it sounds like a really big step towards that direction yeah as I hope okay so that was number four moving on to number five the final one you say uniswap x complements unit swap V4 which is designed to enable new techniques to sustainably improve passive liquidity provision can you unpack that statement for us well why does uniswap X complement unit swap V4 and and what what's the significance of all this yeah so a couple ways first I think going back to what I how I started this I do think they are Universe each are primarily designed to to serve each each half of that of that ecosystem that I was referring to earlier UNICEF V4 is about new ways of protecting passively creative writers you just have access about ensuring that swappers are getting the best prices um and so I think I think you know maintaining that balance is important um and uh I I think I think they're the designs that help one are often very sort of very different from the designs out the other but when you're helping them it's generally not at the expense of the other um at least at least in my view because again like in the long run these are these are our users this is this is the um uh the system and like you can't you can't like just screw over swappers in order to help LPS um long term you'll end up with with no one swapping on your on your decks anymore um or vice versa so um some specific ways in which it complements it so one is I think uh well they have some other way they have common themes so Unison V4 is about um flexibility it's about allowing someone who has a cool design for a decks to build it as a as a on on this platform um uh on yourself before rather than building it as a as a fork or as a different pool um and I think uh that's you know that's similarly with with unisob x uh it's much less opinionated about how this trade actually gets um gets executed and you know again like I said before you can use of basically the same on-chain format um basically you don't have to change your sub X to protocol itself at all in order to radically change how you actually match these things off chain um and I think that's uh yeah I think that's just just a really um uh it's a shared theme there where we thought oh like you know there's there actually is this very wide design space and yourself doesn't have to be as opinionated anymore um and and and we can open up more more Innovation um from others and from and from um labs and from people who contribute to the ecosystem um so that's the second way and then the third is uh some specific ways you saw before because of this of this new innovation and openness means you'll probably get just a lot more pools um on chain and routing uh across uh in between those pools is going to be a tough problem um and uh I I think it's one nice thing about UNICEF X is it actually outsources the problem of figuring out how do we route across um this multiplicity of pools to this incentivized network of fillers um and and generally the MAV ecosystem and right now already Mavs does a pretty good job job of arbitraging pools um I mean if you build a new amm it you know even if your docs are terrible um and you don't have an API and everything it will probably get armed basically if anyone can if it's if it's easier to ARB than it is to like hack find a zero day in in Viper right um because that happens so like if it's easier if it's easier to Arvid um then they will get armed and so um you just you know similarly we have that for Arbitrage across pools we don't have that right now for for um routing the uh swaps for if you've got like an uninformed order like what's the best way to actually write it I think we don't really have um a decentralized ecosystem trying to get users the best swap possible um and that's what we're trying to do with units WebEx yeah the thing that I saw between you know swap V4 and unit swap X is is both that it pushes computation to the margins and like you said yeah like you said uniswap X is for the swappers unit swap V4 is for the liquidity providers maybe you can take a moment uh bankless listeners I'll have told them to definitely listen to our episode with Hayden on unit swap V4 as well as our episode with Hayden by unusual backs prior to this but just to to unpack unusual V4 why does uniswap V4 benefit LPS and how does that benefit how does that if we've been talking about this entire episode about uniswap X benefiting swappers what does uniswap V for what's the secret sauce about Universal V4 and what it does for LPS yeah so I'll start by talking about about unisoft V3 um and so you know with with uniswap uh when we started working on Unison V3 we're thinking about what are the big challenges to to in unit swap or where are we trying to solve and I think we landed on Capital efficiency for for liquidity provision um as a as a major problem solving I think that's true both because um it was just very it's very capital and efficient to provide liquidity at all in all price ranges and you actually just get it's much easier on LPS it benefits LPS but also because it increases the the creativity that lpus can can approach this problem with you can say like oh I'm gonna I'm gonna provide using this you know some particular I want them during using some different like static curve and you can construct that with just a bunch of unit swap positions you might want to like actively rebalance and you can do that as well it opens up this this range of possibilities and this freedom for LPS to to figure out how they're actually going to going to use the system as opposed to we're forcing you all into one bucket and I think um you know that that made sense in in 2021 and in part because a lot of the Innovation that was happening in around amms at the time was about like what's the shape of the liquidity curve that I'm providing um and you're trying to sort of curve for example like providing a concentrated liquidity um you know specifically pretty opinionated but like very much designed for Peg assets or for stable coins um that was that was a big innovation in indexes because it actually makes a lot more sense for you to provide liquidity that way um so so USB 3 is a way to build like your own curve like amm right you can pick a uh whatever am you'd want to do to do that with what we saw actually in 2022 and 2023 is um The Innovation is moving away from just however you know what kind of liquidity shape is your liquidity it's moving toward these more creative um things that actually get into how the Dex has designed itself and a lot of that is around for example um uh well what's what's like the initial price what's what are the fees that we set like can we change the fees which is not possible to really do in V3 although you can pick you can pick which which pool to provide in but unlike one pool the fees are static um can we force only particular users are allowed to trade or you get to auction off the right to um to like to set the fee order or to um or to be the first Trader in a block there's a lot of different new features you might want to add that just don't fit into the V3 framework um but they do into V4 so with with V4 the ideas we have these hooks that allow people to get more creative and um in what kind of uh strategies they provide and so yeah I'd see it as you know this is a wave where if a liquidity fighter wants to actually run a particular strategy they can actually just build their own pool or someone can build one that they can aggregate many liquidity providers in um so getting into into the details of where those are I think so I will say I don't think we have a solution to loss versus rebalancing which is this this General problem of lucrative writers being arbed and exactly I think there is no there's no General solution um and I think like you can there are ways that we we think uh can actually minimize and reduce and reduce it but ultimately and I think it's it's it may also be a cat and mouse game forever and that's one of the reasons why it's not we're trying to enshrine this one solution and be forwards instead we're opening up this this design space where anyone can but some of the ideas I think that um that can be done I think Alexander and his Logan on Twitter had a had a neat idea about setting fees um based on the on where the price moved in the previous block and I'll give you just a very quick uh design of it but this is an example of one of the things that can pretty easily be built using hux um using unusual unit swap before the idea is if the if the price is you know is in Block end suppose the the um the price has moved from you know the youth price has moved from um uh from two thousand dollars to like twenty one hundred dollars at this point so then there's there's probably been a big arm you know price move that it happens um uh in this pool where somebody armed it basically to exactly the right point where they made the Imagine The Profit maximizing ARB um so the price has now moved to like you know to twenty one hundred dollars okay the thing is when they were trading they were paying a fee and so they probably pushed the price so that not like the midpoint price but actually like the Very extreme of when you trading up they were paying they were paying exactly twenty one hundred dollars so if what unit swap V3 you know and or V2 or whatever thinks is the price right now is like 2100 minus 30 bips right that it's actually like like the midpoint price but a better estimate would actually be exactly 2100 because that was the final price that the that the our previous arm paid for it and so that's so then you can adjust the fees so that actually um just move the fee window so that uh it takes that into account so anyway that's that's like the core idea there but it's just all it involves is adjusting the fees which is provided by the UNICEF V4 hook um and I think I think it's a clever idea and that's like the kind of thing you know other ideas on it um and I think we'll be publishing some stuff later this year um on some of my ideas and I'm I'm trying to be pretty open about what kind of videos I'm working on with this um in general but like in my view those are the kinds of things where you can just eke out some improvements um for liquidity providers using V4 features that we may not even imagine that wasn't an idea that I had had which I think is pretty cool it's been a while since I've been an LP and I've never been an LPN unit so I have V3 because I just it's seemingly pretty sophisticated and also intensive but the meta that I've come to understand through my conversations with people is that being an LP is losing generally like you're losing money on average especially if you're passive lping and so I'm wondering if like this side of the unit swap equation isn't complete yet you we've talked about uniswap X and intense and that feels like a logical conclusion of where swapping goes but it's but I don't know and and I I'm maybe asking you for a little illumination here it doesn't seem like we've reached a point of sustainability for liquidity providing inside of of uniswap because uniswap V2 definitely and you just want V3 also for my intuition and for my conversations people aren't making sustainable money in order to supply sufficient liquidity into this side of things so maybe you could help kind of um just like Define the Contours of this conversation it's like why aren't LPS making money where's that where's that coming from and how and and does uniswell V4 fix this enough or like maybe maybe you can kind of take it from here yeah so this is a it's a very complicated question and it's one where I I've mostly just been relying on others work uh for this I've tried to look into it a little myself um my best read of of the literature on this and I think the big focus is almost like half of unit swap v3's volume goes is the usdc weath five bit pool and that's like that's just like the big I consider that that's all right let's like focus on that pool um my best understanding is that the average liquidity provider on that pool loses money and I'm I don't actually so to me this is a weird mystery because I don't actually know I don't know people who provide liquidity on that pool um I don't know why people do I have I have a few possible theories that I can go and do it a little more but part of what I'll say is I think we designed the system um so that if it's you know you should see some equilibrium where okay if it's not profitable by liquidity then there should be less liquidity it my best understanding of what people have people have published is that it seems like liquidity is over provided in total on that pool um but I actually I don't you know I don't know that for sure and it seems confusing to me why people would would provide liquidity if they're consistently losing money so I just don't have an answer to that to that puzzle and if somebody has a good answer I would actually love to hear it um because I feel sort of dumb that I that I don't have a better explanation than but but maybe they know something that we don't know maybe they do Insane one one point is is they're just lazy not a valid answer yeah I don't think so and one of the reasons is you mentioned passive versus active uh at least one of the studies I saw says that active liquidity providers lose more money than passive oh wow really well for one thing you know they're you're when you're rebalancing you're paying gas every time you rebalance you're also um probably in practice Trading um maybe trading on chain um provider and also being a Trader is slightly synonymous right and so you're maybe getting some picture price impact when you rebalance um and so I don't remember if this if this analysis actually included that but like it doesn't actually it doesn't Shock Me necessarily that actually like providing really active liquidity um on a pool like you might lose more money because yeah again you're basically paying paying fees doing slippage every time you do that um but yeah I I I'm willing to believe that the the liquidity is over provided on B3 I just don't have a good answer for why it still happens um one one possible theory is there are people who are making so all these results are about um are on average basically um and I think some have tried to have tried to break it down a little bit it's hard to identify who recording Fighters are one possibility is some liquidity Fighters are making just money hand over fists and everyone else is losing money and there's a it's a constant tournament to try to um to be that guy to try to get ahead and so people so you know that's that's like one sort of like the like online poker theory of um of liquidity provision it's like yeah on average online poker players are losing money and yet or in the peak of it I think like there were studies like they were all like mostly on average losing money but partly there was just a lot of churn and who was actually trying to be there and and whoever's at the top is making money so that's that's like one possible Theory and another is just like people are dumb but it also is weird because like when you mention laziness like the people who are doing the most like who are writing these complicated Bots seem to be losing uh uh money maybe more money than others I don't actually have a good explanation for it so but going back to you going back to your to your question um yeah I mean I I agree and that's why again I think V4 is largely focused on can we actually really address this and make liquid devices more profitable cool and the of course the beautiful thing about unusual before is that these hook strategies are likely going to be built and not obviously holistically not not as a sweeping broad statement but um a big source of innovation to demand for Innovation for hooks is going to become from LPS trying to figure out how to fairly capture sustainable fees in order to make their activity more profitable at least that's my interpretation yeah one thing I quickly want to provide a take for you on to get your reactions to is uniswap's own app layer infinity pools is a new app that's built using uniswap LP tokens as assets and also I think like the success of something like infinity pools would create demand for unit swap LP assets which creates demand for liquidity is unisoft's own app layer that has LP tokens as assets a potential source for LP yields yeah I think that's I think that's possible from what I've seen in general the idea okay look there are these uh passive liquidity providers there seems to be demand for this kind of exposure maybe there maybe like rebalancing or hedging or something um and so like are there ways we can actually provide them this exposed like basically you get paid yield for holding this convex position um uh or concave position I guess actually the term um the question is I'm sorry uh yes the question is like are there more interesting products that we can provide liquidity providers um to get this and potentially increase their yields I think I think quite plausibly a lot of the designs I've seen involve basically removing your liquidity from like basically you borrow some liquidity and then you actually pull the liquidity out of the pool um and so I I it's never been that clear to me for a lot of these products why actually you need the unit swap part um uh or like is it actually does it actually cause liquidity on net to be more often in unit Swap and have you seen like different answers for some of those so I'm I'm not as sure about any of the particular instances of this uh of these kinds of products but generally I think yeah like trying trying to find ways to make liquid give liquidity but it's there's demand to provide liquidity as we see on unisoft V3 there is demand to do this and so the question is like okay can we actually provide them this what they're trying to get out of this uh bed with a better price oh with better yields I think it's definitely um it's something I think is something where innovation of the app layer is awesome well Dan I think this was a fantastic first exploration into what is a brand new rabbit hole in the world of intense and off-train orders and new swap X and bridging uh it seems to be that you know crypto always has some cool Rabbit Hole to throw at us one rabbit hole that I know that's out there that we're gonna go investigate is uh Suave out of flashbots we're doing an episode in three to four weeks with Phil Diane and Andrew Miller I'm wondering if you can just help me incept listeners brains with with Suave why they should be excited about it what the tldr is and just overall prepare them for an episode that's going to come in the future yeah so I'll give you I think why why I'm excited about Suave and it's maybe a um it's as as a kind of like user application developer um so my perspective on what makes me excited and part of it is you know we've we have this on-chain infrastructure and what was one thing that was exciting about uniswap V1 and V2 is that we could build these um protocols decentralized completely decentralized protocols that um uh where basically everything happened on Channel and then all this stuff is done for you where you can just like write your logic on on chain and um uh basically yeah you know it'll be you know it'll actually be executed um uh and it's really decentralized but you know there's all these costs of doing stuff on on chain you don't actually with stuff you don't actually need like Global consensus on and so we now have this incredibly sophisticated off-chain infrastructure um with particularly like you know Mev Searchers but also I think a really sophisticated Builders were often on red relays these parties where they're um they're doing all these complex computations um but they're often doing it in a way where uh you know it involves involves points of centralization um anyway I think the ecosystem overall is incredibly decentralized like as a system um but there are points there where there's actually benefits to being centralized and I think this is this is a potential risk um and it's one of the flashbots has been has been concerned about for years um and it's also one where if you're building applications in this MAV space you potentially find yourself you have to you have to find trust trust somebody to run you know a a a Searcher for a a what are they called um a solver for for some protocol right like you know or or our matchmakers or something you know there's many different terms for this uh or a relay someone who's who plays some semi-trusted role in this off chain infrastructure again once the stuff gets on chain like it's you know it's all non-custodial and and the trades are settled everything but there's this point before it where a lot of stuff ends up being uh you the way that things are currently designed they're the potential points of centralization there and what I see Suave has is is it's a platform for decentralizing all that off-chain infrastructure um I think for uh decentralizes some of what Builders do but also um you know if you like want to run a protocol right now for matching for doing like a batch auction off chain right now probably the best way to do that would be to would be you know have some semi-trusted party like you run it right like you run a server and I say I just promise I'm going to to run a batch auction and um and I won't look at your bids and I won't bid myself but if you wanted to do this in a trustless way there's actually just no platform on which to build that to build a for example like a decentralized Batcher and so um what I'm most excited about Suave is I see it as a place where we can you can build I can just like write some um code right like maybe even just like some solidity and they will run it for me off chain really efficiently um but in a way where I know that it's actually going to be executed I can depend on untrusted Hardware or on consensus or on some on some decentralized guarantees that it's actually going to be run um in a private way I think that just as an application designer would be an incredibly powerful thing to rely on it's in my view almost as big as just moving from like Bitcoin to um to ethereum to moving toward Turing complete on-chain contracts imagine we return complete off-chain contracts beautiful Dan this has been a fantastic exploration to a bunch of new knowledge and I think you've for coming back onto Bank list and spreading all of this cool stuff that you've been researching on over at Paradigm thanks yeah thanks for having me back and just just before before I go around remember I'm Paradigm we're in a cryptographic investment firm um we do investments in a lot of the uh projects that we mentioned today um and generally I'm here speaking on my own behalf and nothing that I said here was uh Financial illegal advice of course thanks Dan I'll give our own disclaimers as well over at bankless crypto is risky bankless Nation you know the deal you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
