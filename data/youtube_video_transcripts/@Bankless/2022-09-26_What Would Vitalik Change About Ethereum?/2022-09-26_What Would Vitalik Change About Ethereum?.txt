vitalik if you could go back in time it sounds like one thing you might change is you would have simplified the proof of State conception and maybe got it in the road map a little bit earlier is there anything else big that you would go back and change are you satisfied with how this turned out had we known the results of the meanderings it would have been a great if we could just skip to the results immediately so the design of the proof of stake system and all of the choices of like should it be a chain or a smart contract or something else as one side of it the other side of it is the layer two scaling roadmap like I think optimism and arbitrome could have been finished and fully trustless by now had we known from the start that Roll-Ups are the way to go and then was plasma like there was this I hope that we could find some way to generalize it but that ended up just not working and then two years later I think we ended up learning that like well actually pretty much nobody wants a scale of ethereum that's just a payment system everyone who's in if they're M already wants something general purpose and so there's no points in making even a roll up unless it's a general purpose one
