checkmate for a central bank is when they have high inflation but for one reason or another they cannot raise interest rates so for example in the 1940s united states at one point the 40s you had 19 year-over-year inflation and they still didn't raise rates and i think that right now there's a number of central banks that are essentially checkmated where there's you know too much debt in some of their areas like for example italy has 150 debt the gdp japan has 250 public debt to gdp and so you know they can't support five six seven eight ten percent interest rates the fed has a little bit more leeway and so they're still in the phase where they're at least trying to you know raise rates from a very low level to try to combat it but again the fed is kind of an outlier compared to a number of other developed countries and you see a dollar strengthened too much then you ironically have foreign entities sell treasuries and start causing problems in u.s capital markets and and the u.s economy and i think that ultimately forces the fed to probably stop tightening by next year even if inflation is still kind of running hot
