foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we got Fabian who is wow he's just such an OG I mean Fabian was one of the co-authors of erc20 which is the standard that all tokens well all fungible tokens on the ethereum network use um and well not all but there's there's substandards that are derived from erc20 but erc20 is kind of like The Godfather or the Godmother of uh of tokens on the ethereum network um Fabian is also the author of ERC 725 which is a standard around identity on the ethereum network and if you've been following season two of the green pill podcast you know that we're talking a lot about decentralized identity and how it can create a more green-pilled World by allowing us to track our interactions with each other create more positive some games through repeat interactions Fabian was also involved in the Miss project which is before metamask and infuria one of the ways that you could integrate with the web3 based web um and he's just been a lead Engineers thinker in the ethereum space for the last half a decade and that's exciting to me because we're now not pushing forward standards for uh tokens and missed browsers and stuff like that we're now pushing on universal identity and uh account abstraction and so um this is this episode we're basically covering the opportunity space of identity and creating new token standards and also fabian's working on this uh layer one called the Luxo Network that is going to put a lot of these ideas in practice they have some really beautiful apis designs and and you know Fabian was right in the right place uh in in a lot of things in the past of ethereum so that gives me a lot of confidence that he's going to be in the right place uh and on to something when it comes to Identity and and some of the trends that we're following on the green pill podcast so uh Fabian is just a gigabraine he's really smart he's an engineer he also speaks marketing he also understands the space really well and so I think this is a really fun episode episode so uh without further Ado I give you Fabian enjoy the glow dollar is a new stable coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty Goes Down Glow sounds for Global income coin it's a dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glow is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the glow Reserve to give directly its basic income program give directly as a charity that gives money to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past through the globe nonprofit you can reduce property by just holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glowdollar.org greenpill

sick the last weekend but that's why my voice is a little different than usual but I'm good now yeah we're transitioning to winter so I think things are getting colder uh and I'm glad you're feeling better well uh Fabian I've been following your work for years uh you're the author of The erc20 and ERC 725 uh standards you worked on Mist web3js uh and lots of great things in the ethereum ecosystem and excited to catch up and and talk about your most recent work so where should we Dive In um I think we can talk a little bit about my my path getting to Luxo I think that's a good idea and then I think the standards is probably the next important thing that's what people yeah right now talked about on Defcon a lot so yeah well I mean I think the standards you worked on have been really influential on the ecosystem so yeah let's start with your your path to to getting to Luxo and and working on those standards so the kind of short version of it is um worked at the team Foundation as lead the app developer um from from there built together with Alexander Van de sander uh the Miss browser he was a pretty vocal person uh at the time you know in ethereum uh he came up with the Miss browser concept and really the most fascinating thing about the Miss browser concept is that most of the things that you know he described in this video are not even done yet and in fact now will be possible with universal profiles and the new standards I have built lots of these things that yet in this video cannot be done nicely um so I just wanted to interject for the listeners who don't know uh Miss browser was a bundled kind of web browser where you would sync the blockchain locally and then you could do web3 enabled things and uh it kind of was it it was was sort of the first idea of integrating web3 into a browser-based experience but I think that it it didn't really take off because you had to download and sync the whole blockchain in order to be able to do anything in in browser extension that you could install and point to inferior kind of beat missed in in the marketplace but it was still useful proof of concept is that is that an accurate portrayal of the Miss project um actually the Miss browser was the thing that initiated all of this so metamask was the answer to the missed browser and we could have also right I mean we could have always pointed to an external uh source for the nodes the idea of the Miss browser was really to try the full decentralized way like you're on your own note you have a local uh browser that can run the apps by building the best browser by building the first wallet we had to literally invent the way the apps work and how the apps even exist um metamask then was kind of like you know trying to make the simpler version of the Miss browser by saying hey instead of making a full browser we just make a browse extension um and like they kind of like you know came out of it came out of mist in a way um but it was the centralized version of it because you didn't run your own node right um and out of this came literally later everything else we had after that so the Miss browser was kind of the initiation and the initial first ever the app browser in fact yes first whatever web3 browser if you want to call it like that um and we had to define a lot of pieces in that time we had to Define of how you talk to a d app right which later you know I provided uh like came up with the ethereum provider standard which was a bit more generic initially we just exposed the web3 object into the D app which then what the apps used to talk to uh you know the browser or later even metamask metamask or took that um and um yeah I mean we had the first the theme wallet running this way and figured out a lot of things along the way so I mean you know as a listener and someone who's followed your career what I kind of take away from this is that Fabian you've been sort of on the Forefront of innovating in web 3 for years and so um I Look Backwards in the rear review mirror at the at the success of erc20 and 725 and web 3.js and it allows me to have a lot of confidence looking forward that you're going to help us continue to innovate with universal profiles and the work that you're doing these days so um it's been a long journey in it and you know I'm curious I'm curious about erc20 uh maybe that's the next at least the the next thing to to chat about tell me about working on the erc20 standard because that's the foundation of everything in this space it is that's actually the least contribution I made I mean from my perspective because this was really initially uh vitalik's uh proposal it wasn't a Wiki page we had to chat like as a few developers I'm not sure there were like three or four of us debating uh how a topic could look like in a smart conduct form and at the time there was this uh ER EIP repository that Martin BC created to discuss ethereum proposals around the network and literally just two weeks before he created this so I thought that's a great place to discuss a standard so instead of this Niche wiki page where nobody is really really paying attention let's just talk there and so I had to come up with a format that was more specification like so I kind of you know referenced the RFC specification way if it's a bit simpler form and I called it a table request for comment because I thought it was a great way to get input from the community and then have a proper standard the request for comment became then even the name for the standard and it was the issue number 20 which created New Year's E20 and um I did some small changes we had the discussion of 60 people over like a few peer a month period and people started adopting it and that this became you know the token what's really interesting for me though is how such a simple agreement on just a few functions can have such a strong impact on all the things you can build on a program of a blockchain right and this is this is in my opinion the most fascinating thing to see how you know what comes out of so little agreement if you want um and yes it built the basis right icos came out of it D5 came out of it nfts came out of it literally everything came out of it um and what I'm now doing and this is really uh why I took this as a learning which was purely I would say a coincidence even you know that this took off that big time there was a need um at the time but like taking this learning and then making this more consciously right that's what I'm doing now you know like coming up with the next set of standards that are fundamentally important for the the future of this space but doing it with some thought and doing it with some way where I can already like you know anticipate things and put them together in the right way that they create a great foundation for things to be built in the future while using 20 it was on the end purely you know like people said they want tokens with Telethon a little bit came up with this idea we discussed around it made a bit better changed things and came up with some basic bare bone thing without really stretching our thoughts far too uh too far in the future trying to make it too complex system because first something needed to be adopted right um that's now different when you have all this experience what happened over these years and you see you know what went good right and wrong what could be improved now you can make it right and you now can make it way better with some experience that exists now which didn't exist at all in 2015 November six months seven seven eight months after the main net was started right was a very different time so that actually you know I think puts puts me in a way better position to like do these standards and or improve these standards and create these new standards that I have done now over the last few years together with my team I'm wondering if you could do erc20 all over again is there anything that you would change given the the gift of perfect hindsight I am actually doing it as a 20 all over again actually we have we call it Luxor standard proposal number seven so it's called lsb7 and this is literally um the new esc20 so it's actually I did exactly that so what was improved is number one um the way of that actually this this token standard calls other smart contracts right this idea was not new right there was ESC 777-223 even seven to one has this kind of uh on tokens receive function built in but how we did it is we did it in a generic way that it's a generic function you call it called called universal receiver that basically can notify any smart contract especially profiles whatever exists in the future in a generic way that means you can now send tokens to the smart corner and the token the smartphone can react on it which is the biggest pain point of es20 for example that you have to constantly do this you know approve and transfer from kind of double call just to like make a Smart Connect understand that he received some tokens which is I guess the most biggest pain point of D5 in fact so yes that's improved uh what's also improved is to have batch calls built in what's also improved is that you have an unlimited way of adding metadata smart on readable metadata to your token so now you can reference the Json file with some pictures and name and description website and whatever but you can also reference other protocols or other tokens or other systems that somehow relate to the Token you have literally in unlimited key value store that you can attach to your token contract which will make these extremely extensible in in a standardized way um so that's kind of the major improvements there's a lot more smaller detail improvements but also really what's what's nice now is the the naming and I think when it comes to standards one of the most important thing is hey you're having an intuitive naming having something that kind of developers ideally get and kind of can remember without constantly having to go back to documentation and reading it again and again and right now for example there's a lot of differences between esc20 and ESC 7 to 1 in terms of how the functions are named purely because they all thought they want to improve it and change it and then they give it different function names and all of this and that makes it very confusing for people so when you do these standard from scratch and you really don't care about the past because you create a new network and you can literally do things right we can clean up that mess and kind of you know unify function names in a way that they are now consistent across nfts and token standards and in the way they act and behave and everything so it's it's also a clean house cleaning task that we did in a way on top of that Improvement yeah yeah I mean having having users is a double-edged sword because you have Network effects that come out of that but you also have a lot of Legacy things that you if you could do it all over again you'd probably do differently um so I'd love to segue from ERC oh sorry go ahead no exactly I mean I fully agree with you this is exactly the the big problem that you know ethereum's uh standard space has right this a lot of people want to propose things but there's a lot of people already went with some way right and they already went down Rabbit Hole a so it's very hard to convince them to go to Rapid hole C or D and if you create a new network from scratch people are very willing to adopt and use the new standard from scratch that gives basically if they're the right standards in the right way give people a lot more possibilities of what they can build and you can create a whole different unit of experience something very hard to to push through in an existing Network and this is really a little bit same with Bitcoin by the way in any other network right they always have that baggage of people have a way of doing things and they kind of want to stick with it in a way yeah yeah backwards compatibility is a uh uh is a problem but also yeah um so I mean I I'd love to segue from talking to from erc20 which is a foundational part of tokens in the ethereum space to erc725 which is an identity standard and just as I prompt you to talk about ERC 725 one of the you know this is the green pill podcast we're talking about regenerative uses of crypto positive some uses of crypto and one of sort of the ideas that we've been playing with is this idea that um with identity we can now have these pseudonymous identities where because we can track our interactions with each other we can have more positive some games through repeat interactions with each other therefore complexifying the design space and allowing for more regenerative crypto uh projects to be built so I'm just really curious to know you know why ERC 725 was proposed how it's going and um maybe you could give us a little bit of a hint of of how that's evolving into Universal profiles over from your Vantage Point hmm um I mean first off uh or you're totally right right the biggest missing piece in blockchain is is identity I mean we have all we have an identifier it's an address it's just a very unhuman readable identifier and that's the big issue um it's not very identifiable uh by machines yes by people not so much um and that's the biggest issue and that's exactly why a lot of use cases aren't happening and that's why literally the nft space is [ __ ] if I can say that in this podcast I'm not sure how you um but I mean it's it's basically a problem because the identify identifying creators are not very visible right your your product your nft is visible you as the actual person group Dao brand whatever created it totally invisible so 725 basically came initially out of a uh some you know workshops I did um and the idea was let's create a smart content-based account system I had them make some thoughts about how to do this I came up with a very basic concept which was the first version of seven to five I somehow after that had this urge to propose this as a standard and I was working at ethereum I had literally no idea or interest in doing anything work identity whatsoever um there was Civic protocol and and what's the consensus version uh Newport at the time in Newport yeah no they were all like the big the big players at the time and yeah um I had totally nothing to do with this I just had this urge that I need to somehow write this in a doc as an ERC which I did um somehow it took traction people got all like really interested in that and Newport got quite offended because they said oh my God a smart kind of basic counts are you crazy and uh you cannot put everything on chain and um wrote big like big articles like saying why this is a monolith and they want to build a modular system uh long story short um I literally thought other people would go do something with the standard I worked you know continued work on web 3.js and other things in ethereum I just put it out there it got traction there was the origin protocol that they like created Alliance and people now all subscribed to using it blah blah blah what happened funny enough is that nobody really took the lead on this and involved the center forward because it was not done done it was like the basic idea um somehow then at some point it came this this guy Taylor Osaka I think and he said hey here I can build an implementation for for this I want to try and said sure go ahead do and then he came back and he had some extra ideas of what we could approve and then really I changed a little up with him together and then I think a few weeks later he just left and said I will stop coding I would become a doctor great whatever then I was sitting there still and when I started Luxo I realized that this standard is so extremely fundamental to everything we wanted to do because we want to create a blockchain for the new creative economy where identity obviously if you create stuff right the Creator is quite important um and not only you know do you need to identify people great stuff but you also need a user experience in blockchain that actually people can manage and really thinking about es75 it wasn't I think November 2000 and 17 when I proposed it um up until really when I started really building it out in detail which was 2019 or so um I thought a lot about it I don't know somehow this it didn't let me go you know this then I had to I pondered it around my head over the years and on the end I really got to like more and more ideas of what can be done with it and how it can be done in blah blah and all of the things and so long story short we build it out over the last two years exactly all the things that were missing that I thought need to be added will build it out it's not only one standard it's a set of 14 actually we have 17 standards now where 75 is a core building block of many of them because seven to five itself is actually a very generic standard it's two pieces it's two parts of a standard one is a generic execution so you can just execute to a Smart contract onto any other smart connects totally generic execution do whatever you want and the red the second is a generic key Value Store what's the what's the benefit over a generic key Value Store versus writing variables in a smart contract if you have a smart contract and you have two functions like name and symbol of a token right you deploy the smart contract that's it that's all you got right you can now have a name in a simple maybe you can change it that's it but if you would add like some third thing like a website whatever right you couldn't anymore if you have a generic key value store you can extend this for the foreseeable future in whatever way you want you could say okay one of these you know added variables is now an address or it's a new product call or it's like a reference a new Json document or what the heck you want to add right you can add millions of entries to a Smart contact now that makes things extremely extensible from a information point of view which can also be used for extending logic and all kind of stuff so that's the combination that's a ground piece that works really well for a new metadata Center for tokens it works really well for a profile smart contract it works really well for all kinds of new type of smart contracts that we haven't even thought about yet and so we have filled out all of this groundwork and we have the thing called Universe profiles which is a combination of a few smart contact number one it's your core account that's obviously your address that's the thing you won't want don't want to change over time right that's where you gain your reputation this one is a full-on profile you can attach your profile picture you can act through it on chain you can do lots of really cool features that I guess more developers will be interested in but you can also better manage it because that one account is controlled by another account that we call a key manager and the on specifically lsp6 key manager and by having a key manager now you can have multiple Keys controlling that one account so that's a very similar thing to what people discuss now in ethereum with account abstraction right there's many accounts proposals some want to solve it on a smart conduct level I don't want to solve it on a minor level lsp6 and year 75 account is kind of like a Smart Connect level version account abstraction and a lot more than that um what it gives you is it gives you a smartphone an internet like a blockchain based account that you can use to hold stuff to hold token interact have a profile picture have a reputation have a follower system have a decentralized Twitter have whatever hack you want on your web free account while managing it through you know your mobile phone your computer your Hardware wallet your ring you will have in the finger uh what are your AR classes act in a game through your decentralized account to whatever else you want um at the same time other people can pay for the gas which makes onboarding very seamless like no more go to an exchange and get some tokens kind of thing you can just like literally go to a service say create me a profile give me three months I pay you next month uh type of thing that will onboard a lot of people to web3 and at the same time they have a full-on account that can even extend that can react to assets I mean the feature list is crazy long and very detailed but it's kind of like for some people in the Box space are shunned but standardized and a very deep level hyper modular and super picture rich I'm curious if you can it if you can paint us a picture of what the coolest use cases that can be built on top of 725 and Universal profiles this Suite of identity based systems you know what are you what are you most excited about that this enables I mean this is this very similar question like you know if you would ask me in 2015 what do you think will happen with tokens right it was very hard to imagine icos I mean icos were pretty okay they were they were straightforward but the craziness of icos were not so straightforward um but D5 you know and and there was it was clear that these things will happen but the the shape they took the complexity they took the markets they created and nfts and all of these things um in that detail level was not so easy to match I mean we knew people can make you know nfts we know that people will use whatever compounded tokens and do whatever but not in that kind of detail same here it's such a flexible core piece that it's very hard to imagine all of the things I mean what's maybe probably very clear is a decentralized social media for example right you can have a decentralized blockchain based account that's your decent or social media account it will be your login to websites but it will also be your social media account but at the same time it's also your wallet so it's all of these things combined um you would probably have multiple of those profiles some you use for anonymity reasons other use as a public person but you will definitely want to stick with certain accounts because reputation only builds onto like verifiable and accounts that you can actually follow and see right if they constantly Swap and change and my son has this great idea to constantly change his username and Discord I have a really hard time finding him because every time I search like his name has changed and it's really hard to find him um here it's you have literally a unique identifier that solve that root identity problem that exactly is the reason why almost none of the other um uh identity protocols really succeeded either they just invented the [ __ ] token or they said we are totally generic and we're off chain which on the end means okay where do I go look and find two well the account or whatever I'm looking for right um um but yeah December social media I think Creator economy right being a brand on the blockchain you want to be visible you want to be the place that you know people know where to go when they want to look for a new mint they want to know and see your profile and see oh profile you know X just created a new uh collection or something right you want to be able to have transparency on chain not open C transparency but it transparency that's cross-apps application right it's not one app having a profile now this every app has the same profile now that's why Universal profiles right so it changes the game for everything and all of these you know doing good projects can now happen because we can create dials where members are visible we have dials with the universal profiles themselves so they will have a profile picture and information attached and protocols attached to what logic attached to it to it whatever you can now have communities run and organize themselves in a very transparent and very blockchain based way um and we haven't seen that really like you know Dallas today are Discord communities that's not a tao it's just a Discord Community with a down name uh attack yeah um we will have real bars let's say we will have real decentralized communities we will have everything that we couldn't do so far because the identity was missing and nothing restricted so yeah well I think that um you know I I just really fully believe that identity is one of the key building blocks of making the space actually useful for everyday people um and it seems like there's a couple competing Visions standards I'd be curious what you think of um like Evan mcmullen's criticisms of on-chain identities in that they don't allow for privacy um I'd be curious what you think of decentralized society um you know uh what do you think of of the other trends that are happening in the identity space and where do you differ from other other major players that are working in the identity space in terms of vision and execution a lot of questions um okay the critic point with I mean I think lots of people in the old school identities this space how I would call that right in the one which was more like before blockchain would definitely say Hey you can never put something like this in the blockchain right my argument would be the following first off it's not about hard identity it's not about an identity that's necessarily identifying you as a person it's about creating an identifiable account or profile that could be an AI could be a gamer identity it could be whatever it doesn't need to be you as a person so what I do I differentiate between soft identity and hard identity hard identity is your passport Social Security everything that has to do with your livelihood and your actual physical person soft identity is your internet account your gamer account your Instagram account anything that's literally more like a creation than it is actually real life right it's a created Persona that could be you know looking like you physically or could be totally abstract today with crypto panks everybody's totally abstract in Twitter now right everybody's back to being a pixel uh figure um and so when you make I think the biggest difference to other protocols is they always try to solve hard identity I don't try to solve hard identity it will be solved through that as well but I rather want to have soft identity that's what everybody actually needs really first the thing with like um privacy you can have any kind of selective revealing protocols built on top of this right where you have certain information that you know people can verify you have and you only reveal it to certain parties or you can have CK uh snarks in some way where verify stuff and approve things that's all possible to build on top of this yes if you put your face on a profile account and then you say that's me people can watch you on the blockchain this is the same today right you put your address on Twitter and say that's me guys uh I mean people can follow you what you do in ethereum right um but if you put an ens name so it's the same thing and that's actually a problem of the technology because we don't have fully programmable blockchains that at the same time totally private so we have to live with what we have at the same time when we look at Facebook and others people are pretty interested in Magnums of public and I believe if you look at look a bit more from a philosophical point of view if you live in a village right and you do something at some point either something nice or something bad or whatever or something weird people in this Village remember right for some period of time that you did it so as much as this right to be forgotten is a nice idea um you can also not go into the village to everyone say hey can you please forget that I did this because I just chose to not want to have that memory anymore and you all need to also forget now so if we do things in a public space and a blockchain is a public space probably also makes sense that it stays there because it was actually part of History um and the internet is the same it doesn't forget either you can maybe force Google or any other platform to not reveal it but still going to be there somebody downloaded this took his computer still going to be there it would be ideal to have a blockchain that's totally verifiable and private but we don't have that so as long as that's not the case why wouldn't we now make public account systems because it's actually quite useful to have specifically for anything has to do with culture groups Dows Brands creators and all of these where transparency variability is the absolute most important thing like how can you become a famous brand if you are like a known that's somehow not going to get a well right you want to be transparent you want to show what you do and honestly if you choose to be anonymous don't put a picture don't say it's your account and you have your blockchain anonymity of the day so that's pretty much yeah there's a really there's a really interesting episode on Bank lists in which Evan McMullen and vitalik talk about the various merits of Soul bound tokens in vitalik's case and off-chain the IDS and verifiable credentials um and I think that it's an important thing to get right so I'll just direct listeners to to that show if they want to learn more about identity and privacy um I'm curious I'm curious if you've read the decentralized society paper Fabian uh by vitalik and Glenn and in Puja and if so what you think of that vision of blockchain-based identity I can quickly recap it if if you'd like uh yeah please do because I have not I'm too busy inventing that then yeah yeah no the idea with decentralized society which is is called like searching for web 3's Soul was the name of the paper but um because it was all about Soul bound tokens which are basically nfts that can't be transferred like you know say I go to some event and I get a nft from that event that says that I go went to it and it can't be transferred that makes it so that it can't be financialized and so the ultimate articulation of this vision is that vitalik and Glenn imagine this sort of web of trust where say I sent you actually I should do this now that I think about it I should send you an nft saying you've been a guest on the Greenville podcast and that's an identity signal about our relationship with each other at scale if you're sending tokens uh whether they're poapps or cell bound tokens to other people there's a web of trust that we can use to bootstrap things like civil resistance and um and under collateralized loans and web 3 social networks with profiles and stuff like that um and so that's that's kind of the articulation of decentralized society and I'd be curious if we could compare and contrast that with your vision and what you're working on with 725 and Universal profiles if there's any overlap it's completely overlapping what I built is exactly the ground structure for this so it's so Universal profiles are the soul of Soul Bond tokens I personally don't really like these kind of naming convention that vitalik chose because he was a I guess play war hammer game or whatever this game was that he was into um uh yeah World of Warcraft exactly yeah so um I mean I call them non-transferable tokens I I like a bit more The Logical naming uh then it's not so in big quiz um but if you call it songbound token the universe broke without a soul and and the problem right now is exactly that there is no soul your wallet account is not a soul this is not something you can ever use for that because you forget your private key and what all your reputation is social interactions are now stuck and gone or uh basically it's unmanageable it's not a reputation system that works in any way um or your friend gets hold of it and now they can be you and act as you um so what we're missing is a soul Universal properties are the soul for sober tokens and yes exactly what I described before you can attach this reputation system that could be based on an nft or a non-transferable token that could be based on some kind of registry that people agreed to some kind of point system actually I would be building these more on top of a point system but yes I mean for example we had a hackathon and we gave people um a participant nft and so on but right now they're transferable but I mean it's very easy to make them non-transferable once we launch mainnet and then something that's stuck on your profile and the good thing is because your profile is very hard to lose not like a key it actually can like this Society in this Vision that I was saying I'm fully agree with this by the way was totally able to happen and the only reason why it couldn't happen so far is because people like use wallet private Keys as their accounts which is obviously not the way it can happen ever but if you have a profile that you in the worst case consult your recover or you even have a third-party Recovery Service you trust or you have even three their five devices you control it from so if like like four are gone you still have access or you have a dial that could gain your access back everything now possible right then you can actually literally get started have stuffed and stuck it on a profile and literally make it unmovable you don't even need to think about a logic anymore of how you moved it in whatever lock case have lost because it's unusable um and that changes the game so I fully agree what they're saying and this is what I have built up the foundation for now it's it's there it's uh let it be to be going very soon there to be experienced um by people and and by developers really and this this is now all possible yeah it will change the game yeah so I'm curious um you know given that we only have about 10 minutes left if we can if we can start converging I'd be curious you know um what what you're focused on now uh how people can can help contribute and and how people can get involved in building this future that that you're working on yeah all right um so basically we are we will start our mainnet in the coming months um that's if that's basically we're starting a new ethereum let's call it like this because it's actually easy to type of network just a new network focused on the new creative economy I don't want to see it as a competition to ethereum it might end up being that but I see it more as an let's call it system Network extension right now but it's built as a new network because we need to have this new basic standards and we have to have this uh focus of these people who built on these new kind of uh setups because they enable all of these new things that we've just talked about in the past so we have the standards we have the smartphone implementation we have a browser extension you can test out there's a whole documentation page we can read about all of this so if you're developer and you want to really build all of these things you for example mentioned right the ones in the social space and the in the not detail but regen how you call that region space uh yeah um then this is the tool chain for doing that it is the absolute two chain you could use uh Universal problems on any other evm chain that's possible it's only on the interest Smart Connect standards our project sensory won't support it out of the box obviously for for obvious reasons um but what's really missing is the transaction relay Services that's what you want so and we will run one we will have one from the get-go and another reason why a new network is we can fund early users we can subsidize their profiles and we can subsidize their initial transactions that's how you basically get to use the blockchain right away without any of the hassle um what we also instigating you know through our hackathons and others for example the one we did at git coin uh is to foreign less Services now because all of this is standardized building one is fairly simple so you can basically be the mobile or phone provider or Internet service provider of the blockchain and say come sign up with me get a free profile and 10 million gas and then you know subscribe next month and that's how you get people using blockchain without the day you know being scared away they can also be then the first Recovery Service of your profile and all of that you know web 2 ease of use we know while at the same time you have a full-on web3 profile and you can click them out at any point in time and even pay you on transaction fees if you like just fill up your controller key with some feed some money and that's it so it requires a bit more things you know that's why Luxor the mainnet with transaction relay service initially and all of these things for this to take off um eventually it will triple down to other networks as well so if you're a developer and Builder go read the docs understand how to do this it's not a lot of things you need to understand if you just want to make it the app that works with metamask right now you literally have to change nothing but if you want to use the power of universal profiles if you really want to do something around profiles you know just read the talks and read how you attach information how you get permission set permission to whatever you want and then you can really invent the next level uh social protocols Community protocols Styles whatever else you want and it's going to be a lot easier for you doing that than it has been the last five years where none of these basic things were solved um all right um I'm curious you know if you can project this out 10 years into the future right I I know when I asked you about like what were the ultimate use of tokens be you're kind of like well that would could really predict what that would look like but you know if you could do your best to someone who's been on the frontier of of Technology trends like if Luxo in in Universal profiles are are maximally successful what kind of impact do you think that that has on the world you know what is what is the ultimate sort of north star that you're chasing I don't know let's say in 2032 if we have you back on the green pill podcast uh what does the world look like at that point I mean on the end this technology these standards will benefit the whole blockchain space at large not just Luxo but Luxo will be the initiator of it um what I see is basically it will completely disrupt society as we function today like on a fundamental basis because you can now self-organize with actual real people that really can use this new technology all that power that web3 gives you of self-organization of like instead of sovereignty and all this now becomes possible and in the hands of everyone and it will change what I see is really like a unification of the world that's I'm not sure if that's in 10 years it's more like in 20 or something or 30 maybe yeah orders will dissolve power will dissolve how we operate on a global scale how we you know act on issues and decide on things we're completely massively disrupt you can build you know decentralized Global voting systems you can have actors and dials that own like billions now and can you know act globally on a fully decentralized scale whatever way these people and groups want and it will completely change the game everything will be going hyper Democratic um everything will go very well funded too I mean this the whole world now will actually have a lot of groups that have a lot of very positive impact with a lot of fun funding in all of this old world you know structures where it was so hard to even do an impact um it's really it will really go to a mass acceleration of everything and on the end it's up to people what they do with this technology it's a tool anything could be done and um um and I really hope uh it's all for the better so we just give people and Humanity a tool of exactly the web 3 Tech stack but user friendly and accessible um and that's going to change everything going forward in the next 10 years for sure 20 absolutely all right well if uh if green pill podcast is still around in 10 years we'll have to have you back in into a review of how it went but um is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say uh no I think I'm good I mean on the end it's really it's a new I mean it's a new technology it's a new set of Standards it's more complex than USA 20. um once you get the concepts it's actually not really hard to understand it makes a lot of sense yeah it takes a little digging initially um once you use these things it will become more and more clear um it's unleashing a bit more complex set of standards that are working in concert together um then what we had in the past where somebody comes up with one stand-up proposal and says hey here one smart contract 3 function let's go and now it's a bit more complex but it's actually very modular very extensible very structured but at the same time extremely flexible and I have thought a lot about this stuff on my team and we built this out thought a lot about this we are blown away ourselves every single time of the flexibility in what you could now build like even for us it's not clear all the stuff that could be built now so I think there would be some years of people really diving into this but it's going to be very interesting to watch what people build and that's really what excites me seeing how people will use this and where does always be going and uh yeah it's probably very crazy so I also want to watch back you know in 10 years and I see all the stuff see how right you got it uh through this technology it's going to be very interesting I mean we've seen names of 20 right we've seen it with all of the other stuff in the recent years I mean looking back here and it's crazy if you look at this what happened um it was not totally like that obvious um you know back in the day when we like just came up with it so it would be like this again just massively on a larger scale because you can do a lot more things right a lot more things um because identity is the missing piece really that fundamental piece has been missing in the blockchain space and I do a claim now I solved it but let's see in a few months and years great well where can people find you online Fabian okay luxo.network is the website we have a Discord Community Luxo underscore IO is the Twitter uh my Twitter is at findura or just search for my name on Twitter um and uh yeah just Twitter is really the space that I communicate likes to communicates uh Discord and just follow follow the mainnet launch follow the the tech use it play around create a profile you know start to care about your profile and use it and uh and there we go amazing Fabian thanks so much for joining us and telling us your vision for Luxo and Universal profiles and um to get out there on crypto Twitter thanks for having me foreign
