foreign [Music] kind of episode for you today an episode that is also an announcement because today Bangles is announcing that we have acquired a company bankless is no longer just a media Studio we have acquired a company to help you on your journey of going bankless and that company is called earnify and the creator of earnify is named Dotson Botsford who you are talking to here today on the show perhaps some of you have heard of earnify if you haven't heard of earnify earnify is this application that you can plug in your ethereum wallet and if I will tell you if you have something that you can receive it's an airdrop an nft a PO app an ens name I don't know any opportunity that you might have on ethereum earnify can let you know about it and Ryan and I think that this is such an important tool that we wanted to bring it into the fold inside of the bankless ecosystem for the bankless nation because now bankless is not just about education but also tools to help you explore the frontier so today on the show we are talking to Dawson bosford who is this sole Creator behind earnify and is now one of the founders of bankless labs the new software Studio out of bankless and we're going to tell you the story of how he created ernify how he's a Relentless hacker in the same way that I'm a conference goer Dawson is a hacker he's attended every single hackathon and so we're going to talk about Dawson's Journey creating earnify and how we've ultimately come to where we are today with earnify and bankless joining forces and where we are going into the future so strap in join us on this journey West and without further Ado without any message from our sponsors we're going to go right into this conversation with Dawson bosford the creator of earnify what's up bankless Nation I'm here with Dawson bosford of earnify Dawson welcome to the show hey thanks for having me David Dawson what certify earnify is the web 3 notification tool it originally launched as the airdrop Checker and that's what earnify has been known for the past two years just zero spam high quality airdrop notifications but now it includes even more than just that it also includes checking you for pop tokens white lists and ft mints ens names expiring and more and Dawson who is Dawson Dawson is a hacker and not the bad kind the white Builder the one who goes to hackathons all the time the one that loves open source software the one that is in web 3 for the right reasons to help decentralize and democratize access to finance and helping distribute airdrops was the first step of that and so what made you uh maybe walk us through a little bit your Beginnings with crypto uh Beginnings with ethereum uh and perhaps your Beginnings attending a hackathon and eventually will run into the story where you decide to make redify yes so the journey started actually a long time ago in 2014 I had some folks in Boulder Colorado where I went to University really red pill me uh orange pill me actually on bitcoin so this is before ethereum was around um actually had some some folks come and tell me about it who were pretty into Dark Net markets and so that part didn't appeal to me but the idea of programmable money just got me hooked right away it did take me a while to figure out how to make a full-time job of it but eventually I got completely pilled on the smart contract idea so you have to fast forward until ethereum came out of course and then ethereum had some time to have some valuable applications on top for then I was after that then I was able to realize how cool the smart contracts could be on these platforms yeah totally so and were you a hackathon attender before ethereum or was ethereum your first like intro introduction into hackathons yeah so I'm the hacker of all hackers as far as hackathons are concerned I started the hackathon back when I was in college the one at my University I flew to hackathons all the time I was employed by Major League hacking which is the company for college and high school hackathons and then afterwards just continue to do more hackathon stuff which was mentoring and then eventually when I thought I was all aged out from hackathons these Global events come around which is just the next level after college hackathons you can graduate to do hackathons with youth global and so I did I think sixth Global events last year and one of them the first one of the Year actually uh in 2021 was earnify it was a finalist in uh the February hackathon and so if uh hackathons were a sport you would be a an athlete of that sport yeah exactly yes an athlete almost always training it was always training how many how many ethereum specific hackathons have you gone to I think I'd have to check my pop history but my guess would be eight and then and okay so uh earnify was the product of a hackathon which hackathon specifically I'd actually have to pull it up I don't recall which one it was but it's really easy to find the East Global page because they keep it around sure all right well it reminds me of all of my like conference attendees like as as at some point all the conferences I've been to I'll kind of just like blur together and I can't remember which happened to where uh so I would imagine it's the same what was the inspiration for you to make earnify so the uniswap airdrop had just happened and I believe it was actually mirror protocol which airdropped this thing called M if I was scrolling through Twitter one day and found that I had a thousand dollars of M eth just for having been a uniswap recipient who did not sell so they did this really cool system where life you claimed but didn't sell then you were rewarded and it was literally one tweet that I saw that said hey go check if you have it at their website and when I saw that I realized if I wasn't watching Twitter all day I would have missed that one tweet and I would have never even heard about m eath then that was a thousand dollars in my pocket that day and so I realized that well wait what if I were to put those two uniswap and Emmys into a single website to search and then I also came across pop tokens came across all the other airdrops that were live like one inch already and really just put them all together throughout a really cool tweet uh GIF that had a bunch of confetti falling it was like a big party on screen I think I might have used vitalik's address or someone's address to just show like look these are all the airdrops you can have even today when back then there were only five air drops that existed in the world and yet even back then it was still useful to aggregate those five hmm and so your your head was at like well if it's aggregate if it's useful to aggregate just merely fives air drops uh it'll be even more useful to aggregate 500 of them for example I would imagine that that was your thought process do you remember if italics address uh had an unclaimed airdrop in it oh yeah vitalik has always had hundreds or thousands of dollars unclaimed and uh Austin Griffin but I've messaged Austin a bunch about it and uh I think he's actually a customer at this point nice yeah that's hilarious oh we'll have to remind uh remind metallic that he need to go claim his hair drops before they expire uh so okay so you've gone to a bajillion hackathons uh at every single hackathon you make something but earnify was different in that you made earnify at a hackathon but then you decided to keep with it um so what was different about earnify that that is differentiated between all the other like hacks that you've hacked together yeah this is an important point because the thing about being a hacker is you're always spinning out new ideas but the downside of that is that you don't always commit to anything even sometimes you're still doing your day job while you're spinning out hackathons but for me I was always a bit more serious about the things I created because I knew I wanted to be a Founder one day and I really followed the Indie hacking movement and minimalism and essentialism and to me the idea of combining all that into one thing which was my career was the dream and so as soon as I saw that people really wanted this tool and really wanted to use uh claimable earnify so I used to be called claimable when it first launched um when I saw that there was desire for this there was a little bit of product Market fit I dropped everything and went very seriously in the direction of being an indie hacker and a founder and so ernify claimable from day one it was obvious that this was there was a there there that this was something that that was worth your time and you never really questioned whether or not this was going to be um successful I feel really lucky to say that I knew that there was going to be users from day one that was just by nature of the way it launched because during the hackathon actually I had posted that Sizzle tweet with the confetti falling and everything and it went viral on Twitter before the hackathon ended so actually during judging the first round of judging one of the judges found five thousand dollars through earnify live and then the very next round of judging the same thing happened with a different judge and so people had already seen it a bit on Twitter at that point and that just really fed the viral growth even more yeah it's hard to argue with that level of product Market fit amazing okay so all right uh you won the hackathon uh things are going well the obvious product Market fit ton of confidence in the in the product uh something that like a lot of early upstarting companies would would dream of having uh tell us uh take us forward in the the next like year of time with earnify what was next year like that next year was intense that was the year of the 2021 bull market so we had a ton of defy tokens launching we had a ton of nft booms as well and in all those booms there was hundreds of different airdrops these had all kinds of new things invented as well like expirations so some air jobs they expire forever and if you don't claim before they expire it's gone and so during that time there were some pretty stressful things that came upon myself as the sole engineer on this like there was an airdrop that had seven days expiration so if you didn't claim it within those seven days it was gone forever everyone had a thousand dollars each so I had to rush around like crazy to make sure that was implemented properly and people got notified and that's just one example of hundreds of what happened that year so yeah it was a I would imagine a very challenging year for any service that responsibility was to notify people of airdrops because it was a year full of air drops you said solo engineer you know was there anyone else working on earnify or was it just you so I've done very occasional Consulting for help with things like the internal support tools and then getting the design nailed down and really a good design for folks to interact with but I've been a sole engineer on the application you see today and not just engineer I also didn't have Ops or CEO or anyone else I was really trying this Indie hack route okay so the earnify team we're looking at him there's there's one yeah and and support emails I sometimes say uh we are working on this and we appreciate your business but it's always been I appreciate your business it's it's the royalty me myself and I yeah all three of us uh we did it how many how many hours a week were you putting into this thing during the peak of the bull market yeah on some of the serious weeks it was coding while eating it was you know after dinner is code time before dinner's code time in addition to just a work week and so those were some of the tougher weeks but actually I found so much energy through it I'm sure you felt similar to David during the bowl it was just so much good content there was such a movement and we were at the center of that movement and it was just so addictive and I actually have some friends ask me about my lifestyle and earnify they ask why do I continue to work so hard or long hours if I don't need to if I could just put it on autopilot or hire someone why won't I and some of that response is that this is actually the most meaningful thing I could think of this is the most enjoyable thing I could think of to spend my time doing why do you enjoy it so much oh I've become I've gotten into a really lucky place here because there's some really interesting technical challenges and it's delivered 150 million dollars to people who are Everyday People Like Us just D5 users it's almost like the ultimate sticking it to the man because big corporations aren't getting these airdrops and the individuals are but they need a tool to know about it and so I feel like I'm really connecting directly with a bunch of everyday folks and helping them go bankless so I appreciate appreciate that service as well of course and uh I definitely uh Emma so I'm a bit of a chaotic individual a little bit less organized uh and so I had a handful of ethereum wallets that I would use something like 10 or 15 of them uh and I got the uniswap airdrop like something like three or four times uh the the day that the you know swap airdrop happened but then because of ernify I actually found it like four more times after that with wallets that the nice thing for me the nice thing about earnify was that like in order to check an airdrop I didn't have to load it up in metamask I could copy and paste address into earnify over and over again really really quickly uh and so like uh I could have manually checked my uh uniswap airdrops with all my wallets but that would have taken me like 20 to 30 minutes especially if they were spread across different private Keys which they were but it was earnify I was like okay Pace into the search bar hit go uh and then you also just I'd also discover like oh dydx also so airdrop that I missed because of that expire oops and maybe if I had subscribed to earnify at that time I wouldn't have missed that um so that's how I've used earnify in the past I mean is there any other like cases like this that you've heard there have been yeah so uh Baki Bupa he's a guy who runs a lot of the ethereum scene in Australia I came across his profile once when I was doing this Santa giveaway 25 Days of Christmas I would manually load up people's addresses and just check them and the highest value ones I would notify them directly on Twitter and Baki had like 60k I think it was like 60 or 65 000 USD worth of unclaimed airdrops on his address and so I got to notify him of that and yeah let him run with it from there that's a that's a great marketing Tool uh okay so uh earnify it notifies you of airdrops that you can collect uh it also it also notified me of my poachy penguin and there's like a little penguin like little penguins like like a derivative nft project I was able to Mint for marinify so it also does nfts it also does poapps uh and so like how do you what's your process for like discovering all of these things like how do you just make sure that you are actually logging all of the valuable potential things that are claimable how do you make sure that you find all of them you have to find all these It's a combination of really linear on the community leaning on my friends other folks who really care about collecting and receiving tokens airdrops nfts just like you and I do as web 3 Builders and users and then in addition it is being a part of these discords being a part of these Twitter communities and trying to really make sure you see the heartbeat of what's being built what comes out who's getting funded and who is decentralizing because airdrops are usually the first stage in decentralizing a business so if folks really want to distribute a governance token one of the most popular ways is to send out an airdrop so making sure you know when a company is kind of getting close to that point or there's murmurs about them decentralizing it usually is a good hint that they're going to do an airdrop the dog whistle the decentralized dog whistle of course uh so Dawson the the big news here uh is that uh you are no longer a lone wolf and so Ryan Ryan reached out to you after he discovered that I found my extra unit swap bear drops with earnify I was like hey uh how can we work together uh so now now there's uh it's still earnify but now there's this uh overarching company called bankless Labs which is a combination of Dawson and and bankless uh why did you decide to come and join voices with bankless so things have come across my plate before to join forces with and I deferred and deflected all of them because I didn't see that as the right route for earnify the thing that's most important to me is that earnify continues to help people like me like you find our unclaimed assets and bankless wants to make that dream happen even more and now I'm a part of bankless in order to make that happen so I'm super excited to call this earn a five by bankless now well we're super excited to see uh what we can help you with uh is it weird to go from a lone wolf to a team of like 15 people it's a very new experience I really felt this actually working together with operations and some of the hiring folks to post some job descriptions previously if I wanted to post a job description from start to finish I have to do the screening the interviewing making sure I decide on the tech tool that applications pass through there's just all these little things that you don't always know are required to make something run smooth until you're doing it and I was really reaching a point that it was too much I had to turn away a lot of opportunities of different directions the business could go like different extra things that earn if I could do for you I had to turn away a bit and uh pump the brakes of it and now not only are we hiring on this team but we're also taking on a lot of new features you know just this week I'm launching get pop integration which allows developers who have a GitHub account to check for get popes and there's over 4 000 new pull-up tokens that are being checked now suddenly after I have a little more bandwidth mm-hmm yeah so uh now now that you have like the bank bankless machine behind you to do a lot of like uh marketing operations all the stuff that like you know hackers probably begrudgingly do because they have to but not it's not really hacking uh what are you planning on doing uh and what are you hoping earnify turns into now that it has like bankless Firepower behind it the other thing I want to make clear here is that I'm doing the opposite of stepping away or moving off I am even more dedicated to the mission that earnify has been doing this whole time with now a lot of extra Firepower you know working together with you and Ryan so far has been excellent It's we're 10 days in and yet I already feel like this big weight is lifted off to be able to get some help with some some parts of this business so now that I have a little more bandwidth bringing on a lot of this engineering Talent to improve how quickly addresses are searched which features are supported you know this is other things like social based airdrops there's Discord and Twitter based things that earnify is adding as we speak and so be able to add upon this feature set to be the notification tool for all of web3 is what's now going to be happening so it's much bigger than just airdrops it's notifications notifications to spark my imagination for for what notify like the the broad scope of notifications Beyond airdrops is like uh make that super clear for the listeners yeah so let's say you are worried about some valuable assets you have in your wallet maybe you've got a crypto Punk and a pudgy penguin and suddenly that pudgy penguin gets sent out of that wallet you don't know why you didn't do it but you get a notification within 10 seconds from earnify that that nft was transferred out of your wallet well what are you gonna do with that information in hand you can now go check and drain or sweep out all the other Assets in that wallet that's an example of a way you could respond to a notification this would be turning on notifications for valuable nfts that you own are they moving are they leaving your wallet and that's just one of a million types of these triggers so it's almost like anything that can be a trigger can now be something and will be something that you can get notified of another thing is if you're really active in D5 maybe your loan is about to get liquidated and you need to add collateral to one side of this loan to not get liquidated you know earn if I could save you thousands or who knows how big of a whale you are it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars by letting you know these things you would not have otherwise known the other use cases that really come to mind are like to me off-chain stuff so like say say you your wallet has a particular state right like and maybe there's an event going on somewhere in the world that like if you if your wallet checks this box then you can get tickets to this event right and maybe you need notification of that that your wallet the state of your wallet specifically like you have a Punchy penguin you can get into this event you might be need to be notified of that is this something that you've thought about as well or is this might be out of scope because it's off chain stuff that's absolutely in scope um that's something I think that also you uniquely notice because in New York City there's actually a lot of token based events I was at nft NYC in 2021 and there was a ton I remember there was a pudgy penguin event um I believe there was a board ape event these are things that you get these unlocks for especially actually I went to that event because of the friends with benefits events and you have to have those tokens to unlock that so that's definitely something I plan on doing the earnify will be supporting in the future doesn't as we come to a close here what other what last message do you have for the bankless nation and the earnify community the thing that I want both communities to know is that you're now one community and in addition that one Community is going to be prepared better than ever because not only do you have the information from bankless you've
