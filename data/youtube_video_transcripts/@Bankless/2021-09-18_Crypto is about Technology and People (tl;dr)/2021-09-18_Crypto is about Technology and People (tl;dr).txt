solana and arbitram both had outages this week the metaverse is extending its reach to all parts of the globe and kathy wood finally comes on bankless all of this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the headlines and important narratives from around bankless this week as always there are going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so first i want to shout out our sponsor tracer dao they've shipped the perpetual pools now live on arbitrary this means decentralized no liquidation leveraged perpetuals pretty cool so i don't have any proof but i was secretly predicting that d5 derivatives would be huge on layer 2 and tracer dow looks like it's going to prove me right but you don't need to take my word for it check it out at tracer.finance so kathy wood came on the podcast this week accompanied by chris burnisky and yasin elmandra kathy has earned her spot as one of the most successful and innovative investors in the world and it's probably not that surprising that she's sympathetic towards the technological and societal innovation happening in the crypto space right now for the most part big financial funds and institutions are risk averse uh especially after the tumultuous 2000s with the dot-com bubble and the 08 meltdown but kathy thinks this is the wrong approach now is the time to embrace innovation we are on the threshold of uh an explosion in innovation and crypto is symptomatic of it i think in the in the crypto space uh we're going to see blockchain technology and artificial intelligence converge and cause explosive reactions so it's it's pretty exciting when i was trying to explain to someone what i wanted to do before starting arc and who's not in our business he said to me oh you mean that in that the future of investing is investing in the future and i said you got it well now when i started in the business that's the only that's the only way people thought about investing and then we went through the tekken telecom bust and then the 0809 meltdown and we ended up with huge risk aversion in the markets and a tendency to invest very much like the broad-based indices out there and the indices are where they are because of what has happened historically but if we're right and all of this disruptive innovation is about to explode well they are in harm's way from a broad long-term time horizon i think it's not a super hot take that we are at an inflection point in human history uh one ready for a massive explosion in technology i'm always drawn back to our episode with josh rosenthal called the crypto renaissance uh and i think as an investor you'd want to be on the bleeding edge of that our market monday post covered some of the key takeaways here defy is hollowing out the banks and they are scared also ethereum's taking could become the new risk-free rate decentralization is security and an elegant credibly neutral system makes sense uh to serve as the fundamental bonds that a global economy is built on top of finally d5 can accelerate innovation in non-crypto sectors uh innovation doesn't occur in a vacuum and the upgrades to our capacity to coordinate will echo throughout all economic sectors now is the time to look forward not to desperately clutch onto something that maybe used to work uh this was an awesome episode uh so thank you kathy for coming on the podcast and investing in things that push humanity forward so that's on the technological or investing side of things but you always have to remember the people and dc investor is one of those people to remember in addition to having an incredibly sound crypto macro market thesis and being a frequent guest on our bull case for ethereum episodes uh he also has one of the most impressive nft portfolios out there ranging from crypto punks to fidenzas as well as a slew of one of one unique nfts and countless others and when you scroll through his gallery you see a story being told an investing story about the benefits of conviction and getting in early but also one of taste and curation and actual care being put into these digital objects i am fascinated by dc's approach to the nft space and the advice from him definitely echoes the other nft themed episodes we've had get the things that you like if you're a flipper and you're stuck holding a bag that you don't care about and there's no more liquidity well there's no value there believe in what you're doing and uh the greatest advantage that you can have is a keen understanding of d5 culture how do you think broadly nfts are changing culture not just inside of ethereum but outside of it as well so i think the impact is starting to be incredibly profound to be honest um to the point where i think cryptoculture is going to become a dominant culture in our society and i think nfts are going to be a prime like propagator of that in a way that people couldn't have expected i feel like we are on the cusp of this digital renaissance and we and i think it's going to be realized as we kind of transition more and more into this concept of a metaverse and while we're discussing the notable people and culture of crypto well that's the point of layer zero and this week anthony sassano uh joined david to talk about ethereum philosophy his thesis on life and i've watched enough of anthony's daily way to see firsthand his commitment to ethereum values and the community uh with anthony his fervor and consistency are really emblematic of the crypto ethos and his priorities are transparent uh i found this episode genuinely inspiring you know i like to see individuals so deeply passionate about making the world a more equitable accessible place and part of making the world a better place is bringing crypto to emerging markets and that's what we discussed on the wednesday newsletter the world needs crypto a robust ecosystem of financial services needs to be global this article zeroes in on latin america uh with emergent tooling to help small businesses cross border payments uh removing obstacles to loans and other basic financial primitives and we're seeing the start of a crypto fintech boom in latin america and i'm excited to see where this goes both for the benefit of crypto and emerging markets and small businesses today they're small businesses but tomorrow they may be doused uh dowser the crypto version of businesses and organizations and they can range from a small tight-knit group of associates to expansive sprawling communities uh there's no limit really to the expressiveness of dows with aligned values uh shared core vision and crypto economic resources the dow rabbit hole is a deep one and the best way to learn is by joining a dow and our tactic this week covers exactly this get involved learn what's happening here learn about the future of work and if you're not already familiar you may be surprised at the degree to which a healthy dow ecosystem can fundamentally change how we coordinate a key part of coordination is social scalability and social scaling can only truly come with economic scaling for ethereum this means a robust layer 2 ecosystem so if you're bullish on ethereum you are bullish on layer 2 scaling solutions the layer 2 world or theme park or metropolis or however you want to frame it it's just getting started the market opportunities here are vast and also difficult to navigate so when ben writes about it i read it and i listen and this week he told me how to invest in layer 2. the places to look are infrastructure things like oracles and bridges so link or the graph or hop protocol or connext another place to look is the applications as they begin migrating to l2 or applications that are launching natively to layer two so something to think about is what types of activities would have had more success in d5 up to this point but they lacked the scalability to make it capitally efficient maybe derivatives maybe liquidity either way there's a lot of frontier around scaling solutions so i will be keeping my eye out for incentives and innovation in this space however it wasn't all good news for layer two this week arbitrarum as well as the layer one smart contract platform solana experienced outages but these two events are not really the same and there are definitely some key differences here when a layer two has issues it can fall back to the economic security of the layer one but when a layer one struggles there's no backup i'd recommend watching the weekly roll-up for a more in-depth analysis of these events but my broad takeaway and i'm also counting this as my final thought is that crypto is nascent pushing products out into the world is gritty and chaos and change are closely related concepts crypto has experienced speed bumps before and will experience them again but something to think about though is that what would be catastrophic even apocalyptic in the traditional world ends up bouncing off the armor the cryptographic armor of the defy space i remember the big drop in may where crypto prices plummeted huge huge amounts in a really short amount of time but defy apps didn't collapse uh they actually had their most successful days ever we didn't need a bailout uh the right people got punished and that to me shows resilience anti-fragility uh crypto has shown itself to be spongy and flexible in the right places and extremely tough and unbreakable in the others uh this is the kind of system that i want to see society built on so i want to quickly shout out our sponsors arbitrage matcha ledger and uniswap we get to sponsor resilient anti-fragile projects transparent protocols with sound fundamentals it's really cool also this wouldn't be possible without them so with that uh none of this was financial advice eath is risky d5 is risky but we're headed west it's the frontier not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bagless journey so thanks a lot and
