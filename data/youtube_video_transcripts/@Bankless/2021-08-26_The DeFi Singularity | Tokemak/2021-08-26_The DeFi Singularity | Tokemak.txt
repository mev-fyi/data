[Music] hey bankless nation welcome to this newest episode of the meet the nation series today i'm talking with carson cook from the token mac project pokemak is a brand new system that is kind of currently in its bootstrapping phase getting us a project right out the door and it is called uh carson calls this a liquidity utility uh and so we go through the in the entire show as to what that means what is a liquidity to a utility and the conclusion that i came to is that token mac is a system of dials and levers and tools that allow people to more strategically and point uh liquidity across defy and so this might be a fantastic tool for daos who want to make sure that the liquidity behind their token is highly optimized and strategic and not just a chaos of mess of just a thousand different participants all doing their own strategy what if we got all these participants together pooled liquidity and had a more focused uh strategy with regards to the liquidity for a token but it goes much beyond that but i will leave that part of the conversation for carson himself in the actual show so let's go ahead and get right into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your dapps all in one place arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use d5 if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrary arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrum and join their discord all right bankless nation i'm here with carson cook who is the founder of tokamak and tokmac comes to me from just a number of recommendations and i believe we are also putting out something on the bankless newsletter so that actually might be coming out the same time as this uh this video if we can get things coordinated uh so carson uh welcome to the bankless meet the nation show thanks for having me excited to be here so let's go ahead and get right into it what is tokemak so tokamak is a decentralized market maker or decentralized liquidity provider for d5 it's essentially the answer to the question what happens if you pull apart a market making or trading firm into its constituent parts the capital that is used to trade the strategic decisions that the executives at a firm would usually make in order to route the liquidity or sort of set the trader's mark on what they can trade and where and then finally the trading expertise and technology that actually sets the bids and offers into the markets okay so this is a decentralized trading firm or would it maybe be more appropriate to just call it a trading firm but as a dow this is a dow and a protocol and it's sort of a proxy to a trading firm but you can think of it actually more as a liquidity utility um so it came from that uh sort of question um but the answer ended up being decentralized this thing into a utility we basically were observing that all of all dows sort of across d5 web 3 etc uh were suffering from the same thing which was illiquid markets and they were living and dying by liquidity and we started to realize that liquidity was playing this very important role in the space uh almost to the level uh that bandwidth played in the early days of the internet so pre-broadband internet uh you just didn't have enough bandwidth to build really interesting applications on top broadband came along and then all of a sudden you could do things like netflix cloud gaming etc uh streaming gaming etc similarly within uh within the area of blockchain uh where value flow is replacing the data flow of the internet what we realized was every project neat has separated their user from their application with a token and that means that liquidity plays that same role uh as bandwidth and with token map we're building this liquidity utility which will enable sort of the broadband moment of liquidity for d5 okay so it sounds like it's a kind of a hybrid protocol human-led organization right yeah you can think of it as a protocol first and foremost but the the holders of our native token which is called toca t-o-k-e are the liquidity directors so when i mentioned those sort of executives at a trading firm those executives are actually the holder of our token and those are what we call liquidity directors that determine where the tvl or the assets in our protocol flow so at launch we're going to have support for sushi swap unit swap balancer and 0x and we'll add more exchanges and amms over time and these liquidity directors are basically giving votes each cycle which start a week long on what assets should have liquidity and where that should flow sort of across the space so you might vote i want to see s next liquidity and i want to see it on sushi swap as an example and the incentives rebalance everything to both attract more in this case s and x liquidity into the system and then be routed down into uh the the venue in this case uh sushi swap so who would you say would be like the ideal customer or user of tokamak who who is like in the most need of what the services that are being offered yeah great question so we built this with thousand protocols in mind really builders um but this is much broader than that so founding teams um will like this right now they're in the case all in the situation of needing to bootstrap their liquidity that's very challenging if someone's building uh some protocol that might be web 3 and gaming related they shouldn't have to be an expert on liquidity and all of this abstract stuff that comes along with with trading markets but they sort of need to navigate that in order to get this liquidity again so that users can interact with their token and ultimately the protocol due to that what we saw coming from the trading world was that in this space if you can solve something that's really built for those users and ultimately for the community of all these token holders as well as investors traders vcs exchanges all of them basically benefit from the ability to flow this massive decentralized liquidity provider wherever it's needed uh in in real time okay so i'm still trying i'm still trying to get my head like wrapped around the actual product and the system is it correct to say that token mac is just a liquidity optimization engine is that a good way to put it you can think of it as uh that's i think a good way to put it and you can think of just digging one level further into like what a liquidity optimization engine would be it's really a liquidity generator uh and director or router so the way it incentive or it brings liquidity in is through this mechanism of incentives so imagine for a second we have five different we call them reactors but five different tokens that you can choose from in terms of directing that liquidity to a venue you basically stake your toca our native token into those reactors which through a feedback loop of real-time incentives increases the incentives for liquidity providers to come in with that token so say it's the ave reactor um more token holders uh lps with ave come in and importantly for those users they're actually doing single-sided they're supporting liquidity and essentially lping but it's single-sided for them so instead of having to go to a uniswap or sushi swap have ave and eth put them both in and deal with lp tokens they put one in uh earn rewards through the system and then once it's in there they then direct sort of at this network think level from all of the system of uh toca holders or all of the toka holders collectively are pro rata voting where that liquidity goes into the end exchanges so you can think of it as not only generating the liquidity by incentives but then also routing it into the different exchanges and amounts so when i think of liquidity like generating liquidity kind of that kind of seems like a weird phrase because like to me like liquidity comes from just like there's just more buyers and sellers there's overall more participants so how does liquidity get generated if you are not just creating new buyers and sellers and trading trading uh volume like how where does that actually become like generated how does that manifest yep so there's at least two um definitions or uses of the word liquidity that i'll kind of attempt to define in a second here and then there's even one much more broad bucket that defines sort of adopted and that can make things pretty uh confusing sometimes when talking about this so defy often just says like hey like liquidity our tokens wherever they go and that's that's a legitimate like definition but we're actually thinking of this more in the sense of liquidity that you can trade with so in particular we're supporting two-sided trading markets basically bid offer or amms on a curve because that gets to this whole bandwidth play where we think that what's going to be unlocked protocol to protocol and and where defy is heading it's critical that you have this very tight slippage a great experience for traders which are not only traders but also users and protocols here in order to move one thing of value into another um so within sort of these definitions that broad definition of liquidity um there there is a definition of kind of how much is in there available to trade and then there's the question of trading volume and often people conflate trading volume with liquidity so trading volume is something we can't can't uh control that completely depends on the actual secondary market of traders which can be users protocols and actual traders and investors right but that depends on is someone going to actually come in and hit the order book or buy from an amm sell to an am et cetera what we can control is we're at this metal liquidity layer i should also say we're not in exchange um i think that's probably clear by now but that's something that sometimes misconstrued where the kind of the exchange's best friend to route liquidity into them and exchanges can use this to you know sort of battle with each other and try to get more liquidity into themselves as well but uh effectively we are just deepening the bids and offers um on order book or rfq type models or increasing the depth of the pool in the case of amms like sushi swap and uni-swap balancer etc um and then the trading volume that just all depends on people coming to those end venues and actually buying or selling into those different pools or protocols so that's kind of how we pull apart and think of this so we can we can actually source liquidity in the more traditional definition of the word by putting incentives to get uh tokens to flow into our system which then get routed across all of these other routed and rebalanced across all of these trading venues and then the trading volume comes as sort of a secondary action to that when traders actually come into those venues and buy yourself from the liquidity provided by tokamak into those venues right so is is tokemak opinionated about the price of assets or are you is the protocol completely neutral about the the direction of assets and how does that go down yep completely neutral and uh this sort of came from our past experience market making the the sort of traditional approach of a market maker unlike you know a lot of longshore portfolios and other traders investors and firms in the space is generally you have inventory of assets you make money from the spread so in a sideways moving markets you're on the bid you're buying here uh you're on the offer selling here of course you get what's called run over as the prices go up and down but i'm sort of over time you kind of make that spread plus you make the fees plus you can make rewards like sushi for example on sushi swap um and so that's effectively now you can think of this at the protocol level that's what the protocol is doing so because you have lps if you think about take a step back from defy in general liquidity providers regardless of what um protocol you're talking about at least i'm generalizing here but you can really think of those things as loans right most of the protocols don't there's some exceptions now but most of them if you have third-party liquidity providers they're putting their depositing in they're basically giving a loan to the protocol they can withdraw it when they want so here because you have that the way the whole system works where liquidity providers have entered basically the the tokens and then the ether the stables that go along with it that means that the system itself is neutral because when we have when we get say the alcx in the system or something it's neutral to the alcx because third-party liquidity providers have entered in the system has the asset and the liability um so because of all that this the whole the whole system is um essentially market neutral um when you look at the system in total and there's gonna be an upcoming git book uh and medium article that's gonna explain this in detail for anyone interested in diving in um and then it's just as it's making the spread the trading fees uh and the in the case of venues like sushi swap sushi rewards that's basically building up within the protocol and the toca holders are the ones that own the protocol so that toca holders actually have a claim essentially on this growing d5 trading weighted basket of uh of assets so let's go through a a story of a particular token as it goes through the the token maca experience so let's use the the bank token for example from the from the bankless uh not terribly liquid uh and if it was that would unlock a bunch of cool things that the that the dao could do if it was more liquid how can token mac make uh make the bank token uh was so how uh what's what's like the onboarding process what's step one uh where's the and then where does the story go after that yep um so uh in the in the end state and then i'm gonna come back to what the next event is for sort of how we bootstrap this but in the end state the way this works is we an experience very similar to a lot of the amms where you drop a token hash in and boom and you provide the liquidity and boom the pool's life now it's different we're at a higher level right we're at this metal liquidity layer so the way this would work is um the dow itself or holders of it come and say hey here's the token they drop the token hash in and they say we're now going to stand up a reserve the only thing the system really needs in order to get one started is a certain amount of reserve of the token so generally the dow provides this and what this does is serves as sort of a final backstop there's really interesting uh il mitigation techniques here that link together a surplus deficit management within the system as well as localized um sort of rebalancing or slashing mechanics on uh toca stakers there's never globalized losses with that it's always local to a specific reactor more info coming on that soon um and and and then last this reserve so the reserve always makes sure that we have enough sideline that anyone who acts as a liquidity provider is always made whole and can always redeem one for one and that's very important because when you think about composability there's so many things that will be built on top of this um every time someone puts in an asset they get back a t acid so if you put in uh let's let's just use s and x again as an example you put in s and x you get back t s and x and that can be redeemed like that's out in the in the system providing liquidity for the snx token across across the space and at any point you can then redeem uh your snx back one for one uh with the t acid so coming back to you that was a bit of a sidebar but coming back to your actual question um the process for a new a new or existing protocol would be they come they provide a certain amount of their token into the reserve there's no set amount that they need to do if that is a hundred thousand dollars of the the asset or 10 million dollars of the asset it basically says how powerful their their actual reactor which turns on can be because there's a multiplier for how much liquidity from the actual third-party liquidity providers which can be spread across the community that that reactor can provide so i'll just use an example if you had a five million dollar reserve that you stood up um in abc token um initially when we're when we're running this thing very conservatively it would mean that that actual reactor can provide 15 million dollars of abc paired with 15 million dollars of ether stable so 30 million dollars of liquidity can be provided for that project across d5 so stand up the re reserve the reactor turns on and then at that point the incentive feedback loop starts so all of a sudden toka holders can stake in as liquidity directors abc holders can can provide the assets as liquidity providers and and then basically you have this rebalancing that happens where the reward feedback loop happens and effectively you have you bootstrap now in the inventory liquidity you need and you're now using the liquidity directors to route those into sushi swap unit swap balancer 0x at launch and more exchanges in the future okay so the the case for token mac like the bull case for token mac is that like uh it takes in a bunch of assets that is and then kind of therefore it's liability because it you know it's those assets are going to go out in the future in theory um maybe they don't but they are a liability nonetheless uh and then they using token mac like its own pool of capital uh starts to collect trading fees and that stays inside of the system so i'm assuming some part of it goes uh does it do any part of those trading fees go to the people that posted the reserve or yes yeah because they're looking there to some degree the liquidity providers uh and then some so the some amount of the fees is also retained by the token max system and that stays in the system yep so effectively what you have is i'll put the reserve to the side for a second because those are the ones provided by by the dows but for the community out at large that can participate as liquidity providers or liquidity directors um initially what we're doing is decentralizing the protocol so you're earning everything in toca and the protocol itself so not our team not even really the dow it's not in our multisig but right into a contract we're earning these rewards and the token holders have a claim on that now at the beginning they don't have the ability to sort of redeem that but down the road i'm sure the token community determined to that they want to vote this on it could be that you could actually burn your toka or somehow redeem um with a buy-back in order to pull out your share of this like d5 weighted portfolio of assets that have built so you can think of at the beginning the fundamental value of toca is that this is tokenized liquidity like each unit of toka is one unit of liquidity you get your pro rata share it's a little bit like governance on steroids like from one perspective you can think of it as tokenized liquidity the other perspective you can think of as kind of governance on steroids because now instead of just thumbs up thumbs down on improvement proposals you're actually impacting the real-time operation of the system by voting where the liquidity goes and you and you alone have that vote there's no sort of thresholds if you want to uh you know if you're a shrimp or whale you can direct that much liquidity um in any reactor you want out to the end venues over time then to your point about the fees um the spread the rewards et cetera since that's building up a protocol uh these protocol controlled assets we call them it means that over time the the utility or the value of uh toca is not just that it's tokenized liquidity but also that it's backed by this sort of growing black hole of assets and internally we talk about the moment of the singularity which is when that grows big enough to where you actually don't need third-party lps so eventually you can actually have the system have all the self-contained assets it needs to basically run itself it's still governed by the toca the token holders and they're still routing this liquidity utility and directing it basically with with their toca but at that point you don't need third party lps and you can do really really interesting things and eventually that should mean spreads can go to zero or near zero and that's when this thing really starts to uh approximate uh sort of uh broadband moment and bandwidth so where where are all the places that liquidity can be pointed to and why might toca holders point them in different spots based on certain market conditions yep um so so this gets to um almost more the art than the science of liquidity and there's no necessarily one answer so we think that in the future uh dows will basically um vote on or or um uh knight someone as their liquidity director um that sort of uses their reserve of toca and by the way one thing i didn't say that we might not come back to so i'll just say it here is these projects when they stand up their reserve um in the early days uh at a minimum we have a process either through a sort of a trad five swap where we're basically lending to each other or through a trade where they can get enough toka to be a powerful liquidity director day one and then we get the enough of the tokens that we stand up the reserve is the backstop for the reactor so both protocols kind of win and any protocols that are interested should just reach out to me or the team and then we can discuss and we've had a lot already talk reaching out to us in the last week since since launch um uh but but basically uh coming back to where where they would route it to and why if you're um a founder or someone on a founding uh uh the founding team of a dow you probably you might know okay over on this venue we know that we have the protocols linking together in this way or there's something interesting on the protocol that you know plugs into liquidity on sushi swap or in the future some more exotic venues that we plug into so they might know hey we really want to increase the liquidity or what i call the bandwidth really of the system there because we know other protocols or our protocol uses it in this unique way others might look and say hey we're already incentivizing uniswap we have pretty deep liquidity there let's just double down invoke most of it there this gets the art of science or they might say we have the deep liquidity on unit swap let's also get some from other incentives let's get some deep liquidity from tokamak on the sushi swap and onto balancer so they might start voting around there and so there's really no short answer to it or one size fits all it's really what the criteria both in terms of kind of traders and users out in the system and where the trading activity is and we're going to give the user not only the tool but also the feedback loop to see how effective it was so after the different cycles they can look and see okay here's where cycles are what we use for each sort of uh cycle or segment of liquidity deployment so after it they can say okay of the all of the ave in this reactor um 60 was voted here 30 was here 20 was here and so on and then they can see per unit of liquidity or per quantity of tokens that were voted somewhere how much trading volume actually happened there so they can see did they get good bang for their buck wherever they routed the liquidity and was their actual use by traders users protocols etc of the liquidity that was provided there and then that will mean for the next cycles the network will just likely at least for those that are paying attention to that signal will start rebalancing kind of and adjusting where the liquidity goes as a result of that feedback can liquidity be routed to some like a lending protocol like ave or compound yeah it's a great question so at launch no um but there's nothing and that was really because we were focused hyper focused on some of this two-sided uh trading market bandwidth but there's nothing that says this couldn't go we couldn't expand this like our first path probably is to expand to more exchanges we'll probably exhaust that fairly quickly then there's nothing that says this can't route into things like urine valves rari ave compound cream like any of these these len borrow protocols or any any of these other more exotic things um uh and i and i think that that's probably where where the future will go and that's a natural way that this can expand the the other thing along that kind of line of thought thinking is at launch where we're on l1 um however we found a really interesting way to make it once you stake your token you can rebalance your votes of which reactors you want to direct liquidity and where you want to vote without paying any more gas we were very conscious of the current state of gas in the system and making sure that this was the best experience possible for for users so we did a lot in our architecture to make sure that was the case going forward what we want to do is we want to expand not only into l2 but also other chains as it develops and you can imagine since we have these cycles where we rebalance the liquidity we can actually the end state of this will be take the tokens wherever they are so any to any we call it so take the tokens wherever and then allow the liquidity of directors to uh direct that liquidity to any whether regardless whether that's an ethereum based layer higher layers other chains etc as long as there's a tunnel to get to and back for that we can rebalance on our different liquidity cycles so that's also where this is going hey guys i hope you are enjoying this meet the nation with carson coming up in the second half of the show we finish off the conversation as to what a a token liquidity uh utility looks like and where are all the points that tokens can be pointed to in d5 what what's the difference between a t token that is the like the liquidity token that comes out of token mac and the difference between that and you know a normal lp token out of uniswap and then of course i asked carson to show me or tell me a story about the maximally successful version of tokemak if this thing just hits all the boxes and executes uh according to the vision what does that look like and the the those answers answers to that those questions i always find are very very fun to ideate about uh and so before we get into the second half of this current conversation with carson we must pause and talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so for for daos that have a token and again from for me just bankroll style comes to mind uh tokenmac can be this like you said this this liquidity utility and so bankless dow could use token mac to put bank tokens in the ecosystem wherever it wants it to go for whatever purposes that they need to be served right if so for some reason if they do indeed want a lot of bank supply lending inside of compound maybe that that's where they vote for that to go first compound would have to accept bank as collateral and you guys would also have to actually onboard lending protocols um so right now maybe it's just more of a uh oh for some reason banquet style wants a ton of liquidity specifically on sushi swap or on xerox and for whatever reason but now token mac allows that for for that to happen so it's kind of like taking this very chaotic uncoordinated game of liquidity which is done and fragmented by just a bajillion different players and then focuses it into one single entity which can do things a little bit more purposeful and intentful and maybe a little bit more strategic is that how am i doing so far no that's that's a perfect description and i'll say just to go beyond not just one single eyes entity right but one thing uh one singular um uh decentralized entity importantly where you have control and this is actually going to this this is what is kind of the crux of it for the builders and and the founders of these different dows it's going to turn not only a huge headache and a current cost center massive cost center uh and i've heard the the horror stories and uh i came from the market making a trading world so i knew how that worked and i realized this is not fair and it's not right to builders and there's a better more defy centric way to do this and so it was basically like hey let's just upend the industry that i came from by the way it can be good for market makers still that understand this and realize how to plug into it because they can market make much bigger sort of pools of capital with this down the road but they have to learn from this and adapt and figure out this new way of working so effectively what you said is exactly correct so like let's use the case of bank um if you're most of the builders right now right when they're thinking about their uh their pie chart of where all their tokens go they usually have like some amount that are for emissions that which might go to their their single asset staking pool um and that thing might be you doing something useful on the protocol might not might just be that they're removing cell pressure some some cases they're doing something really novel some cases not but they're paying out either revenue or emissions inflation whatever you want to call it in their token so they have a certain piece of the pie that's there they have another piece of the pie that they generally go to their pool twos right they say they pick una swap or sushi swap they put that in and say take your lps take them here and we'll pay them because they know they need liquidity what we can do is actually replace those two with a single pool because if instead and we've had a couple different dows already reach out to us on this and i know there's gonna be a lot more because we haven't started pushing this you can say hey instead of worrying about two pieces of the pie that you now have to budget to your single asset staker and this complex process for for your pool 2 for the people that actually are lp staking instead if you have abc or let's use bank just incentivize one pool that is t bank so then your users have to take bank put it into tokamak which means then through all the mechanics we were talking about your liquidity is solved sort of across d5 pay out your inflationary rewards to a t bank so the users to the t bank stakers so the users take the t bank that they get back from uh token mac these are t assets work kind of like a assets uh a acid c assets etc um take those t assets take them in now all of a sudden you're paying out inflation to one pool you've cut down what you've budgeted roughly in half in terms of the inflation of the protocol and you're still solving uh solving liquidity sort of in a s in a matter that's very in a manner that's very simple for users because now they can just take one token stake it in there and never have to deal with uh sort of lp tokens and making sure that hey i've got a you know a million dollars of bank but i don't have a million dollars of eth with it so i guess i can lp now they can just take the ones they have put it in there and then still earn the rewards from the protocol that they're trying to support outside of tokamak does token mac have its own like supply of uscc and eth and other like pairs that it provides liquidity towards all of these dows that needs tokens yes so at launch we'll be using our own internal reserve um for for ethernet meaning that the dow owns um of and stables uh in order to pair with the dow provided ones that we don't have access to at the moment in order to turn on their uh their reactors so let's just use bank as an example if bank has a reactor and we have the bank reserve that's provided by by uh the bank list dow here what would happen basically is the tokens anytime the liquidity directors are routing that let's say to sushi swap so 2 million bank goes to sushi swap our manager contracts basically identify how much of the eth or stable for the target pool it needs to pull it pulls that in on each liquidity cycle then it deposits that into the amm and so it basically is pulling between these different single-sided pools and then orchestrating them across all of the different uh target exchanges uh in that manner can the uscc or eth in the token mac like treasury can that be somehow provided across multiple assets at all like it can provide liquidity to bank and to other tokens all simultaneously correct it's one big pool so it isn't sort of uh is that the magic is that where the magic comes from that is that is one piece of the magic and there's about six more pieces of the magic which uh i can definitely uh uh route you uh and and your your listeners here um too once we have the article out um it's a bunch of different things working in in gun shared uh you can kind of think of it as um think of it like this um let's use ave for example avira compound right um at any given point in times when they take deposits they're they're lending out and they're just playing with the aprs in order to try to guarantee that a bank run can't happen right at any point in time they actually don't have the assets in the system so if everyone withdrew you couldn't make people whole but the magic of incentives are with the aprs are good we have those but we have so many more levers than that so because of how il works right and permanent loss when you when something goes into deficit you actually get a surplus somewhere else now it doesn't cover all of this and this gets to where the liquidity directors not only direct but they also are collateralizing a reactor so as these things move around we can not only play with the aprs but there's also this sort of magic that we uh that we do and and i'm not trying to use that to uh to make people think something spooky or crazy is going on we're going to divulge exactly how this works in a in an article coming up but effectively um when you have that that ability to have surpluses elsewhere in an end-to-end pool system that can cover a certain amount of the deficit in the event that one is underwater and everyone does withdraw and the cycles also help this you can pull that amount plus you can pull a small small amount of what we would call slashing basically to the localized liquidity directors that were collateralizing that reactor that will actually happen quite rarely and then additionally you have this reserve to fall back on so the reserve is basically to make sure that liquidity providers are always made whole so sort of top of the stack is the liquidity providers they are always always redeemable one for one if you put in bank or snx or alcx or whatever into the system as a liquidity provider and you get back the t version of that you can always redeem that one for one with how this system works so interestingly the liquidity providers no longer have so so there is no uh i would agree with kind of that sentiment out there that there's no such thing as il um uh il removal it's all just mitigation and sort of where you push it around um and trust me when you see how this all works it's really really interesting but we do remove from the liquidity providers perspective they are not the ones that hold the i o and that's really interesting because right now users have to be advanced enough to figure out how to put two assets into um sushi swap and uniswap and they've done a good job to make that especially with like univ v2 where it's not you know too complex it's not too hard for users but that's still friction plus then they have to deal with the il here if you have the assets put it in don't deal with the complexity and you don't have to deal with the il the rest of the system and some place else going into the liquidity uh directors who are the more advanced users they're the ones that deal with it and where the ultimate risk falls too so it's a really interesting sort of pulling apart of risk and reassigning it elsewhere right yeah and that has always been one of the beauty beauty uh beauties of defy is to extract and like precisely point risk like really that's all that that's kind of how dfi started with maker dow right like maker dao was like let's shove all the risk into ether and mkr and remove all the risk from dye uh and really that's how that's kind of how d5 started um can you summarize and compare and contrast the differences between um me and say say i'm bullish on ave and i for some reason think that uh providing liquidity on ave on uniswap is the best form of yield for me and so i do that with uh with my ave token uh and therefore i probably also would also have to own fifty percent of eth um and to do that on your swap can you and then and then i get the unit swap lp token back and i'm getting some sort of like revenue from uni uniswap from the trading fees can you compare and contrast that uh uniswap lp token with a t token from tokomac so uh first and foremost you won't have any of the il as liquidity provider um if you go through tokemax so you don't have to deal with any of of uh that you also don't have to deal with making sure that you have enough uh eat if you're a whale on a certain product in this case like ava you don't have to also have enough enough eath now what you're earning on tokamak um at least for the sort of first phase of this is toca so you are actually earning more which actually you can feedback in the system for compounding in really interesting ways right you can come in as an ave liquidity provider earn toka then take that token put it in the other side of the reactor as liquidity director earn rewards there so you get really interesting compounding effects um this will sort of come coming back to what you were saying what you do with the lp tokens ultimately if you're a user that reps can can wrap their head around il not worried about that had both sides then i would say the big difference is where were you going and staking uh that that uh token so if there was a good pool 2 or lp um staking option for you where you were earning something in a project you believe in then you're really just just balancing the quantity of toka and your belief in in tokamak and topo over here and then the quantity of whatever the other asset is someplace else and uh the value and your belief in in that protocol so that's kind of the trade-off you're making between these two things and there's gonna be really interesting things we can do down the road with composability where hopefully users won't even have to make that choice nearly as much and you can stack some of these things is there something that we can say about how much feeding our trading fees would be generated by simply just lping to uniswap versus lpng to token mac yeah so if you were on unit swap i'll start with that one because obviously on sushi swap there's also the sushi rewards on uniswap for sure after launch you're going to make a massive amount further because we're incentivizing this very nicely out and we really want to decentralize this right this isn't just us wanting to give out emissions or inflation we want the users that are using this to be owners of the protocol so in the early days we want to want to pay out toca and reward people so you're going to be earning i won't throw out the percentage because it all depends on how many liquidity providers come in but trust me it's going to be way way way juicier than just going directly into unesco sushi swap of course you have the sushi rewards so that pulls back a little bit but i can also tell you looking at the thing with the exception of maybe certain onsen or double reward type pools in general you're going to be making a lot more also on tokamak so coming there and then even if you want to support the liquidity on your swap or sushi swap if you abstract it away come into to uh tokamak as a liquidity provider it's really the sweetest deal across the board for the liquidity providers um entering the system in uh in tokamak because you don't deal with the il you don't deal with the complexity of both you don't have to manage the lp tokens rewards are going to be much higher and you can still then as if as long as you have some toka or as long as collectively they're voting you can still support the liquidity down on the end venues right your tokens can be used to go to sushi swap unit swap balancer 0x whatever your target exchange was but now in a much much simpler fashion for users and you'll be getting paid more as well so to finish off this exploration of token mac can you give me the version of the future in which token rack is maximally successful what does that look like yeah so in a version where it's maximally successful this thing really is the liquidity bandwidth provider uh in the space so again as in d5 and web3 and everything that's too common as we link in gaming and nfts all of these things need liquidity bandwidth uh and effectively uh what tokemap will be doing is allowing people to buy and sell anything with minimal loss so our goal our end goal is to have this thing be a black hole of assets that has any of the assets you could buy or sell within it that means we don't need liquidity providers liquidity directors are directing this in real time so that there's deep liquidity anywhere and if you have abc token and the protocol or user needs to get to xyz token you can actually do that with no slippage in the market we want to move spreads to zero and have the price be the price and no longer have this concept of if i'm buying i'm paying a higher price if i'm selling i'm paying paying a lower price that's the moment that we get to the bandwidth of liquidity and that's where we'll unlock all kinds of things as these protocols build and build on top of each other this can be kind of the base layer of liquidity that will enable that very cool carson if people want to find out more about token mac and get involved where should they go yeah so uh you can go to tokamak.xyz to see our site you can join our discord there there's links for all those uh go to medium to at tokamak to look at i think five or six articles that we have a lot more coming git book forthcoming you can follow us at tokenreactor follow me at liquidity wizard um and just reach out to the team uh in discord we're all very uh especially a couple of them that that aren't quite as inundated with requests as me are very responsive so ask questions it's a deep rabbit hole don't be intimidated and uh happy to help and and and help guide people through the process uh wherever we can well carson thank you for coming on the show and introducing tokemak to the nation
