I'm gonna go through five of the top misconceptions I hear about the merch the first one is this there is a misconception that you can withdraw your staked eth after the merch is that correct or incorrect and why uh it's incorrect so the merge is basically only the transition to privilege stage you're going to need another upgrade uh to have withdrawals and the reason there is just the merge is already the most complicated change we've ever done to ethereum and we want it to limit it as much as possible to make sure that it goes well so the upgrade after the merch will have withdrawals if there's already specs being worked on for it so if you have staked if guys what this means is post merge it'll still be locked in place you will not be able to withdraw it but there will be another upgrade coming down the pipeline the order of I don't know months are we talking about or years and that will be another upgrade post post merge maybe six months time range six months to a year something like that is that what you expect him yeah basically that's usually what we what we do yeah okay there we go uh the second misconception that we hear so often is that the merge will lower transaction fees there's a little bit of Truth here but it's just a tiny bit of Truth can you tell us about this yeah basically can you tell us about this misconception uh so in short it it won't basically like uh proof of work versus proof of stake doesn't change the throughput of the chain uh ethereum strategy to lower transaction fees is uh Roll-Ups and making it as cheap as possible to use them and so that'll be a whole other series of upgrades which is also starting to be worked on okay so the merge will not lower transaction fees folks uh number three misconception the merge will lower eth issuance um actually that one's not a misconception that's true yeah that's actually true um so proof of work issuance I don't have the numbers in front of me but it's like percent yeah something so and the way I the way I look at it um is if you go on an ether Scan they have like an issuance chart for mainnet um and there's like four lines in it there's like proof of work issuance proof of work Uncle issuance uh proof Uncle rewards issuance and then the E2 issuance the beacon chain and so if if you look at that like you can literally remove the three first lines and you just have the the proof of stake issuance left and it's about a 90 like the proof of stake issuance is about 10 of the total so it's about a 90 reduction it varies like on a daily basis uh you know there's some error bars on these numbers but like yeah there's a massive issuance reduction so putting that in misconception format some people think that the merge will increase if issuance and it won't it will decrease issuance uh total eats Supply at least issuance over time will be decreased over time uh number four there's a misconception that users applications will have to do some work to upgrade maybe click a button and download something what is that misconception what will users and applications need to actually do uh post merge so assuming so again if you're not if you run a node or you're a Staker or you're an infrastructure provider like you definitely need to do stuff blog.etheoreum.org has the whole list if you're just using your theorem like sending transactions or deploying smart contracts um basically you need to do nothing like everything will keep working as is um the one small thing I'll say for smart contracts is if you use the block time uh or if you use the block numbers I like proxy for time that changes a bit so like today blocks are about 13 seconds with a lot of variance after the merge they're always like a multiple of 12 seconds um so like for some yield farms and like apy products like that matters because if you calculate like a certain apy over a certain number of blocks after the merge you're gonna be issuing it slightly quicker um but it's it's not like uh you don't have to do anything that will just happen uh you should be aware of that and if you want to upgrade your contracts you should but that's really like the only only the only thing that can affect how applications work so if you are a regular everyday normal user not running a eighth node there's nothing you will have to do if you're just using metamask continue just using metamask we want to click any buttons there's no upgrade it will roll over automatically um the fifth misconception is you can't run a node an ethereum node without staking so without 32 eth for example can you tell us about why is that a misconception Tim yes uh so there's two types of nodes right on the network there's validators which are nodes that produce blocks which are like minors today to run one of those you do need to run you do need to put 32 East um and every 32 East gets you like an extra valid air slot and you can think of it as a luxury like every block there's a lottery and uh you're 32 weeks is like your tickets still like potentially produce the next blocks um so if you want to do that and be a validated on the network you you need that Capital if you want to run a note on the network that's different from being a validator and what's running a node means is you actually verify that the blocks and transactions that these validators create are valid so validator is like a really bad term because the validator doesn't just verify what they do all the nodes verify on the network what the validator does in addition to that is they produce the block and this is why like in Mev they call them block producers not validators and but if you're just a normal user and you want to make sure that the blocks that are being propagated on the network and produced by validators are actually correct and that for example you know a staking pool doesn't collude the print itself a bunch of eth it is free to do so like you can just download you know your consensus there client your execution layer client and run that it will sync to the chain it will verify that the history of that chain you know the rules were followed or at least that there was like strong agreement amongst everybody that the rules were followed and then today you know like once you are synced every new block it will run it and make sure that like every transaction in that block uh meets the rules of the protocol um and that's like pretty important because the only the kind of biggest uh blocker that we have to validate there's concluded and changing the rules of the protocols is having a large number of nodes that are run by non-validators who just like act as a check and make sure that they're not changing the rules of the protocol uh behind closed doors so if you run a node you do contribute to the security of the network you don't have to pull up Capital to do it it's a public good then to run a node a non-validating node it's kind of like you know voting in your local elections is sort of a you know public good and to check on power yeah that's correct hey we hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to banklesshq right now to develop
