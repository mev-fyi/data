think in the future David these sorts of Adventures are going to be the way tokens are issued this is like the new aircraft surface area yeah there's a surface area here the new airdrop is an adventure drop I think um all right let's get to markets what is bitcoin doing in the markets this week we up we down we up a decent amount three and a half percent Bitcoin started the week at below twenty thousand dollars at 19 400 ish and we are above twenty thousand dollars at least at the time of recording at twenty thousand one hundred dollars so eyeballs right above waterline right above water let's play that happy music I'll take a 3.5 in these trying times how about youth price is that up too please yep up a little bit up a little change a little bit over one percent uh very marginally over one percent sort of the week at 13.50 we are at 13.65 so we went up fifteen dollars okay fifteen dollars remember when 15 was actually nothing and now it's actually something there was a time when the price of eth was just fifteen dollars so uh aren't we playing I don't remember that time these are ancient times a few few remember few were here uh youth Bitcoin the ratio what are we looking at on the week uh Bitcoin ratio down I think like a percent a little bit over a percent we are down to point six seven eight zero six seven eight so flatish back in that crap season for the Bitcoin ratio um how are we like historically we're still up from the July 22 lows I guess I'm looking at this from uh a year-long basis I mean if you zoom all the way out the eth ratio has been fantastic like the eth ratio last bear Market I mean look at this David eth ratio 2019 into 2020. remember when it went down to 0.018 that was when I was like okay I I don't I don't have to go back to school right honestly this is still irrational right no no this time was basically like oh I'm going to start a newsletter because the ratio shouldn't be this low and we were like this is when we started the bankless podcast in 2020 we're like this is stupid we started at the absolute bottom of the ratio yeah it's because I felt at the time that defy and eth were going completely underappreciated relative to bitcoin which is a fantastic in and of itself so uh yeah look at the trajectory since the bankless podcast was launched David it's been up only there's got to be synchronization it's not correlation all right uh Global crypto market cap we below a trail uh just barely above one point zero zero zero three trillion dollars it's a total crypto market cap there's some zeros in there happy music uh well let's talk about the FED everything hinges upon the FED these days and we've been talking so much I think all of crypto is talking about a pivot so when is the Fed pivot going to be when merged now win pivot win pivot when is the Fed going to start ratcheting down right it's when is it when our easy monetary policy uh when's that coming back I mean does that feel like uh like we're bad austrians to say that like please fed give us an easy monetary policy can you please print some more money I mean I love some of that money printer that that's that's not exactly like why we're saying it's just like in inevitability right at some point we're trying to like forecast what the Market's going to do and because macro markets right now have such an influence over the prices of everything we're trying to anticipate when Jerome Powell is going to Pivot because David it seems inevitable that he has to Pivot at some point I know he's trying to slay break the back of inflation has that already happened yet is that just a lagging indicator I don't know but we do know there's a lot of pressure on the FED to start this pivot now we'll go over a few of those pressure points right now number one the stock market has had its worst year in more than a decade and it keeps getting worse this is a headline from uh time.com I believe and this is actually the worst start to any year in the stock stock market since 20 uh since 2002 post 911 year post.com crash year the worst start to any year since 2002 and we are down in the s p around like negative 25 NASDAQ negative 32 percent so U.S stocks are heading for their this feels almost like a 2009 financial crisis in the stock market that is one pressure point now you might say and I might agree with you actually um that Powell doesn't care about the stock market I think so yeah I think to some extent that's true I wonder how much that's true so that that is pressure point one David pressure point two is there's some rattlings beginning uh around the world from other countries that aren't in a position to raise rates in quite the way that the FED is um the first is the UN so International body and they are calling on the fed and other central banks to Halt interest rate increases they're saying I'm going to quote this the Federal Reserve of another central banks risk pushing the global economy into recession followed by prolonged stagnations stagnation if they keep raising interest rates it's interesting I didn't know the FED advice or the UN advised on economic policy in this way but you know some of these voices are surfacing as well and further we are starting to see other central banks begin their soft pivot now the FED hasn't Powell hasn't but Japan just spent uh 20 billion dollars on Intervention to support the Yen so the fed the US dollar wrecking ball is destroying other Fiat currencies including the yen is losing ground relative to the dollar and so Japan is actually printing money to intervene to support the Yen we also talked a little bit about the UK pension crisis last week David well Bank of England is working to bail that out as well they are buying long-dated UK government bonds um that started that process started last week so some of the these other central banks are beginning to Pivot and I'm thinking this is putting more pressure on Powell for a pivot at some point soon now we're not getting we're still getting very hawkish messages I think from Powell and uh and the Fed so far that you know they intend to continue raising rates uh you know want to break the back of inflation but you almost wonder if that lasts like past maybe November midterms like past maybe some of this increasing economic pressure from other Central Bankers uh pass maybe did you get a chance to see this graph David yeah what are we looking at here yeah we're looking at the supply of oil reserves and so people might have noticed except in California I've heard California gas prices are still super high but gas prices overall are just down like I've seen like three and a half dollar gas in New York maybe four dollars other people are talking like gasoline prices are down well so is our supply of gasoline reserves so it used to be at its peak in like lit uh 2010 750 million barrels it was at 650 million barrels up until 2020 and it has just dropped off a cliff going down to 350 million barrels so it's halved and it hasn't been like that since like 1982 so we have the lowest supply of oil Reserve since 1982. and the Tweet here the political tweet is saying that Biden is on track to practically empty our strategic oil reserves to make sure Democrats get elected in November as in wanting to push down the price of bear of oil to have political clout say hey look what we did like gas prices aren't bad but that's because we're just like draining our supplies we're debating our reserves you don't you know that's not oil out of the ground that is like oils we've saved up that's our savings of oil has been halved in the last like two years and so I think the story here with everything that you just said and also this it's like the we can see the sidewalk running out like there's not less and less like Road way here it does we don't really know how much roadways left uh but I'm also reminded of that that one famous internet GIF where like there's a car hurtling towards like a wall and then as soon as it was about to crash the camera cuts to a different angle and the car's about to crash again and then it gets close to the wall the camera Cuts again and then the cars further away so it's one of these things like yeah forever we're yeah and it just repeats forever and then one time it actually does crash yeah but you don't actually know like so we're seeing all the we're seeing the roadway run out but we also don't know how much roadway is is left right so like we could be talking about this I don't know maybe through the rest of the year it's like oh there's a pivot soon there's a pivot soon some one day it will actually happen uh how much roadway we have left TBD yeah three months six months a year uh no one knows I don't even think Powell and the you know the FED actually know what the breaking point might be uh and when they will start that pivot but although if you if you do try and like Trend out this trajectory of oil reserves it goes to zero in like I guess something like napkin napkin trajectory here like soon quick December yeah something like this by Christmas we have no oil yeah the U.S strategic Reserves I'm laughing about this but this seems a little serious a little dark this doesn't seem like it's a good thing um well this is this is why this world is so weird right now is like the more bearish things get like the more bullish it becomes because then we have to Pivot and print more money so it's just weird weird state of things I guess it's more bullish for Commodities it's more bullish for things that can't be inflated for non-fiat currencies right um we're definitely living in this uh in this Fiat World a hollow world per our podcast episode that we just recorded with Ben Hunt that's coming at you guys in a in a couple of months he has this uh phrase here a couple of weeks excuse me yeah a couple weeks he like has this phrase he likes to use calling the world uh very Hollow right now and I think that's what we're seeing um but some words to look for if you are looking for signs of a pivot the language of the pivot maybe comes at us from Matthew Pines this is a tweet it won't be QE that is quantitative easing they won't use those terms anymore it will be restoring Financial stability right when we see see the FED pivot it won't be ycc that is yield curve control it will be fixing Market dysfunction it won't be called a bailout it will be extingent and unusual circumstances it won't be indefinite debt monetization it will be a targeted Limited intervention this is the Fed double speak I think so look for this kind of these kind of words in the future when when you want to tell if the FED is uh beginning to Pivot restoring Financial stability fixing Market dysfunction responding to unusual circumstances and targeted limited interventions I think this is uh or words like this yeah yes this is Central Banker speak this is how they they speak when they are intervening and they have to they have to use different words than last cycle because those ones don't work anymore they're dead no they've gotten bad press the Alpha's been squeezed out of those with invent new words so much for that um what's happening in crypto though Layer Two is having a moment yeah so this is the optimism we've reported on this a number of times every every other week or so optimism makes a new highs with transactions per month uh and so uh sep what was this last month September September was no exception coming in at 4.5.1 million transactions in the month of September which is a new high uh and that the the another high was set last month the the high before that was June the high before that was the month before that the high before that was the month before that so like optimism is in a transactional bull market and I'm pretty sure Arboretum is the same and so this is like the end of my my mental model for how if we're going to play this bear Market out is that some things just Crescendo for the entire bear market and this is something we're seeing it's like it's kind of slow build slow build slow build you know what this reminds me of is um right before D5 summer 2020 we had like months many months of like more total lockdowns TV L and D5 TV increasing just bit by bit just by bit by bit and we would look at it and you have to like bring your magnifying glass and like zoom up really close on the charts to actually see the tvl going up but it was in you know increasing it never stops going up and then explosion as soon as we hit 1 billion we hit 10 billion remember when we hit 1 billion yeah everyone in ethereum crypto Twitter was talking about 1 billion logged in team everyone wanted that first tweet uh we hit 10 billion like three months later and then there was and then it was the D5 summer yeah d5's real I mean that kind of proved the use case but an interesting comparison is um compare optimism in arbitrim arbitrum to Avalanche which has previously been kind of a darling and the number the lines are different here what are we looking at yeah the lines are different yeah bankless analysis uh for both optimism and arbitrum have passed Avalanche in Daily transactions now optimism passed Avalanche before so has arbitrim a few times but this time is different this time it's like meaningfully sustained uh and Avalanche is now both below active use of both optimism and arbitrum since I think the whole month of September yeah almost uh and so this this is different and this is what we've always been saying is like these are these execution optimized monolithic layer ones like Avalanche or Solana are not competing with the ethereum layer one they're competing with ethereum layer twos and now Avalanche is behind two of ethereum's two leading layer twos um so yeah congratulations to the optimistic roll-up world I feel like that thesis has taking a long time to play out yeah and now it is maybe starting to play out not the end of the story so we haven't been proven correct yet did you know by the way David still the number one evm chain in terms of total user total transactions is still binance chain Yeah by like a large margin six million or so uh four to six million um I believe like per month is what we're looking at here what's interesting about this chart that we're looking at it's um definitely down and so it's definitely decreased in uh you know in this bear Market relative to layer twos uh that are going up and um look I mean theorem is kind of steady state right when it ethereum transactions are maxed out like we can't have any more transactions on the on the layer one anymore that's what's interesting is transactions aren't a perfect proxy for actual usage so it's just like value measure among the missing missing value transfer is super important how much you actually settling um all right David what do we got coming up next is Credit Suisse Ryan going to trigger a 20 2008 financial crisis or not perhaps not and also is Gary Gensler the newest influencer on the Block uh because he made a video they made it kind of seem like he wants to be one so we're going to get into all these stories and so much more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible in all of my years in crypto I have

David where do these rumors come from yeah the the first uh part that the story ever like manifested in the world is this guy Dave Taylor news on Twitter says credible Source tells me a major International Investment Bank is on the brink as it turns out he is talking about Credit Suisse the house also this tweet has since been deleted which is interesting uh and this just got the world of you know the world of Finance uh both in crypto and outside of crypto just murmuring about Credit Suisse like Whispering about Credit Suisse and then the credit Suite CEO says that the credits weeks is at a quote critical moment as Bank prepares for latest overall the credit Suite CEO says and so this felt like it was corroborating what that tweet says that the Credit Suisse is at a quote pivotal moment whatever that means and now as a result of that credit Suites credit default swaps hit a 14-year High credit default swap is basically a assurance against the company defaulting so if you have a credit default Swap and Credit Suisse go defaults then you make money basically on that this is the thing that happened in 2008 that caused so much like contagion event and so this tweet here from Grant Stefan says 600 billion what Layman Brothers held in assets when they crashed and took the entire economy with them 2 800 billion right Credit Credit Suites and Deutsche Bank control in AUM 4.6 times more and he said he continues credit Suites is at a critical moment now says the CEO what lies in store for the world and he made a threat about this now this is just me reporting on the actual events and and what people are talking about I am not no I don't think Ryan and I are like anywhere close to being able to like be accurate informants about exactly what's going on in the world of credit and who exactly knows and who exactly knows only Credit Suisse management only a relatively few people who are in the internals of that Beast actually know what's happening but yeah go on but I will I will defer to somebody who knows much more than me who's very well researched which is Kyla Scanlon and she's put out a great video on this so I've pulled out some tidbits to uh to talk about here where she has said doing some analysis that is decently above board she goes the market is pricing in a 1.4 per chance percent chance of Credit Suisse going bankrupt uh and she did this with a just a cross-referencing and a bunch of numbers which are a little bit confusing but that's what she came out with 1.4 chance is what the market is pricing in uh that is pricing in a less likely chance of default than Ford the motor company uh Ford being an anchor and irrelevant Anchor Point just to say like hey that's like not very likely and so she is of the opinion that this is not at all a Lehman moment even though that credit Suite is not necessarily necessarily like in the clear and not everything is like you know good it's not a Lehman Brothers moment is what she has taken away from and so I generally trust Kyla she knows way more than I do pays attention to these things way much more than I do and that is her take and that is better than I could ever produce here these are still these are still just like multiple takes on it right it's like it seems like the the Market's still trying to figure out the uh the truth here I mean it's the CDs spreads at 14-year highs looks like some sort of Market reaction to some some negativity so we don't know but what does seem true though is like I feel like the market is looking for something like this you know this is why tweets like this um you know the original tweet what was it said something like credible Source tells me a major International Investment Bank is on the brink that seems like it could be so true and because we thought this leads it leads yes and we because we felt this in living memory some a rumor like this spreads around the internet in like nanoseconds right and so pretty soon everyone's kind of chanting it and then it can they can actually affect the market right uh that's what's interesting about this I um here here's another take I guess on the uh on the on the subject like some something is probably foul in the traditional Finance Market isn't it and this is that moment where the tide is going out and you get to see who's wearing pants who's wearing shorts and who's not it was Warren Buffett says and I think the entire world the entire Market is anticipating that we're going to find some people who aren't wearing any shorts right this is uh Dylan Leclair saying the three areas capital tradify is out there somewhere praying for a bounce here to unload some of their illiquid garbage I almost feel like crypto may have front run right a lot of this like I actually feel like crypto is um healthier now than it's been in a long time because we had our deleveraging moment in early in June when three years Capital went bust we had multiple crypto Banks go completely bust like we already faced the deleveraging event and you sort of wonder if it's not Credit Suisse maybe Credit Suisse is healthy maybe Kyle is wrong I don't think the Market's wrong to have like be in high alert status and be watching for something like this because of excesses of the last decade or more David crypto has only had only it only had like 18 months of bull market to be able to wind up its leverage yes the traditional Market has had like 12 years leverage and debt deep into the financial system and that is difficult to unwind yeah and but we just don't know where it's going to pop it almost seems so it almost seems too simple right for oh it's a it's a bank again credit default swaps like again same thing almost seems it's probably going to happen in some unexpected area but like I guess we'll have to monitor and and see what happens from here um what else we got going on Gary Gensler is up to some things uh and Kim Kardashian how is she involved in crypto yeah the SEC is charging Kim Kardashian for unlawfully touting crypto security uh so you might even remember ethereum Max ran I think I can't remember where I saw her the ethereum max is like she was paid to chill pump this ethereum Max thing what is it she uh I it's it's a grift basically uh what's it like an ethereum Fork of some kind yeah it's like yeah it's a ethereum fork uh I don't know a single thing about it other than the fact it was ethereum Max she was paid for it and no one in my Twitter Twitter circles or friends that ever used it at all uh pretty sure it's just a scam through and through she was paid to promote it she did promote it on her Twitter it was extremely cramped I remember when that was going out and now she is being charged to settle these charges for a whopping 1.26 million dollars and I'm being facetious here that is a that has pennies for Kim Kardashian and probably less than what she got paid for it to promote the damn thing well no actually I remember reading this she she got paid like 250k or something to promote it and she's getting five she did win 56 yeah so it's a bad business decision for her right it's just raw business decisions yeah she must have which is pretty much underst understood what it means to promote a security she probably did not think about that in good news David what this means is we could pay Kim Kardashian 250k to promote bankless if you're into it no no wrong crowd different crowd crowd different cross-section yeah so here's the press release and also an interesting uh quote from insides uh that Gary Gensler said so here's a quote from Gary Gensler saying this is a this case is a reminder that when celebrities are influencers endorse investment opportunities including crypto asset Securities it does not mean that those investment products are right for all investors we encourage investors to consider an investment potential risk and opportunity in light of their own financial goals yeah it's a normal normal speak but like yeah yes you shouldn't have done this yeah definitely definitely she shouldn't have done this like uh and then I guess you know Gary's coming to the rescue here but that's only half the story okay yeah the other half of the story starts with uh this tweet from Mike dudas who goes lamal LMAO literally everyone hates Gary Gensler including his own staff it's amazing and he is tweeting out a picture of Charles gasparino a three three tweet saying SEC enforcement staffers people that work for the SEC are complaining that Gary Gensler violated protocol by hyping the Kim Kardashian settlement appearing on CNBC within minutes of the case being announced people with direct knowledge have told Fox Business this they are calling they again the SEC employees are calling this a publicity stunt that has been designed to burnish his reputation to be named treasury secretary they also say Gensler stealthily approached CNBC for his appearance and created a video on the settlement an unusual move for chairs who usually allow staff to take credit for actions and pursue broader issues it's the latest Skirmish between genzler and enforcement departments that continue to lose attorneys amid complaints about Gary's management style and workload as the SEC dives into non-traditional areas of enforcement I.E corporate ESG mandates SEC has no immediate comments so the take here is that Gary is doing a he's doing like a speaking tour Pat himself on the back for going after Kim Kardashian and this is why I highlighted that 1.26 million dollar fine for Kim Kardashian which is pennies she's just gonna pay it because she's like yeah go away like but Buzz away fly get out of mind and then he's gonna be like yeah we got her look what we're doing we got the bad guys we got the bad guys we were stopping crypto scams and not actually going after the real scams like Celsius which was an actual security uh and actually like needed banking regulations blah blah blah so like leaving all the actual hard scams like free and clear and going after Kim Kardashian because everyone's like oh Gary Gensler is going after Kim Kardashian promoting a crypto security nice job Gary nice job yeah it does seems like it's some kind of uh regulatory clout chasing here it's like he's he's just um he's trying to cash in and what like a great name to do it a Gensler versus Kardashian I brought down this kind of wealthy Elite influencer who everyone hates in the name of retail investors I'm here to protect you like Captain Gary kind of thing that's what it feels like a little bit but I you know it's not just this tweet it's um the video that was yeah that was mentioned in this week so this is um the Gensler uh video pushed out on YouTube high production value like relatively for uh regulatory agency like you know hey who's your editor big you know Gary because like we need more editors in bankless uh and uh the title of this video is use caution with celebrity endorsements of investment products should we play part of this video yeah let's do it sometimes celebrities endorse investment opportunities like crypto tokens or special purpose acquisition companies celebrity endorsements though don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even frankly that it's legitimate even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine each investment has its own risks and opportunities and may not fit your investment needs yeah so so David that that's a flavor of the video it's uh office hours with Gary Gensler it's got this you know cheerful music that you probably just heard and like Gary pops up and he tells you that celebrities can't give good investment advice and shouldn't and you know if you're just a normie retail investor you should be very careful and pay attention to like you know celebrity endorsements around things um first of all it's just incredibly basic advice and but but there's something about this video that just feels like almost like um you know financial advisor influencer kind of thing I don't know there's something that just doesn't feel like genuine influencer and we'll let bankless listeners you know get get their own kind of take on this and insight into it but like how does it strike you what like what is this really the explanation is is Gary kind of like jockeying for some sort of influence some sort of um clout in order to get the next rung up in his career that is treasury secretary coming for Jenny Ellen's job it's just something something's just so off about like this this Mr Burns type figure who's doing like a highly edited like influencer type video like he is an influence he's trying to be an influencer except he's Gary Gensler and he just does not look like an influencer and so the whole thing is just like it's it just makes me like shiver man it's like weird it's pretty cringe this is a uh article in Fortune uh crypto the crypto side of Fortune I guess it says the sec's Kardashian fine was a dumb publicity stunt uh and then talks about it this is what happens when your cringe on the internet Gary you get called out what happens this is uh Maya imagine an alternative world where Gary Gensler had gone after machensky this is the Celsius CEO before the crash or the real Shilling as a as a Biz entities instead of Shilling some Kardashian news that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things this is this is the end of the day whether you think that was cringe or you think that was just you know Gary being kind of Gary and that's who he is and maybe he's trying to be helpful given the benefit of the doubt for for a minute here's the problem it just doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things like no no one is really going to be helped by this Kim Kardashian suit there are so many other scams like this is one thing that we've um asked the help of regulators like crypto has scams doesn't David like all sorts of scams we're about to talk about wow right yeah and like there is work for The Regulators to do to help clean this industry up all right partner with innovators those that are providing transparency give us safe harbors for those that are building truly Innovative entrepreneurial products and then go after the machenskies like please help us with this but like don't just do the surfacy clout chasing type stuff that like where's where is our Bitcoin ETF right I mean that would that would save retail literally tens of millions hundreds of millions billions of dollars of capital right like why don't we work on that together right this is not helpful to us how about Clarity uh you know around the difference between like kind of a security and a token that's not a security and that would unleash the potential of thousands of entrepreneurs and we're not doing these easy things instead we're going for the like the Glam the cheap stuff the surfacy the whitewash stuff it's just it's stupid it's just feels very like political game it feels very Congress it feels very let's call the bankers in front of our bank Committee hearing and yell at them for two hours without actually doing anything I'm just tired of seeing this can you click on his profile picture there in front on his Twitter account like the guy very clearly really cares about his Public Image yes like he has a Public Image SEC chairman yes not doing his job he's made so many videos he has he has that wasn't the only video he's made if you go back to his YouTube channel he's made a bunch of videos what is short selling what are crypto trading platforms with Gary Gensler uh rule 10 5 B1 insider trading plans uh 1.5 7 000 views oh that kind of sucks yeah you should work on that Gary uh what is short selling 1.9 000 views one month ago bad bad Roi on these videos Gary what you doing bro can you go back to your job you do your job I think I think I think one thing that you know he could do is definitely is um hire someone to do these things right hire somebody with some kind of you know Charisma some some ability to like like maybe partner with some other influencers like that would be more effective it's just very weird to take Center Stage age in this way but uh I don't know let's go on let's talk about the the crypto grifters because things that he's left on the table yes there are some things left on the table and and certainly crypto has its share of grifters that uh could be gone after so Celsius top three execs apparently they cashed out 42 million dollars before they filed for bankruptcy out of their own platform so exceo Alex machinski who we were just talking about xcso Chief security officer is that what that is Daniel Leon and CTO nuke Goldstein wow that's an unfortunate name Goldstein yeah wait there's cto's famous how did I just find out about this yeah wow that's pretty crazy this is a real article right this is a real article this is this is not a regular I got screwed over by Newt nuke Goldstein yeah he's got my these three the top three execs of Celsius pulled Bitcoin ether usdc and the sell token and Celsius token from the custody accounts of sales Celsius in May before the company suspended all customer withdrawals oh so they got their money out first they got their money out uh before the assets were frozen uh and so machinsky withdrew about 10 million dollars Leon withdrew about seven million dollars uh and the other person went through about uh six million dollars do you remember that machines right that's your money Ryan that's your money that they that they pulled out Goldstein has your ether yeah well if I had to get screwed I guess I was going to get screwed by a guy that just makes sense do you remember at the time all this was going on the rumors for flying machinski came out on Twitter and he said stop with the fud there's nothing to worry about I forget the exact phraseology of the Tweet but that was post he tweeted this after he had just taken all of his money out of Celsius right it's unbelievable man unbelievable the level of rifter grifter uh you are calling it out though David what's uh you're trying to compete with Gary Gensler yeah I think I think I'm a better influencer than Gary again we'll see also I would like for to First be labeled as an educator who happens to influence not an influencer I know I'm getting into this YouTube world where I do these YouTube optimized stuff we'll talk about that but I would just like to plant that flag I'm an educator first and influencer second but it's like something Gary gansler would say David wow about that one anyways there is a brand new bankless YouTube account out there this is a big news number for the week it's the biggest news in crypto okay of course it's brand new bankless YouTube account uh the current bankless YouTube account you might have noticed if you're watching this on YouTube is now called bankless shows uh there's a new bank List YouTube account called bankless where more YouTube optimized videos are going to go and so I released the first video that I made and it's titled why is crypto full of scams and it gives my model my uh my mental model for how I understand the crypto industry to be what it is which is core devs at the center crypto Believers around them crypto grifters around the crypto Believers that separate the crypto Believers from the outside world and this is people like Alex machinsky Daniel sesta dokwan the people that got really loud interestingly all three people bank that's got in a fight with uh and uh alexinski is uh featured in this video and so definitely go subscribe to this new channel uh because we are going to be putting like uh just newbie optimize short form content things that you would find on YouTube uh thank you everyone on the comments who told me that I needed to iron my shirt noted I will do that next time that's funny and these are these are brief videos right so this is not like a 90 minute roll up okay we this is like 10 to 15 minute quick explainers for you guys so if you're listening on if you're watching on YouTube right now make sure you go to this new bank list channel uh we'll include a link in the show notes um it's different than bankless shows and this uh turn notifications on for this um all right David we got a lot more to cover what are we talking about next coming up next we got some maker Dow stuff maker Dow is investing 500 million dollars into different kinds of bonds but also the Winklevoss and Gemini want to also strike a deal with maker down so make her doubt making some moves and then after that Fidelity a multi-trillion dollar asset management company has built a pipe straight into ether with an ethereum index we're going to talk about that there's also so many more things to talk about ens the ens markets are blazing hot that they always have been there's a documentary about coinbase coming out Salon is down again and crypto really awesome heartwarming story about crypto adoption in Africa Ryan which I did not expect but yet some really good news Out of Africa which is not something we hear about frequently so all of that and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible the brave wallet is your secure multi-trained on-ramp into web3 and it's built directly into the brave privacy browser gone are the days of

2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 Bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross train bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across V2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher Capital efficiency layer 2 to layer 2 transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of a cross's story by joining their Discord and using a cross for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely Bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrum or Boba networks maker the stablecoin issuer is investing 500 million dollars in U.S treasuries and also corporate bonds David this is a big move that's a lot of money big time yeah what's going on here so make your doubt of course is allocating 500 million dollars for investing in U.S treasuries and corporate bonds and this is coming from its over collateralized stable coin Supply 80 of this is going to short-term treasuries 20 going to investment grade corporate bonds and this was a proposal was presented last June and accepted uh so that is what's going on in the world of maker doubt that's a big move 500 million dollars is not small what else uh you mentioned the Winklevoss before the break what are they doing so this is the second time that an exchange has gone over to maker Dow to make them an offer and I think this is coming off of that offer that coinbase made maker Dao not too long ago so maker is entertaining an offer from Gemini the crypto exchange from the winklevi twins of course and they are offering to paymaker 1.25 annual instrument issuance rates on deposits of gusd the Gemini USD stablecoin from the winklevi from Gemini and in return maker must hold more than 100 million of gusd in its Peg stability module known as the PSM which is this thing that like helps dye stay at a dollar so gusd has definitely been like underrepresented definitely not like a leading stable coin but this looks like a strategic partnership between Gemini and maker Dao to boost liquidity of gusd and acceptance inside of D5 so it's uh it's just a proposal right so they haven't accepted this yet what's really interesting is like Banks negotiating with Dows yeah like yeah and or endows negotiating with banks like this uh this whole um treasury uh story that you're getting into this Bank um called uh syndrome is the one executing it and it's working with BlackRock Switzerland to allocate part of the the 500 million dollars to 250 million of the 500 million dollars and I'm just kind of like well what is maker itself it's such an interesting entity it's not um it's not a pro it's not just a protocol it is a protocol but they've built kind of this like Dao you know soft tissue layer of human governance around it for risk management that can actually interact with real world yeah so it's kind of like it's almost like a crypto native Bank question mark it's something like that and um yeah it's a very interesting entity and I mean working with BlackRock working with Gemini you know negotiating with Winklevoss twins this is a decentralized autonomous organization doing that and it kind of blows my mind sometimes yeah it's pretty pretty sci-fi anyways moving on Fidelity has revealed its ethereum Index Fund straight between Fidelity clients and ether and so uh with 50 000 minimums sadly uh it has generated about five million dollars in sales already which is and this thing's brand new so five million dollars in sales between Fidelity Investments and his clients and ether so there's now a nice big fat pipeline between Fidelity and ether which is what we like if we want Boomers to buy our bags well this is Fidelity look Fidelity did this in 2020 with Bitcoin now they've become friendly with ether which is great and like we have to like I guess Fidelity has to put these sorts of trusts together in the absence of having a freaking ETF which we all need come on we need an ETF for both Bitcoin and ether but we don't have it um but you know Fidelity is absolutely massive David like are all corporate you know a whole bunch of Us corporate 401ks for example all managed by you know Fidelity and um if you're just like slaving away in the office in a corporate job and you want to buy some crypto in your 401k it's really like infidelity it's really hard to do that so providing on-ramps to that is a good thing and hopefully this turns into something that's a bit more retail friendly consumer friendly or at least has Fidelity continue to apply the pressure to Regulators because I think they take the phone calls of banks Davis they're not taking my phone call they're not taking your phone call maybe they're not even taking Brian Armstrong's phone call but I think they're listening to the fidelities of the world and so Fidelity calls and it's like hey we have and for products and maybe they'll pick up the phone and listen to them in ens news we got another all-time high ens is all-time high I believe is this uh sales in September David and this is a domain registration uh registration new ens names have been registered as also with ANS renewals and so names that were already registered also got renewed so big just like how optimism and arbitrum are having their like slow crescendos of transaction volume ens is having its maybe faster Crescendo of registrations uh so the BNS bull market continues but bullish ens I've still haven't sold my airdrop David I'm just holding I like that protocol um look at this these are the top the highest all-time sales of dot Eve names and what's cool about this website is of course all of this is like publicly available data you don't have to scrape any databases it's just like all on chain so you can come up with these sorts of dashboards but coming in at number one the biggest dot eth sale ever you ready for it hit me paradigm.eath that's a long that's a large number of digits that's one million four five six seven eight digits wow yeah two million dollars for this uh 420 eat uh abc.eath was only spent uh a quarter million dollars wow so I'm assuming that's Paradigm the Investment Company yes that comes in at number one PGA pjfi dot eth I don't know why that's worth so much almost 500 million zero zero zero diet half a million dollars excuse me sorry half a million dollars uh abc.eath what else we got um dpac.eth went for 75 eighth porno.ieth of course 100 I think we talked artdow.e these are the top ten um 196. I'm just glad we got Bank list.eth when we got it yeah and this is like yeah the two thousand dollars we spent on Bank list on youth as an absolutely somebody would have squatted that and tried to sell it what do you think 200 000 300 000. yeah a stupid number yeah somewhere between in Paradigm in porno I bet they would have tried to charge us because it's a good brand um speaking of good brands Moon Birds the Dow launched so they just launched it out 2.6 million in eth in the Dow also some nfts um what are your thoughts on this uh well the it's pretty cool that Kevin Rose and proof seeded the doubt with this 2.6 million dollars so they hey you guys have it down now also you guys have 2.6 million dollars uh go play with it I guess no actually so here's the cool thing it's not just go play with us play with us go play with it and do whatever you want it's kind of focused the focus is empowering creatives that are building towards furthering the moon Birds ecosystem reputation and lore that's a bit more specific so reputation and lore right so I can imagine this doubt specifically doing a function that Dows do very well which is like hey generate a whole bunch of ideas and spread those ideas so I actually kind of like some more focused targeted doubts because sometimes if you give Dows a complete Blank Slate they don't really know what to do they're kind of like oh a little bit here a little bit here sometimes they're walking around like a zombie without a brain right and uh if you give it a focus and you say here's some money here's some things the community can do and it becomes kind of like a grant funding mechanism I think that could be successful so I think that's what they might be doing here of course we'd have to talk to Kevin Rose to get all the details but a nice narrow scope Dow might be a good refresher compared to some of the doubts we've seen uh recently this is really cool here's a tweet thread out of Brian Armstrong saying big announcement we've been working with director Greg Coe on a documentary about cryptocurrency and coinbase over the last three years and it will be coming out this Friday that's today if you're listening to this on Friday on Amazon Prime iTunes YouTube you can watch the trailer you can watch the trailer in the show notes I got goosebumps when I watch this really this is going to be awesome why and why'd you get goosebumps it's just like watching Brian Armstrong like practice a pitch in 2011 about like how to pitch coinbase he's like dude like it goes all the way back to 2011 huh yeah it goes It goes real far back right there's Fred Harrison uh and and so like I mean uh there there's a lot of really cool people here David Chom was is is future vitalix in here yeah it's just like it's uh there's there's map Logan yeah Matt from Hogan from bitwise right uh I I think it's gonna be great and this is I think uh a really going it's gonna be very useful to help explain crypto to the outside world movies documentaries there's like there's like two other ethereum movies like there's the infinite garden and Cami Russo's documentary it's also going to come out and I think this is going to be a great way to onboard people to crypto and like here's the story of like these people that have been grinding this out for years do you know the the guy who's making this uh Greg coz he also made the doc documentary I really love came out like four or five years ago called alphago and this is about um Deep Mind which is uh an AI that I believe Google created um to beat the go champion of the worlds right so you know this links into maybe um your story at the end yes some special that you met don't do not spoil that I will not spoil it okay but the first AI beat a um chess player in what year was that 1999 2000 something like this uh that was oh God I don't know when was that okay around that I should know this uh and but before that it was thought inconceivable um like a difficult problem for an AI to actually beat a a human chess player and then um an order of magnitude more complexity is actually um the uh the game go which is a strategic game it's very popular in in the East uh less so in the west but it's kind of like the chess of the East right very popular in places like Korea and this chronicled this effort of Deep Mind and AI to take on the world's best go Champions and I won't I guess I could spoil it because it's like five years after but like the AI wins in the end yeah and it's this whole battle yes maybe that's maybe that's not entirely yeah I mean that's the entire uh era that we're living in we could the AI wins in the end um okay so it beats the humans and um yeah it's a really cool story because there's some drama like the it's very hard for the world alphago players to kind of like come to grips with this anyway great documentary going into a complicated subject and actually like helped me understand neural network AI type systems and also go which I had no previous understanding or knowledge of um through documentary format so it helped mainstream that to me maybe we could do the same with crypto yeah that was that was a great way to Full Circle this is like oh complicated uh complicated story we have a great Storyteller they're gonna tell the coinbase story very well so yeah excited for this I'm gonna watch this perhaps on my flight to Bogota are you yeah uh in other nft news three arrows crypto Punk and other Starry Night collections on ethereum their nfts are set to be liquidated uh so The Starry Night fund which was of course three arrows capitals nft fund uh is in the hands of a liquidator tenio uh apparently that has the goose in it doesn't it yes I believe so yeah so art blocks crypto punks like all this stuff getting liquidated if you are an nft collector with cash on hand you might be able to score a pretty cool nft three years Capital starting starting night uh starting Starry Nights at the top of the the bull market that was the top that was the they funded that fund at the very top at the very top uh Solana went down again last weekend uh this is this one actually made me sad yeah Solana back online after the latest outage it was down uh in September sorry it was down for 18 hours that was September of 2021. uh this time I don't know it was down uh looks like five hours five hours five hours yeah why why did it go down what happened uh it looks like there was a validator that signed two blocks which is bad because that's forking the blockchain and because of this the remaining validators I think couldn't find the chain they were confused as to which chain uh it was the correct one because there were two versions of Solana and so both of them just didn't progress and so the blah blah blah the Solana blockchain just halted I want to ask you so I want to ask this question of you right so this is a question I tweeted out if a blockchain keeps going down it is still worth billions of dollars which Salon definitely is do we conclude from this that the market doesn't value blockchain uptime remember when ethereum classic kept on getting 51 attacked and it would pump the price no because it was in the news uh attention it's all it yeah well this was not a price pump this was just kind of nothing happened it was just the market Shrugged it off I think if you're a Solana holder you're and you have you just you I don't know well no Anatoly uh responded somewhere in the tweets uh and it totally as something to the fact of like actually this is a strength because see how fast Solana can actually recover what yes that is a take uh there you go what the whole point of decentralization is to recover from arbitrary catastrophic failure without loss of State including bugs in the code maybe doing so so quickly and reliably is important as well that was his take so and so that's a bold take Anatoly I mean I get the point like you can recover your blockchain but like centralized companies can recover databases that's not the hard part that's not that's not hard it's interesting right because the market doesn't seem to care David so um you know there's all sorts of other explanations but I'm curious yours what do you think yeah so you put out that tweet uh like through two or three weeks ago saying like facts Solana has had over two months of uninterrupted up time that was September 10th uh so we're basically one month later so now it was three months they had a three-month streak uh it would it it's Solana going down during the bull market I think it's I mean it's not really excusable but it's more excusable when there's High activity but Solana going down in the bear market like they need to get this number of and like days without incident high they need to not be going down because you need to be Dependable of a blockchain if you're going to have the future of Finance on your ecosystem you need to not go down and you need to prove to the world that you're not going to go down so during times of depressed activity and you're still going down you are burning that chance of growing the Lindy effect of saying that Solana is not going to go down doesn't matter if the social if there's a social recovery if a bunch of validators just meet no that's only it only matters that doesn't matter it matters to the current set of users we're talking about we need to onboard the rest of users and the rest of the world hopefully will care if their financial system goes down I'm coming to the conclusion that Salon is kind of playing a different game than ethereum oh it's always been I don't and I think that maybe that's always been and maybe that's why why sometimes the communities talk past each other yeah because um if you if you're like hardcore Bitcoin ethereum values you're like your chain can't go down it's a lair freaking one it's like a property rights system for the entire world you can't go down if it goes down it's dead and but I don't think Salon is competing there I think it's competing against other almost like open fintech type of applications where sometimes things go down in those worlds it's like if your chain goes down people will not issue valuable assets on your chain as much and I don't see how Solana can say that they don't want that and that's a goal optimized kpi is how many valuable assets are being issued on Solana and if the more Solana goes down the less people are less comfortable people are going to feel so you're saying it makes them less scalable like socialists because they're less dependable and dependability is scalability and all of these things yeah it's uh to be determined but I mean good luck to the Solana Community as you guys continue you as Solana continues to iron out those bugs also stuff happening in the crypto community in Africa this was a really cool report put out by Chain analysis yeah chain analysis I should say uh what is this saying yeah so some tidbits from this report saying this report shows strong crypto usage and adoption rates in the region of sub-Saharan Africa with Highly Educated young people and low job prospects crypto is a quote way to feed their family says convexity fandler nibi oof I'm sorry about that small retail payments in sub-Saharan sub-Saharan Africa are powering exponential crypto adoption and usage with the region conducting the world's highest proportion 80 percent of crypto retail payments less than a thousand dollars according to the chain analysis report this report also has how peer-to-peer transactions are more common in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else in the world at about six percent of all crypto transaction volume Africa's peer-to-peer transactions dwarf those of Central and Southern Asia the region with the second highest volumes in that category and the report continues and says many Africans have integrated crypto into everyday life besides retail transactions remittances and Commercial transactions have also been key drivers for Africa's High adoption and usage rates did not expect to see a report like this but that's really good news this is this is just some the fundamental adoption of crypto that's not speculative that's not Shenanigans it's not like nftes like going with jpegs this is like real utility being leveraged by uh by a sub-Saharan Africa yeah I think this is really cool to see uh in in places in Africa it's you know it's peer-to-peer small transactions improving people's lives um it's underreported as well because it's not kind of a big news event happening in the west and honestly David I want to dedicate some Cycles to explore the cryptocurrency community in Africa um I've not talked much to that Community I know there's a bankless Africa yeah chapter actually that's a chapter down there that's rocking it and doing some things so maybe there's some opportunity to get an update from them uh David speaking of updates a negative update from Alex the arrested tornado cash developer he is staying in jail after his appeal was rejected this is from the Block David what refresh people who is Alex perseff and what was this appeal about Alex purse was the tornado cash developer that was arrested in the Netherlands and has been waiting to hear why he's been arrested and so I believe he appealed to be either released or just to hey can I hear why I'm arrested and that repeal was rejected not only that David this this story goes on it was not only rejected and he has to stay in jail they're actually auctioning off his car starting to take his property what yeah um this is uh this is from the article property seizure and auction at the moment they've only taken a car this is his wife talking but I think they can come and take something else at any moment I don't feel safe prosecutors will sell all of our legal property at auction leaving me with nothing yo what the hell arrest the guy dude this is the Netherlands don't you're not uh charging him with anything you're leaving him in jail no charges absolutely no charges for for all we know the only thing he did was create an open open source smart contract code on ethereum that was used without his permission by some nefarious actors but completely without his permission now he's in jail doesn't know why they won't tell him and they're auctioning off his freaking property stealing his property let's call let's call it stealing because that's what it is the government does it they call it seizure but it's stealing what is happening here I don't get it right what do you even do about this I don't know I mean we're not in the Netherlands I we've tweeted about it before we've talked about it before there are locations we've directed people to uh to donate to the cause is legal defense there was a git coin grants that were raised uh continuing to talk about it continue to keep it in the news cycle I think is really important continuing to tweet about it uh is really important um I don't know this is the Netherlands this is like the quote-unquote like a western liberal democracy all right uh that's insane it's infuriating it's infuriating um so our our thoughts with Alex will continue uh keeping you guys updated about this in happier announcements Ryan you know Google's 10 times have you heard about this yes yeah so like on Fridays like if you work at Google you can go work on something that you're passionate it's like 10 is it 20 or something or 20 okay yeah policy at Google on Fridays you could go do something that you want to do sounds like an intrinsic intrinsic work just pick something okay so consensus is doing something very similar with their employees saying hey on Fridays or like I don't know 20 of your time go work for a doubt uh so there's a partnership between consensus and bankless Dao to develop what they are calling the first ever dalation chip where consensus employees and bankless Dao are going to work together to like to build out bankless Dao so that is pretty damn cool I'd say that is awesome big big move by uh Bank LaSalle to get that set up um funny we had absolutely nothing to do with no idea it just happens uh in the background and I think bankless style is doing great work and excited about the new energy that consensus is bringing there and the first dalationship so use that 20 time well consensus they're also using their uh development time well because this is a new portfolio viewer from metamask the makers of metamask so you can now click a link and like zirion or zapper style start to see what is in your portfolio really cool release really cool app um this is a bank.e portfolio you see some Bank tokens in there among other things and uh yeah really cool to see another release coming out of Aztec they said they are thrilled to announce Euler Finance as the first yield protocol supporting assets 4626 Bridge uh I will explain what that is first uh Euler is a money market like compound or Ave that provides yield to assets and Aztec is a private Layer Two privacy Layer Two uh and so you can now use and get access to Oilers you field privately on assets on the asex private layer too but they also have this 4626 Bridge that's an EIP number or an ERC number uh basically it's their yield bridge and so prior to eip4626 every single integration between Aztec and compound Aztec and Ave Aztec and Euler was like a one-off bridge a unique Bridge 4626 is what they're calling one bridge to rule them all and so a yield bridge between Aztec and money markets throughout D5 so any place that you can get yield anything that's a tokenized fault you can Bridge right into Aztec so defy and yield is becoming a little bit more private these days private yields private yield sounds really cool I um I hope they don't get oh fact yes in the coming weeks and coming months well we if they do uh we're investors Ryan so uh we're relevant here that's right uh I should mention that as well let's get to raises now uh you to swap labs they look to be raising about 200 million dollars in a new round of fun ending this is a report from TechCrunch not completely confirmed but this deal would give uniswap Labs the lab side not the tokens to the lab side kind of the equity side a one billion dollar valuation so we'll have to see how that emerges we've got more raises defines Capital what are they up to David yeah Arthur Chong's Defiance Capital which was originally spun out from three arrows capital and so I think he hit he got a Defiance took a gut punch when three hours Capital went down reputationally at least also also they had to I think liquidate some of defiance's assets because it was owned by fear that was Capital pretty brutal yeah uh and but Arthur is bringing Defiance back raising 100 million dollars uh raising 100 million dollars to invest in liquid tokens so can Arthur bring Defiance back from the dead looks like he's doing it so congrats he's trying and last raise of the week Horizon is thrilled to announce that they've raised 48 million dollars in a series eighth week make web 3 easy Horizon and their wallet sequence is a a platform for both uh having an awesome wallet that's very easy to use that is integrated into web3 games and webbed through things it's just and it's also a builder platform so they also have this integration with skyweaver Nifty swap a few other things so congratulations on the race to Horizon also they are a bank list sponsor for Q4 so there is the disclaimer there their smart contract wallet looks pretty badass man yes I love the ux of this um David we should get to jobs jobs I'm sure with all these raises companies are hiring in the jobs Market this week

Market as well as an evm compatibility as well as all the takes from the week a question from Amin solomoni hypothetically speaking if you wanted to use ethereum to wage a war how would you go about it so that is a take that's coming up next right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web 3 world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem

reply to that tweet we may read your question out on the roll up this is the first one I think this question is coming from okay this question is coming from Mike finity Mike asks are there any new categories in the ethereum space that are emerging that some of us may not know about yet David secret hidden categories in the ethereum space that are emerging that people don't know about tell us give it drop that Alpha my friend yeah there's this one category that's being built out which requires ZK Roll-Ups that has to be on a ZK Rola because of how many transactions it's going to require but there's a world of physical simulation like physical space simulation like gravity objects colliding objects that when a object moves or collides that's like game physics game physics yes game physics on ZK Roll-Ups uh and so it's it's you can why this is important is you can make a verifiable provable position of a physical object like fizzy physical digital you know a digital but physical object in the metaverse and you can make this you can provide coordinates you can provide velocity you can you know Mass magnitude Direction you can an improvable layer that is a universally shared truth on the internet create it physically like mapped out space physical space I've I've seen demos of this kind of thing before I've seen prototypes of this kind of thing before but it seemed it's always seemed so abstract that I don't even I can't yet grock it I can't get it other than this link between like as we've always said what is the blockchain for well it's uh first securing property in the metaverse and so you were talking about physical manifestations of properties secured by something like ethereum but like I think how does that mean it's more just like objects like uh we we need a single shared source of truth of a bunch of physical space except again it's not physical it's it's digital but it's physically represented digital space and if we have a single shared source of Truth on this thing it makes that platform incredibly neutral and so you can imagine like a digitally represented physical space that is being rendered at the periphery because we have this same source of Truth as to what objects are where okay so but like what do you do with something like this uh I mean first you have to build it and so this is like still very much like under construction but I think it's a better question as to like what can't you do with it uh yeah there's there's a lot out there uh this is a topic of uh in the zero knowledge podcast with Anna Rose she did an episode on this uh with a bunch of CK teams um but it's like a it's just like a commonly shared source of Truth for like games and space if you say something to me it feels like there's a new primitive that we just don't know what to do yet on the application layer and we might see it manifest in cool ways is definitely emerging definitely something that probably a few people knew about and did you say what's the place to find out more that uh Anna Rose is a zero knowledge uh podcast it's an older podcast let's see if I can find it and put in the show notes cool uh we got another question from a crypto dude dot vet what is the significance of ZK sync 2.0 getting evm compatible is it that you can Port smart contracts over from eth layer one with little or no changes in their code or is there something more to it no it's largely that uh if previously like for example Stark net starkware has their Cairo coding language you can't just take solidity code and put it on Stark net you can put it on ZK sync because it's evm compatible so it's it's near one to one compatibility of all all anything that's ever been on an evm chain binance smart chain optimism arbitrum the ethereum layer one like apple 95 of all the yes if it's if it's an app that's already built you can just be put right on zksync out of the box and so that's why that's why everyone is super bullish on evm compatibility it's a really big deal um all right David let's go to takes of the weeks this is from amine he's asking the question hypothetically speaking if you wanted to use ethereum to wage a war how would you go about it of course that came from Amin if you wanted to use ethereum to wage a war I don't know what he is thinking about on October 4th what are you thinking about on a like casual Tuesday for this for amine but um your answer was interesting you said start a podcast what are you talking about I actually want to leave that one up to the listener I'll leave that one hanging there really that's all you're gonna say yeah yeah if you wanted to use ethereum to wage a war how would you go about doing it and David says start a podcast you don't call it bankless Nation for nothing huh are we talking metaphorical War are you just gonna I mean it's talking a literal War I'm talking I've expanded the scope a little bit to be like yeah but also like narrative Wars and you know Community alignment stuff like that there you go all right all right leave it there take from Ryan Sean Adams says too many of y'all taking VC money in crypto when y'all should be bootstrapping look Hayden Adams built uniswap in a cave where the 65 000 Grant and a box of scraps nice nice reference there that's the power of crypto just because of VC wants to give you 10 million dollars doesn't mean you need it more building less raising nice bootstrapping friends bootstrapping like like seriously we don't need tens of millions of dollars to build what we're calling d52.0 like we don't need it and I think too many teams raise too quickly so this is like immaturity or some of it's like there's a glamor in having a large VC with a brand name write you a check right um I like this is the power of ethereums right one developer a very small team weekends evenings can crank out some very powerful piece of code and you need to find out if you have product Market fit before you actually know if if uh you need the VC money to scale this thing out yeah and I think too many people are skipping that step and uh it's to their detriment because um kind of spin their wheels I just I would love to see more bootstrapping uh and less money right out of the gate and so that's my encouragement for uh for product teams uh right now because even in this bear Market David it seems like the VC money is still flowing like the private deals are getting done we're seeing um massive raises every single week some of sometimes that's right but like you need the money to scale you don't need the money to actually prove uh and get some Market validation in crypto you can do that with a small team with a box of scraps as Hayden Adams showed us last take of the week here is I don't know if this is a take but it was funny uh Dash stormy one.e says POV you're listening to bank lists with your trustless state and Ryan Shaw Adams talk about the most famous sports figures in the world and then it's the GIF of Michael Scott just like bearing his face oh wow we really screwed up last week yeah it turns out we were talking about uh Roger Federer and Nadal like two of the most famous like tennis players I had no idea brutal I had no idea that's brutal I we've been outed as uh not a sports fan this is not a sports podcast all right guys we talk crypto we have like like we'll talk talk like geopolitics and we'll talk economics but apparently not sports that's not a prerequisite for understanding crypto the consistency that I got this take across Twitter Youtube comments telegram Discord my friends like cute guys that was Roger Federer and was it Nadal what's the dolls we apologize don't don't take us deeper David we apologize to the uh entire bankless Sports tennis playing Community yes but I will say this in our defense okay learning about sports is an opportunity cost to learn more about crypto yeah like I'm just I've never been able to justify I'm like I could learn more about a sport and watch a game or I could learn more about crypto right and I always choose the other thing it feels like one of the trilemma like pay attention to sports pay attention to crypto and like have it have a podcast and you get to pick two of those things yes and I know which ones I've picked all right yeah that's right me too David I'm I'm with you but um sorry on behalf of the the sports the people that have chosen to not pick up the people yeah it's totally fine to have a sports life outside of crypto it's totally fine we support you anyway David in a different world I would like to challenge bankless listeners all right I didn't know who Roger Federer is but do you know who this is because this is Ryan what I'm bullishing let me look it's so first of all I see on the right it's David in a three-piece suit yeah look at snazzy with that gray vest buttoned up a nice tie and with a gentleman to his left now this gentleman has a flag of Ukraine nope that is a there's a story behind the flag you're not going to guess what that flag is oh that's not okay yeah it's it's very small that is the story behind that flag is that is the Russian flag but the red of the Russian is removed because they are trying to remove the blood of Putin and what he's doing in Ukraine oh that's a big thing yes it's an older it's an older person so should we give people like a few more seconds to yeah so I'll keep on giving hints this is at the Oslo Freedom Forum Gala uh and uh that's my last hand actually that's all I got there's it's someone that it's also someone that David highly esteems clearly from his voice and the big smile on his face yeah the cameras the boy is stoked in this photo very excited I know who it is this is Gary Kasparov who is the last world's best chess player to be the world's best chess player before he was beat by an AI Deep Blue by IBM in 1994. that is personal hero of mine not only is he a fantastic chess player I don't know if the bankless nation knows but I play a ton of Chess uh I have a series level not at Gary's level but he is also just a freedom fighter and like very much I believe shares a lot of the ethos and values that I do and I think bankless does and he's also a great podcast guest and hopefully he will one day be coming on the podcast that's what that's what this was all about is Gary please come on the podcast we know you listen to bankless well so the story the story here is that this is a uh you know the uh this Gala they try and raise money they sell like people put things up for auction Gary put up a chess game for auction at the gala a game of chess a game of chess with Gary Kasparov yes and I bid on that and I won and so I get to play a game of chess with Gary kathrov and I'm stoked say we got a utility nft which is uh you can cash in for a game of chess with Gary Kasparov that's awesome man if I can rotate this into a podcast however live stream jobs yeah yeah we'll figure this out host it at your house just put the camera yes into my wire this morning so it's locked in it's awesome man um yeah he's a great individual I've heard him on many podcasts that gets by the way to what I'm bullish about this week because that's what you were bullish about yeah just meeting uh one of your Idols Gary Kasper off um I am bullish on podcasts in general oh yeah that's good yes so I've been doing some podcast binging um I know some of your favorite podcasts but I probably don't know all of them David but like um Lex Friedman I listen to a lot Sam Harris I listen to it all a lot um I think podcasts are like the only digital media source that is somehow not yet a slave to the algorithm and what I mean is like podcasts aren't like timeline sorted right you have to actively go and subscribe to a podcast and this makes it a very unique media form like all of the RSS feeds are self-sovereign and they're not hosted by anyone you can select whatever podcast player you want um and so much of the time like I all of the media that we see is just uh arguing it's like like they call it debates but it's mostly people talking past each other and like all sorts like we're all siled in these algorithmic uh information Bubbles and podcasts to me at least the ones I listen to are like a breath of fresh air like Lex Friedman will actually have a conversation with somebody who actually listened to the other person try to understand what they're saying right rather than just freaking like um yeah yeah optimize for the algorithm it's like a deep rich conversation and I'm just glad that we've preserved this because I feel like in this hollow world going back to what Ben Hunt was talking about there's just all this this hollow media out there and podcasts have not yet succumbed to that so I was just appreciative and I'm bullish of podcasts themselves you said earlier in the episode um if you want to start a war start a podcast if you want to start a movement maybe that's another way of Revolution start a podcast uh and you know why this works so well and then what what how this is related is RSS feeds are a decentralized technology they totally are dude it's like TCP SMS and RSS yeah um so anyway bullish bullish on podcasts in general this is why we love this this form I mean we put our stuff out on YouTube YouTube's important we're doing like you know channels for it but like we will always have a podcast like it's just a piece it's a fantastic you can't stop us it's a it's a fantastic form of communication and uh David you taught me that because um you know you got me into podcasting I appreciate that thank you to convince you to do a podcast and as soon as that ball was rolling it was off I've long been a consumer right I didn't know that anyone would actually tune in to and listen uh to us um talk about crypto like every week but this this is uh I guess also a question to the bankless nation is what podcast do you guys like what do you recommend who should we listen to as well leave a comment drop a comment in the comment section yes leave a comment in the comment section um all right meme of the week time you ready for this is that even the week two beams of the week this week oh lucky uh so this one is uh titled this time is different and then if this is the weak Doge versus very strong buff doge meme so you got the weak Doge in 2008 saying oof 2008 we made some bad loans and in 2022 we have ripped very strong Doge and that caption is the global economy is a gigantic positive scheme things seem worse this time around is this what this isn't playing yeah oh yeah it's like it's like oh 2008 that's cute the entire global economy is a Ponzi different order of magnitude we're dealing with in these uh 2020s and I thought this one was a nice continuation so this is a cartoon illustration of what is a like a Wall Street Banker with a suit and tie standing on top of a pile of money pointing down at a lady holding a Bitcoin sign and this Banker is saying your Ponzi scheme is killing the environment and I thought that that was just a nice way to around this uh this meme of the week off yeah I guess it's just a matter of preference in terms of which Ponzi do you prefer because it's all ponzis all the way down that's that's what it seems like David yes yeah all right well this is the time to remind folks after we just talk about Ponzi that uh crypto is risky all right you could lose what you put in so it's Bitcoin so is he so is defy this is definitely not for the faint of heart it's not for everyone
