what's defy 2.0 where are the best yields in crypto and how do you catch a vibe all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the important narratives and headlines from around bengals this week as always there are going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so before we start i want to shout out our sponsor pool together which just announced pool together v4 the no loss d5 lottery has just leveled up by merging all the fools together into one big prize pot and the pool together treasury has allocated 1 million dollars to the prize pools to celebrate the new launch dive into the pool at bankless.cc pool together so roon christensen the founder of maker dow came on the podcast this week to explore two big statements he's made over the last couple weeks the first is a technical case for maximalism the tldr is that over a long time horizon only one layer one blockchain can survive it seems impossible to bridge your assets from one layer one to another in a trustless way and that kind of defeats the whole purpose of all of this so this ties into the protocol sync thesis where resources will gravitate towards and orbit around the most decentralized credibly neutral protocol if you just think coming from the perspective of you know i'm making i'm going to make a blockchain i'm going to make enable d5 i'm going to make sort of a you know block you know blockchain business blockchain economic ecosystem and all these things right like the number one thing you're always thinking about is like if you're trying to optimize for a good blockchain a good environment for people to build the main thing people care about which is why they're using d5 and why they're using blockchain is is um you know interconnectedness essentially right like this this um interoperability right the synergy uh permissionless innovation manually goes this is kind of the entire value proposition right so the the um you know so there has to be like a really compelling reason to sort of deliberately exclude that which is then which then becomes this of this l1 narrative essentially right which is this idea that you can be a self-sovereign you know a dominant blockchain essentially that can have its own ecosystem the other part of this conversation covers the environment and that was also the topic of market monday this week fixing climate change we talk all the time about programming our values into our money and it's time to put that to the test roon argues that we can and should be making die into clean money accepting collateral and prioritizing investments that demonstrate an alignment with sustainability for a community like maker dao which has solidified its spot and defy it seems ripe to begin pursuing the greater good for projects in general i think a good rule of thumb is that first comes growth and then comes purpose while the more og protocols are solidifying their place and seeking purpose a new crop of d5 projects are exploding into their growth phase recently termed defy 2.0 this new class of primitive seems to be emerging with some shared attributes like an emphasis on openness and dows really defy native really composable and also risky on state of the nation this week we had jay the co-founder of rari capital on rari capital is one of these defy 2.0 projects and we covered it in an article last week but basically rari is a protocol for money markets so that's lending and borrowing on any defy asset during the episode rory actually crossed 1 billion in total value locked which was really exciting to me this whole zoomer 5 defy 2.0 phenomenon is really just that like we have these risk-averse protocols we have this risk-averse foundation and what would rari be if it didn't really already have assets like die or other money markets out there right so it actually is the time towards leaning in towards like some of the these riskier ventures because as of just a few minutes ago rory capital crossed a billion dollars locked in defy so you know that something is working it did it did yeah on the screen david do you have some sound effects for this this is pretty memorable oh gosh uh i don't i don't think i do oh no it's only music it's only music i don't i have the right sound effects uh but but jay congratulations my man on crossing a billion dollars in defy so clearly the strategy is is working out how does it feel to have a billion dollars in the smart contracts scary [Laughter] good answer after we just discussed this the riskiness of d5 2.0 however is not to be slept on and a massive liquidation event hit the olympus dow pool on rari earlier this week this sector is an experiment uh but these platforms have seen tremendous growth while the traditional d5 blue chips have certainly been much quieter an increasingly loud space in crypto have been dows but for the amount of energy and hype surrounding daos the tooling and infrastructure is quite primitive the business model and internal structures are also brand new and experimental our resident frog monkey argues how the next unlock for daos is decentralizing capital flows so the idea is that not everything runs through a treasury department or a centralized hub of resources instead you distribute out those resources to a set of interconnected nodes and let the power of a network take over and suddenly you turn from a more centralized linear flow of capital to a decentralized web of relationships and what you're seeing here happening in real time is metcalfe's law the more connections you have in a network the resilience and efficiency of that network increase at an exponential rate so crypto gaming is here uh but it's also still definitely on its way this newer sector is exploding so we brought on some key community members from axa infinity and elluvium to talk about where we are and where crypto gaming is headed so here's the way i take a look at it defy is the gamification of finance game 5 is the financialization of games these are actually no different you're just coming at it from kind of the opposite ends and when you combine them what you have is basically play to earn and the metaverse where um if you watch ready player one people own their assets across different game experience buying uh buying these assets and owning them and then taking them basically to their whole virtual lives of them so i think they're just opposite ends of like the same same outcome what i liked most about this conversation is how positive some it feels this doesn't feel like a competitive environment uh the core builders in this space just want to see an entire economy built out and flourishing the passion here is not about making the most successful game at the expense of users and at the expense of competition it's about shifting the paradigm creating a world where the lines are blurred between gamers and developers where earning and owning are real things in the digital world removing boundaries and incentivizing growth and collaboration other emerging sectors are nfts and scaling and both of these are happening in parallel uh layer one ethereum will increasingly become a hub for bundles of transactions instead of individual ones so your nfts will likely live on layer twos down the line and it's worth learning about how to get ahead of the curve and figuring out how nfts work on layer twos this feels like a fractal of the idea of modular block chains uh which we've been talking a ton about lately the idea here is that we separate out different layers on the blockchain for different purposes we have the consensus or security layer on layer 1 ethereum mainnet and then we use rollups to build out the user aggregation front end layer this week we also covered where to find the best yields in d5 things like curve and yearn m stable and barnbridge oh but where are the hottest yields in d5 well not gonna make it luke defy's hottest yields are [Music] wait but i didn't catch any of that oh turns out gotta be a premium subscriber for the hottest yields in d5 but i don't wanna be a premium subscriber well not gonna make it luke looks like you're not gonna make it subscribe to bankless get the best yields i don't make the rules and finally on layer zero this week we had on metacartel core member peter pan and if you remember peter pan wrote the before bitcoin series which david can't get through without crying so it's probably worth a read uh and this conversation covered a lot more going through his journey into crypto and being an early pioneer of the dao space and when it boils down to it a dao is basically just a vibe daos introduce a lot of complexity into an organization and it's honestly much easier to understand what's going on if you just try to catch the vibe rather than i don't know analyzing a hierarchy chart or going through a bulleted list and with vibes instead of having a list of rules or some objective rundown or bureaucratic small print you just have a feeling vibes encompass work play culture incentives and compress them into a type of shared knowledge a harmony between those sharing the vibe a vibe is an understanding and although you can try to talk about it and try to define it eventually a vibe is something that is unspoken deep uh subjective and internalized vibes are a good way to conceptualize the complicated nature of dows instead of trying to learn every detail read every word a white paper uh every interaction just learn the vibe learn the principles and when you are like coasting on top of this vibe you can start doing some pretty cool things so with that i want to quickly shout out our sponsors matcha alchemix ledger and arbitrum vibes are being built on top of these projects and also this video wouldn't be possible without them so thanks a lot and finally none of this is financial advice eth is risky d5 is risky our vibes risky but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bengals journey see you next time hey we hope you enjoyed the video if
