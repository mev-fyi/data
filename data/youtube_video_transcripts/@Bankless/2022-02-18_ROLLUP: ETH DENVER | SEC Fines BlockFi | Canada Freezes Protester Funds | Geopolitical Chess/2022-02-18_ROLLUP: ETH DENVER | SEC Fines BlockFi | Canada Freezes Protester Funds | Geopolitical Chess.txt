bankless never ever misses a roll up but then i'm going off to eat denver that's awesome man yeah so guys david is live he is our eat denver correspondent right now hey bankless nation happy third week of february it's roll up time david hoffman how are you doing oh my god ryan it's the best week ever not only is it the third week of february but it is east denver week which is what you can see going on behind me just a little bit vitalik just finished up his talk and there's so many more talks later today that i'm really really excited for uh east denver as i've said before holds a special place in my heart so i'm excited to uh to bl blast through this roll up because bankless never ever misses a roll up but then i'm going off to eat denver that's awesome man yeah so guys david is live he's our eth denver correspondent right now before we get into kind of the headlines what we're going to run down in the roll-up give us a high level of like what's happening at eve denver over the next couple of days why it's important yeah so today is shelling point which is kevin o'waukee and a few others uh day before eath denver event the actual east denver opening ceremony happens tonight at 5 00 p.m which i am the opening mc for along with jonathan mann who's got some songs to sing the song of day man oh man he's awesome yeah apparently he just had a i missed it but he had a song about vitalik which was very catchy so i'm gonna have to catch uh watch that on youtube later um but they all all of today is a bunch of uh really powerful talks uh all in the theme of uh regenerative crypto economics which is what kevin owaki's favorite subject is uh and uh that's that's all of today i have my talk later today uh and then east denver kicks off tomorrow uh people have been here for the last 10 days or so hackers have been hacking away uh and just for just you know a little bit of context the first eighth number i went to was 2018 i think there was an ether 2017 before that ethereum 2018 had something like three to four thousand people and that's when eth price was like 600 coming out of the ico mania uh and then eat denver 2019 eth price was like 100 except the energy and vibrancy of ether 2019 was like 50 bigger and and stronger than it was during the ico mania east denver and there was like uh i think another 8 000 people there uh and then uh eat denver 2020 uh was like even like right before the covet crash right before like the liquidation a bunch of people got coded right in denver 2020 not too many not too many that was east cc but like it was definitely there and the energy at that denver was even higher even even like more vibrant and then boom east denver 2022 because we didn't have 20 21 because of covered ethanol 2022 15 000 people have tickets that blows my mind 15 people and so i'm assuming the vibrancy is about to be off the charts i just got here and into this podcast room to record this roll-up but i'm about to go experience it for myself uh i'm expecting there's a there's a lot of newcomers and and so like while all the previous east denver's were a lot of like you know the the bear market east denver's this is a bull market east denver and so it's about to it's going to be a little bit different there's a lot of newcomers here i'm excited to to meet all the people all the newcomers uh and kind of here who steve see people where i was back in ether 2018 and hopefully uh so many new awesome projects get spun out of the inspiration that comes out of this well guys if you uh see david at eve denver make sure you print out your medium article and hand him a copy of your article because that's what you did your first eat denver you were like passing out pamphlets of your writing uh it's a really cool story also yeah i also have a my own poe app there's people that have their own poeps you met me poeps and so uh if you meet me i'll have a poet for you that i met david without me so hopefully uh i'll get issued that poep at some point this year david um and bankless listeners we're going to probably follow up with some other content other episodes on eath denver so uh you feel like you are getting in on the conference even if you couldn't attend in purpose in in person we'll uh we'll do that uh sometime next week but let's get to the roll saturday night live podcast on stage with uh me eric voorhees and kevin owaki the subject is transcending individualism with collectivism so that's gonna be okay fun show and that's just one piece i mean we'll have some other content coming out of eat denver before you try to offer the highlights um but anyway let's get to the roll-ups this week because we have to we can't not we're going to talk about a few things number one we got to do a ranking of the top super bowl ads david a little game happened last sunday bull crypto was all over it maybe it's a crypto bull and advertisers came out and forced we're gonna rank those ads uh for you as well the sec is also finding block fi 100 million dollars is that bearish sounds like it or is it bullish maybe it is maybe there's a bright spot around this also crypto prices are going up maybe tensions are easing in uh the ukraine with the russia situation we're gonna talk a bit about that canada is freezing protester funds without a court order what does that mean what does that mean for crypto and then twitter just rolled out eth tips david wow jack is gone twitter's doing that what we're gonna talk about that too so those are some of the highlights that we'll get into in the roll-up uh david before we get into the roll-up we should talk about notional finance all right because what they are doing is super cool it's a new d5 primitive that wasn't available a couple of years ago and now is in full force fixed rate lending okay that means you can earn interest on your usdc earn interest on your die earn interest on your eth and your bitcoin using this protocol and it's not volatile so you actually get to lock in a rate for up to a year point in time uh david what else do you want to say about notional i mean this is just putting banks to shame isn't it like effectively zero interest rates uh versus over eight percent apy that you can get locked in for a year like this is just it's just so it's so easy these days to talk about how silly and unnecessary banks are so uh this is the highest stable apy rate that i've ever seen before eight point four percent uh borrowing or you can also borrow and you can also lend you can also lend stable uh in um in a stable fashion uh so notional dot finance there's a link in the show notes if you want to get started go check that out too especially with the news of like block fi getting fined and freezing interest rate accounts you can still do these things in defy today so this is a way to do that you can check that out at notional.finance we'll also have a link in the show notes so you can see that all right david let's get to the markets man what is bitcoin doing for us this week bitcoin started the week at 44 000 it is currently at the lower price of 41 900 uh hit a high of almost 45 thousand dollars uh some some chop this week but overall down four percent down four percent on the week and did ether follow suit what's that looking like on the week yeah followed even more so start of the week at thirty one hundred dollars hit a low of two thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars its high was three thousand two hundred dollars and we are currently clocking in at 2 970 uh has dipped since uh i've woked up this morning it's been a down down morning so far overall down uh seven percent no uh three three point three point five percent on the week three point five percent on the week plain with that 3k number as well it's like whenever it's above 3k i'm feeling okay and when it's below 3k i'm i'm not feeling so great about the bull market and um it's just hovering around that like you know 3k is maybe the new 300 a couple of years ago it's funny though you see the same trends in these markets it's just like 10x higher the next go around right well the the ether the ether at 300 meme only actually lasted for three months but i guess we've actually only been around 3k for for a similar amount of time uh the the reference is that in 2017 ether was at like 300 for a really long time while the market just moved around it anyways we're seeing it again fractals fractals that's what we always see in crypto how about the eth bitcoin chart what's that hanging out at on the ratio the bitcoin ratio yeah not too much of a story here currently clocking in at 0.071 so relatively flat on the week hasn't really done too much crabbing out just crabbing out how about uh the bed product so that is one-third bitcoin one-third eath and one-third d5 looks like that's down on the week as you would expect no it's flat on the week flat on the week started at 115 and it ended at 115. oh wow so exactly flat huh yeah that's funny okay um let's talk about why the market is doing what it was doing so i believe it was maybe last friday there was some breaking news about increased tension between russia and ukraine we don't have to we don't have time to get into all of the geopolitics of that but earlier this week crypto saw a price rise uh and that was on the back of putin pledging to partially pull back troops from the borders of ukraine so a lot of geopolitical macro tension that's happening that is affecting markets and of course crypto prices as a result seems like maybe some of that tension is easing uh what do you think about this yeah this there was a statement that putin made about how like genocide is currently happening in ukraine and it's like everyone was making fun of him is like everyone knew you were gonna say that like you when we already knew what the script was and now like we're at that part in the show uh and so like this just seems like a bunch of except for the fact that there's actual like armies and tanks like it's almost just a bad joke uh and so like his statements are like rocking in the markets uh but also rocking the world while people's like people's lives do hang in the balance while like putin just flexes trying to get what he wants uh and so uh it's really kind of like putin's show at the moment like what's putin gonna do i feel like it totally is and for me david this meme summed it up okay so this is uh i think this is like from family guy and uh for people can't see it's like like putin pulling out some sort of weapon like a gun or something that looks very very harmful and then being like psych nope it's just you know it's just a hanger it's something else yeah right yeah yeah it's something else that about sums it up for me but you know what's interesting on the back of this and i wonder if this is related so this just was breaking like as of 10 minutes ago as we're recording ukraine is legalizing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies very interesting unprecedented so they are uh you know on the on the borders of potentially being invaded by a foreign aggressor and what's an action that they take not to outlaw bitcoin and crypto but to legalize it something that most western countries and most countries around the world haven't been ready to do i wonder if that is somehow related right it's like if russia is going to invade their banking system may as well have a credible uh you know neutral public money system to to be sort of a backstop to all of that what do you think yeah if you're about to be invaded by an oppressor you might want to lean into the financial system that sets you free like the contrast there is it's pretty obvious in my mind yeah or i mean maybe this is just a coincidence uh but like i don't know they're kind of ukraine's kind of busy at the moment and then they decide to pass a legalizing cryptocurrency law so i feel right kind of tells you their priorities uh and it's it's i guess it's kind of cool it's kind of cool and of course as we've said before right when you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values so this is ukraine adopting a value of freedom for for their country excited to see david let's talk about some eath numbers because we can't not and this is a another fantastic analytics screen that david mihal came up with this is layer two currently my roommate he's your roommate at denver well can you get him to uh throw in some other metrics that bankless has wanted for a while dropping a request yeah all right so this is really cool another cool dashboard it's layer two fees how much are rollups paying for ethereum security have you ever wondered about that one day security cost arbitrary is paying 100k to get the security of ethereum what's so interesting about this of course these numbers will will go up over time we expect we expect um you know chains like rollups to be the big users the big consumers of ethereum block space overall but look at what they're getting for a 100k in one day fees a massive amount of security they're getting ethereum level sovereign nation state protection for their chain and they don't have to issue tokens in order to do that so if you contrast that with what many of the alt layer ones who are going their own way are trying to do they are issuing a lot of tokens in order to get security right billions of dollars of tokens per year high inflation high token issuance most people don't look at those numbers but of course david mihal has a has another chart for that where you could see it um so that's what's fascinating to me about this l2 fees tracker and i'm glad we can we can see that data very clearly now any other takes from you david yeah something i've learned recently is it's hard to scale caring about decentralization there's a core part of the crypto world that really cares about decentralization but if we want crypto to scale to the world more people are going to care about low fees we've learned this in 2021 more people care about low fees so do you care about low fees well then you can go use arbitrary optimism dydx et cetera but you know what those chains that give you low fees care about those chains care about decentralization so they give you high low fees and then they care about decentralization on your behalf in the background where it's supposed to be but do you know what's also cool is those chains actually care about low fees all right and rather than issuing their tokens and paying billions of dollars in token issuance to uh validators they just have to pay a hundred thousand a day for arbitration to get ethereum level security so i totally agree it's like not the decentralization argument that will win over the masses it's actually the economic argument which says it's cheaper to run a layer two backed by the security of a main chain like ethereum than to go your own way and create a new alternative layer one at least that's the bookcase for l2s which we are bullish on um this is my take that was related people say users don't care about decentralization i think it's such a myopic take okay because the future blockchain users there aren't people they're chains to win in the smart contract wars you have to sell a lot of block space to a lot of chains chains are the new users and these users care about decentralization similar to what you just said david um this is another interesting stat number of ethereum addresses holding point one eth just hit an all-time high i think this is a good marker for uh distribution it's something that bitcoin has has um promoted about like the distribution of bitcoins is a very good metric to see go up any thoughts on this yeah we i was wondering if this is including people that are holding point one eth on layer twos as well as the ethereum main chain because point one eth on the ethereum main chain is gonna cost a lot to move to the l2s uh so i hope those people are accumulating more because disproportionately that the transfer to an l2 cost like i think like point zero three or point zero four um but like we do we do like it's expensive dusk it's expensive yeah but we do like the distribution distribution's very good um let's talk about this last metric so somebody actually did the market cap of the ethereum ecosystem and i've never seen these numbers before it just takes a little finagling to uh to get to them we've seen we of course know the market cap of of eth right which is all eth outstanding i don't know what that is now david something like 40 in the 250 no it's like 300 billion i think oh it's 300 300 billion something like this okay uh and then um but that's not the total market 350 billion so that's not the total of the uh the ethereum economy because you also have to add all of the erc20s all of the synthetics on top of it this chart doesn't even add the nfts which would be another layer on top of it but when you add both ethereum the market cap of ethereum and then all of the tokens built on top you get to something close to 600 billion dollars so 585 billion dollars at the time these numbers were computed and that is the total value of all of the assets within the ethereum economy which is uh which is quite stunning i mean this gets to like nation state levels and i think this is going way higher right so i think there's going to be a time where ethereum absorbs so much we're we're in the you know um double-digit trillions in the next 10 years i can easily see how we get to 100 trillion dollars with when you combine eth and then all of the tokens all of the digital assets built on top of it any uh takes on this yeah two two comments here it's actually a a very i think it's going to be a very interesting uh scientific uh question process uh analytics process to actually figure out the correct way to calculate this uh the market the value of all assets and tokens on ethereum that aren't eth it's not an easy calculation it's not just going up to coin gecko and summing the totals because you not all evaluations of all tokens are the same right some tokens have significant outstanding supplies with low liquidity uh and so their market cap is super inflated so adding up all the tokens is not a trivial process and that is going to be um an ongoing scientific endeavor i think for the rest of ethereum and then the other the other comment i have is this really shows the importancy the importance of the security of ether the asset we have ether the asset market cap roughly matching the value of all tokens outstanding on it now we that i think that means we have plenty of room for more value of tokens i think something like 20 percent first 80 um 20 market cap of ether versus 80 supply market cap of the value of the tokens on top of ethereum is about the right ratio uh but but you can't have something like 99 to one because that one percent of the value of ether is securing the rest of the 99 of the value of the token so there needs to be a balance there yeah you know my take on that last one is it also uh depends on what sort of erc20 token it is so some erc 20 tokens are super crypto native and they settle completely on top of ethereum there's no outside corollary whereas other erc20 tokens right they're actually just representatives of dollars in a bank account somewhere say or you know stock certificates somewhere not secured into ethereum not secured by ethereum so it's different settlement right like usdc is not completely settled on ethereum it's actually settled in a bank account somewhere and ethereum is just kind of the tokenized representation of that so there's even more complexity there but to your other point too imagine doing all of this but then also trying to add up all of the tokens on various layer twos which this doesn't even get into right it's going to be quite the task to put all of this data together into size the economy but proportionally you can see if you just take eth right now and all of the erc20s it's about the market cap of bitcoin like the economy size is the market cap of bitcoin right uh anyway super interesting this is why we think these things are more than just money systems they're economic systems they're like they have gdp they have taxes they're like like digital nation states decentralized digital nation states and it's really cool to see the data coming out about that economies in the cloud economies in the cloud um this is cool david i i just think i know we routinely go over kind of like why buying and holding is is the the best and uh low time preference paying your future self but like holding is such a skill in crypto that people really need to develop and why don't you read out this tweet because i think it proves that point yeah so this is uh this is uh rug pulling the dollar as a frame of reference and instead using iphones and ether to measure value and so this is iphone launch date costs and e so we go like iphone 6 iphone 7 iphone 8 and then how much ether it cost to buy those things at the day of the iphone launch so the iphone 6 it costs you 690 ether to buy an iphone 6 when it got released iphone 7 it only costs you 52 ether iphone 8 it only costs you two and a half an iphone 10 3.3 and an iphone 11 3.7 to where we are today at iphone 13 which is .0.24 ether so like it kind of shows if the ether deflating this is a deflationary asset granted it only started actually deflating with eip-1559 recently but the demand for ether and also the the generalized promise of deflation in the future has made ether a highly deflationary asset this is that instantiated in a tweet it's also kind of sad because now i'm regretting my iphone 6 like what the hell man look at this it's a really expensive iphone i ryan but this is really the way to look at it it's all opportunity cost uh when you denominate in something like eth and i think it's another another lesson for us like you don't have to be a brilliant trader in crypto in order to do well all right the verbs you need to know the two verbs the only two verbs you need to know buy and hold two verbs you need to know okay never sell the trading for later never sell maybe the third might be steak okay so once you buy once you hold learn how to stake and if you get real fancy you could do stuff with like notional and you can start to lend and earn interest that way but like trade that's the advanced stuff yeah like you don't even need to do that that's a hobby trading is a hobby that you don't have to partake in stop buying iphones buy more e that's what i learned from this pretty soon it'll be denominated in just way you know if you way you'll be able to buy the iphone 20. uh all right david we've uh we've got some more stuff to cover on the releases side of things of course we're going to get to the hot news items but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this

we have to start here because uh bankless just released a new podcast it's my favorite thing cast network it's my favorite thing bankless release another podcast what is this one david this is green pill this green pill coming out of kevin owaki uh and so green pill is all about regenerative cryptoeconomics uh regenerative cryptoeconomics comes out of degenerative crypto economics and so kevin milwaukee is obsessed with public goods and how we can make people's externalities in the world regenerative rather than uh you know uh their externalities be positive rather than negative negative externalities are like when factories spew like carbon into the air or dump storage in the water that's a negative externality how can we make social structures and social systems that have positive externalities as in when we use them the world actually gets better it's like an upward spiral of of economics and so kevin owaki is exploring this subject with his gran brand new podcast green pill which we are helping him produce out of the bankless ecosystem oh who's this guy right here vitalik buterin who just he this is his image of the talk that he just uh gave here at uh uh shelling point uh 99 warlock yeah exactly so that's the first podcast first podcast with vitalik buterin the warlock himself uh and he's also got like eight other podcasts already lined up there's carl flores he's also got glenn weil uh and so i'm really excited for this podcast uh it's really just true to the core of what it means to be crypto uh and kevin is also just a fantastic speaker and i think he's going to become a fantastic podcast co podcast host um and i'm excited to listen to it i i think um this is a good podcast to send to like your more collectivist minded uh friends right maybe people more on the kind of the traditional left anti-authoritarian left um people who think crypto's hyper capitalists don't want anything to do with it yes and this is this is very um you know it gets out of the fixed pie mindset that some people fall into in crypto where it's just like let's just uh grab as much crypto as we can and hide in our bunkers and let the world screw itself over right this is no how do we enter the world and how do we improve it so i think it's a good message for people who need to hear that and kevin gets really practical i mean there are projects right now that are that are helping reduce climate change and there are there are mechanisms that we can employ to uh to make the world a better place so kevin's gonna be covering all of that uh what's the action item david should people subscribe how do they subscribe is that their rss there is yeah it's an rss feed you can type it into uh you can type green pill into spotify or apple wherever you get your podcast ryan i just sent you a link and zoom you can actually pull up a qr code so people watching on youtube can just say yeah yeah in zoom so you can actually just scan this qr code uh and it'll take you right to the podcast wherever you want to subscribe to that uh fancy magic right there uh remind me of a super bowl ad david yeah that's exactly right that's exactly right uh so yeah subscribe to greenpeal also if you want to do us a favor and give us a give it a five star rating and review uh so we can get this thing bootstrapped um that'd be fantastic let's screen pillow the world guys uh it's awesome what crypto can do um all right oh i almost disclosed my me of the week ignore that ignore that um all right so let's get back to the next item on the list which is uh orbit a layer two roll-up um let me find the link here david uh what is urbit though while i'm looking for that urban is uh a self-sovereign server it's something like you can take a hard drive and pop it out of your computer and then you can pop it into a different computer and your same computer is like ready to go right out of the box and there's much more to it than that it's actually a very complicated subject but it's um it's a it's a self-sovereign corner of the internet it's a self-sovereign operating system that you can make for yourself uh and so kind of like a myspace page for the self-sovereign cryptographic age where your myspace page is actually like a hard drive and it's also your computer at the same time it's a crazy subject actually it's a crazy subject it's super complicated as well but but like the net of it is um it's trying to reduce reliance on aws and all of the centralized servers and like redesign the internet uh it's almost a new operating system for a decentralized internet if you will and what i remember from this project is bitcoiners have historically been super excited about it as they should be and i think any decentralization maximalist has been pretty excited about it i haven't seen much you know practical use of it yet but maybe that's because the technology is still super early but none of that's the news the news here is that they are launching on a layer two roll-up on top of ethereum so orbit on a layer 2 roll up david what uh what's the tweet say yeah it says uh it's a technical triumph and it cus cause cuts gas costs by almost 200x making planets more affordable and transaction fees nearly trivial planets is a urban technical term they use the like solar system terminology to describe um describe like the ecosystem like your i think your server is a planet for example uh and so they are now integrating uh their their ecosystem with a layer two roller that's really cool to see uh also launching this week is lobby three so we had andrew yang on the podcast who was really advocating for crypto in washington and he said he was going to do something in the space he said you know basically that classic line if um if you're not at the table then you're on the menu right and referring to the crypto industry how they needed to participate in washington lobby uh groups or not crypto would die but like innovation in the u.s would have a much harder time and so he has launched a lobby group to actually bring the voice of web 3 to washington is what it says and you can join as a member of this group what's super cool here is david they've got membership levels and of course the the proceeds go to the lobby 3 lobby effort which is pro crypto crow pro web 3 making some actionable uh differences and the membership levels they're all denominated in eth okay so you become a level one member at 0.07 eth right now and that gets you access to all sorts of various things uh discord access status updates amas with andrew yang events and merch voting and all of the proceeds go to a lobby group it's really cool to see actually politicians and lobbyists raising using crypto native tools right now using etha's money when andrew yang came on our podcast and he said that he wanted to be the uh the paul the politician that represented the crypto industry and represented the web3 industry a lot of people said yeah he's just saying that for votes are you sure about that now yeah are you sure because like look at this uh andrew yang's also coming to east denver he's going to be here on friday so i'm going to take andrew yane to a party it's going to be great but yeah okay even people who complain about he's just saying that for votes okay what do politicians do we're going to give crypto friendly politicians more votes right like that's what's going to happen so be a skeptic about what his true motivations are is you have to evaluate what he's doing and what this what organizations like this are doing on on their merits are they pushing a pro crypto pro web 3 agenda for it or not and if they are again they adopt crypto protocols they dropped crypto values but you're gonna party with andrew yank tonight is that what's happening uh no on friday tonight it's tuesday's thursday night so friday yeah um yeah he's coming to eat denver and he's gonna be just walking around with the rest of the web 3 people um i was talking to carly riley host of overpriced jpegs and andrew yang gets a lot of resistance uh from other people in the political sphere tribes like oh he's not like he's not democrat enough or oh he's not this enough but apparently andrew yang just really vibes with the crypto folk and the crypto folk really vibe with andrew yang something about being like some sort of futurist uh we're with shared values about like we all know the future's coming and crypto people know that and andrew yang knows that and so yeah i'm just very happy to have andrew yang on team web 3. look man i mean what what politician without speaking at event actually comes as a uh as a kind of a hobbyist to a an esoteric like conference like this you know eve denver that's pretty cool i don't even think most of the people here know he's coming i just know that because carly told me he just signed up yeah hey guys wait is that andrew yang what the hell that's exactly that's awesome all right what's up rac doing it's really cool okay r-a-c uh andre we read out his uh tweet thread about why nft skeptics uh need to reconsider uh last week he's been in crypto for a very long time he's released the rac social token over a year ago and now he is introducing ric os as an operating system version 0.1 at uh website rac.fm a web3 enabled portal for all rac token holders and so this is uh rac i think really giving a huge upgrade to his social token and the concept of social tokens at large this is a portal if you have his social token you can go here and do things if you have the social token and so he's giving utility to his social token and i think it's really he's pioneering the way into what it means to issue a social token uh that's really really cool really really super smart guy grammy award-winning artist he probably listened to a bunch of his music he's like a collaborator on you know tons of fantastic things over the years and uh yeah this is look this is the birth of social tokens it comes from creators creating new experiences like this and experiments like this it's super cool to see another one if you want to learn more we did a meet the nation with uh rac a little bit like almost a year ago it feels like uh so that yeah i think this youtube well it feels like we should have him back on to explain some of this too uh another experiment that's going on in the bankless dao world i saw this launch last week is the bankless academy all right so this is uh the ability to start your bankless journey bankless academy is on a mission to introduce one billion people to the exciting possibilities of cryptocurrency so basically it's a way to connect your wallet go through various tutorials like wallet basics for example intro to d5 all of these various lessons and earn things at the end of them so whether you're earning a badge at first or maybe in the future like tokens or specialized nfts again this is an example of crypto pays you to learn about crypto and this literally is what is happening at the bankless academy it's still in beta just launched but a great concept to see coming out of bankless dow this website is sick it looks super simple this is the very kernels of how we disrupt universities universities in my opinion have devolved into just fake credentialism and you know if you want to get really on the end of things extortion out of students the new universities of the web 3 digital age are online courses that establish legitimacy with employers and and employers and then you can go and show it's like yo i've done every single lesson in the bankless academy look at the tokens that i have on chain to prove that credential that i have uh and so this is a new type this is literally decentralized decentralizing the concept of a university bankless academy is like pioneering this path they're not going to be the only ones to do this any sort of like domain of knowledge can have some sort of on-chain web3 credentialism based on some sort of course and if that course is good the builders of that course is good their tokens will be more desirable to have in your wallets to prove that you know what the course offers so really cool stuff it's funny i mean what else is a university diploma right yeah it's like pre-tokenized it's a credential it's something you're given in real life and those are traditional credentials maybe the diploma of the future is a collection of badges and something like this uh yeah really cool to see how that develops um david let's get on the raises section this is another group that is doing something similar rabbit hole they are paving the path to web3 contributors as well they've got sort of an academy where you can earn things by uh taking lessons and they just raise 18 million dollars from a set of vcs really cool to see that get funded the series a rabbit hole is another we've done a lot of articles on on rabbit hole in the past at bankless and i encourage folks that are trying to learn trying to level up in the space to go check out what they are up to any any else any other thoughts on that david exactly what i was just saying like this is this is this is a new thing well not a new thing this is a a new path of web 3 getting explored by both bankless dow and rabbit hole and look 18 million raise uh people people are taking this seriously congrats to rabbit hole uh another big raise is the rainbow wallet which we've talked about in the past nft focused wallet uh it raised let's see what are the numbers here big numbers i think uh some are in the article 18 million dollars another 18 million yeah and led by reddit co-founder alexis ohanian and his venture firm 776. we are actually having alexis on the podcast sometime in march to record with him going to talk about this and the other thing he's up to in the space uh wallace getting funded as well and uh what's this david openc with the venture arm that's what's next what's this about yeah opencv ventures uh so like apparently when you raise hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars you actually can't figure out what to do with it other than reinvest it into the ecosystem so an nft grant grants program coming out of open c so it's actually just genius like they built they built open seat in order to inspire a bull market in nfts because of open seat basically and now they have all this money because of all their success and now they are just sending that money back into the ecosystem and or because they need to you know bootstrap more products so that it's it's so circular it's just such a great move nice flat wheel nice flywheel it does seem like openc i mean coinbase has uh had venture set up for a long time many years it does seem like open seas is trying to be sort of the the coinbase of nfts uh and expanding into the space to take that market share um this is circle the creators of usdc and other things they just had a valuation and a spac deal of nine billion dollars pretty impressive valuation so many unicorns in crypto i don't know we have dozens at least by now um any other thoughts on this yeah i don't know too much about spax uh so i probably shouldn't comment but nine billion dollars is a lot so congrats to circle yeah big valuation uh guys as soon as we conclude the raise section we have to ask the question what are these companies going to do with all of their money the question i just asked david yeah what comes next get a job get a job in crypto it's time to get a job look at johnny crypto get a job all that money it has to go somewhere uh and it's looking for talent right crypto is building itself out this is the early internet the skills you develop in crypto now will be used by these companies and they will pay you for those skills both salary rolls jobs and dows all sorts of things a great way to get plugged in is at the bankless job board that's at banklist.palette.com jobs i'm going to read out a few david don't have time to read them all out but senior product engineer moment ranks community manager dydx a governance growth lead at dydx business operations and finance associate dydx marketing associate dydx an accountant smart defy a web3 engineer goldfinch a senior go rust engineer syneca smart contract leads star x there's even more if you want to just passively explore these opportunities you can submit your profile to the bankless talent collective and talent seekers will go find you ryan i actually i actually want you to go back to the to the uh jobs board and go down to the maker jobs because you want to you want to keep dancing i want to keep well no i want to read these out actually though well there's actually only two of them operations manager at maker down lead financialist analyst at maker dao uh make her i was just how to make her doubt party last night uh maker dao is making some moves in this space there's gonna be a bunch more jobs coming i believe onto this job board so those who are interested in maker uh and want to lead maker into this version of the subdials and working for the subdials stay tuned for all those jobs coming out of make or down coming soon meanwhile people behind you are like who's this crazy guy and why is he dancing yeah what the hell oh we do have an only fans update but this is not that it's not bad maybe that maybe that joke gets cut no no it doesn't let's move to news guys top super bowl ads david let's give our rundown of the top super bowl ads cause crypto had a bunch of ads people are calling this the crypto bull that's what we predicted i think we predicted like seven ish or so and that's around the number that had crypto in it mentioned crypto but uh i want to get your ranking on the top crypto ads i know you saw some of these live others you didn't but you watched afterwards give us the ranking man what were the best ads yeah so in my opinion coming in at number one is ftx with their don't miss out featuring larry david and it's basically uh just uh a speed run through history of all the technologies that have changed humanity the wheel the light bulb bulb indoor plumbing uh even more stuff than that i can i can remember and every single time it's larry david into like different outfits going like ah that's not gonna work uh and it's a very it's a very entertaining ad it was easy to watch the production was fantastic and you know there were so many probably like groups of people family friends where like there was a mix of maybe the kids were pro crypto and the adults were anti-crypto and like all the family were watching this ad and like all the anti-crypto people had to watch this ad and be like oh i'm larry david i'm the one that thinks that it's not gonna work and so if this was not only a very entertaining entertaining advertisement but it was just putting to shame all the naysayers about crypto saying like you're the you're the person that's holding us back about this brand new technology the positive pr that we got out of this uh advertisement i think was super super good yeah i totally agree i totally agree yeah like somebody's going in there and saying oh dad that's you that's you yeah that's you you're larry david it's commercial uh number two let's let's what's your pick for number two david number two is the coinbase qr code which is like i think i've had this idea of this uh uh advertisement for a while so it's like what happens if you just post put a link or a qr code on screen wait they stole your idea david yeah that was i had this idea first so you know the the rainbow dvd like screen saver where the dvd moves around the screen that's what they did but with a qr code and it was so successful that it crashed the app within minutes uh and they they got so many sign-ups uh and and so like ballsy pretty ballsy but like also it's just like thinking like they paid 14 million for this advertisement but they had to pay zero to actually produce it whereas ftx probably had to pay something like tens to twenties and millions of dollars to produce the actual yeah right and so like coinbase this is like a ten dollar advertisement all they have to do is pay for the time uh and if you i think it might be coming up next ryan but if you wait the qr code actually does oh my god it's a second to the corner it's gonna yeah it's gonna happen yes please please please please please yeah of course they do it at the very end yeah so that's that's why coinbase came in at number two and those were in my opinion like the number one and number two advertisements were like very far in the lead and the three and four were kind of mad i didn't know and so i saw this live and i was like qr code should i should i do it should i do it and i did it and i was like oh coinbase and what it does it it prompts you uh to set up a coin based account and g it gave you like 15 worth of bitcoin or something so it's just like a immediate account sign up for them um some people weren't fans right some of the like non-crypto people were like felt it was a little weird or scammy but um you will get to maybe those takes later the third was what david what's number coming clocking in number three etoro which is emphasizing it's social trading and so it was a bunch of people all floating off into the sky grabbing other people to go with them because we're all going to the moon together i kind of liked it because it had we all going to make it vibes also there was a tip of the hat to aboard ape there was a tip of the hat to doge uh frank sinatra's fly me to the moon was playing in the background it wasn't specifically about crypto but it just had like good crypto references uh with big wag me culture built into it so you know coming in at number three nice vibes good metaverse vibes as well number four was this from crypto oh i spoil it who's this from number four crypto.com featuring lebron james and basically i didn't really get this one like it was basically lebron james and somebody else i actually don't know talking about how like should i do it should i not do it and lebron james is like you got to do it because fortune favors the bold and then boom crypto.com and so like yeah crypto like fortune favors the bold you got to take risks but like the advertisement had nothing to do with crypto is this about lebron james i think maybe somebody's talking to a kid version of himself i don't really know uh whatever yeah but you know the cool part is it's lebron james and so anything that he endorses he's got a fan base that's gonna go check it out so you get some brand associations crypto.com is doing uh matt damon earlier as well so they're pulling in the celebs here um a ton of honorable mentions as well like bud lights had nouns in them uh meta what was this uh what is that it was a yeah it wasn't a crypto ad it was just uh advertising the oculus quest but you all know we all know that at the end of the at the end of meta is a bunch of crypto stuff once they finally get there yeah uh it's really cool to see um what were some of the uh the reactions you heard because here's one i heard from like non-crypto people crypto people are of course very excited about this but um i i read a tweet like the morning after saying oh my god crypto is thirsty at the super bowl uh like these takes like if crypto was so great and there's so much money to be made in crypto why does the industry need to run super bowl ads why does it need to even advertise itself and what's funny to me is i feel like uh larry david answered that same question in the ftx advertisement which is like an answer to all of the skeptics some people are seriously going to be skeptical of crypto all the way to 100 trillion dollars david like they're just gonna not believe it and it it's it's going to cost them like money like we have more traction and crypto is so much more de-risk than it was like three years ago five years ago and there's a certain segment of the population they're just i guess i'm not born to be late adopters i don't know can't get past some of their objections to actually dig into the space and ask the question of of why you know uh 60 70 million americans now hold crypto why what what it's doing in the space uh it's always going to be skeptics i suppose any other thoughts on that uh i mean the big takeaway i have is crypto is about money like it's an industry about money so of course we have the money to pay for super bowl ads and also when all of these big gargantuan companies run super bowl ads it does a favor to the entire industry and eventually it gets more people to buy more crypto assets which makes the crypto assets go up in price which funds our ability to make more super bowl ads yeah well that's the criticism though that's the criticism though david that it's just uh they're trying to get you into their pyramid scheme you know the ponzi the ponzi game and that's why they're advertising so if you squint hard enough everything's a ponzi scheme at the end of the day or ponzi game anyways thank you most people don't squint is the problem uh let's look here's another big thing after the super bowl ads i think this is the other big thing of the week so the sec just fined block fi for a hundred million dollars and this is a combination some goes to the fed like 50 million some goes to the states just some context so block fi is a centralized crypto lending provider so you can lend money to block fly uh you can lend your crypto to blockfy and you can also earn interest on blockfly and if you uh do it through usdc the rates are something like eight to nine percent like very high um you can't get these types of interest returns in a traditional bank account of course now last summer the the sec famously blocked coinbase from issuing their coinbase lend product which was a similar product and coinbase said hey hold on blockfy's doing it everyone else is doing it why are you telling us we can't do it and uh they eventually decided to you know to withdraw that product entirely um so now the sec is coming after block five in a heavy-handed way a 50 million dollar uh fine to them and a 100 million dollars total to the states and so when i first saw this like the question in my mind is oh my god what does this settlement mean is this the end of centralized crypto lending it's not and we're going to get into that but anything else we should include in this story at the high level before we get into some of the details um no i think you covered it pretty well i don't have anything else to say well so here's uh i guess that the take um that i was questioning is is this block five settlement on friday the end of centralized crypto lending in the us interested in your thoughts a bunch of people reached out to me crypto lawyers and such and blockfi gave their take and they actually spun this as a big win a big win for blockfy they called this a landmark resolution with federal and state regulators so a hundred million dollars seems like a massive fine for this sort of thing but the flip side says blocks phi is we are getting clarity on a pathway for crypto interest securities so what blockfi has done i believe is anyone who had a a crypto interest account still gets to keep their crypto interest account right now they are not allowing new signups on the crypto interest account so they've disband all new signups in the us um but they will transition those crypto interest accounts to a sec approved version of the same interest account and i don't think this is quite an etf it's it's uh something something different but on the other side of this what it will allow them to do is offer an sec approved interest earning product to all americans and what the sec gets out of this what they wanted out of it was more investor transparency which i actually think is a great thing particularly for centralized lending providers like what is blockfi actually doing with the funds in order to generate that return it's not d5 so we can't see it on chain so it should be transparent so there's actually more than a silver lining i actually do think that this is good news for crypto i 100 agree that the net outcome of this will be positive my big qualms with this is that there's always with crypto there's always like the first through the door phenomenon where if you're the first one through the door you are the one that gets shot uh and so block fi got fined with 100 million dollars a hundred million dollars we as an industry thanks to block five so thank you block five we just finally just paid off the sec a hundred million dollars to get clarity that's how much clarity costs a hundred million dollars and so this is why people the the more radical takes of the world think that the sec is just this extortionary uh agency out of the out of the government who's like oh you want clarity before if we don't send you to jail pay us a hundred million dollars and then we'll give you clarity um i mean block fi ate the fine and now we have clarity uh and so we get to progress forward and take the w but it costs for that w it costs us a hundred million dollars yeah absolutely i i think that is a good take so net net this is good news for crypto i think it's good news for us investors but but there is some some downside with it right so one is what you said like if you're trying to compete against a uh a block file look the sec just made the startup cost even higher right so it's kind of creating this incumbent industry um the other lesson what regulation does that's what the sec does they just create incumbents you know on the flip side of this like uh investors in these products and purchasers of these products could use some additional transparency so that i guess is the good side maybe the the counter balance but one lesson it teaches crypto is like never ask for permission yeah you can't we learned that from uber uber taught us that lesson don't ask for permission you have to go do it and then you have to blitzscale so you're large enough to pay these exorbitant fees or you're never going to make it um the other question to me is and this is maybe the more concerning bit so we'll see what does the sec do with defy now all right because we got we got defy lending right which is trustless we would say it's on chain it's verifiable so you could see the assets you could see the risk profile but is the sec coming for defy next and what's their action going to be in in the territory of d5 the other concern i have is of course the us now has completely different rules so blockfi can operate in all of these other countries like as they had been before but now the us has this very specific carve out regulatory apparatus and of course um it wasn't congress that passed the law it was like the sec kind of passing a law so i mean we had our conversation with um uh uh the congressman yeah tom emmer earlier this week and it's just a little bit like congress come get your boy you know like like they shouldn't be the ones creating these essentially you know pseudo laws they shouldn't they enforce creating laws create rules right so like legislative branch get it together right okay regulators should not be legislating this and taking bribes right uh in order to like move these things forward that's not the way this industry should work and it's up to congress to take some action to rein some of these regulators in and that's what tom emmer was saying in our conversation with him earlier this week yeah no these are all the right takes and i think this is going to be something that's unpacked for the next few weeks so anyways once again thank you to block five for taking the bullet through the door yeah and uh let's let's let's move on to some other nation state actions while we're on it so um trudeau and canada they're having some problems with protesters these days there is a uh you know convi convoy covid protest going on in ottawa going on in canada what caught my attention is not necessarily that protest but on the back of this there is now a mandate from trudeau and those in power in canada to freeze protesters bank accounts absolutely ridiculous this is qui this is qualming freedom of speech whatever you want a speech about whatever you have whatever you want to talk about you have that freedom of speech because we value freedom of speech they are freezing bank accounts to people that are expressing speech that's great it has a lot of downstream effects so regardless of your opinion on the protest and you know bankless isn't here to take one side or the other on the protest um i think like here's here's the quote with no need for a court order this is from the bbc reporting banks will be able to freeze personal accounts of anyone linked with the protest anyone linked with the protest freeze your personal bank account okay and the take is this time it's their protest maybe you're not protesting maybe you don't care about this next time it's yours what if it was a crypto protest david they started freezing bank accounts what if it was well actually those people would be okay right but like i mean what if it was something that um uh that that you care deeply about what if next time it's about like um runaway inflation right and like the labor market and like energy costs soaring and you know something else the price of food government shouldn't be able to freeze people's bank accounts without a court order without due process yeah governments and politics should not be intervening in finance and money those are separate concepts and the the government is using the banking system to silence political dissent that should not be happening ever it should not be happening ever and you know people will say well the protesters did this and they did that like let's just talk about the precedent zoom assets all right zoom out let's talk about the precedent the sets and you know what what's interesting to me david is uh crypto is not impervious here so the finance ministers and the financial regulators uh in canada are actually it's being reported blockading certain crypto wallets so they are coming up with um there was a fundraise going on in bitcoin uh 34 different crypto addresses that contributed to this this fundraise are now being uh blacklisted by fintrac which is canada's fincen financial authorities and so what that basically means david is like if you're a crypto bank you know your exchange or something operated in canada and you receive a notice from fintrac hey don't receive deposits from any of these counts uh don't let any of these accounts withdraw anything they're being blacklisted then you have to abide by that or it's illegal right they're treating you as if you exploited some contract for billions of dollars like that's the same treatment uh okay that's a big problem and of course is the reason i think david uh for the bankless movement this is the reason for d5 this is also the reason that bitcoin can't solve all of our problems if it's just bitcoin and the only thing you can do on bitcoin is just move money from one place to another and you can't trade you can't actually convert to other assets you can't lend you can't borrow and the entire banking system is like built on top of centralized custodian banking we got a real problem and that's why we need defy that's why we need uniswap it's unstoppable protocol for trading that's why we need lending and borrowing protocols that's why we need layer two so we can transact with low gas fees like that's why we need defy i've always felt like and i think this is you know continued proof that just having a non-sovereign store of value without scalability at the base layer and without decentralized finance doesn't actually produce a new financial system it's like just more of the same because there's all of these choke points and the existing bankers and the existing government structures will squeeze the next of these choke points until it starts to resemble the exact same system we came away with that's my takeaway that's exactly right i think this next story highlights what some of the government regulator response is going to be to this sort of thing a treasury official says stablecoin issuers must be banks to ensure security to ensure financial stability some representatives however said the move would crowd crypto native stablecoin issues issuers out of the market uh yes it would but that is treasury's answer just everyone become a bank let's go back to the old system same same story here this this is what we're seeing with regulation regulation is pulling as much of crypto as they can into their fold um but also at the same time this the what makes me optimistic is that at the same time crypto's getting better at more stuff we have so many more products and that's allowing us to be more crypto native while also appeasing regulators at the same time they're never going to get like the wonderland stuff of the world under their fold the anon developers of the world that's that's strictly going to be crypto native but they're going to put like circle and all you know tether and they're going to bring those under the fold and maybe that's enough maybe that's enough yeah and i do think that the the big story here is that uh world governments have moved beyond ignore crypto that was the first decade in crypto it was just like ignore it's not gonna happen too volatile yeah it's stupid it'll never work now they're in the camp of getting educated and actually uh starting to do things in crypto and that'll be a double-edged sword sometimes it will be good sometimes it will be bad an influential policy body uh just warned this is the fsb they are compiled i believe of the the imf it's sort of a you know nation-state regulator body uh they just warned that d5 may shake the stability of the global financial system they put together a report i've read some of it their section on d5 is kind of interesting you can see them getting super educated on d5 they talk about the the privacy which which could be sort of a threat and concern from a you know state surveillance perspective they talk about the permissionless nature of d5 protocols they very much don't want d5 to exist like they would rather it not exist but now that it's here they all have to grapple with what they're going to do about it and they're still in the phase of infancy where they're just they're moving from ignore and now they're getting educated on it and we'll see what comes next i feel like much of this though david is um incumbent protection that's maybe what the s fsb and imf are primarily concerned with is not world financial stability it's financial like it's stability of the incumbents existing control system that they most care about and this is just a meeting in the middle like crypto is making nation states move closer to crypto stuff by making them compromise we saw that with the sec and then also the nation state is using their powers to make crypto compromise to nation state regulations so there's a meeting in the middle but also we still get our crypto native stuff that's right and meanwhile we're getting some big adoption uh as well so twitter just added ethereum wallet support to its tipping feature i never thought i could see the day well jack leaving twitter do you think that's related at all at all absolutely yeah yeah so as soon as jack the ceo of twitter left all of a sudden twitter started rolling out all these nft features now there's a feature for ethereum tipping some people are like well it's stupid because each gas prices are too high but of course you could implement this with any ether dress across any evm compatible chain whether that's a side chain with lower gas fees or layer two which is obviously the future uh and uh it's cool to see twitter adding this now not just being kind of maximalist blinders about this entire space i'm still kind of skeptical as the the whole tipping use case um like uh tipping in twitter like does that really go hand in hand it could be it could be a building block it could be a building block for something better it's something but like people don't even tip in us dollars on twitter right like why would they do so in crypto it's probably just you know bad product market fits kind of like um you know buying starbucks with your with your cryptos like that's the last thing that'll come right uh david let's get to some nft stuff why don't nfts with this yeah what's this oh gosh only fan launches verified nft profile pictures my my uh take on this is that this is coming off of the heels of irene dao the uh the the dow that the the irene the simplify season kicked off simplify season and then also only fans was like oh twitter verified nfts irene dao there's something here for us uh and so now they are like only fans which is generating like bajillions in revenue uh is using nfts uh probably to help their customers their their clients uh uh get more money from their viewers from their users um like and it's like only fans is about taking money from customers who want to see stuff uh and then nfts just make that even more expressive i guess like we'll see where this goes look only fans are creators after fashion so this is the crater economy uh once again uh david what's happening in the crypto punk world crypto punk the biggest crypto punk sale ever for 8 000 ether 23.7 million dollars an alien crypto punk the owner of this crypto punk owned this but i think bought this crypto pumpkin something like 2018 for like a couple ether so so like very you can we can verify that on chain i don't know if those numbers are right but i think bought it in like 2018 for like two or three or four eighth or something so you know a very casual like 4000 x in each terms while ether went from 100 to 4 thousand dollars or 3 000 where it is now uh so gg to the seller gg uh most impressive trade i've seen this year i can safely say that exactly what ryan said the best thing you can do in crypto is hold well it's also another thing which is like are nfts a good way to generate denominated returns if you buy the right nfts that could be a strategy right huh yeah about that i don't know what's what's the next crypto punk david you tell me oh god well don't make me don't make me say that but i mean i've got my money where my mouth is um size of the nft market though okay is only one percent of crypto's two trillion dollar industry this is a really cool board with uh it's called nft go which shows you the the nft market cap which i've never seen before is about 16 billion dollars i'm not sure what this all this includes but still a tiny fraction of crypto's market cap size and a lot of room for growth here in collectibles and it just goes to show how loud nfts are how like nfts have completely changed the entire conversation about what crypto is and has generated so much love and so much hate and it's just 17 billion dollars defy like the erc 20 market cap they were looking at earlier is like 400 billion dollars and no one talks about d5 it's the loudness of nfts off 16 billion dollars in market cap is insane yeah punching way above their weight class from a cultural presence perspective way above their market cap and weight class but also like so much room to grow here if it's only one percent um let's move to some bitcoin stuff fidelity is launching a bitcoin etp i believe this is uh this is in europe and this is kind of like an etf equivalent for for those in the u.s that's what an etp essentially is and it's going to be the cheapest crypto etp in the world at fees of 75 bips so less than one percent which compares quite nicely to gbtc which is in the us over here two percent management fees if you're getting into that product any thoughts uh no thoughts no thoughts we still need our bitcoin native etf and then our ether etf and it would be nice if the sec weighed in on that uh sometime soon but um i feel like i've been waiting for that forever uh david in altcoin stuff or alt layer two things uh tara just signed a 40 million dollar deal with the mlb for the washington nationals this is a sponsorship deal getting crypto into the sports scene yet again any thoughts uh i mean this is we've seen this before we've seen it again like like there's only so many sports teams in mlb leagues and sports leagues that like crypto can buy and so far we're doing all of them it's kind of funny to me though there's there's an element of like is it weird for like layer ones to advertise is it weird for protocols to advertise a little bit like if you if you're a piece you never had to advertise yeah if you're a decentralization maxi then yes it is weird that layer ones are our buying sports teams and and advertising deals i do think it's normal for layer twos i do think it's normal for execution layers so i expect the arbor trims of the world and the star wars of the world to follow suit uh at some point in the future there was also a big vulnerability this week in coinbase and uh a near near miss near disaster near catastrophe update us on that david yeah so this tweet went out from tree of alpha who uh said anyone can can anyone here get me a direct line with someone at coinbase preferably management team or possibly brian armstrong himself i'm submitting a hacker one report but i'm afraid this can't wait can't say any more either this is a uh potentially market nuking like asking for brian armstrong's attention on twitter is like everyone wants brian armstrong's attention on twitter but for and no one really knew why uh but this tweet circle around is like and everyone in discord and television gotta take it seriously you gotta take it seriously uh and so i this is a little bit outside of my technical capacity but what that what i think happened was that uh as after this tweet happened coinbase paused advanced trading uh so they had the advanced trading features uh and uh and so they paused all trading on that under and they said technical problems and then moments later it had been resolved so it didn't take that long what i think happened was that a technical glitch in the coinbase system servers i don't know was allowing people to enter trades that shouldn't have been or or just make trades uh that with with fake prices and maybe coinbase had this exploit where these these trades would go through and so what that means is the the market nuking aspect of this is a lot of oracles and d5 use coinbase as their price feed and when you can submit fake trades with fake prices into the system like it's not you're not they're not being able to buy like either a bitcoin for not at the right prices you might have uh just coinbase might be reporting bad prices to the rest of defy and that's what have it could have caused cascading liquidations uh this this hacker uh uh not hacker like white hat hacker i guess uh caught found it and raised the alarm and coinbase answered the call and fixed it in a moment in minutes and apparently saved us all from a black swan event so thank you i guess wow collective sigh of release important to note that this wasn't like um a hack of coinbase's custody solutions right so that's cold storage or even it's hot storage it's it's their order book it's their order yes which uh which could have been bad too uh binance in another crypto bank news binance is removing its name from the blockchain ecosystem formerly called binance chain it's now being called bnb chain which is a little branding exercise i think to sort of separate finance the exchange from the i guess um like the control or the the perception of control that are the ones behind yeah even though it probably doesn't change anything fundamentally i mean finance still runs b and b chain don't they yeah the the last like three things we've talked about binance on the last three roll ups have all been like pr and branding things so that's that's interesting yes uh we are maybe some point having cz on the podcast be a good question for him um like what's real what's decentralization theater right um that's probably not an alluring question for him to bring him on but that's a question that i have in my head uh david another thing is interesting is all of the banks that are now investing in crypto blockchain companies that's why at some level i feel like it's too late for the imf it's too late for regulators like even their banks are capitulating it's like guys you're supposed to be our friends you're supposed to be the insiders and you guys are offering crypto products and uh buying up equity in crypto companies too this is a list look at this massive list of all of these banks that are now in crypto in blockchain they now have investment offerings ing ubs bbva mufg whatever that is citibank barclays jp morgan blackrock all of them the banks are here right my take here is this is a reverse moloch or moloch for good where like because one of these banks is getting into crypto and generating revenue and making money from all the crypto offerings all of the banks have to offer crypto and when all of the banks have to offer crypto then everyone is easily onboarded to crypto and then when everyone's easily onboarded to crypto we no longer need banks anymore uh and so like moloch is forcing all the banks to uh like accept and offer crypto products just legitimizing this bankless industry if you don't understand moloch you don't know what it is listen to slaying moloch episode is a very foundational concept it's about coordination um but this is a moloch for good this is game theory at play right it's basically what you're saying too and game theory forces them all into crypto um last week david just happened what just happened yeah so the insane lunatics who uh connect uh hacked the 2016 bitfinex hack and then tried to become like internet rappers uh netflix has already green lit a series on this um and so they the article says it's a tiger king type movie yeah well netflix is giving the bitcoin couple the tiger king treatment which is i guess some sort of like crazy people doing crazy stuff but we're going to make a movie about it so uh big bitfinex hackers get in a movie yeah i don't know if it's a movie or maybe it's a show it's a series something it's gonna be like a tiger king style series uh i can't wait like now we get like it's gonna be so crazy i can't wait to not be in it at all i want to distance myself very far from whatever this series outputs guys we will be back with the takes of the week and what we're excited about of course the meme and moment of zen but before we do we want to

repays itself what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp are you winning some [Music] guys we are back with the freshest of fresh takes for the week gonna keep it short because david's gotta go somewhere for eve denver but why don't we start with this one what's the take david people aren't mad that nfts are scams they're mad that they did everything society told them to and yet they're still unemployed and drowning in debt while college dropouts make 10x their annual income by flipping memes nfts are a violation of people's perception of fairness this is why we tell people to get a job in crypto this is where the shenanigans happen and i get it like people it's exactly right there's this cognitive dissonance it's like god damn it i've been grinding for so so hard for so long and these monkey pictures are going for millions what the actual f is going on in the world right now and at some point like i understand the cognitive dissonance maybe this is an exercise in meditation and accepting except and mindfulness lean into it i know it's crazy but like you can stop grinding and just get into crypto um not a guarantee like you also have to grind in crypto uh you don't just magically win in crypto but like good things happen the more you get into crypto uh so this is this is great i think this take is 100 right off right on and uh worth reading again they're mad that they did everything society told them to yet they're still unemployed and drowning in debt get a mortgage go to college get student debt get your degree yup try the path be like even become a teacher teacher salaries all of these things like the traditional system has really failed a lot of people and so they're mad and they're taking it out on people who are flashing their nfts and their crypto wealth around it and i get that like i totally understand that it's like it's it's kind of part of the populist movement that undergirds crypto quite honestly but yeah at the same time i think this is a lesson for a lot of people that um just think they can do everything that society tells them to and like not question that worked in the 50s in the 50s and 60s that worked no longer it no longer works you have to continuously reinvent yourself you have to continuously level up and learn and educate yourself on what's next what's happening you can't just take what they tell you as the way the system works and the way the world works you have to constantly and continuously learn and level up and that's very much what like the bankless program is about what the journey is about right it's like a bunch of people collectively going on a journey to try to figure out this industry together and become self-taught all of the people in crypto are two things number one curious number two self-taught they they learn themselves because they go they seek out this information i understand a lot of people are you know don't have the time to do this they're just so stuck in the grind that they can't even surface their their head above water to actually like start to understand the space and my empathy right i've a lot of empathy for people in that position and yet if you are listening um this is this is the way to do it right you got to get out of the prescribed recipes for success and actually figure out how this stuff works uh it's an important lesson for us all right david take us into this take what is it yeah this is from chris burniske bitcoin is like a mirror its hottest narrative reflecting what society needs the most and this is coming off of the heels of uh canada uh freezing the bank accounts of people doing offering political dissent uh and so he's retweeting a tweet that says bitcoin in 2020 to 2021 inflation hedge narrative while we had rampant inflation bitcoin in 2022 censorship resistant narrative while we have governments freezing bank accounts so pick your narrative because we we got them all like and the crypto is coming to take over the world and it's because it's got an answer to everything and so in 2020 to 2021 our problem was inflation boom we have a 21 million supply 2022 we have freezing bank accounts boom we have censorship resistant money uh bitcoin is what you need it to be yeah and i think that's definitely true of of all of crypto uh look man light on the takes this week that's because you're busy we're busy but i got to go talk i'm literally about to run to my talk yeah well okay that that leads into what are you excited about this week david oh ryan i'm about to go talk at east denver about to be on stage it's a dream come true to actually being able to talk at east denver i've been working at this talk on this talk for for a month now i'm going to finish off my slides the next like five minutes uh so that's what i'm excited about ryan what is the talk about you can't leave this hanging oh uh crypto is here to set you free uh and it's all about how cryptography puts power in the hands of the in the individual uh web 2 and tradify concentrate wealth towards the center but web3 and d5 pushes wealth out towards the periphery what happens when we have social structures that enable us rather than extract from us uh so that talk will be available on uh probably on on the bankless youtube definitely on the east denver youtube uh and we'll figure out how to put that on podcast feed some way or another that's awesome man are there any other talks that you're really excited about um over the next couple days at eat denver well i sadly missed vitalik's talk but i'm definitely going to go and rewatch that one but the whole rest of today's shelling point uh talks are really really stacked um i'm just so excited for all of them ryan awesome man what are you excited about you know it's going to be weird but i'm actually excited about this block 5 thing that happened with the sec and i think some people see this as a compromise right it's like not not a good thing to crypto some people see it as a loss um and i get that perspective but i also feel like the broader perspective is this is a concession from governments so the the big picture here is crypto is playing this multi-decade game of chess with nation states a multi-decade game of chess and some people will look at the chess moves in the board and be like yeah that that was a that was a bad move that puts your piece at a disadvantage or you know so people see it different ways but look when we zoom out this was more of a win for crypto than the sec because if you go back in time five years ago for instance the as you see a nation state regulators nation states as a whole did not want this type of product to even exist if you ask them hey can we go make this thing it's gonna you know help consumers get you know lower interest rates they would say no our traditional financial system does that perfectly fine thank you very much please leave us alone they didn't even want to do this sort of thing and krypto forced their hand how did it force their hand by onboarding a whole bunch of users who actually wanted the product right by building winning hearts and minds winning hearts and minds delivering some utility and now the sec is like oh well uh i guess we got to try to salvage this thing and get some control out of it and so maybe from the sec's vantage point they they won a battle here but i don't think they're winning the war like if you ask them if they want this product to exist they probably would have said no and now they're forced into providing a way to onboard more people to crypto so in the game of chess this is yet another move that puts the nation state in the defensive posture and pushes crypto forward uh and like this is gonna play out it's just not your thing it's not like we're gonna be done with it this year and this is the final answer it's gonna play out in all sorts of ways with central banks all sorts of regulators all sorts of nation states in a multi-decade game of chess that's what's happening here you know i'm a sucker for chess metaphors this is blockfi retreating a piece retreating a horse a knight uh into into a more defensive position so it can attack later so we're take we're giving up on one angle of attack we're going into defense mode and we're going to be able to attack from a stronger position later yeah i totally agree totally agree all right david let's get to the meme of the week of the week hot this week all right so i just killed it oh no oh no hold on shift command t all right okay um this is the meme of the week and this is the guy telling the girl who doesn't want to hear it no it's called a blockchain and it means the monkey is actually mine and that's the name of the week that's awesome that girl's like what the what's going on here guys uh this has been our roll-up denver special edition thanks for logging on david uh we're gonna get you the moment of zen in just a minute so stay tuned for that but before i do i
