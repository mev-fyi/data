okay i'll just say l1s are basically cults and the cardano cult is pretty dedicated their validator distribution is the best in the industry better than bitcoin and ethereum in its current state it's by far the largest l1 outside of bitcoin and ethereum with a strong philosophy of inclusive accountability i'd even argue they skew closer to bitcoin than ethereum as to how cheap and easy running their nodes should be they have a very enthusiastic very engaged and probably third best social layer generally and they also have strong teams working on roll-ups like orbis and melcometer and probably the most activity happening around next-gen scaling solutions outside of ethereum and tasus i'd say cardano is the best position to be the number two settlement layer for roll-ups after ethereum but no idea if they can pull it off have we on bank list been unnecessarily mean to cardano
