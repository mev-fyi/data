no matter how many smart people work for your company there are a lot more smart people who don't the advantage of an open system is that basically everybody can participate like you can go basically recruit and draft right and build a community of basically every smart person in the world and they can come participate economists use the term permissionless innovation the internet was classic permissionless innovation crypto is classic permissionless innovation so the potential is to draft all the world's smart people and then to collectively build something that's just like much bigger and better and you know more comprehensive and more innovative than any individual company could ever build on their own it's not what jamie dimon thinks should happen right it's not what warren buffett thinks should happen we've seen this happen over and over again we saw this happen to the internet we saw it happen to the pc we saw it happen to the iphone like there have been lots of examples over time of how you have these systems that other people can build on top of and you get this much bigger and more powerful thing and so i i think we're kind of doomed or whatever faded to kind of fight these things over and over again and i don't know i know what side i want to be on
