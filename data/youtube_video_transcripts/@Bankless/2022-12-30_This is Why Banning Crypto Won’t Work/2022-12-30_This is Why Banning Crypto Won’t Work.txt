so this is the Senate banking chairman says when asked about banning cryptocurrency maybe could be a good idea not too sure here's a quote from him maybe Banning it although Banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore a message to Gerard Brown let me give you another reason it's going to be difficult because we will fight you the entire time these are our digital property rights Senator Brown These are important this is not only difficult because it will go offshore it's difficult because this is a breach of our constitutional rights to own these sorts of assets and to preserve our privacy also I got news for you Senator Brown it's already offshore if you ban it here you're just Banning your own citizens from accessing something that already exists it's not going to go offshore it's it's already it's on the internet bro I think some of this thing is just being uneducated about how this works maybe we'll ban crypto because I'm a regulator and I can do whatever the hell I want I'll just be on that oh you like that I'll be on it no bro like how it works
