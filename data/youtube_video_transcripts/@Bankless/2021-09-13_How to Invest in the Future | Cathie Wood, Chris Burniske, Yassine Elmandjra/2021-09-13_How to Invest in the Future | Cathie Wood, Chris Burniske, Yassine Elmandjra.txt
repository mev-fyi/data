[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless wow david all-star cast today kathy wood came on the podcast two analysts former analysts chris berninski whom bankless listeners already know and also you seen elemadra and wow it was just a fantastic conversation almost felt like we were in the room with them brainstorming the future of crypto with these incredibly savvy investors just a wealth of information almost like insider information as well as you were kind of witnessing an arc invest meeting on crypto yeah this was an interesting peak inside of the dynamics of arc invest right it felt a little bit like a reunion we have kathy and and current crypto analyst you seen also back with with uh chris burniske who uh you know has he has his thoughts like intertwined into the crypto side of our confess so seeing that dynamic in this episode was was really really powerful i think my favorite part about this was and we talk about this a lot at bank list these aging fragile antiquated institutions and kathy and the team over at ark invest really put this into a new perspective that i really really enjoyed which was these institutions keep on looking backwards in order to form their investments they keep on looking into history and that has left such a massive opportunity for people who are actually forward-looking which is the whole point of investment in the first place and so they the institutions of the world which on the bankers program we criticize as like i said as being just old antiquated institutions have really given a ton of opportunity for retail investments and retail educated retail investors to make some of the brightest and most informed and most precise investments in this space and that has really caused a massive division in wall street uh about like the approaches to things like tesla yeah and of course the approach to things like crypto where the traditional institutions of the world reject crypto yet the retail network retail investors of this world really helped bootstrap these networks in the decentralized way that they were always supposed to be in the first place um and gosh there are so many other things in this conversation yeah i totally agree with that though dave like even their metrics are wrong even their investment metrics are wrong because what they're based on the past and they're based on assets that existed in the past kathy at one point in time called herself rebellious people on wall street thought she was rebellious um called herself an odd duck and i was just reflecting on wow that fits exactly into you uh into crypto crypto natives we are odd ducks we are rebellious uh by nature but we are looking at this asset class and projecting it into the future and sometimes we look at the outside world and we're like what are you guys doing right like how are you missing our hands how are you missing this it's so obvious and i think kathy sees some of that too just the the the obvious nature of how big crypto is going to be and how quickly it's going to get there one at one part in the conversation david she actually blew my mind to uh won't reveal like where exactly that is but when we were talking about banks and asking whether they felt threatened um yeah she had a really interesting response on that that totally blew my mind the other part i thought was really cool ryan is that their crypto analyst you seen said that he's actually used some some bankless content to inform some some arkansas analysis onto ether and ethereum which i feel very very proud of that we've actually been able to to influence the way that ark treats uh some of these crypto networks that we hold so dear yeah and that's what this is this whole crypto discovery process it's like just one big group conversation online right like so many of our ideas were actually influenced by chris berninski who's also in this conversation today so it's just this feedback this open source feedback loop of like discovery on what this asset class is what the relevant metrics are and uh this is all about how kathy and arc invest think about this asset class so absolutely fascinating discussion guys i know you are going to enjoy this so sit back enjoy one last thing before we begin david and i have a special debrief today there was some after the podcast conversation that we had with chris and kathy and yasin i want to fill you in on what they said after the podcast i think some interesting tidbits there so to get access to that you have to subscribe to the bankless premium feed that is available for all bankless premium members we'll include a link in the show notes you become a a premium member and get access to that as well without further ado we want to thank the sponsors who made this episode possible and then get to the conversation bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is a powerful platform for

powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer.fi bankless nation we are super excited we are honored to introduce our next guest to you we've got uh three individuals assembled here i'm going to introduce them one by one the first is kathy wood she is the founder of arc invest legendary investment firm kathy founded ark in 2014 focus disruptive innovation they do actively managed etfs that's the product arc just passed 50 billion in assets under management earlier this year and they've delivered some of the best returns that wall street has had to offer all through one thing and that's investing in the future so it's no surprise they were all so early to crypto kathy great to have you how you doing uh great to be here ryan i'm doing fine and i have uh you have two other individuals i know you're going to introduce of whom i am so proud so why don't why don't you take it away well these are these are fantastic individuals as well uh the next is yaseen almandra yasin joined ark in july 2018 as the lead crypto asset analyst where he focus focuses on crypto assets of course the portfolio allocation of them the institutionalization of them he also has a specialty in on-chain metrics you seen great to have you as well great to be here ryan thanks for having me and bankless nation you also know chris berninski from a previous bankless episode uh he's a venture capitalist and partner at placeholder vc before starting placeholder he actually worked for kathy as a crypto analyst back in 2014 back when crypto was called like next generation internet and he led the firm to become the first public fund manager to invest in bitcoin chris thanks for having b for coming back with friends this time good to have you sir thanks for having us thank you thank you are are those asset numbers outdated by now oh yeah we're um i think we're a bit north of 75 billion grows fast congrats yeah well done congrats you've been blessed with great talent so fantastic and you've been blessed with some foresight too which we're going to get into first but just to give everyone some context of how we're going to do this podcast i feel like what we're trying to do is paint this beautiful tapestry of crypto investing so kathy's going to help paint the picture yacine's scene's gonna add the detail and chris is going to add color as we go and i gotta ask before we begin um when was the last time this dream team the three of you guys were assembled together or is this the first time i don't know believe it or not it was earlier this week did i forget that that's true we were on i thought you meant physically together physically might have been your book signing chris i might be wrong on that uh yeah chris that that's how i met yaseen three and a half years ago and that's actually i i like to think how i landed my job at arc uh but it was uh it was a funny story where i actually stumbled upon uh arc through twitter and i was following both chris and kathy at the time and i was at college as a senior in college and at 11 p.m right before i was going to sleep i see a tweet from chris of make sure that you come to my book signing tomorrow in new york at 5 00 am and i was like all right i have to go so i ended up booking a train ticket that night and that's where i met both kathy and chris uh and that was kind of in the middle of my my interview process so look you've seen i don't know how many people that book brought into crypto but i am one of those people actually so i started to really get interested after reading uh chris's crypto asset book it was kind of foundational to uh me coming up in the space so chris you brought a lot of good people into crypto sir thank you thanks you guys that's gratifying to hear and i learned a lot of it from kathy and yaseen's hustle worked you know for everyone who's out there trying to get a job in the space um showing up physically and um displaying your passion and your ability to commit in that way um is meaningful attend those book signings guys that's what you have to do to get a job at crypto all right so we're definitely going to talk about crypto today but first i think we want to uh do do some high level orientation here and kathy we want to understand a bit more about how you think how you think about investing and i think as david and i were talking about doing this show one thing that really struck us is um ark has seen an insane level of success i think by doing one thing very simply and that is pricing in the future today like no one is pricing in the future like kathy would nor confess your talented analysts and and that seems to be the investment thesis for arc and i want to ask this question to us what makes you think this future that we're always talking about is so close oh my goodness uh we are on the threshold of uh an explosion in innovation and crypto is symptomatic of it uh the seeds for what is about to happen were planted during the 20 years that ended with the tekken telecom bubble those seeds have been gestating for 20 to 25 years sometimes 30 years and are now beginning to blossom and that's not even the right word they're they're they are exploding into into existence so we think there are five major platforms 14 different technologies that are all uh getting ready to move into the sweet spot of their s-curves and there are going to be convergences between and among these technologies so you're going to have one s curve feeding another feeding another uh and creating explosive energy and explosive growth and i think in the in the crypto space uh we're going to see blockchain technology and artificial intelligence converge and cause explosive reactions so it's it's pretty exciting uh just to get back to um investing in the future when i when i uh was trying to explain to someone what i wanted to do before starting arc uh and who's not in our business he said to me oh you mean that in the future of investing is investing in the future and i said you got it well now when i started in the business that's the only that's the only way people thought about investing and then we went through the tekken telecom bust and then the 0809 meltdown and we ended up with huge risk aversion in the markets and a a tendency to invest very much like the broad-based indices out there in other words not adding much more value than the indices themselves and the indices are where they are because of what has happened historically the largest companies the most heavily weighted companies in these indices are there because of their past success but if we're right and all of this disruptive innovation is about to explode well they are in harm's way kathy in a presentation that arc gave in that the big idea is 2019 there's a slide that you guys have uh that talks about illustrate some sort of relationship between innovation and investment and just the development of technologies and the future and on the very right side of this graph where we are currently today 2020 you guys have it just like soaring up into the right with exactly what you just said like so many different technologies all hitting the peak uh steepness of their s-curve all at once so a couple questions here have we ever seen any sort of alignment of the stars with how many different technologies are like really hitting their strides all at once and what makes you believe that this is actually true yes well this uh chart uh was uh was drawn by uh brett winton or developed by brett winton uh who's our director of research and uh he was working with academic literature to try and understand what would be the productivity or the impact on productivity of the combination of these platforms and what what he's depicting here is the productivity uplift is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen we've only had we've had multiple platforms evolving at the same time only once before and that was in the early 1900s telephone automobile and electricity and uh that that world uh there was a that that was the technologically enabled innovation of the time and transformed our world completely let me put some numbers on where we are now in 2019 when we did this chart uh we um we uh evaluated the market cap around the world associated with truly transformative uh innovation that was that year it was seven trillion dollars so it was less than 10 of the global equity market cap that's public equity uh the next year last year that doubled to 14 trillion and we did have a very good year last year we believe that in the next five to ten years that number is going to north of 100 trillion dollars uh but what what we're not saying when we do so that's the upside the downside will be in the broad-based benchmarks which have uh been beneficiaries of the traditional world order and are now going to be disrupted and disintermediated so in order to summarize this section about like this explosive innovation what what is the current market holding true that you think the market is fundamentally wrong about uh i think um the the pace of innovation and the convergence uh between and among these platforms uh most investors have never seen exponential growth well they they recall seeing it once it was during the tekken telecom bubble and that ended badly and that's why there's been this allergic reaction to innovation and high valuations most investors have a one-year time horizon maybe 18 months we have a five-year investment time horizon the early years of exponential growth when we're at low numbers in terms of the base uh the numbers don't look that much different from linear growth but when you uh go out five years the difference between exponential so revenue growth rates in the 25 to 50 percent range per year and uh and let's say gdp growth which might be 5 at best night and day and i think what gives us uh the differentiation is our starting point we start from the top down trying to size markets and we center our research on something called wright's law wright's law is a relative of moore's law moore's law is a function of time rights law is a function of units and uh and actually wright's law has worked better in the semiconductor industry than moore's law itself during the last few years uh and so that's how we get to numbers like the electric vehicle space 2.2 million last year but the costs are dropping to such an extent now that we think that number is going to 40 million almost half of the global cars sold in five years actually more like four years now no one has that kind of accelerated growth in their models they've never seen it before so they're not modeling it in the future but wright's law is a very good guide just just to hop in and emphasize this point because i'm sure you seen and i both have built these these right law rights law models kathy's saying like as you increase the units of production there's a certain cost decline curve to that technology and so that's a lot of arc's work of being able to predict out five ten years what are the costs of these things going to be based on the the units produced there's this other thing that was coming to my mind as kathy was talking and elon musk has this line of fate loves irony which always messes up my head but um when i think about how backward-looking a lot of traditional finance has become that comes at the same time in the backwards looking is as kathy's saying focusing on indices and investing based on the past that's happening at the same time that the world is changing at an accelerating rate and so there is this this tragic irony that people are more and more backwards looking in their investing at least institutions are while you know the opportunity is getting larger and larger in the future and i think that what what's great about that actually is it opens up a space for retail um and you know arc is predominantly i think retail favored with growing institutional respect and i think that will only grow over time but the opportunity is really for retail to catch up to institutions you guys say front run the opportunity but it's just retail being future looking while the institutions are backwards looking well said absolutely and this kind of this this you know tragic irony that you're talking about chris kind of gets into uh another question that's been on my mind which is this like we all have haters out there david and i we have we have haters you know it doesn't take long to scroll our youtube comments you know every once in a while there's lots of people who are willing to um you know trash what you're doing and kathy you have some haters too there's an anti-kathy wood etf out there i've heard critics call what you're doing unprofitable tech that's what they call your sector um our friend from real vision raul paul uh was just on recently and he says part of this is because people are fundamentally afraid of change is there something to that why do you think there are like the haters of the world disparaging the work that you're doing and kind of your method um actually i feel very comfortable when when i'm in that kind of situation if everybody loved what we were doing and were and were and and they were chasing it i'd feel much less comfortable so i'm kind of used to it i've faced it actually inside the traditional world as well as i became an odder and otter duck [Music] and my uh counterparts were becoming more benchmark sensitive so you know it was kind of seemed like to them at least uh rebellious uh so are they afraid of change um i think there's muscle memory associated certainly at the high level management associated with the tekken telecom bubble and many equity uh uh leaders went down and basically ceded power to the fixed income uh market so many of the leaders of financial firms came out of the fixed income world uh because of the tech and telecom bust many equity uh leaders lost their jobs then and then again 0809 and so you have this very conservative group of people who really uh haven't managed equities ever and and actually i understand more benchmark sensitivity since that's how that work world's world works um and i i suppose this just seems like again an odd duck running around uh with her head cut off you know uh they they're not willing to look at the kind of research we're doing which we provide freely out there in fact we provide our uh tesla model right and to help to educate people saying look we've done the research that supports these numbers and i think the biggest surprise to me is that giving the research away spoon feeding them with the models has has not changed much uh but i think it will change we're just going to ke if we're right if we are right uh then those who are wedded to benchmarks are going to lose their jobs i would i would i would only add that your research has educated retail right institutions might might be um dismissing it currently but you have your following kathy yasin has his following like ark's team has been empowered to connect with their audiences and while there are haters of arc there's a much larger army i think of lovers on you know reddit and twitter and everyone cheering on what ark is is doing um based on the open source research which is and it has been wonderful in fact there's a concept called accredited investors in in our world accredited investors um have to meet certain income and asset thresholds because before they can invest in anything risky uh which the sec deems risky now hester purse at the sec is fighting this concept and so are we we're trying to democratize investing and give these opportunities to um to anyone now if you ask me who are the accredited investors in our space i'm going to tell you it's the retail they know because they're reading our research and you know these the these investments uh they do not many of them do not make lightly they want to study everything we put out those are the truly accredited investors so hopefully we're going to be working with the sec uh over time to to to change that dynamic well said you seen what did you add to this yeah i i was going to add that you know hate really kind of signals that you're on to something most of the time there's that whole like famous quote of like first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win like that's that's kind of what we're seeing in real time here um you know i'd also add that i don't think it's a coincidence how a line kind of the crypto adoption curve or the crypto ethos has been with kind of arcs trajectory as well you know it starts obviously at the open source research ecosystem level where you know we want the information we we acknowledge that the information is commoditized so the best way to use that information is to share it with the world so that it can battle test our assumptions it's going to be out there it's open source same thing is happening in crypto right you have readily available data that anyone can access it levels the playing field uh and then in terms of the adoption curve as well i mean the first to kind of bootstrap these networks are retail investors um and they in a lot of ways were way ahead of the curve relative to institutional investors where now institutional investors are have just begun to dip their toes um in bitcoin let alone you know other other uh crypto assets so um there's some high alignment it's and it's really interesting to kind of see that play out in real time so bankless listener i i hope you can begin to see the lens through which arc views everything and it's very much aligned with with a crypto lens i heard things like open source analysis heard things like s-curves and exponential growth um you know kathy talked about herself as an odd duck i feel like an odd duck i feel like a rebellious investor when we're talking about these things i'm sure many of you listening will resonate too um so let's get to that topic of maybe maybe one of the oddest things around you guys started doing crypto in 2014 that had to be had to turn a lot of heads of course and i know you have a five technology platforms you're investing in so genomics is one artificial intelligence is the second robotics is a third energy storage uh and then also blockchain we can call it crypto on this podcast so let's talk about that last one the weirdest one maybe the most understood maybe the most rebellious to date i'm not sure this question for kathy i'm curious at the highest level what do you see in crypto well again my aha moment was after chris had really written the the paper could bitcoin serve the role of money we're just working from a very basic level and uh it was we were talking about a six billion dollar market cap at the time or network value as we were calling it and uh we had art laffer take a look at this paper and uh he looked at it and and helped us we wanted it to be absolutely correct from an economic point of view he looked at it and he looked up and he said wow he said this is what i've been looking for all my life this is a rules-based monetary policy a global rules-based monetary policy and i i ended up saying oh okay well if that's true how big could this become and he said well how big is the u.s monetary base and at that time it was four and a half trillion now it's eight trillion uh because he he was dimensioning it as though it would be the reserve currency a reserve currency out there so that that so a global inter rules based intern monetary system hugely important uh for humanity i believe uh and i share uh art's view i was educated by him so that's not surprising but uh and then um i think the idea again uh chris wrote the book uh we're dealing here with a new asset class also for for investors uh unlike anything we've seen before and you know unlocking huge productivity uh and um creating inclusion like we've never seen before globally so i think uh and decentralized finances uh just mushrooming as we see so you know it's becoming it's going viral you see and i want to pick your brain here with this next question uh kathy just talked about uh in 2014 peeking into the world of crypto seeing bitcoin seeing that it might actually compare to the monetary base of the us dollar uh that and again that was in 2014 2015 we're in 2021 now uh how has uh arcs model for what bitcoin can be or what it is perhaps changed over time and then are there any like on-chain metrics that you like to to peek at that help you back up this belief that has either stayed the same or changed since uh the initial impression that arkhamvest got in 2014 sure so i'd say i want to continue kind of that narrative evolution that kathy mentioned right where you know we started off in 2015 with could could bitcoin serve the role as a disruptive currency um chris a few years later kind of wrote um you know is bitcoin the birth of a new asset class uh and then more recently we we published a paper on kind of a new mental model around you know defining bitcoin in these crypto networks as as novel economic institutions like as a new form of institution um that that kind of introduces a new form of economic guarantee uh and i think that that is a very kind of interesting uh mental model um you know especially as we're shifting from the physical to the digital world of what these institutions represent um you know there's a massive innovation now in in basically kind of shared state uh where as opposed to with traditional databases here you have kind of this read only database that is open source in which the right access is is mediated by open and fair markets and so the coordination mechanism is completely has completely evolved from from what we traditionally rely on in centralized institutions um and so when you kind of think about what this is really good for um it's great for money uh or digital gold as we're seeing with bitcoin um you know what excites me the most about bitcoin is that it's really kind of the first legitimate attempt at a non-state money uh it's it's a representation of sovereignty um you know it's a tool for for freedom and developing nations and so the way that we kind of our our thinking has evolved and i recall in the early days when chris was sizing the opportunity you know we were looking at the remittance use case we were looking at kind of the the potential digital store value use case um you know now in the context of the macro conditions in the context of you know the broader adoption developing nations you know i see bitcoin as as really this this novel economic institution that transcends borders that is politically neutral and that sort of introduces a new uh mechanism to facilitate economic activity um now how does this kind of how do we see this play out in real time and what sort of data can supports this investment thesis or or kind of the general adoption curve that we're seeing yeah i think you can segment this in a few ways i think there's the qualitative aspect of it right where we're seeing the actual adoption firsthand in real time uh you know el salvador this week announced that they have now rolled out bitcoin as legal tender and people are able to kind of get their 30 worth of bitcoin airdropped on their wallet um you know this last these last this last year we've also seen you know corporations adopt bitcoin on their own balance sheet um institutions uh so there's been kind of a general uh adoption curve uh that that has expanded beyond retail uh and particularly this year um that i think is as excited as the most um on the quantitative side of things and you kind of alluded to this in terms of on-chain data i think investors are increasingly starting to realize that the conventional frameworks to analyze these crypto assets um aren't suitable uh and in fact i'll credit chris again for you know really bringing that conversation in the early days with how do you value crypto assay right you can't really apply a discounted cash flow model to value bitcoin or ethereum um and increasingly we're starting to realize that the answer is actually right in front of us it's with the the the wealth of data that these crypto assets provide given their open source nature and i think increasingly the power of on-chain data to assess the network health fundamentals on the first layer but then on the second and third layer to actually identify the relative value of these assets based on what this data is telling us is going to become you know a lot a very meaningful uh part of how investors broadly assess uh assess these assets uh so we we recently published kind of the a framework by which to analyze on chain data um you know we have this three-layered pyramid where we're at the first level it's really just network health and fundamentals so you know thinking about things like hash rate or transaction volume or minor revenue it's like is the network working as designed um you know that can't necessarily uh give us an idea of the relative value of the network but still gives us kind of a long-term fundamental view on it but then a layer above that the beauty of this this data is that you can then segment the data based on you know the number of coins that is located in each address and the amount of time that those coins have been in each address and so that kind of creates these really interesting metrics that in the traditional asset space doesn't really exist so imagine being able to you know have the cost basis of every single holder and being able to identify the flows in and out of exchanges versus miners versus retail investors so there's a there's a wealth of data that you can track that can that can assess buyer and seller behavior and then upon that assessment you can further manipulate the data to then identify kind of short to midterm price inefficiencies based on how holders are interacting um you know with their asset uh and so you know a famous example of that is called the nvrb ratio right which takes the ratio of the market cap over the realized cap uh the realized cap being giving the cost spaces of of kind of crypto holders and there you can kind of identify you know when the market is underwater when the market might be um you know primed for profit taking uh and so you know i think that this is really the only the the beginning stages of of creating this framework and tool set uh but one that we're in for and i am in particular quite interested in and heavily focused on yeah it's it's super interesting there's so much that we could unpack there i love what you're saying you've seen about this new form of institution that's really taken hold that's that's definitely a sentiment we share on uh on on bank lists you were also talking about like the open source nature of this and hey the answers are all available to us in the blockchain and that data is free and open and accessible to anyone it just takes the whole open source analysis thesis that arc has and and blows it out even further because now you don't even have to look at you know 10k filings right we have all of the secrets all of the answers are available to us in this on-chain data um i i want to ask we talked a bit about bitcoin and kind of the uh the sound money thesis as a digital gold um but it seems to me and i think the crypto industry uh is uh increasingly recognized that the story doesn't end there you know chris's book was titled crypto assets with an s right so with bitcoin but now we have this um this like wealth spring of all of these other crypto assets that have come to the forefront i want to ask you about um ether and ethereum uh next so what are your thoughts on ether as an asset and the ethereum network kathy was talking about decentralized finance earlier maybe we can couch it in those terms um wondering if we could start with you kathy your thoughts on ethereum and what's going on in the decentralized finance landscape and how that adds to the sound money value proposition that bitcoin brings yeah um i i think um we've we've um we've been evolving our point of view on ether when we when we started our analysis we were pretty much uh and this was with chris uh bitcoin was what we needed to understand first uh but we were keeping our eye on all of the other assets and and we stuck pretty closely to the thesis the fat protocol thesis that uh chris's partner joel monegro came up with at union square ventures which says that um the value accrual will take place more at the currency level and we believe there would be only a few currencies uh in the world much like uh there are today we thought we thought bitcoin would be the reserve currency and we were looking for the other currencies and and ether was showing uh where it was showing up as uh a very strong second um and and i have been surprised at how uh how how ether and the ethereum network is mushrooming with stable coins nfts decentralized finance it's clearly satisfying a huge unmet need one of those needs is yield out there um and and we see that in the fixed income markets uh the the ridiculous uh uh rallies that have taken place taking junk bond yields down to you know just a couple of hundred basis points above treasuries that's kind of nuts uh uh so this this this hunger for yield is being satisfied by a much more efficient uh financial ecosystem and i think many more people are more open-minded to it as well um let's see one of the things that has struck me from the beginning and when chris uh started at arc which was very close to the beginning of the firm um i remember saying very early on follow the developers follow the developers well uh using that metric ethereum is off the charts you know uh whereas bitcoin is steady as she goes still increasing uh steady as she goes but clearly ethereum uh decentralized finance nfts have hit a responsive cord i think bringing the creator community into this ecosystem uh is you know helping it go a little bit viral more quickly than we would have expected so you guys are you guys are bullish then on uh bitcoin bullish eth yes indeed i would add to when arc was beginning its investigations into crypto ethereum didn't exist right um if you go back to 2014 it was just an idea um when arc first established its bitcoin positions ethereum the network had just launched a few months prior um i remember you know knock down drag out fights arguments uh in arc brainstorms i mean that's that's putting it too harshly but contentious debates um around the dao in 2016 um and uh you know arc is full of varied viewpoints and i think that's part of its strength right allowing everyone to to express their viewpoints um but when the dow happened in 2016 that was uh at least for me the catalyst of oh my god this thing just raised over 200 million dollars from people all over the world um yes it got hacked yes it's a disaster but the fact that this happened um is indicative of uh power basically and um and i would say that with ethereum you know in particular because arc dives so deep into the tech and um wants to understand things through and through ethereum has had a lot of problems um in a way in which bitcoin hasn't and so also as as a at scale investor you know even though arc is as risk tolerating as they come on the institutional side um the the risk profile of ethereum for a long time i would say wasn't suitable for arc um and it's it's in the last year or two entered a sweet spot a sweet spot of suitability for arc and i think i've seen the whole team embrace that and say okay you know even though i'm not a explicit part of the art team we're still in close contact i see you know a focus and openness to what's going on in the ethereum space chris will always be an important part of the arc team and his dm his dna is in arc i i want to reflect on a a meet up that you organized uh uh chris remember we brought the pet in and the ether uh developers together or yeah and developers in our our first office you know one of those startup offices and uh chris was preparing he was trying to he was thinking about how to manage the discussion so that there would not be a war and what i remember at the time as i was sitting there and i was listening to these developers this was late 16 early 17 just to place people so like ethereum was in decline it was like at like six or seven bucks seven dollars it was seven yeah like we'd come off like the middle of 16 kind of frenzy around the dow sold off from like 25 to seven um bitcoin was like kind of pushing up and we tried to bring the focus was to bring ethereum and bitcoin together anyway good go on yeah so uh and what i came away with i said oh my gosh this is crazy you know this is so interesting listening to the developers but also understanding there would be a place for both this was not an either or that was a bit of an aha moment the dao um that uh chris chris came in and presented the dow at a brainstorm and i was fascinated i was saying wow that's pretty wild and but then there were others in on the team who were just like pushing back and saying this this is going to blow up and felt it felt vindicated when it blew up but that and my experience in innovation is when you're on to something early uh there are bound to be problems and when it blows up is when you invest that's when you really think about the investing and i'll say just in terms of ether and the nfts and the creator community um i was listening to uh one of uh one of placeholders calls and i i they featured uh the ceo of async art and i had never heard async art i had never heard about this this phenomenon at all he starts speaking and i'm on a walk and i am smiling from ear to ear i have not smiled that wide a smile since i first heard of the internet just to give you a sense wow that that's the impact that nfts had on you this is this idea of asic art and what they're building on on nfts yes i was saying oh my gosh the layering that sort of get the creator creators involved with this this could go nuts why what did you see what was comparable to the early internet kathy just the awe of how how new and differentiated how a different way of thinking a way to reward creators uh which we've been looking for for generations or forever right and this idea that you could have you know a a a piece of art and then layer it and sell pieces of it off and have the underlying creator still uh get rewarded for you know thinking up such an interesting idea i just thought wow this is so collaborative it is so collaborative and that's where the world's going that's how arc is set up too as being very collaborative and iterative in our thinking and so that's what i felt when when i uh when i heard the ceo of async arc art talk i think uh viewing ethereum as like certain all of crypto as kind of a new capital coordination system is is a powerful lens this thing and i want to bring you seen into into the conversation here as we're talking about eth as an asset and we're talking about valuation earlier and it's always been this question of how do we value these weird crypto assets that are coming down the pike i feel like you know bitcoin got this valuation method based on a story value based on being kind of a gold um chris actually surfaced a paper that was written not sure in 1997 1998 about these three different asset super classes that was super helpful for my own mental model where we talk about capital assets they produce cash flows and that's one super uh super class and the second is commodities so things like you know wheat and uh grains and oil and then we have store value assets right it feels like uh bitcoin has been placed in that store value asset category maybe a little bit commodity i mean you have to use bitcoin to pay for bitcoin transactions but it's in those two categories you seen how do you view ether as an asset how do you attempt to to value that does it fit in one of those asset categories for you does it does it fit in all three what's your take there that's a that's a really good question and quite honestly i'd say that a lot of my thinking here has been inspired by what you guys put out so there's definitely a a back and forth here i think you hit the nail on the head in terms of how the market has really accepted bitcoin i'd say as a digital gold since really 2017 right when we kind of think about this you know from an institutional pitch standpoint it's like the narrative for bitcoin is pretty much set in stone and it's kind of one very easy to make the case for bitcoin as an investment but then by extension kind of value the different opportunities i think with ethereum it is a little bit different and that investors have really yet to converge on on a primary narrative on how to value eath um and i think that that also has to do with the fact that the narrative is evolving in the same way that bitcoin's narrative has evolved um you know one of my biggest breakthroughs and thinking about you know how to how to how to value eath especially compared to bitcoin and something that kathy alluded to is that you know bitcoin and ethereum are differentiated enough where they can coexist and in a lot of ways it isn't really a a zero-sum game it it's it's a positive sum game where um you know that you're you're unlocking kind of new new uh pockets of value that otherwise were non-existent um with ethereum specifically i think you know there there's a question of of ether as like this natural resource this digital commodity um and if you think about as the as the general economy transitions from the physical to the digital world um that you know theorem can command a sizable premium relative to physical commodities um that that that otherwise bitcoin bitcoin could not and so when you kind of think about oil or coal or kind of general commodities those are in the hundreds of trillions of dollars um in in in in market cap are in value um i think increasingly we're starting to see eth as this productive financial asset and something that you guys kind of introduced as the sort of that internet bond um and that that is sort of broken away from bitcoin specifically kind of with the with the general consensus algorithm of of bitcoin versus eth especially as heath transitions to proof of stake but when we kind of think about valuing eth as a as a productive asset that's where i think it's it's deviating a little bit from bitcoin as sort of that non-productive monetary asset um and so when we kind of think about the potential value accrual there um you can kind of think of it as as the same way that you might might value a traditional bond and so you can kind of kind of guarantee this this sort of yield um this this kind of risk-free rate perhaps um that that that eve can generate um and i think that because it's native to the internet that's what makes it so unique right um and then that that sort of that last narrative of perhaps you know ethereum is is a new country or a new nation state that sort of digital country um and so that's one that kind of transcends borders and one that is native to the internet and so the way that i kind of like to look at ethereum what excites me most about ethereum is is in the context of kind of this ever more more globalized world right where we're all increasingly connected to each other and so there's going to necessarily be demand for cooperation on an equally global scale and and one that doesn't rely on traditional means of identity or legal assurances uh and so when you think about ethereum as an experimentation layer on which you can build these economic primitives with little counterparty risk uh that's that's something that's very exciting and i i will admit that that's that's not something two years ago that i would have been completely sold on um you know i think a lot of the bitcoiners they tend to look at ethereum um as as something that isn't worthy of existence because it has a much larger attack surface right so they they look at kind of the technical security risk of ethereum and say why do you need ethereum um and and i've sort of i've sort of started to realize that there is actually a need for that higher programmability than is currently being offered by bitcoin and i think the potential benefit is bigger than the attack surface that it introduces um and so that's ultimately kind of where i stand with ethereum and i also had one last point which was at arc and and i love what chris said about kind of the the risk appetite that arc had um and how that's sort of evolved over the last few years um i think one of our biggest aha moments when it came to even comparing bitcoin to ethereum was was early in 2020 when when ethereum uh flippin bitcoin in terms of fee revenue um and so that was something where if you think about fee as a proxy for demand to use the network and now ethereum has you know not only exceeded on transaction throughput and transaction settled but on actual sort of demand to use it that was something where where we're like you know it is the usage and the interest is undeniable um and and it's and when you couple that with with the community and sort of the the ideals that ethereum has has been able to to build for itself um it it makes a very compelling case for for why there's a tremendous upside so i want to double click on what you were talking about you seen with the whole um yield side of ether the asset right this is a very core component of the relationship between ether and ethereum uh proof of stake allows the ethereum protocol to issue ether yield uh and as we started talking with this whole crypto section we talked about bitcoin as a non-sovereign money it's a money that transcends nations that transcends borders and ether as this new similar sort of technology that transcends borders offers a a new protocol issued yield in ether terms and ether denominations that has no counterparty risk right like they're the ether is always solvent ethereum is always solvent because it can always issue new ether which is kind of a paradigm shift in where we can find yield in the world now we can find yield in crypto terms in crypto native assets internet native assets that have no nation state dependencies and so uh i want to turn this question to kathy the cost of capital in the traditional world is really dependent on you know the the bond market how much how risky are you going to get based off of the yields you can get in dollars on the bond market but now that we've unlocked this new internet native risk-free rate with ether staking do you think that's going to how do you think that's going to impact uh global yields and global like investment appetite as uh ethereum gets more and more adopted if it does get more and more adopted over time well um i i think part of the heightened regulatory talk here in the united states and and elsewhere but it's really taken off uh in the last few months here is because what you are talking about the yield has attracted so much interest that the banks themselves are beginning to feel it uh i have been shocked i listened to especially j.p morgan's call it's a good kind of staple to understand what's going on in the banking industry and you know in a v-shaped recovery uh jamie dimon was telling us that their loan growth would be negative through the end of this year i said what uh and i began to think could it be could what's going on uh in uh in the uh ethereum world already be impacting banks you know prices are determined at the margin and so this could be really hurting the banks and i think we're i'm going to take a very close look uh during the next uh few earnings seasons to to see if we can dimension it it does you know it doesn't seem like it is big enough yet uh but i'm beginning to wonder you know the search for yield uh which again uh the the extremes the bond market in the the traditional world i believe is in a bubble certainly on the corporate credit side which is where the risk is uh and i i can't help but believe that others believe the same and are searching elsewhere for yield uh especially the hedge funds i would say uh so uh i that's the first thing that comes to mind when you ask your question and i'm beginning and i and now you're going to have to rephrase your question if you want me to go any further well i just want to ask i just want to follow up on that because the podcast and the movement we have here is called bankless right so we've seen this for a while but um we're actually not sure that the banks are actually worried about it right now well i think you think they are oh definitely i think part of the uh regulatory heat that is taking place now is uh is because the banks are beginning to see how much this is going to hollow them out there's there's a really key thing that that kathy said of prices being set at the margin and i would layer in another thing that i learned from her of um what really matters is the the share of incremental growth um and so you have very large bases and so you could look at the banks and be like well how could crypto you know this kind of small thing be disrupting these very large based banks but if if crypto when you look at these growth rates in the hundreds of percents if that is eating the incremental growth share that starts to weigh on bank growth expectations and all assets are priced based on expectations right and so that's where these seemingly small things that are hyper growth can have a significant impact on the growth expectations of much larger asset bases and so you know when we when we think about the yield market you you you have the people who are lending and then also the people who are borrowing right um and when i at least think of myself down i feel old for crypto right i'm 31. um like i'm i'm basically a crypto boomer now i'll admit it but um like myself down i i see people like increasingly asking like hey like can i can i use this to borrow against right like if you if you think of something like maker dao um that i can take out a loan 365 days a year 24 7. um it's a flat rate um and you know the well while makers rates and when i say flat rate like everyone gets the same rate there's no preferential treatment there are other systems that give you fixed rate lending and so that whole world is is mushrooming and that's the some of the incremental share i think a thing i want to piece apart a little bit more here is this idea of the risk-free rate um because i i think it could be so fundamental so when you think of the you know u.s treasuries um providing risk free rate this is something that you look at a lot kathy as like the the base of valuation for for assets and i want to call it a risk minimized rate um because i think that that we just presume you know the u.s is always going to remain solvent but there is still counterparty risk there and so that there's a risk minimize rate uh in the meat space on uh t-bills and then ether is going to provide the most risk minimized yield in the crypto space and and i i want to call it risk minimize because people are going to say there's way too much risk in crypto you can call it risk free so then we disagree okay it is risk minimize and then you start to look at what are the components that go into risk minimization and this is where we get into the importance of decentralization right where not all proof of stake is created equal um and you've got you know delegated versus the more pure proof of stake that that ethereum is working towards i've got a plane flying nearby but um kathy i guess a question i would have for you is can you envision a future where ethereum's risk-free rate or risk minimized rate is starting to influence the the broader internet economy and be that that baseline for how people think about valuing other internet-based assets i absolutely can see that um especially since uh monetary policies around the world have pretty much become unhinged and you know talk about trust uh i think there's more trust in uh this ecosystem you know in in the way you've defined it risk minimized uh then there might be in the traditional world uh as as if we're right there's going to be a lot of creative destruction and counterparty risk uh and these banks are going to be losing uh share to the crypto world and i i want to get back to that in a moment um because you seem so surprised and i think it's so uh obvious but now i realize what the disconnect is there uh but yes absolutely i can and if i uh could say something i learned an important lesson in the it was the currency crisis the asian currency crisis in the 90s 97 i think it was and the thai bot devalued and uh nobody thought anything of it what you know thailand was uh you know hardly measurable out there uh but it ricocheted there was an asian crisis that took place domino effect and so we began to ask companies like boeing at the time oh what's your exposure to asia it seems as though something's unraveling there and they'd say ah nothing you know not even five percent well what they didn't say is it might have been four percent of their sales but it was more than a hundred percent of their growth and so when asia went down boeing's earnings imploded in a way that most people couldn't understand because they said wait a minute they told us it was only five percent yes but they didn't say what percent of the growth it was uh and uh i think we're talking about something equivalent here and so oh yes the banks are on to this you know i'll i'll tell you why i was a little bit surprised i think it's because like we're in the sort of the crypto trenches and to you scenes like um you quote early right we're somewhere in that stage of them ignoring us and them laughing at us that's the stage we've lived in in crypto and so to hear somebody outside of that crypto bubble say no actually they're in the stage of maybe fear fight and and for you to talk about it as like a hollowing out of the banking system and they see that they see that on the margin and it's starting to affect their growth rates is is pretty amazing actually for me to hear but like let's talk about that a little bit more so this is not the first time an industry has been hollowed out and you hearken this back to the early days of the internet uh and of course a lot of early fintechs have been born since the birth of the internet i'm i'm curious about um your thoughts here so i think we we agree that banks big banks are going to be completely disrupted i'm curious how fintech sort of fits into this we've got visa we've got mastercard just bought a a crypto company ciphertrace we've got paypal entering we've got um you know jack dorsey and square doing things in crypto is we call it kathy the d5 mullet we we think there's actually going to be like an increasing number of fintech companies who have sort of the fintech in the front and the d5 in the back right that's where the party is how do you see this shaping out right fintech and crypto is this a match made in heaven or are they opposing factions oh uh so um mastercard and visa i consider them part of the old world old dna and they see the writing on the wall they're trying to figure out how to cut cut their costs and and insinuate themselves into the crypto world uh but they are really hostage to the banks right when you think about it uh so i wouldn't put them in they would call themselves fintech i don't call them fintech but you know i've been wrong on visa for a very long time i've always thought uh you know someone would come and knock off that kind of uh duopoly um as far as the others so paypal and square have digital wallets um we really so max friedrich uh our fintech analyst working with yasin uh has uh has done an incredible uh job analyzing the potential for digital wallets we've looked obviously at wechat pay and learned a lot uh we do believe that uh this is becoming a winner take most market um and in our big ideas from last year i believe one of the charts is uh jp morgan's uh account user base customer base and uh charted against venmo and uh cash app and what you'll see is that jp morgan's is up and to the right but every step up was an acquisition it was acquired growth which is not real growth it's called consolidation in a mature industry whereas you look at square and cash app they have surpassed morgan in terms of number of digital accounts uh more than 60 million each now and they did it in you know five to seven years which is which is unbelievable uh and we believe that these these digital wallets are effectively uh uh bank branches in our pocket and they're going to be there right now there's a lot of peer to peer and so they've gone viral their cost of customer acquisition is twenty dollars per or less while the banks are paying anywhere from three hundred and fifty dollars to fifteen hundred dollars per uh user uh to to bring them into checking accounts savings accounts mortgages and so forth uh uh those banks grew up and uh and became dependent on the loyalty of their customers the customers couldn't go anywhere else uh and there was a lot of friction if they tried uh but again the digital world changes that right and and so we're seeing this uh adoption of digital wallets and i think two-sided marketplaces feeding each other the consumer and the merchant side square was very smart starting on the merchant side and then looping in uh consumers who worked for many of these merchants and then the peer-to-peer got the viral network going uh so we're we think banks are are being hit on that side as well you know their their customer base is being especially the younger customer base not as profitable in the early years but absolutely need them in the later years they're not going to be there they're going to have digital wallets i'd see for crypto natives even right they can't wait to uh close out their wells fargo account and like even just move to coinbase that seems to be like this this hybrid between fintech and crypto that's that's sort of a bridge layer yes and and coinbase has a shot we're looking very carefully who is going to be that who's going to dominate and it might be regional dominance i don't know though i don't know now that uh uh we've got crypto in the mix because crypto's becoming an important part of these digital wallets uh that's why you see paypal once square launched with bitcoin paypal sat up and said oh my gosh you know and and even paypal i'm watching them aggressively move into crypto now i think square's doing it more to infiltrate the rest of the world paypal's doing it not to lose out to to square and cash app so it's been pretty interesting i don't know uh chris or yes yeah i was i was gonna add um two things um one this is right on time if you read uh carlotta perez's ins uh uh technological innovations and financial capital i might have butchered that name um but carlotta perez's book uh talks about how you have you know the early innovators that that get things going and then when you start to see private sector adoption that is the precursor then to public sector adoption and so we're very much in the like private sector adoption structurally when you look at you know paypal square coinbase what's happening here i i think is a continuation of um on-premise hardware to private cloud to public cloud to now we could call it crypto cloud but what what like if you if you look at coinbase's cost structure when they're using bitcoin when they're using ethereum when they're using these other networks um for financial or monetary services they've outsourced a lot of their capex to these networks and they're paying on-demand operating expenses it is vastly more efficient to operate that way than to manage it all on your own we've seen this play out already from people managing all their own servers to then going to private clouds to now adopting public clouds and so one way to think of this is like the banks in the existing financial system kind of provide this on-premise private cloud financial services layer where they hold everyone hostage and it's not really a free market when you look at crypto it is so open and so competitive all those costs get driven down as close to zero as possible and so i see it as the next iteration of of public cloud where people are going to be outsourcing large amounts or or as much as they can of their cap backs of their opex these companies will operate way more profitably they will get a lot more investment in the in the public markets and that's going to draw just even more people in this trend um and so that's like these companies yeah they're doing it to be sexy and branding but they're also doing it because it improves their profitability um the only people who are fighting it are like the very traditional guys who operate the private cloud right now because it hurts their profitability that's such a good point and i think on the other side so you you have like the companies themselves that have declining cost structures but then if you look at the barriers to entry from users as well they're so much lower than than with traditional banks like the to have a crypto native bank account literally just requires you to have a private key and so then you just some sort of user interface with a traditional bank you have to go through these massive kind of compliance and regulatory hurdles so it's like there's a there's a there's like a catalyst on both sides where there's a massive incentive for these fintech companies to continue to bootstrap their their their operations by leveraging these technologies and then on the other side you go to a random like teenager of look here just download metamask and we'll just deposit in a some eath and then you can go and buy an nft with it it's like it's it's very hard for jp morgan to compete with that and then all and then finally what i think a lot of these fintech companies are are realizing and what they've done quite successfully is that if they don't want to get disrupted in the same way that they disrupted traditional financial services then they have to embrace crypto uh and and for those who who aren't uh then then then they're likely to be left in the dust and that's not just from an infrastructure standpoint but also from like a cultural standpoint as well which i think is a really important component of these like cutting-edge fintech companies that is often dismissed if you look at like the way that cash app has insinuated itself in in the like the grassroot culture movement of of artists and their designs and the merch it's like no one's ever going to buy a jp morgan t-shirt unless they want to kind of as an ironic statement you have cash app dropping these flash sales on merch and it's like selling for for for hundreds of dollars so just a completely different dynamic um and one that i think is is uh is fascinating gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave dot com at the beginning of this uh interview so far we talked we asked the question uh why does ark think that the future is so close uh and then when we also talked about uh the dao um uh kathy you talked about how astounding it was that it could actually source so much capital so fluidly so quickly uh and when it blew up that was a buy signal for you because you know you said you know buy when something blows up but my question is we're talking about how all these public crypto networks collapse costs down to zero and uh one of the answers you gave about why the future actually is way closer than everyone thinks is that all of these s-curve adoptions are going to interact with each other and so i want to open up how defy actually plays a role in that and how this capital allocation and collapsing costs of public networks play a role in that can cathy can i get you to elaborate about how defy specifically in these uh lowering costs of financial services can help actually spur innovation in all the other sectors that arc is bullish on um okay that's a big question i'm probably going to bring uh yasin and chris into into this one um as you were asking the question what uh pinged for me and i'd love to hear yaseen and chris weigh in on this you know the convergence of artificial intelligence and uh blockchain technology um you know i've been chris knows this because we first talked about it after a meet-up that uh placeholder had and i remember uh i've forgotten the name was it live pier live pier is that the name of it there was live pier i mean we've done quite a few meetups there was a numerai meetup there was um a maker dao meetup and and i was i was trying to think wow i hear them talking and i think part of the solution will be bringing artificial intelligence into the ecosystem so i would love to know uh from chris and yasin you know if they see that happening or how they see that happening because artificial intelligence costs training costs are dropping at a 68 per year rate think about that you drop the cost of anything 68 per year you're gonna get a lot more of it and it right and it solves problems so this yeah so two things one i'd say the clearest example we have um at least a placeholder works closely with that's the convergence of machine learning and crypto would be numerai um where and and this is going to apply i i think that to the way d5 is going to play into a lot of these overlapping s curves you know numerai because of the collapsing costs of compute and the scale of data is able to employ thousands of data scientists all around the world right who are able to submit models that help manage numerize hedge fund the way in which they incentivize that is effectively using deep defy right like defy is like at a very simple level is like transacting and saving and based on everything we're saying with traditional finance those systems cannot scale to coordinate people globally there's way too much friction and so if you want to um coordinate global sets of digital actors you have to use d5 you'd like you would spend hundreds of millions of dollars and you know lose all your hair by the time you're able to pull it off using traditional finance and so like when you look at the the sharing economy movement which now feels dated but which i think is still just really getting started um that movement you know it's messed up in two ways one the the capital is all owned typically by a concentrated shareholders concentrated set of shareholders as we see with uber or lyft or whatever so the value accrual doesn't go out to the supply ciders the demand citers the people who actually create the network um and then two you know a lot of the sharing economy to date has been meat space focused you know and so then it has to go region by region by region what defy enables is like the financial back end to scale the sharing economy for any digital service globally from day one and like you know for us who exists all day encrypted it's like okay yeah cool that's obvious but like for the rest of the world who's not paying close attention to crypto that's pretty mind-blowing if they could conceive of it that way and not get lost in you know all the chaos and mistakes and you know get rich quick schemes yeah i want to add just one more thing that that chris had alluded to earlier which is exactly you know what we're discussing here in the relationship with costa clients but it's like in in the traditional banking services it there is no real free market the market is much more inefficient in its ability to kind of determine that cost so now you're opening up this layer of experimentation where it is highly transparent it is open source it is ruthlessly competitive you know you're able to kind of spin up a new project by forking it and and changing the rules and then seeing whether or not the free market you know the decides to migrate to that new protocol well it's like that is obviously going to to to drive cost declines downward um and so i think the the general uh premise of of being able to provide this permissionless unfettered access to financial services um is is going to to yield a much lower cost than what we see we see in the traditional world there's one more thing i want to add and it relates something we're talking about the start of this and i know we're probably running low on time here but i don't think people still realize the um radical amount of openness that that crypto has and it's you know the open source code it's the open data and it's also the open market structure and when you have so much openness you cannot hide inefficiencies all the inefficiencies continue to exist in the existing political and financial system because they are closed and opaque so i basically see it as like a bunch of light flooding into all these opaque inefficient sectors that then eradicates all of the inefficiencies over time it doesn't happen overnight it takes years it takes decades but the directional trend is obvious so all of this makes arc very bullish on crypto right and there are a number of ways i i suppose uh an individual or an investment fund like yourselves can get exposure to crypto i know some of this because some of this is public but you know a gbdc is a grayscale product arc holds some of that ethy another gray scale product exposure to eath our cold some of that some other things as well but i'm curious a broader picture because um we've talked about regulatory a few times we've mentioned it and i'm curious from your perspective kathy if if you think that the structure of arc actually limits what you can do in cryptos there are more that you'd like to do but can't because of how arc structured or you could ask the same question another way does the regulatory environment itself limit you not just the structure of arc but the regulatory environment itself do you find that limiting to arc or to crypto in general well uh gbtc and eth uh yes that is how we gained our first exposure to both and um and yes we this in 2015 september of 2015 we had to go to the new york stock exchange and explain what the heck we were doing and and they said well okay one percent you know limit the risk so we put it in at one percent and never sold you know so which is then the max yeah yeah so um it was limiting but uh i'm just happy we're able to do it you know we we we were allowed to do it and uh and so what you're talking about is the etf structure and uh in the etf structure we can only own securities uh the grayscale uh gbtc and eth are our securities they're grant or trusts uh and so that's the only way in an etf we could access uh in our discretionary accounts uh we we can we can go direct and uh so we're we're going to help uh evolve the market in any way that we can uh certainly from the public uh you know uh sec registered uh company point of view because that is what we are and we are predominantly retail uh so i i i don't so yes the etf itself limited but we're we're we are maneuvering around that we are pivoting um just like we had to pivot at the beginning of arc uh we described ourselves in terms of the active equity etf that invest in disruptive innovation we shouldn't have even mentioned active equity etf because the main point was disruptive innovation and let's see how we can harness that it doesn't matter what kind of rapper is out there so so that's what we're trying to do um and just to clarify ark's not pivoting into becoming a crypto firm i would say is arc is is going to continue doing what it is great at doing and finding ways to adapt yes um itself and some of its structures to more wholly be able to embrace cool i'm actually curious your your take on this too kathy because you've seen technologies blossom like change is hard right it's hard for everyone it's scary at times this is a massive change for regulators they're they're trying to figure out what the scope of um their regulatory agency is supposed to be in crypto and i think some of them are doing their best some of them are still trying to understand this but uh you know there's been a sentiment that this is very bearish some some recent things in the u.s have been bearish for crypto others have said no actually the fact that regulators are talking about this this is bullish i'm curious if we can learn anything from other industries that are that are leaning into the future where there are things that are scary to regulators uh that could apply to crypto what are your thoughts here uh sure we we had a good brainstorm on this topic led by uh yasin so i'd love to have you seen way in after but um i i i agree with a more positive interpretation and one of the reasons is we have gotten to know uh the the research people uh in finn hub at the sec and they know what they're talking about when we first went to them uh well actually chris actually was at the firm when this happened too and and he uh um he wrote an answer uh to the sec's request for information about were we ready for a bitcoin etf at that time and we were not ready yeah 2016. we were not ready um and we and uh the sec took in and basically used a lot of what chris wrote in its own response so we've gotten to know over time the the kind of research taking place at the sec and it's excellent it's really good now you have gary gensler coming in he had been at mit we all know uh uh focused on blockchain technology especially bitcoin so at least at least he understands he was an advocate so so that's good now what you have in the united states i think are six financial regulators who are fighting for power and uh i i think uh that might be a little bit of what's going on right now and the fact that um the sec has issued coinbase a wells notice uh might be seemed like a very scary thing when i saw that i said what they haven't even launched the product yet what what is this and uh uh really this is the sec's and the industry's way of pushing the discussion forward moving it forward three iq sued the canadian regulator and won in the courts and so this this uh has precedent you know if uh if coinbase were to turn around and sue uh i'm not saying how this is going to work out but but you know three iq against all odds at the time and this was not that long ago this was last year um they won so i think that the discussion will move forward and we will get more regulatory clarity in this case um we're dealing with the howie attest and now the reeves test which was 1990 and there's something in the reeves test having to do with promissory notes that um that might uh need to be clarified as it relates to what coinbase wants to do with lend so we will get some answers i think it's good uh i'm never happy when i i know regulators are are trying to vie for a certain amount of power because then it can get a little dramatic uh but but i do think the the discussion is going to move forward and we need it to we absolutely need it too kathy and team this has been an absolutely uh fantastic discussion so far we've covered so much already and um you know everything you're talking about i think we we definitely resonate with i i want to maybe end with this question to you to all three of you i'm wondering if you have the same take or similar takes or different takes um very much like david and i some of us in the crypto industry we're in this crypto bubble we feel like cryptos may be inevitable but there are technologies that also fail right um i'm curious your perspective on what is holding crypto back at this point in time so like we've made so much progress but we're not there yet what's holding us back i want to start with you scene on that question and close out with kathy uh it's a good question i mean i i would say that at a high level i'm fairly happy with the way that crypto has played out in the last call at 10 15 years like if you were to really ask yourself that like state that bitcoin didn't even exist 15 years ago and today this week there's a sovereign state that has adopted it as legal tender um you know it's hard to say that there are things that are quote unquote holding it back um obviously there's always room for improvement but i'd say for the most part i i'm quite optimistic at the evolution of crypto in in is since its inception um i i you know i think that there's obviously still a need for for education and for regulatory clarity as kathy said so if we want to kind of continue to catalyze that adoption some people just don't really understand its value proposition and so i think it's it's on us to continue to educate um and then if you were to ask specific to to you know a particular network call it you know bitcoin or ethereum you know if if you were to ask maybe potential failure points um you know while crypto has done tremendously well i i still think that you know complacency um at the at the protocol level uh you know is i'm sorry sorry about that it it is certainly a risk um and so when we kind of think about bitcoin specifically and the trade-off between institutional adoption and preserving its ethos it's like bitcoiners you know should not remain or should not be complacent they should kind of continue to kind of think at the cutting edge um and then and then obviously even with ethereum we're seeing some interesting traction outside of it um and and kind of should encourage that experimentation uh so you know crypto generally i i think we should just we should keep keep treading along as we have uh and then at the protocol level um you know not remain complacent same question what's holding crypto back so i would agree with what you seen said around we've gotten really far um for the short period of time that crypto has been around and i i i operate from the place that crypto is inevitable like it is the new financial economic coordination rails for the digital world and it's going to be absolutely pervasive in a way that we can't imagine in 20 to 30 years so where i spend a lot of my time is thinking about where power and capital is going to concentrate within this inevitable future and so um while i think nothing is holding crypto back from from this pervasiveness i think what's holding crypto back from its maximum societal impact is the way that power and capital have gravity and a tendency to corrupt um and i see it all throughout crypto um i've i i started much more as an idealist i would say in 2014-15 than i am now as as a vc and um seeing how concentrated ownership is of some of these networks is really sad um when you when you look at the scale of the returns and who those returns are going to like most of the lps of large institutions are also large uh capital allocators who manage for high net worth individuals um and so there is there is this this almost inescapable truth that like capital is created from capital just as life lives off of life and so um when you when you have things go through hundred or thousand x's you need to make sure that that's as distributed as possible before the thousand x happens otherwise you just enriched a very small group of people enormously versus enriching a very broadly distributed set of people pretty pretty well and so um i i would just go back to like nothing is going to crop nothing is going to stop crypto crypto is inevitable but the amplitude of societal impact will be um controlled by our own self-control wow well said there's a lot there's a lot to unpack there uh but kathy i want to ask you the same question what i have to follow that i'll just put maybe a fine point on this two trillion dollars so nearly 10 percent of the u.s economy uh or two percent of the global economy already remember um the the asia example i gave where only five percent four percent but growing uh enormously so in many ways uh crypto has arrived and is not going to go away i completely agree uh with chris i think going through the big volatility bouts as we were just getting institutional interest uh you know may i think there you know there was a a little bit of a pullback but you know i think and and you could see this with ether uh well especially you know it didn't skip a beat it didn't skip a beat it worked brilliantly whereas most in the financial world are just saying this you know just because they don't understand exactly how it's set up they're just saying this is leverage upon leverage this is upon leverage this thing's going to come from uh come crumbling down so the the more times we go through volatility and the network comes out stronger for it uh the more uh credibility it will have and the more confidence um uh investors will have in it uh and then the other thing uh and we we uh did the b word uh uh you might have heard about and a large part of that was okay how do we support this ecosystem so it does become stronger and with bitcoin that would be supporting developers uh uh it seems like there's no problem with developers because the economic model on the ethereum network uh so supporting but also i think you've got just listening to uh chris and yaseen uh uh and i don't know you so well but it's clear uh you you know in great depth uh what is right and what might be wrong uh just going out there fine minds surfacing and exposing bad behavior uh and you know coming down on it certainly from the you know the new governance uh platforms that are evolving absolutely well kathy you've seen chris this has been a fascinating discussion and uh you know thank you for spending some time to talk about the future we do think that crypto is inevitable we're glad that it's part of ark's innovation platform and
