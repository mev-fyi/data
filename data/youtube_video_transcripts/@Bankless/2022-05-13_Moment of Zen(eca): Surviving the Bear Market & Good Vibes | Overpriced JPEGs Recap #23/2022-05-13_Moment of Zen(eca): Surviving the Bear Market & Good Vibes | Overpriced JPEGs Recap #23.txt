get into web3 all right man let's start with i guess how you holding up and what has been your strategy as this uh as the events have unfolded i'm holding up okay um yeah i got back from my three week vacation like three days ago so it brought the market crash with me the exact same thing excuse me exactly anything happened last year i was away in july in august september and came back and bear market hit so i should maybe just never go on vacation but yeah um more or less yeah it's been a crazy crazy period yeah for everyone the whole crypto market is down nft market is down stocks are down just everything is is getting crushed at the moment and it's very bleak out there a lot of doom and gloom on the streets and i'm feeling it myself i feel like a bit panicked and a bit scared and fearful um at moments throughout the day uh it's not calamitous or anything i'm fortunate that i've i'm in a position that um i could focus on building creating and you know i don't have to worry about getting food on the table and then paying off debt or anything like that so i focus on what i have and try and as much as possible stop refreshing um the floor prices 40 000 times a day how are you doing yeah yeah you know i i've gone through a funny mix of like kind of numbness which nate alex tweeted about and i do think there is something about the whole industry crashing at once with everybody in it that it's a different kind of pain than when you feel like you alone have made a mistake and i think it's maybe worth saying this like you know i've had some really bad moments of like in my stomach and waking up in the middle of the night when i've made a bat like i sold too early or i you know you know i didn't buy the thing that pumped or i bought the thing that went down and and when you're in like a bull market and everybody's doing well and all your all the posts on twitter are about people who are making money and you can very much personalize like i'm an idiot you know i'm there's something wrong with me i don't understand and whatever right even though that's irrational because a lot of this is it's all it's speculative right like it's not a it's not an indictment of you if you make a wrong move and you don't sell at the top that's impossible but there can be a very acute pain there and i think it's been different for me this pain of it all going down it's like well you know it feels less personal um which i think is interesting and i also i was saying this to you earlier um in times like this you see where your convictions lie and i'm very convicted around ethereum and i'm very convicted around the ecosystem and the the macro picture of what we all believe in which is a more decentralized future which is a change the growth of the creator economy like a paradigm shift in a way a lot of industries work i very much believe in which makes me very bullish on ethereum because inevitably it's like getting to invest in the platform layer of the new future and so the ethereum price crashing um you know i'm okay like i see it as a buy opportunity i'm you know i i've been dollar cost averaging into ethereum for a year or more now and i'm just gonna continue to do so but but the nfts make me a little nervous you know it you you we we all say you know we think there's we know that you want to hold long term and and but let's be honest we've all you know entered into projects where we're sort of hoping for more of a short-term thing and you know there's a little bit of emperor has no clothes at times with projects so um i also just want to like if you're out there and you're really hurting and you're you're really overextended like you know you see it on twitter but you are in very good company so many people have lost all of their wealth in crypto at various points like and they come back and it is not the end of the world you know take a walk hug a loved one like people come back from this all the time right like you can come back so you know i'm aware that there are people who may be in a lot of pain and you know that that really breaks my heart yeah it's really it's a sad time in the market i think uh i the terror the lunar ecosystem with ust is probably the most calamitous and damaging part like it's not really it really isn't nfc related at all um i saw an interesting tweet the other day i can't remember who said it but it was like there's two things going on that are like really awful in the space right now the ust and tara thing and the azuki thing and there's like almost no overlap in the venn diagram they're just two completely almost separate entities but that they've hurt a lot of people in in different but significant ways um but yeah the ust the the stable coin it's quote unquote stable coin um that basically is going to zero yeah and let's let's talk about that but let's i just want to finish on sort of your strategy here it sounds like you know i saw you post something saying that maybe you'd bought into some more art blocks projects is that something you've you've been dabbling with during this bear yeah it's i mean art blocks is still my number one most high conviction play in the entire nft space um with ethereum being pro the highest conviction in the web 3 space and crypto space in general um i'm not trying to buy too much but yeah the little the few purchases i've made over the last say 10 days i'm pretty sure i've all been art blocks or maybe a couple of individual pieces that i bought to support a project or a person but um i'm mostly sitting on my hands that's my strategy i'm trying not to panic sell um i'm trying not to time the bottom either like yeah i i basically don't need more nft exposure uh and my plan i guess me personally my plan has always been to hold most things long term because specifically in germany where i live in a tax resident the difference between long-term capital gains tax is it's like zero percent if you hold for 12 months or more versus almost 50 percent if you sell within the 12-month period so it just makes almost no sense and it has led me to be uh not overextended but my portfolio allocation is far more skewed to the nft speculative side than i would otherwise like um and my plan has been to as that year um bench milestone hits start to sell off pieces bit by bit um unfortunately this massive crash happened sort of before i got to start selling anything significantly but uh who knows maybe it'll come back maybe not but i i stand by like my logic and reasoning and i'm just happy to hold um and i'm fortunate that the majority of my portfolio is in projects that i have high conviction on so apes doodles art blocks is still i'm sure my number one bag even though it's down 90 um and then yeah with a lot of the other projects uh that are maybe less established and the floor prices are a lot lower it's again i'm just i'll wait if there isn't a pump again in the future we've seen projects come back we saw like october november december last year was a really bearish time in the market specifically the nfc market and the january hit and all these projects that had almost died just powered back and i wouldn't be surprised to see that again i also wouldn't be surprised if i'm sure that a lot of them are going to fizzle out and they won't bounce back so don't you know hold your bags to the grave expecting them to but for me personally i can afford to take a bit of a risk and then if they bounce back maybe sell into volume yeah i would say you know the projects that i'm uh you know less convicted about i i didn't put enough money in for it's for it to be worth me taking the the the pittance that they're maybe worth now out you know what i mean i'd rather just hold and see what happens in the long term um and then and then there's a number of projects that you know i i i have some conviction with sorry you know i didn't mean to interrupt but i was going to say for me it's like there's a lot of projects that like the floor prices under 0.1 and it's like almost not worth it for me to list and sell you know if you add it up it's a good amount of money but like again i'm focusing on on other things right now and yeah yeah and i think this is the value of blue chips in a scenario like this many some of which are faring better than others many of which that would have been considered blue chips are doing not well is there tends to be more liquidity and and that's the thing that's the other reason to be in blue chips if you you know like you're just much more likely to find a buyer in a scenario like this even if you're taking a loss if you need that liquidity a lot of pro you know a lot of projects just you can list them as low as you want there's nobody trying to buy them right now um and i think that's a learning and that's the other thing is i i think i can kind of put on this hat of like this is my first crash and it feels like a rite of passage i mean you know there's been ups and downs but this one feels really different you know um and i think it's a rite of passage i'm kind of trying to look at it that way of like how can i learn as much as possible from this i'm really interested in the interaction between crypto markets and nft markets and and the sort of detachment seemingly between the two which i think is you know they're both crashing at the same time but the market as a whole we're entering a recession inflation is high like there's there's so many factors influencing just a general market downturn um it the luna terra situation didn't overly seemingly impact nft markets and i think that's a really interesting takeaway in all of this one project i'm keeping my eye on is fly fish club i know you're a holder you know as the market's going down i was starting to think okay you know and your conviction gets higher it's like what are what are projects that i think can really hold their value that maybe right now are being unnecessarily dumped flyfish cup came to mind because i'm like that feels like a soho house you know it's you know it has that potential that you know high rollers cool people hanging out you want access it's an interesting club it's a restaurant i mean it's a restaurant but i mean club in the you know in the social soho house sense i think um it actually went down to like 2.3 i was really debating it didn't pump back up to 2.9 it's now sitting around 2.7 so it's still above mint price you know that's one i think does hold its hold its price well because the utility is very very clear and it's it's somewhat transactional in that sense but with each dumping the way it is i'm like 4k to like get get kind of a membership to this new york city restaurant that i where i live like that's interesting so that's what i'm keeping my eye on i would potentially go in there um during this bear market but otherwise i'm kind of with you i'm just like clutching and you know continuing by eath and then just holding on and hoping i survived the bleeding uh on the other end of this i'm heavily you know my biggest bag is definitely like the garyvee ecosystem which i feel pretty good about like vf1 vf2 book games i've got one of his gift go like vf minis which is just done terribly but um but in all that's definitely who i'm like in biggest on and uh you know i i feel stable with that i hit my long-term caps game gain anniversary on uh my defense i minted v friends in may of last year uh and i so i'm now officially in in long-term capital games territory with that i tweeted that out so um all right parting advice for the bear market before we turn to i guess suzuki specifically and then maybe the luna terra situation yeah i mean i would just say that echoing sort of what you said about trying to view it as a learning experience no matter how bad and calamitous it was and has been i know that people have lost basically everything and more certain people have you know gone into debt and took out loans to you know invest into tara luna and all that kind of stuff which obviously is not advisable but we can't change the past has happened hopefully that anyone going through that right now a is able to um just find some way to mentally cope and stay sane and and not like it's it's normal to be sad depressed anxious angry at yourself and at the world and all these sort of things that they're normal but hopefully people can feel those emotions and take time and heal and learn from it um and yeah definitely treat it as a learning experience to see what uh you might do differently in the future uh and another thing that i think is something that a lot of people say and feel is that if during this market crash uh you're feeling extremely fearful anxious it's usually a good sign that you're overexposed and your balance was not uh your portfolio was not balanced uh adequately and appropriately because it's i actually wrote this i think at some point last year during a bear market was like when the market was bearish i was like able to laugh and i was like you know looking at the market and it was going down i was like wow this is crazy this is wild amazing i'm you know i'll be telling this story in the future when this is happening and now it's a different situation where i found myself more um you know skewed towards assets that are crashing and less into stables than i would like so i'm feeling it more um and then just figuring out how to avoid this situation in the future and learn from it you know yep i'll echo that and i'll say truly i'm i i still feel very bullish and optimistic writ large again individual nfts we'll have to see this and that i you know i don't know where my bags land and that when the dust settles um but i think there's a lot of reason to remain optimistic you know this doesn't fundamentally shake my belief in the in the future we all want um at all and so um hopefully you can hold on to some of that conviction as well and uh and you know we are we are going to make it so uh bear it all in mind there's there's a lot to life beyond the jpegs okay azuki um [ __ ] man in a shitty we were right you were right you were right well i appreciate that you know i i'll only give myself a little bit of credit because lord knows i i would have at various points if people had given me the opportunity to buy into azuki at a lower price point i i would have done it but i did flag i did think it was uh i found it uh off-putting that we did not know whose agavon was that we didn't really seem to be able to verify who the team was that a project that was just getting that much attention and love and praise to be run by a fully anon team whose track record we just had no sense of um you know made me nervous so i'll take i'll take the credit there that i did flag that um should we should we run through for people what happened yeah you want to give the overview yeah i can give i haven't been uh fully in the weeds i wasn't in the space or anything but basically i listened i'll give you that i'll give you the rundown yeah basically everyone knows suzuki launched in i think december or around then last year and just skyrocketed from you know two eighth or one eighth i think it sold out at two thirty plus maybe even forty no i think it touched like 35 or something at its peak and it was just very clearly a lot of people calling it blue chip i think i might have called it a blue ship and considered a blue chip just by i mean you know five six months in the nft space is a long time and for a project to be around and have a really strong community and a high floor price and to to me again as sort of a casual um excuse me casual um outside of looking in well no i i own two or only i've sold them now but as someone who's like part of the community but not like in the discord all the time and just not following closely it seemed to me like the team was executing on things like they had a great event at uh nfc la a great live event they did something cool with the bobo nft and you know uh fractionalized it and had people vote on on things that the ip was going to do and um i mean basic storytelling stuff like that it seemed like they were executing well and then basically what happened was i think like i don't know five days ago or something now uh zagabond who is the founder or project head or one of the founders one of the most maybe the main team member that everyone's aware of came out with a twitter thread basically saying that he was behind three previous projects uh the crypto funks which are the punks that are flipped the cryptozonks which is another are they flipped upside i don't even know what they are they maybe they flip back and then um 10d they play with on-chain like generative incompatibility yes is the third yeah and basically everyone looked at those projects as like various definitions of rug pull and you know everyone has a different definition of what it what it is and and vagabonds sort of quote-unquote defense in my from what i can gather is that he didn't promise the world and he used them as learning experiences and and you know now he's launched this project and the past shouldn't necessarily reflect on this one um but a lot of people who are more connected to crypto funks and zonks and and stuff said no it's pretty clearly that he just extracted value from the community and and did things that were shady and um no one now appreciates and he's only coming out with this now because someone else had like found out the information and threatened him with it and um all sorts of stuff that basically opened its massive kind of worms and the entire space has been sort of figuring out you know what do we do now do we yeah where does the value of azuki lie is it in the team is it in the community is it in the art is it in the roadmap do we want them to continue running it and supporting them do we want a community take over do we want you know different leader um all sorts of questions like that that's and then the floor price has gone from i think it was at its peak 30ish and then it hovered between 20 to 25 for a long time and then sort of when this bear market hit plus this news it crashed and sitting around eight or nine right now um yeah which yeah that's that's not a bad crash um yeah absolutely i want to say a few things one i think it's fascinating that he chose to put this post out because again this came out because zagabond himself wrote a very long essentially medium mirror article um acknowledging all of this sort of proud of it like saying hey i've pushed the envelope in all these ways i've i've you know i've done all these innovative things in the space and and here's what i've learned and these learnings i've taken into azuki i i'm fascinated to know and i don't know what he thought the reaction to it was going to be because the the tenor of the article seems to suggest like he didn't think this was going to crash his project now he said this was an article they were intending to put out for a while again interesting and they put it out early because they were getting like cyberbullied but and being kind of threatened in some capacity he did not go into details as to like what he was being threatened with why that forced his hand in publishing this article earlier like there's a lot of swirly questions around that which i think is at the heart of this is like his his defense which was done primarily on twitter spaces with andrew wang it just didn't feel fully forthcoming which is part of the problem right there was a lack of accountability and there was a lack of forthcomingness where you're like you're being vaguely like cyberbullied and threatened and so you post an article that you were planning on posting anyways like you know talking about all these projects but seeming to proudly talk about them so so so that's i think interesting um i want to get your thoughts on if you have thoughts on where you fall in this zagabond is the same as coal ethereum versus you know he was a builder who experimented a few times and now has found a fit do you have a um a perspective on that as in like literally the same human or just like similar oh no no no it's hilarious that in this space you have to ask that right like yeah people are like a zagabon beanie yeah no the theory being or the the accusation being like their what they have done are equivalents um like coal with pudgy penguins and um pickles yeah pickles penguins yeah i can see some similarities there i can definitely see some similarities yeah i'll give you my perspective which is maybe there'll be people who be who won't like it i don't think they're the same i think zagabond is actually a pretty intelligent talented person i think azuki is taking itself much more seriously as a project than pudgy penguins did punch penguins quite literally the founders ran away with the money i think uzuki is very much reinvesting in this project and is actually committed to building something would i buy into this project i wouldn't come near a 10-foot pole with it but it's not actually because i think it's the same as some of these other pixelmon i would put pudgy penguins in there um i actually think there's a certain level of legitimacy again people will hate me for this to zagabond's argument that like pudgy penguins was fully claiming to be a cool cats doodle style pfp project we're gonna have a game we're gonna be ip uh they had a new york times profile about them crypto punks and attendees were not that right and and i think it's like you know there's a there's a strong distinction to be made there now this person zagabond whoever they are they're not an idiot i actually think i think they're smart um and that's where this becomes sort of indefensible like you can say all you want oh i i did what i told the community i would do and i do think it's fair to make the argument like hey this wasn't intended to be a doodle style project or whatever um but you have to know like you you have to know that in this space if you're in the space people are buying into projects because they expect you to dedicate to it and do everything you can to make it successful and and and they're trying to get a return right and what for me feels really just so distasteful and um is why i would never want to bet on this person you know it is really about okay you learn so much from this and i buy that look and i'll say this too one more before i get to my punch line here like one more uh caveat which is it's entrepreneurs build and fail things all the time before they hit on the right thing that's really legitimate you you can found prod or not project like in in the entrepreneurial space like you can start a company and it can fail and you start another company and it fails you start another company and it succeeds and you learn so much from those two failures the difference is you weren't playing with retail retailers money and you have to know in this space like if we're funding your [ __ ] education you know if you want to argue that you know the basically the community funded your mba so that now you can have the success with azuki's you should be bringing those communities along right like they should have been they should have gotten nazuki air drops like if you're going to kind of climb people's heads to the ladder of now your success there needs to be way more contrition apology and rectification going on for those communities and it shouldn't even have to get to rectification right you should have brought those communities along from day one to because you're beholden to them and you know that because you're in this space and you're not an idiot so i think there's a real just degree of um of just selfishness there and self absorption um that is really really distasteful i do not think however this person is on the scale of like i think they're actually smart and talented and i think they may build something interesting with azuki um is it worth nine eighth i don't i don't know but i wouldn't trust this person but i um that's really where i've fallen on it which i think is maybe a sort of in-between perspective of the different ones you're hearing i think you see people who are like really defending zagabond i've seen a couple people who are like all in his corner and then there's people who of course just absolutely despise him and i think there's a middle ground here that i see but um that's that's really my take yeah no i think i i largely agree with that now that you've you've gone through it all clearly he is talented and the team is talented like you can't if it was easy to create an izuku style project a lot of other people would have done it it's not it's not easy it requires a certain something magic um and skill and talent and also lighting in a bottle and right timing and road market and all that kind of stuff i do think that if he tried to bring along the previous communities azuki wouldn't just never have gotten off the ground i think it just would have been you know dead in the water like no one would have supported him knowing he's launched these communities and like trying to now dutch auction at two and a half feet going under one uh whatever it was one eighth going down like just trying to raise so much money no one would have funded the initial thing i would just yeah you're absolutely i'm really reluctant to support the project um based on just like the parts that i know but if i were to sort of do more research and want to um so i had to azuki i sold them yesterday probably at the bottom for like 80th but or close to the bottom um but i think that i would want to know who the team is i want them to docs i want to know what they've done with the money they've raised what they're doing with ongoing money what their plans are and just more transparency and accountability um until that happens or for the project to be turned over to like new leaders maybe zagabond steps down and we know who the new leaders are but i still want to know what happened to the money and what they're going to do and what they're building and just yeah as it stands i like you said don't really want to touch it with a 10-foot pole that's why i sold um yeah it's it's it's really interesting that this is happening when the whole market is crashing as well because um yeah it's just like it's hard to find what's correlated and what's what's not and yeah i i i want to take what you said there and kind of split the difference for me which is like again i if you want to put kind of morality and um aside i'm totally with you there needs to be tremendously more transparency uh from the team and that's again this like you messed up on this scale and you're and you're not being wildly forthcoming and that reeks of there's more to be cynical about here right like where's the money from the previous projects you know a lot of eth was made on some of these previous projects and you know he essentially copped to like i don't think it's wrong to to make money on a project as a found you know like there's middle ground here that i can understand but there is just a complete lack of transparency now about who the rest of the team is and where our funds are going that i think we need i actually wouldn't necessarily like them stepping down and i'm not gonna buy this project anyways but this current leadership team stepping down and handing it over to somebody else wouldn't actually make me want the project more from the standpoint that like again i actually think these are very talented people right and it's funny because i i went back i've been i was combing through the uzuki website again yesterday i'm like damn this is good you know like and i'd even said when when uzuki's first came out i was like i don't know if i would have recognized this as like so special or whatever and i was looking back at it and like however many months later we are now four or five months later i'm like this is good like this this team is talented they have executed um and it's a shame that really kind of moral lapses in judgment um yeah i have just tainted what is otherwise i actually do believe a quite talented and smart team that is different um than other project founding teams um and and is unique so um that's where that's my split the difference of what you just said transparency a hundred percent but yeah team i think is no absolutely they executed really well like the whole air drop that they did where it was a you know they did it the reveal was live they just airdropped it they didn't have people claim um it was that they changed the art and this long reveal process it was it was cool it was different it was fun the market clearly liked it i loved it um i thought it was well executed and and you know the contract you know that they had an efficient esc 721-a that was just a brilliant marketing thing obviously they didn't come up with all the innovations in there but they package it together nicely and so many projects have used it since so there's clearly talent there there is a detailed orientation too like even if you look and you look at the team members like and you look at their bios they're all pithy and funny like they have created a vibe that's what i love about aku by the way is i'm like there's a brand here right like it has that immediate feeling of like there's a brand that i can either resonate with or not but like it ha it gives you that feeling and that's special um you know i'm not trying to pump the bags of it i'm like literally quite literally saying don't buy this project but you know i think i don't want to reward this team but i i think it's um i i want to give my honest opinion about what's going on here and and anyways by aku because that's well i'm not actually of course not financial advice i'm not telling anyone to buy anything but aku similarly is not feeling like there's a vibe there's a there's a there's something here and it's a i absolutely love the team and i feel very confident that micah johnson is a deeply moral human being who is um a good actor in the space i'm looking at the accu floor right now and i think i'm i if i were to be buying things in this market um i would be looking strongly at that at argo yeah i think um mike has just got a very clear vision which is i find very attractive and he's very much like we're moving towards making a film if you haven't listened my interview with micah go go look at it he's got he's hired a world-class team to do it ex-lucas film people to help him develop the story for aku and um that is the north star right now and then by having that north star there's all these you know fallout pieces of that that come come from having that north star that then can feed the community in the meantime right and i just that a clear goal a clear vision i find that very appealing in a space where there's a lot of like hand waving here's what we are and the community will help us decide and like you know and some of that can be beautiful and great and i think some of that will will find some success for sure living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless

some brand new internet friends okay tara luna ust i i'm i'm of a mixed mind how much we want to get into this i think this is not a d5 podcast bankless bankless put out an awesome overview of what happened here i really i'll link to it we'll link to it i would strongly recommend folks go check that out they really break down what went on um i guess you know because there are folks who do listen to this and it did just have such a reverberation in the crypto markets it's worth giving the high level of what went on here and maybe talking about how we think this impacts just the web3 space in general moving forward do you want to give the the breakdown here of yeah i'll give a i'll have an attempt at it i don't know the i'm not sophisticated enough basically to know the intricacies of how the ecosystem terror worked but basically terra luna i think terra was the ecosystem and luna was the coin if i'm getting it right yes terra is the blockchain right terra is essentially an affair it's layer one blockchain and luna is the east acquitted equivalent to east to ethereum is luna tatera yeah and their like claim to fame and glory was that they promised they they had a stable coin an algorithmic stable coin which is again i'm not an expert but my understanding is that there are different types of stable coins you have ones like usdc where every dollar is literally backed by a us dollar sitting in a bank or sitting in a you know aaa plus class asset class um and that's great your money is safe versus these algorithmic stable coins where they don't necessarily have the full amount just sitting in reserves but they they come up with interesting d5 mechanisms to ensure that the the value always stays pegged to one dollar give or take fractions of a percent um and that's basically what they did they came up with their their own stablecoin ust um uh tether uh terra sorry usd i got a there's a there's a difference there's usdt usdt which is tether and then there's ust which is terror us dollars and a lot of people have been getting them confused um but they're very very different they are both stable coins tether has had controversy in the past because it's a stable coin on the order of usdc which means it's supposed to be backed by stable reserves and it's it was backed by not just dollars right it was backed by a whole bunch of different assets including like chinese commercial paper which is like you know like you know corporate bonds in china that were tanking and so tether is also not something i'd recommend really uh hopping into but yes good importance to distinguish actually today as well i woke up and tether was at i think 90 cents and i was like because if tether goes down we haven't seen anything yet that's kilometers like that's truly kilometers to the market it's it's the third highest coin by market because bitcoin ethereum tether so but thankfully it regained peg but you were right there's been a lot of controversy in skepticism controversy and skepticism about tether because they're they don't have u.s dollars in bank they have like uh treasury bonds and and uh cds and all sorts of other things but anyway back to ust this was a stable coin that uh the uh luna um sorry i keep getting confused the terror ecosystem came up with um and it is basically backed or like the idea was hey we are going to offer you a 20 apr on your sable coins just deposit it into a staking pool on um anchor which is a defy protocol and you'll receive 20 returns and people are like amazed by this it's like stable coins like imagine if you can just go to get 20 interest at your bank um it's amazing right so a lot of people bought into that and they had some interesting again mechanism where the price of luna which is their their other coin for the ecosystem um was like they could like sell or burn luna to re-peg the ust or or uh maybe it's the opposite where they issue more luna and sell that to repair anyway um eventually basically it was a ponzi scheme that came crashing down like 20 apr on a stable coin is just not really possible sustainable or actually well no one's figured out a way to make it sustainable it probably never is um if it's too good to be true it usually is um and just a general rule for investing in anything in life is the higher the returns the higher the risk no high risk high reward is is common saying you you see something with 100 apr it's like you're you're knowingly taking a bigger risk on that because there's a chance we'll go to zero same with 20 for stable coins um compared to like i think for uscc and tether you're getting like maybe five six percent which is still really good compared to like dollars when i first joined d5 at the beginning of last year you could get up to like 12 i think on on like usdc on like celsius and some of these walls it's gone down obviously um since then but yeah and also you know there was an interesting dynamic at play which was that because you you know the stable coin wasn't backed by something so you could have scenarios where it you know there were there were market price fluctuations on decentralized exchanges and things but the idea was within the terra ecosystem one ust was always worth like a dollar for luna so if luna was priced at 85 if you had 85 ust you can always exchange those 85 ust for one luna even if the price of ust on a decentralized exchange had dropped to say 90 cents so that's what would help create arbitrage opportunities that would also help keep the value to a dollar because people would say oh i can get luna you know for for cheaper ust and you know all that so that was a part of what was going on here and part of why you know luna completely crashed when um when the tara peg broke and it was no longer pegged to a dollar and you basically had an actor there's a debate right now whether or not there was like a malicious actor or you know this was just a trade going on because you had somebody basically dumping tons and tons of ust into the system and the luna uh foundation guard with lunar lsfg right right which was is there to help you know maintain the peg spent billions of dollars and liquidated billions of like a billion dollars worth of bitcoin trying to to buy ust and keep the peg propped up um yeah and ultimately couldn't do it and there was essentially a run on a run on the ecosystem and um and that's of course you see that then being part of what's driving down the rest of the market because you had somebody who's dumping a billion dollars worth of bitcoin into an already bear market and that of course drives it down but the one thing i wanted to flag a piece of color and this comes out in in bank the piece bankless did but um doe quan who's the i guess founder essentially of of tara and this ecosystem and has very much been the front-facing person the spokesperson of it uh was on a team of a project called basis cache which was another algorithmic stable coin that had been launched and also basically collapsed and he abandoned the project and um it it it was making me think of the uzuki system being totally separate but it's once again you have somebody who experiments it fails ups and leaves and um that really saying something about a person who's sort of willing to use a community as their testing ground and probably enrich them enrich themselves tremendously really without seemingly a whole lot of again contrition remorse uh understanding of of how that impacts other people and um that's the type of person you see a lot in this ecosystem and um yeah you know for whatever it's worth that that worth some reflection there i think on those similarities even though these are two very different situations in some ways i think it's it's almost something that you see even outside of web3 and crypto where like a lot of the top ceos i think they say that like one in four ceos is a psychopath or a sociopath um compared to like one in 100 or whatever of humanity something like that they have these tendencies to be more cutthroat more like to step on other people to get to the top which is you know that's that's capitalism that's that's part of the world we live in you know it's not ideal but you know that this is a much longer debate on a different topic but yeah we definitely see it in a lot of places and sadly you know when that happens in crypto and web 3 uh it can hurt retail investors a lot more than in web 2 in the traditional world a because there's no regulation and you know there is there are no safety nets and that's again double-edged sword of crypto and this whole decentralized nature um b as well there's a lot of people who can be truly anonymous um and see a lot of people just have no idea what they're doing like even more so than in trading stocks and stuff it's like this is so new and so experimental that um you know algorithmic algorithmically backed stable coins a lot of smart people thought and maybe probably still do think that they can work like if you can find out a mechanism where like you mentioned there's arbitrage opportunities that ensure that you know the price will always stay close to a dollar because if it deviates and some smart people will run bots and get back to that price um but yeah i'm not sure we've seen an algorithmic stable coin work yet and maybe we never will know um maybe people will stop trying maybe maybe it'll be like uh the dao the big dow hack in in ethereum in 2017 i think it was or 16 or so anyway where people just didn't touch dowels for a long time after that really and then now they're coming back into vogue so maybe anyway um i think there's nothing new under the sun this stuff all comes back under different names you know i'm not well versed in in call it monetary policy irl but you've seen scenarios like this you know you have this happen in um at federal you know it's like country levels where yeah countries will purchase assets of other currencies or gold or whatever to shore up reserves and and you know there's um this is nothing completely new and i'm sure it will come back again under another name and um and of course i think on a big picture level as we look here it's brought the attention of regulators you had janet yellen come out and say hey we need more regulation here i think the concern of course is for me right it's not that i disagree i understand the urge to protect retailers uh who are the ones who always end up getting screwed worse in these situations the institutions that are tracking this every minute of every hour are able to get out before it's too bloody for them and then it's the individual retailer who like wasn't tracking it every minute of the day who ends up getting holding the bag so protecting those folks i think is a really worthy cause the concern of course is that regulators really don't understand this well enough to regulate it sensibly and you know don't necessarily understand the difference between a ust and a usdc and um between different blockchains and and you know that there's just a level of technical sophistication there that i don't think any of us think are you know regulate regulators have and that's concerning uh so okay i want to flag raul paul had a tweet thread raul powell is a macro economist who like an investor really so so he um he's been on bank let's a bunch he's a little bit more defy side but he's very like the digital asset class space is fascinating and he's got a fund and he makes a ton of investments i think he's really smart you know he's i love the way he articulates things he's fun to listen to because he just he's one of those people he like paints a picture and you're like yes like that is the future you know um but he's been i mean he was or he comes in like the like let's call it uh legitimate world of investing like macro investing and he was very early on the bitcoin train that caught a lot i think a lot of ire from his like contemporaries because he was on it before people really you know in like 2012 2013. um so he was very long bitcoin for a little while and then maybe a couple years ago i don't know exactly what the timeline is he sort of switched he still likes bitcoin but really got on the eth train and then again like the bitcoin maximalists who had adopted him is like oh my god he's our legitimizing force because he comes from the legitimate investing world and he loves bitcoin then they were all mad that he was in like an ethereum personal a bitcoin maxis came for him um and i mean look he you know he he went on bankless at the end of last year and said there was going to be a huge like eath run up he could see ethan 10k or more or whatever right in the in q4 which didn't happen so look he's a macro picture strategist guy so like when it comes to the micro and his immediate prediction what's gonna happen this quarter he does not always get it right but i i respect him because he's willing to really put bold opinions out there and he you know justifies them anyway he does and then you can decide if you agree with his logic or not um he does real vision if you've ever seen um there's there's a he's like it's sort of an edge like a financial education media company called real vision and he's real vision crypto and okay that's raul paul i respect him i think he's interesting and so he he wrote a thread giving his macro views um he talks about the equity markets and the bond market saying the equity markets have have priced in a lot of the headwinds we're facing in terms of rate raises and blah blah blah um but then i wanted to focus in on the crypto piece he said uh you know he again he talks about all the different markets commodity markets etc and he says crypto is in full panic mode all the monkeys are flinging poo at each other or at me on twitter and that is a sign of approaching the lows march 2020 was very similar in levels of fear anger vitriol shock and panic june 2021 was less but as i have pointed out time and time again time and time again yeah crypto is a long-term investment for me not a trade and the thesis is clear expectations of 60 corrections which i've just discussed at length without that kind of volatility you don't get the exponential upside if you zoom out from the fud you get btc as a proxy for the space overall heading back to its long-term exponential moving average tough times like these are the times to buy if you have any spare cash not easy these days and sentiment is so bad that just by writing this tweet of my thoughts in order to help people my comment section will be full of personal attacks vitriol and anger i'm sorry you feel that way bear markets and recessions are hard and are scary but they give huge opportunities keep calm and carry on stick to your framework relentlessly test your hypotheses and keep an open mind blah blah blah um opportunity comes out of a crisis i think that's a very love it like fully agree sober minded on point and and has the optimism in there right like you're not gonna have the exponential growth without clearing out a lot of uh you know over-hyped uh crappy projects even projects that aren't crappy but that just can't sustain we couldn't sustain the levels we're at and we all knew it no we all knew it it was just a game of chicken of like when is it gonna happen how many bags were you gonna be holding when it when it came crashing down yeah okay let's talk about some optimism and some some things that i think yeah we feel it feels a little bit like we're in this crisis mode but projects are still building right the world keeps ticking this is an ecosystem that is not going anywhere and i really wanted to flag just the projects that are going about their day-to-day and continuing to do what they do because the world is not in fact ending and um there's a like a really beautiful future for this world you wanted a flag i loved this you wanted to flag the angel labs tweet yes do you want to tell us about this yeah so i'm assuming most people know about angel labs you had um the the founders on on i think a few weeks ago or a month ago but basically it's this incubator program f out of meta angels and they're sort of trying to find people and and projects that are trying to launch an nft or web 3 project and looking for some sort of assistance in the form of like coaching mentorship um like just like a general accelerator type thing and i think they had almost 300 applicants uh which is amazing and they announced that the 16 that they selected yesterday um and they it's just big twitter thread where they go like each tweet is the the project and a blurb about them and just reading through it it's just like you get to see just how many people there are out there trying to build really cool interesting you know product projects and products that are going to help the world like uh let's see we all grow latina is an eighteen thousand member community of latino creators makers and entrepreneurs who support uplift each other um amigo hood their expansion into web three on boards members through education and representations of the cultural intricacies of latinidad um democrat dao is an experienced team of democracy organizers launching web three solutions that advance political and policy and political causes um et cetera et cetera et cetera uh they've really found a really diverse group of projects and i mean there's uh how do you say this potly night market brings community product development loyalty programs and crowdfunding to cbd enhanced pantry and snack items and it's just it's just cool seeing and hearing about the different projects out there that are building in this space and this is like this is 16 out of the 297 that they mentioned there's thousands out there of other people other companies that are trying to launch into this space big web true companies and brands little web 2 companies and brands bridging and trying to figure out nfts and web 3 and crypto and like if this isn't proof that there's something here and this is not going anywhere i don't i don't know what it is it's impossible to be bearish long-term when you see the people that are really building stuff and the types of things that they're building that are honestly in many ways only possible due to web3 and the nfc stuff yeah absolutely some of the other projects that you know news i guess this week that i wanted to flag was um kith and invisible friends officially announced their partnership we've talked about this in the podcast before because i just like fell in love with this as a as a partnership i think keith is an amazing brand ronnie feig uh who's the founder of kith i think is an incredibly savvy operator he's been very savvy about the way he moves the kith brand forward i tuned into it like a you know twitter spaces that invisible friends and kith did talking about this partnership uh invisible friends is another one they have a cool look feel vibe they're unique you can tell the brand and ronnie was like you know i loved it for kith because because it's an invisible person the focus really is on the clothes so as a clothing brand and a street wear brand they're basically rolling out i guess their spring summer fall i don't know one of their collections you know on these invisible friend characters so you're gonna see the new kit collection on these invisible people and um that's creative and interesting and i think as the younger generation gets older and has more disposable income this super super digitally native generation that's the kind of stuff that's gonna hit and that all brands are gonna have to start experimenting with is you know those kinds of partnerships and again it just makes me long-term bullish for nfts and the future of all of this is like we are just the world is becoming more digitally integrated and brands are going to need to become more digitally integrated and i really like these two projects i think they share values i think they're both savvy i think they're both interesting i think they're true creatives and artists and i like to see these true creative and artists partnering up and then i think thriving so yeah um love that love the kitten vegetable friends partnership there's also kinship which is um the board ape music group comprised of jimmy's bored apes and a mutant ape have you been tracking the item ships when they announced it uh maybe like five six months ago now it sounded incredible and amazing and so now they've they've got a product or a mint they're doing their first nft drop which um so there's an element of like oh no more money to be spent i did i did sign up for the allowed list i have an avistar which got me you know which meant i was eligible to you know sign up for their pre-mint allow list um it's cool right so this is um umg universal music group which is just the the biggest music group it backs i mean within it's the umg umbrella is like def jam records which is huge it's got emi which is you know tons of artists that you would recognize elton john like emi's in like you know a uk based record label so mostly like the big uk artists come out of emi um they have like abbey road studios like they're just the number of like studios and you know kind of entities that are under umg is massive and one of the new i guess labels that's under the broader umg umbrella or the joint venture with umg is 10 22. it's founded by this woman celine joshua she's been in the industry for many many years and 10 22 so i'll read this little quote here is from celine i started 10 22 p.m to push the boundaries of innovation in the music industry and with kinship we are literally inventing what's possible in real time just as we would with any artist or creator my team and i will work with kingship to sharpen their vision and develop their unique sound each member of the group has their own story and personality that influences and contributes to kinship's overall narrative kingship's overall narrative and so what i think what you're seeing you know this is a virtual music group they're going to have stories they're going to have personalities again it feels a little anathema to me to get attached to like a you know digital music group i think it feels way less anathema to the generation that's coming up behind us the other thing is you're talking about stories right you're going to have a story about this group that can be as engaging as a movie but you have this extra element of it sort of like they're a band and there's going to be songs and maybe you like them maybe you don't like i think i just think it's interesting i think yeah and i think we will see more of this kind of thing moving forward it's interesting to me in the way that um coinbase casting board apes in their uh trilogy is interesting where like we all can be now stage moms but instead of taking that out on our actual children we can just like make our nfts our uh you know we can go put them out into the world to make us money in movies or music groups or whatever yeah um it lights up my imagination i don't know where it'll all go but that's what i appreciate about this space and it's that reminder that when things are dark like if your imagination is being lit up the way this space can light it up like we're all gonna make it yeah it's uh inspirational motivating to see people like pushing the needle and trying new things and exploring what's possible with the technology and it's it's just it's different it's exciting it's new it's maybe in 10 years we'll look back and it'll be it'll be common like there'll be hundreds thousands millions of bands that the characters are not humans or nfts or maybe some hybrid maybe there's ai involved there probably will be actually it's oh it's about a new world honestly yeah and again i feel a little weird about it i feel a little bit like i don't want to watch a movie without real actors i don't i want to go to a i want you know like there's um and and so we'll see but but that's where i think it's a little bit about every generation reinvents things that the older generation is like what you know like why would you do that and i'm trying to keep an open mind to it all so um i think that those angel labs kingship invisible friends keith oh doodles is coming out with the duplicator today yes i don't know if we have any more details on that um uh unfortunate timing for them i think at any other time in the market hard to feel hard to feel bad for doodles though i have to try you know i think it's the only nft project that's like really holding up very well in all of this yeah one of the only ones one of the only like handful um invisible friends too actually just to touch back on that i looked at their floor there they were like three and a half eighth which you know they were sitting at six to seven for a long time sacks they're down 50 but like bought apes are down 40 it's like mutants are down more than 50 so it's not absurd um given the current market and they're holding up well but back to doodles i think um the duplicator or duplicator is uh the thing that's coming out i read something about how uh they've largely been really great at under-promising and over-delivering um and not being but then it almost seems like i've read a few announcements the last few weeks where they're like we're going to blow your minds it's going to be everything you think and more if you're expecting it to be like a standard air drop type thing it's not mutants it's so much more etc etc i'm like either they've just like had a real shift in their marketing strategy and approach for whatever reason maybe they made a conscious decision to try and feed into the hype a little bit more on the market or we're just all going to get our minds absolutely blown and knowing the team i'm i'm not i wouldn't be surprised at all if it's the ladder and i i i suspect that it's going to be something brand new that we've not seen before something cool and yeah any other time in the market that the floor price would be skyrocketing i imagine um yeah again hard to feel sorry for them but i'm excited honestly i i own doodles and i'm i love the art i love the team i love the community um it's one of the few remaining safe havens and blue chips out there especially now that azuki has done the azuki things yeah tsuki has done uzuki things yeah yeah i feel like azuki will become a shorthand for you know like some something they wanted to be famous for their 721a but maybe they'll become famous for another thing yeah it'll be very interesting to see how this all plays out the azuki what the uzuki future looks like um yeah you know deeply bullish doodles um i mean look it it's hard all these bear markets really you know they they they shatter the glasses a little bit and you start looking at things with a more critical eye like okay what have they really delivered that warrants whatever the value you know whatever the however many thousands upon thousands of dollars you'd pay to have one um and that goes back to and i've spoken about this before like it's you can't really know the intrinsic value of nft at this point right like the warren buffett's style of like trading stocks which is like determining its intrinsic value based on a very like mathematical calculation on profit and earnings and all you know you can't do that here and that's why you have to be aware that there's a very gambling element to everything that's going on here but the doodles team i think is um just cannot be denied in terms of their talent and their work ethic and their experience in the space and um so yeah big fan of of the digital team excited to see see what they do um they're people still talk about their event at south by southwest about how amazing it was in bridging you were there right i was there it was very cool yeah so again just like you know they can execute yeah absolutely all right zonica i think that's the show for today stay stay strong out
