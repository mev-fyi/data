the immediate reaction is like it freaks you out and you really need to understand the engineering behind it to understand that I think none of these concerns are actually grounded welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is David Hoffman here without my co-host Ryan trout Adams but we are here to help you become more bankless today on the show we have two of the world coin Founders Alex bolania and Sam Altman and we are exploring the world coin Story one of the more ambitious projects in the crypto space and here's what you're going to learn in this episode first what is the idea behind World coin what does it want to do for the world second what is actually inside of an orb is it safe to put your eye into third world coin's answer to how it's providing privacy to those who get their Iris scanned and why some people are still skeptical about it fourth what is World coins identity platform and what can it do for Sam Altman's other company open Ai and the incoming AI enabled internet that Humanity appears to just be Waltzing into fifth how worldcoin plans to become a permissionless protocol including the manufacture entering and operating of the orbs themselves and sixth lastly we had to ask him what Sam Altman thinks of the AI alignment problem we happened to be recording this podcast on Mother's Day which means Ryan is in his human format and why he is not here for this episode but we are still going to record a debrief episode for the bankless citizens out there for all the premium subscribers so I will fill him in on all my thoughts about this episode and we'll talk a little bit more about the incoming AI Revolution and the ways that the crypto story is a part of that if you want that extra debrief episode that is exclusively for bankless Citizens for people who subscribe to the premium RSS feed if you would like that debrief episode there is a link in the show notes so you can subscribe to bank list get that premium RSS feed where we post all of our extra bonus content along with all the other perks that you get for being a part of the bankless nation like I said in the beginning worldcoin is one of the most ambitious projects in this space there's a coin there's a layer two there's an identity protocol there's a mobile app and of course there's this physical piece of Hardware that's because infamously iconic to worldcoin that silver orb it's World coin's philosophy that the best way to produce unique verifiable humanness is human Biometrics that map to our unique DNA this is the most robust way to achieve civil resistance and that's why worldcoin manifests in the physical world with this orb thing biometric scanners are hardware and that physical nature of the orb that you place your eye into to get scanned has these strong dystopian connotations that have triggered so many people we of course talk about this Dynamic directly with the world coin Founders Alex and Sam how they are dealing with this branding that worldcoin has received and how that's impacted the company along the way but nonetheless the worldcoin project does seem to be growing in momentum and it was a pleasure having Alex and Sam on the podcast today I hope you enjoy this episode bankless

thanks for having us thanks for having us David this is gonna be cool yeah I'm really excited for the for this conversation because uh the world coin story arc uh is an interesting one as it relates to both the crypto world and also especially now with the surgeons of and relevancy of AI uh in in mainstream society and so I think that the timing of this episode I think is perfect and Sam I think this story uh starts with you um can you talk about just like the Inception of the idea of world coin where it came from uh and what the aha moment about why we need something like World coin in the in the future I I started thinking initially that it would be quite powerful if you could have the biggest Network like the biggest financial and identity Network imaginable if you could have something truly Global and sort of had no good ideas about how to do that uh the first version we started talking about this was something like well what if we scan the palm of everybody on Earth um or what if we did all these you know like what if a lot of complicated videos about a verify identity but the reason I was excited about it is as the world sort of head toward heads towards powerful AI systems I thought that if we could do something to eventually redistribute wealth through some sort of global Ubi at scale or maybe even access to these systems which would be the most important component of wealth someday and also be able to verify unique humanness uh with a different lens on how to preserve privacy that would be more important as sort of AI Advanced so I started thinking about this years ago um mostly driven by my work on open AI but also just a belief that Ubi was a cool thing to study anyway and uh egg again ideas were like deeply imperfect but I knew something in the space I I wanted to explore um met first Max and then Alex and I thought Alex was super awesome and I'll let Alex talk about how the ideas evolved since then because that part is really all credit to Alex um but that was how it started yeah so it sounds like the early motivation for for World coin came from the uh idea that we could tackle two birds with one stone one being Ubi and one being identity correct and that was really like the the Elegance of the solution before there was actually a solution known you kind of saw that you could do the same thing with these two uh solving these two problems at the same time correct yeah I mean to zoom out even more it was like solve the problem of verified humanness and that and and that was really like that's what you need for a lot of other things like identity like doing the global Ubi um you know if there's if there's a non-fraudulent solution to that that also is privacy preserving that that that's kind of the goal and maybe we could talk about uh where Alex and Sam met uh and and so when did this uh what year was perhaps the idea of world coin accepted and then when does uh when does Alex come into the story we've really started working in it in January 2020 uh so I was I think seven Max started working on it already six months before but then uh what kind of Max had a full-time job so I'm obviously as well so uh when when I joined we we brought the founding team and then really started working on it right before right before real coin I was in in physics and theoretical physics and kind of how you use deep learning to predict AI systems so um not not too close to crypto and basically I was I literally got an email from Max uh explaining with a white paper of worldcoin back then come to the super early ideas as Sam just said like a lot of high level important ideas uh where this could go and and why it would matter and I drove to San Francisco had a couple interviews with Max uh then one with Sam uh that we spent more time together and then uh later became co-founder that's kind of the quick story is there anything I'm missing sir that sounds right so Alex where were you uh in this phase of your of your life and what was your skill set that made this project relevant for you well Max actually reached out to me uh as a software engineer so right before real coin I was I was quite deep into radical physics um and I had a company before in high school that did vertical farming actually did reasonably well but um the five years before Rockland was pretty much just physics and I mean obviously I read about Bitcoin super early on I was early in that phase of the whole of the whole space but I could not say that it was deep in crypto at all before so it was really just Max reached out I think he reached out to many people at this point um to start building this and then we just we explored the whole Space we took these early ideas that Sam mentioned we went much deeper into them and then later I became a CEO and we just took it from there was it obvious that world coin was a crypto project from from day one I don't think so yeah I think so yeah and okay and so you had the aspirations we needed verifiable human identity uh you could also attach some some Ubi to that but Sam you talked about the prospects of you can scan a palm but that's not what where World coin has landed it's ended and landed on the iris can you talk about that choice and uh and then we can start to dive into the tech that's actually inside of of the orb yeah let me take that one so basically when I when I joined there was this like whole paper that that um it was it was not long it was like three pages a lot of high-level ideas and as I mentioned one of the big points of it was you basically need to solve civil resistance to be able to distribute a token to every human being and why do you want to do that in the first place because it would incentive align a really really large Network to grow to all of humanity and kind of really bootstrap this this huge huge financial Network and then of course at some point you could also distribute Ubi through something like this so you want to do that you want to launch a token to all of humanity collectively um then the first big thing you have to solve is what people in crypto call civil resistance I'm sure you're quite familiar with that and simply speaking what that means is you one one human is able to verify to a network that that human is actually unique to the network and why is that important because if that's not in place what would happen is that bad actors which is like destroy the whole distribution of this incentive mechanism and this token and everything would break down and that's something as you know David that happens pretty frequently in crypto still today and if you really want to scale it to all of humanity it's even a much bigger topic so it was pretty clear very early on that that's one of the biggest problems we have to tackle first um and then we we went quite deep so like I mean the whole founding team is pretty much we all met either at Caltech or Max Planck's area all we have all physics backgrounds so we went through the whole space and there's three big things you could do if you zoom out um there's kyc of course so you basically just use governance uh the the Civil resistance of governments that immediately falls through because um less than 50 percent of the world actually have these documents that you could verify digitally so if you think about inclusivity that just does not scale well it would work super well in Europe and us it just does not work globally so that fell through immediately and the second big kind of topic is what people call Web of trust so you basically try to build up a reputation graph and that's a super elegant idea just never really worked or scaled um but I actually think that's something that will come into work on later so we can talk about that and and the last part is Biometrics and so we actually build implementations of all three we look quite deep into kyc we look quite deep into verbal trust and then looked into Biometrics itself and before we get into this specific modality which as you mentioned we use average recognition the first big thing you need to understand is all the things you use in your daily life so your iPhone for example what what that does is it re-authenticates you so it basically realizes that David again tries to log in into the same phone so there's an embedding stored on your phone of how you look like um and then you try to sign in again a new a neural network calculates this pretty much the same embedding again matches it and you can use your phone so it's a one-to-one comparison and that's fairly easy to do other than fraud resistance to solve proof of personhood however you need to compare one user against everyone else so you have a one-to-end comparison and the big problem with that is you just need much more entropy so information about each user to make that work because otherwise the fraud rate explodes exponentially and you actually hit a wall so that's something that's very important to keep in mind you actually don't have a constant fraud right but you literally hit a wall and so things like face just taking a face image doesn't have enough entropy fingerprints doesn't have enough entropy Palm theoretically actually could have but there was just no life implementation of this and and Iris is the thing anyway sorry Alex when you say not enough entropy you mean not enough uniqueness like there's just not enough uniqueness in someone's face to be able to prove verify fire viable humanness correct that's correct at least if you if you image it with a with a normal uh phone camera sure okay and so I I'm assuming this the search for you come to the conclusion that government IDs aren't work don't work and it's also just not it wouldn't be very like native to the crypto ethos to just use government ID as our our identity system uh and then you also talked about the web of trust which there are other web of trust models of of civil resistance out there in the crypto world they're all decently experimental yep um but I think what you're saying is the the biometric solution towards establishing unique human identity is the most robust and the most tried and true model and so that's how you've come to the conclusion of the iris and I'm I'm assuming talking about the entropy of the iris we're going to have you're going to give me a number that's like and the iris is sufficiently entropic correct correct that's correct yeah yeah okay so that is and that also I think presents the the why World coin is the way that it is why there is an orb if it was just the United it's just like uh United States ID or or um Nation say ID or if it was just uh a web of trust model the world coin project would be in a digital sphere only but since we have to collect actual um like look and map that the DNA of someone we actually have to establish ourselves in the real world that's that's why the orb exists so can you talk about the technology in the orb and and how it does what his job is so so to just like quickly summarize what you just said because I think it's it's another important piece is the world is about to change in a meaningful way right uh in that case that neither digital content so images or video as well as intelligence are discriminator anymore what it means to be a human so you actually need to bridge to the real world and I think that's the only way to actually solve the problem and so we started building the orb quite in the beginning we we went quite deep into that engineering we literally had to build our own lens like it's completely from the ground up um custom and so what it does it has a lot of sensors in the front to just make sure whatever we see is an actual human being so not a display uh and not an AI that tries to fool us and all of that compute happens locally so first check we we look at a human being then second the eye is imaged and a unique Iris code is calculated on the device gets signed by the device and that's then the only thing that actually leaves the device and what's pretty cool and very important is that the uniqueness check is separated from the user's wallet through zero knowledge proofs so what that means is that the only thing we or anyone else could prove is that a user has verified before yes or no and so if you believe what we believe you believe that something like this will have to happen like something like World coin will exist and I think rolecoin is the option to make it privacy preserving open source and decentralized and so I know it sounds count intuitive in the beginning because it uses Biometrics etc etc but you really you kind of you have to look into engineering understand um that I think this aligns really well with the values of the space certainly and scanning an iris is uh from what I understand a known quantity that's technology that we've had and I was talking with a team member of the the world crying project uh DC Builder and he um just told me about the the technology in the orb most of the technology is actually making sure that humans aren't trying to game the orb and so like it can it can scan your iris and that's what it does but most of the technology is making sure that humans aren't trying to game the orb in the process of getting their Iris scanned can you talk about the layers of technology that that are comprised in the orb to make this happen sure um so actually I wouldn't say it's most of it because you have if you think about why the orb in the first place like why did we have to build custom Hardware which is like it was not fun back then we were like four people in a small apartment in San Francisco and coming up with the idea we need to build Hardware devices and ships around the world was really not fun um you you actually solve two major problems as you want like one you just mentioned which is fraud resistance and and that comes down to one showing something to the device that actually is not a human being and two just physically attacking the device itself so you can just go to the processor and try to insert data streams that are actually not from Imaging so that's one and then two is Imaging resolution um so all the biometric Imaging devices we tested back then they actually also do not have enough to scale to all of humanity they don't have enough resolution so that's why we had to build our own lens and on Imaging system and things like that so this was like also like a lot of work um so I think it's pretty equally split um but to talk more about your question specifically is the orb has in front it images multi-spectral so what that means is you basically like you imagine multiple wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum so we have infrared we have 3D time of flight and we have multiple wavelengths with an infrared Spectrum just to make sure that whatever we see is an actual human being so you could just know it show a display or even more complicated Optical setups um so this was quite quite some engineering to get there and then the cool thing is everything happens locally on a device so there's seven neural networks that in real time just like do all of these checks um and that's important because uh privacy yet again is it accurate to say that the the retina scan inside the orb is perhaps the most advanced retina scan technology that exists probably we don't know like whatever military has but yeah probably sure sure okay and so um just to really just drive this point point home and because I think this is really important the goal of worldcoin is to produce humanness right one human is one human in the world of of worldcoin and this is especially important as the world of AI comes and and those lines start to blur we need to understand who is a true human and crypto has other identity projects other civil resistance projects but I think the the point here that stands is that there's no identity project proof of identity proof of human project that is as civil resistance civil resistant as uh biology as DNA and so the world coin orb is meant to uh map onto an iris and that is the strongest form of civil resistance that that we have and so um I think just the the uh question I want to ask and I think this kind of gets to where there are always like um concerns about the world coin project is that serializing humans um is a double-edged sword uh we in the crypto industry don't have a source a source of truth of who is a unique human but the history of serializing humans has not been a good one and this has uh been like the cause of concern around the world coin project is like the concern of privacy so since you can scan someone's Iris and prove that they are human what's the story behind the privacy side of things like how does how does worldcoin address the the Privacy issue well first of all we agree right um so that's that's why we build it the way we we have built it so the first like there's this counterintuitive thing going on then of course you have Biometrics and that first it the immediate reaction is like it freaks you out and you really need to understand the engineering behind it to understand that I think none of these concerns are actually grounded and so with a real coin it actually comes down to um to three big things uh the first one is that the biometric data is not stored so basically the imagining happens locally on a device the computation happens on the device and the only thing that actually leaves the device is an iris code that gets signed by the orb and then that's the thing that gets compared against all users then point number two which is by far the most important one is that the uniqueness check is separated from the user's wallet with the knowledge proofs which brings me to the third point is it's actually self-custodial setup so when the user signs up uh he just like the user has a non-custodial wallet that generates then later these serial knowledge proofs to prove inclusion into a set of users and that gives it like quite extreme privacy I don't think there's anything else I'm aware of that could solve the same problem on that scale without any like literally any privacy implications and then the other thing is everything will be open source the majority of the hardware is already open source Defender is getting released slowly because there's still some security concerns but we're getting there the whole setup will be fully decentralized it's of course a challenge because you have Hardware but but it's going to happen so yeah it's it's I think it's actual rocket science like we spend a lot of time a lot of money to make this to build it the way we've built it um and so yeah understanding the system at a high level it does seem like there's so many moving Parts there's the hardware inside of the orb there's the zero knowledge cryptography there's the mobile app can you uh just walk us through an example of someone uh it goes and gets their Iris scanned that turns into data and then that goes through a line of steps that turns into somebody being able to be verifiably logged into their worldcoin app or and like can you talk about just like how that data is carried the processing of the data in the iris scanner uh the zero knowledge groups can you just do an n10 story for how this um goes from an iris scan to somebody's phone sure I will um I will keep it relatively high level but we can go as technical as you want so sure um a user or a person is excited about what kind learns about it downloads an app it's called the world app right now it's right now it's the only client for real coin but many other wallets will support it too as well so I mean all of this is a protocol so many other wallets are connected but right now you download the world con app uh and you click on a map you see where the next orb is you show up in front of this device and then what happens when you verify as you click and verify now you generate a key pair actually two separate key pairs because you have one an ethereum wallet and the second one is basically your identity wallet so these are two separate key pairs that basically live on your on your phone and then once you verify you show that public identity key to the device and that gets air gapped just via camera to the device then the orb does first the cumulus check then the uniqueness check which means it images the I calculates a unique embedding out of this with a neural network then signs that and that's the only thing that actually leaves advice goes to a back end that later will be decentralized as well but right now goes to back end uniqueness check happens and then when the user uses World ID the user does a proof of inclusion with your knowledge that the user is actually that that public key is included into that set um and so what that enables you then to do is you can use that proof across many different ecosystems are not only in ethereum it will also which all other chains but then also in web 2 like you can just use it to log in wherever you want uh without revealing any of your personal information and then another thing that's important to mention is actually World ID is an identity protocol on top of that on top of this idea of proof of personnel that then lets developers and other people attach verifiable credentials and things like that so it's even more than more than just this but yeah that's that's a flow importantly nowhere in their flow does worldcoin ask for your name or date of birth or address is that is that correct no the only um the only time where this comes up is when you actually use a ramping solution because in the app also in World app there is a you can unramp uh through ramping providers and they ask for your name but it's not us right so if you want to get money into the app you will give the on-ramp provider your information but World coin the system does not require your name date of birth address or anything like this correct okay cool and so this this provides us a place for Unique humans to be to have a public address right and so that is the net output of this is like there is a new public address from the world coin protocol uh and that is because of the way that that address is derived verifiably human and I think Sam one of the reasons why you're uh a co-founder of worldcoin and the vision behind this is that you would find it and from the open AI side of things and I think you hypothesize that the world will find it in the world in the age of AI that having a list of addresses of verifiable humans to be supremely useful uh so why would that be useful in the next decade or Century why do we need this in this coming era yeah I I I think there will turn out to be other reasons besides the ones that I'll mention now um but when we think about these very powerful systems these very powerful AIS that will exist in the world I think the benefits from them access to them governance of them that that belongs to real people and I think it's very important that AI is being built as tools for people now there are a lot of ways that we could think about doing this but there's a lot of there's a lot of advantages we like about the world coin solution and uh as Alex just explained I think although the Privacy vision is different than what people have maybe traditionally thought about I think it's one that's very compelling um and I think it's also one that is very fair like this is sort of the maximally inclusive system we can we can imagine um I also think that the ability to say I'm a human I created this content or I'm at least endorsing this content uh that's that's gonna turn out to be important too and another advantage to sort of this sort of a structure metamask has something new introducing metamask portfolio metamask portfolio is the best way to view your crypto

airdrop farming is another one which is like the distribution of tokens is muted by the fact that we don't have have this proof of personhood is there any other crypto native applications that you see oh man so many um I'll start with like crypto first and then we can go a little bit broader but I think sure within crypto one of the things that like one of one of the things that that is an outcome of worldcoin for me personally is that I travel the world which I didn't do when I was in kind of grad school um so I saw many different countries I talked to so many users in in Latin America in Europe and in Africa literally everywhere and I think there's a lot of financial Primitives that technically the space can deliver but right now it does not for for a couple different reasons one is just ux but a really big one is you need reputation for many of these things right this this whole idea of a of a credit score basically like an Unchained credit score so you can do undercollatorized lending I think is a really big idea that that hopefully is coming and proof of personhood generally when you just like you try to build your mental model what proof of person actually means um it's the foundation for identity it's not identity it's these are two different things because identity means I'm a unique person and this is my name that's my date of birth or that's my that's my GitHub account so proof of personal is like the foundational building block to make all of these things happen Sam this was like a little rant but there's like there's a couple things here yeah sure um Sam uh most people know you from your uh work at open Ai and chat gbt are there any um specific or concrete paths that you see between uh integrating open Ai and wood corn I think it's too early to talk about specifics there but you know as we sort of watch this play out in the coming decade I'm hopefully we'll reveal itself okay so how does the actual um distribution of the world coin token and that's the name of the token correct World coin yes how does that actually get into people's hands and what is like the the distribution plan for uh like how do I get worldcoin and how much do I get and what are the details behind that look many of the details we can just not talk about here uh for for the regulatory uncertainty in the United States you're you're certainly aware of um so we will not go too much in the details here but the the broad mechanism is super easy you download an app you verify within uh with an orb at some point you get the approval personnel and then you receive a weekly ownership in real coin and the whole system is built in a way so this can actually scale to billions of people and it will remain like this over the coming the coming decade or so so is there's an incentive to getting your world coin ID earlier because then you start to get your distribution of Bitcoins sooner well I mean like you have like this whole reinforcing flywheel right it's not just about roll Eddie um it's you kind of I mean at launch worldcon is these three things that we we talked about is raw coin it's World ID and then it's the world app of course the world app is like way less important for the grand scheme of things than the other two but I think one mental model you can have is raw coin is a protocol that is designed to scale itself to all of humanity which is something we've never seen because civil resistance was never there right so you have it's it's unclear to me if you zoom you know if you go 10 years in the future what will be more important will it actually be the token or will it be World ID because we have never seen a token being held by three billion people let's say zooming out a little bit on the same uh thread Alex the world coin project is a bunch of very ambitious moving parts so there's the orb which is really a hardware component which is uh for like on its own Frontier of Hardware there's the coin with uh its own Frontier of distribution mechanism there's the mobile app then there's like the actual boots on the ground scanning effort um then there's the layer two which we haven't even talked about built on the op stack there's a ton of moving Parts here I probably missed a few so maybe you could also like finish finish the list but also once we're done finishing the list what's it like managing a startup that requires like and probably an extreme level of Excellency across so many of these domains I mean I I think Sam can give a little bit of the high level uh answer after but it certainly has been a crazy a crazy Journey because I think what what people always say is like in the beginning we literally have like four people all of us came right out of University so we we never worked anywhere um and now it's this big machine of 180 people across these different fields making this happen and as you said we have like we have a quite sophisticated Harbor team we have quite sophisticated protocol team economics team uh AI teams there's like so many things here so many moving parts so it's it definitely was quite a ride and then over time it went from the early Focus was Hardware that was the big thing to focus on and after that product and right now it's pretty much operations so it's gonna become this like big operational machine uh I don't know how was it how was it for you yeah it's been very cool to watch how good the world coin team has gotten at getting good at New Challenges um one of the things I love most about startups is just is watching people learn just how much they can get done and just how much they're capable of um small teams in particular and that's been very fun to see the world coin team do all these things uh I don't remember who who I first heard this from but there's like a sort of somewhat famous saying interceptors if you knew how hard it was going to be you would never start so it's important that you're like a little naive at the beginning but you can accomplish like like smart driven aligned small groups of talented people can accomplish so much more than they realize because they're like their comparison is working in a big company or being in school or something like that um but even then like the worldcoin team is certainly outperformed expectations even adjusted for that Sam what what's your um more like day-to-day involvement with the world coin project maybe it's not day to day um but like where are where does your uh rubber beat the pavement with wilcoin kind of whatever Alex needs uh I tried it um but what that looks like varies a lot and I try to just sort of help anywhere I can but there's no sort of specific like oh this is like my area or my project okay so I was one uh component that I want to delve into is the the layer two uh this was actually announced not too long ago um that world coin is building on the op stack with optimism um can you talk a little bit more about that choice um why that choice why Layer Two on ethereum and also like what does the actual protocol do for World coin what's the actual mechanism in the entirely inside of the whole uh project well I mean actually what we allow what we announced last week um what you're talking about is actually that the um the token itself will launch on op mainnet all right yeah so we did not we did not alone announce the op stack layer too we will certainly do our own Layer Two at some point but not at launch so this is going to come later in the year um why optimism is we just spend so much time with the team like uh Liam Carl uh I cover the whole crew and actually over the last couple months like so many things they gave us so so much feedback on on the whole technology stack and so we just decided I think two months ago that we have to intensify this and actually really start working together so of course it starts with the migration but it goes much deeper than that so we will people work together on identity Primitives uh then of course with bass as well like uh so yeah there's many things coming so the simple implementation is just putting the world coin on optimism that's where it starts I'm assuming there's additional infrastructure that worldcoin will also use the optimism chain for yeah so quick just like zooming out what what does it actually mean infrastructure for all kinds so world it is completely separate because World ID is kind of if we abstracted away it's a miracle a miracle tree that sits on ethereum mainnet and users then make an inclusion proof to that so that that's and and that then is bridging to a different ecosystems so that will not only be the case for uh for ethereum then again as you just said yes the token will be an op mainnet and then later in the year we will have our own layer 2 which is in our case important for a bunch of reasons I think also because just of that identity primitive and making it useful for a bunch of native applications so key to the world coin project is that everyone actually gets their Iris scanned um which is funny if you think about it like if World 20 is successful everyone's putting their eye into the orb uh but I want to talk about the the boots on the ground effort as it's been so far so like how many how many irises have been scanned how many people have gotten their world coin ID and what's been the the strategy and uh behind producing that sure so in total right now it's 1.6 million actually 1.7 million as of yesterday 1.7 billion total all of that still with a very small operation for us at least so it's like it's right now 210 devices most of the time it was around 50 and that that's mostly because we actually had to iterate on product and scale really only matters once everything is launched so we're weeks away from launch that's why we talk right now um and how was the strategy well once we learned we had to build Hardware which was again a really painful Insight uh the next big question was um I think this was like the super early days when I also didn't know Sam super well but but back then it was okay how many people will sign up once you show up with an of an orb on a public on a public place was the first big question like does this actually work can you generate enough throughput with one of those devices to actually scale to the billions it was like our super early definition of what product Market fit would mean and so we we built a prototype and it was literally me running through Berlin with these devices and then kind of setting up users and I remember back then um Sandra one of my colleagues they did 70 items a day and with that 70s items a day we raised a series a back then because if you if you take 70 times a day you multiply it by a week then you arrive at three two I mean back then it was three to 300 to 500 sign ups a week that means that uh tens of thousands devices would be enough to scale to the billions so that's the it was like one of the very surprising things and then from there this was like phase one which is like super early proof of concept then two is we we took it Global we had 15 devices that we just tried to deploy globally and across many different markets to understand if there's any fundamental roadblock that we are not aware of so we went from troms or Norway uh which was the the capacitors blew up because it was so cold to uh to Nairobi Kenya to Latin America and all of that in covert so it was like quite a it was quite a ride we had these team members to travel through five different countries to end up in the one we actually wanted to go to because of covid um and then most recently now we have opacity a much more professional team in that in that regard specifically we focused on four markets which is uh Buenos Aires Argentina uh Lisbon Portugal Nairobi Kenya and well Bangalore in Daily both in India and these four because these are kind of the perfect launch pads for the larger region so if you want to build product these are the four regions we believe you should actually start so we basically parachuted product teams in all of these four locations I try to travel a lot to them and we're going to scale from there how does one scale out to it you can't be employing every single individual operator of an orb to get to uh the world's population correct so how do you get the orb spread around the world into the hands of people who are operators are you employing every single orb operator or what's the strategy there no and and the much bigger part is it actually has to become a decentralized protocol right so this is not that's not a strategy so how it works is when you operate in orb you get paid by the protocol for every sign up you do um in short and there's the orb itself is an affiliate program and well in some sense it's like there's a lot of incentive mechanisms behind it to actually kind of make it work uh but that that's where it's going to go and then also the royalcon foundation is basically just setting the standard and then later other people will be able to produce their own Hardware devices that connect to the protocol right so this is just a kind of stage one of this large process that it's going to take probably 10 years to get done to fully decentralize this but Royal confrontation sets the standard everyone can produce orbs at some point everyone will be able to to operate them as well and the protocol basically pays people so that's the high level abstraction interesting okay so the orb actually turns into a commercial product that can be built by anyone who desires to participate and there's some sort of financial incentive coming from the protocol for or manufacturers to manufacture orbs yeah correct interesting and then just what are the learning lessons from the boots on the ground for um the the orb operators like since they are not part of uh the actual uh company how what is it like to manage these people oh man so many um it started it started with a very obvious ones right so now we have a team of people that worked at Airbnb and Uber and all these companies so they they brought a lot of experience of just how to operate these decentralized models there's a lot around quality control and fraud detection and things like that which we don't have to go super demon um but then the other thing is just like get as much power to the user right so put as much in the app as possible educate the user as much as possible before to sign up so there's like there's there's a bunch of things there but it's it certainly was a journey and it still will be because it's it's 200 devices not tens of thousands so this is going to be the major the major thing for this year yeah I don't think I don't think we've ever seen a project from Humanity that has this kind of like spec uh where are we would you say Alex in this roadmap for World coin uh so started in 2020 uh Alex uh Sam said that the the progress of world Corey and the professionalism from World coin is exceeded expectations so maybe we were a little bit further ahead in the road map so where are we in the grand Arc of the world coin project and how much left is there to do um I'm gonna give my answer then I'm actually curious about Sam's but uh even though we worked on this now for a while we are still extremely early I mean we're literally ahead of launch that's why we talk right now but there was just so much engineering that went into this and so much building that had to go into this so we were super early and of course everything we have seen so far is extremely promising that's why we're here so we have like 600 000 Maus in the app we at more than 40 000 users a month with only 200 of those devices there's like a lot of things that are super exciting but sorry forty thousand a week not a month [Music] um what do you think Sam we have three orders of magnitude three and a half orders of magnitude of growth in front of us you know it's hard to say it's anything extremely early Alex I remember when uh the world coin project debuted um and worldcoin got absolutely hazed by the crypto industry um and I I think it was kind of an expected outcome like hey stick your iris in this orb and then you'll get some tokens uh it was the the spinal reflex I think is pretty obvious one thing I've noticed however uh is that it has attracted talent in ways that I haven't seen other projects uh there's been a number of people who there's actually been two instances in my life that I've been in a social situation a social setting and somebody from the world Coin Company pulls out an orb people inside of worldcoin love the orbs and so uh slowly uh the world coin team has continued to build continue to iterate attracted some Talent uh attracted people that were not on the world going team that are now on the world coin team that that I've respected just as Builders and thinkers and developers in this space uh and so there's been not only has the project of worldcoin progressed in its own on its own trajectory but um the perception around World coin has changed uh can you just talk about that experience and so so the initial we actually didn't want to announce back then there was this there was a super annoying uh journalist leak that had us to react so I was just imagine this like imagined us vividly of like we were back then a super small team and because of covid I just lost my student visa we were locked in this ridiculous situation we were like sitting in a small town called erlangen in Germany and on a Friday night I think 11 pm I get this email from a Bloomberg reporter it's like okay if you don't react we're gonna uh we're gonna uh we're gonna write about this and everything blows up it's like just the internet melts um Sam Altman is launching it's like a thing and so there's 10 people in a small village in Germany trying to figure things out as like as early as it gets basically and of course it was incredibly hard it was like managing managing the team through this and then also managing the just like actually scaling the company raising Capital with that with that early uh pushback was super super hard but then I mean we just as you said I think we attracted incredible people one of the best or one of the best teams in the space for sure uh but then not not even within that industry I think broadly speaking we have like incredible people here uh just like this flywheel started happening other than people also outside of Brooklyn got excited about it and I think of course AI helped a lot with this because people just understand why this matters so much and why it's important and that actually might be the solution to one of the biggest problems we we face um and the recent weeks has it was just incredible because now we get so much excitement and people are are hyped about it what do you think Sam how was it for you I've I've been through some of these up and down Cycles before so I was less Amazed by it but this was the the um the level of like personal attacks and hatred was was definitely High I remember like logging into Twitter one day I try not to read a ton of Twitter well I think it's a little bit unhealthy but I logged in one day right after and just spent like a long time scrolling through what everybody was saying it was like wow this is like these are quite personal attacks Sam do you also get that from the open AI side of things um yeah open AI has like you know super fans and super haters um oh you kind of get used to both I think that there are certain people um that regardless of what you tell them about the tech inside of the orb and the zero knowledge cryptography that just simply won't accept the Privacy um side of things and and they're super welcome never to sign up sure like I you know I think that's like really important to keep saying right yes um I I talked about on a recent bank list episode the weekly roll up that this episode was happening in that um I got breakfast with uh a world coin member and there was like an orb sitting on the table just like a little ornament it's kind of fun uh and some people were like oh yeah bankless is talking to the world coin people like wow like can't believe they're doing that right so some people are going to be this extreme extreme case where that's that's for sure but it's been amazing to me and I don't even fully understand why like how much it feels like the kind of like overall mean has changed yeah the the the less extreme side of the crypto world seems to be keeping an open mind but and more than that it feels like to me like an enthusiastic mind at this point which is a big turnaround yeah yeah yeah so so what would you say it's like I I don't have the technical skills to actually be able to explain the separation of the Privacy between like the identity and the app and all that stuff there's great documentation that's very very robust that that listeners could go read and get detectable explanation as to how the how the Privacy is actually uh maintained but then there's I want to present the argument that like there's also the world of unknown unknowns like ultimately there is uh every like the goal of world coin is to scan everyone's irises and while there is the technical explanation for why this is still secure there's also just like yeah but they're you're still doing it uh and so maybe we could we could reflect on that like Alex what would you say to that that uh feedback or criticism well as you as you could imagine I have a lot of these conversations um and I think for for 99 of these conversations um the answer is usually just they actually did not read the docs or they just did not try to understand what is happening and so you can usually calm down people quite a bit but just actually going through the details and uh going to but there's a like much bigger headline which is you should not have to trust us and you will not have to trust us right because uh things already are open source and like that's actually that's a common feed pushback we get right now and I think it's totally fair that not everything yet is open source so this is uh obviously we we move on that as fast as we can but there's just like real world um kind of trade-offs we have to we have to work around so yeah just don't trust us like look at the documentation look at the code um if if you find something you don't like like literally or ahead of engineering was the head of engineering of ccash before right just talk to us and we we will figure things out but I think we're in a pretty good place so if um people are peaked by World coin as a result of this episode what is World corn looking for what does it need the most to help move the needle the most uh what do you guys need we need I mean we we literally hire across the Spectrum everything from everything from product to AI um I mean in our case it's not like it's not AGI it's it's neural networks on edge um to detect all kinds of fraud attacks so it's a different kind of skill set of course but but yeah like literally across the Spectrum what you could imagine if you're super operationally talented if you're technically talented just just Reach Out and Sam since I have you here uh really quickly uh where do you stand on the AI alignment debate I I think there's let me try to talk about it in three different ways um number one we need to make a lot more technical progress uh We've laid out our part of our roadmap for how we think we're going to solve it but one on our Google thing is we we need new techniques beyond our lhf I think open AI has been characterized I don't characterized I don't understand how for saying that oh alignment is solved because we have rlh absolutely not like I want to be super super clear so there's a ton of work to do there I think the shape of it all is going to look fairly different than what people think in a vacuum um I think like with all really hard complex problems at the intersection of technology and Society like it's it's kind of hard to sit in Ivory Tower and think think it through all the way we've had really smart people doing that for a long time um say they've made limited progress in a lot of the progress or assumed progress they thought they made has turned out to be wrong because the technology went in a little bit different direction so we need to do more work and I think the way we need to do that is contact with these systems as we develop them in contact with reality uh number two I think once there is a technical once we have the technical ability to align a super intelligence um we then need a complex set of International regulatory agreements cooperation between the leading efforts uh but we've got to make sure that we actually like have people implement this solution and don't have sort of for lack of a better word word rogue efforts that say okay well I can make a more powerful thing um and I'm going to do it without paying the alignment tax whatever that is uh and so there will need to be a very complex set of negotiations and agreements that happen and we're trying to start laying the groundwork for that now um and then third is I think we talk a lot and this is I'm glad we do about the the alignment problem but what we talk less about is what about humans misusing this or even much weaker things on AGI to cause like great great Havoc or do great damage to society um system is like aligned with its operator but doing something we don't want so how are those rules of what the limits are going to get written and how are we going to enforce them on limiting intentional misuse awesome guys Sam Alex thank you so much for joining me on Bank list today to the work to walk through the the world coin project and I'm excited to see what it produces in the future thanks a lot for thanks for having us David guys Bank location you know the deal crypto is risky you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you
