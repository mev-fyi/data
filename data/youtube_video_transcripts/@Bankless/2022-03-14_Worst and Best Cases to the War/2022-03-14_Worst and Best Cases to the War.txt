what's a reasonable worst case for all of this and then also what's the reasonable best case and realizing that like the truth often falls somewhere in the middle and reality is somewhere in the middle but worst case outcomes of all of this and then best case outcomes of all of this to be candid worst case nuclear warfare oh yeah i forgot about that part and then i think like the best case scenario would be that they negotiate putin goes back to russia or whatever or hopefully gets booted out of office gets replaced by somebody who is willing to you know give russian people the life that they deserve and to treat them with the respect that they deserve and not invade other countries like what's been interesting about this war because you have seen the west become so much more united you've seen europe like finally wake up and kind of like become countries again which has been i think really important um instead of just like oh like we're gonna be friends and hold hands forever like that that's just not how geopolitics works
