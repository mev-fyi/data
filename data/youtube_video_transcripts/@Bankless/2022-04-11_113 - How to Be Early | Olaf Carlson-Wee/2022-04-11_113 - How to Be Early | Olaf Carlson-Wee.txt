I love that inherent futurism embedded in crypto which is sort of we're all building for this future that doesn't yet exist but we all are confident you know will exist someday welcome to bankless where we explore the Frontier internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode with Olaf Carlson we we are picking his brain this is an OG investor of ogs he was first to just about everything we're going to talk about all of that and more what he thinks about the space a few things that you want to take away from this episode number one how did Olaf get in early to just about everything in crypto the contrarian investor independent thinking he talks a lot about that in this episode number two who's going to win the crypto chain Wars is it eth is it Bitcoin is it alt layer ones which chain is going to accrue the most value that is a very relevant Topic in 2022. number three how dowels will look in the long run will decentralized governance actually work as a bonus really fun section near the end David and I play a game we call overrated or underrated and get Olaf to name some things that are overrated and underrated in crypto I think you will enjoy this episode and like those answers uh David what were some of your thoughts on this episode with Olaf it's always fun to pick the brain of people that got into the space really really early and clearly saw it right uh and Olaf definitely saw crypto unfold like relatively accurately for how it actually did unfold and it takes a special kind of person to come into crypto early and really be able to call some of the things that happened of course no one gets everything right but the consistency of which Olaf's ideas and concept and and practices about how to operate in this space worked out for him is is just something that's fantastic to learn about I I think the hottest take the the take that I appreciate most Ryan was his long-term model for Dao's and how dowels are going to collectively rather than just being a bunch of discords where people you know shuffle around and do stuff and then cut and settle up at the end of the month or however doubts do it he talked about how Dows are going to be uh you know companies that apply for Grants from a protocol and I asked him after that about like you know what what kind of example do you have of a dow that's really getting something right and I have my answer and I was waiting for his answer and the fact that he said that he hadn't seen any answer yet uh was actually surprising to me but I think that is something that we will save for the debrief yeah we've got a lot to talk about in the debrief because um you know Olaf shared some views that are sort of I guess counter to some of the ideas in in Bank lists like um uh Concepts around sort of money when all assets are the same there's not sort of you know Crypt of monies versus other assets his ideas around sort of a multi L1 world as well I mean polychain for a reason yeah exactly that's kind of what he said so um anyway some really interesting ideas a little bit of back and forth on on that but based see Dave this this episode was everything I wanted it to be because we've never had Olaf on the podcast and uh he's just someone you have to talk to in crypto and you have to you have to pick his brain we'd never had an opportunity to do that and I feel like we got all of the questions in that we wanted asked even if it got into like rapid fire mode near the end and um they were kind of you know short pithy responses so it was just a fantastic episode from that perspective we've been hunting for Olaf for a really long time and kind of had just like given up I couldn't figure out how to get to him and then one day he just shows up in our inbox I was like hey can I come on Bank list yeah and we're like oh fantastic great and that's how this episode happened yeah it's sometimes it just works that way so guys we think you're really gonna enjoy this episode as always if you're a premium subscriber hang with us on the debrief where we talk about the episode after the episode guys we're gonna get right into our episode with Olaf but before we do we want to thank the

that's why this is a special treat to talk to Olaf Carlson we he's an OG of ogs he was early to bitcoin back when Bitcoin was this weird obscure thing he was early to ethereum as well figuring that out he's one of the First Investors in D5 projects like maker Dow one of the first maybe the first crypto fund manager as well starting polychain Capital he was the what uh one of coinbase's first employees a lot of Firsts in Olaf's background and I know what I was getting in the crypto space I uh Olaf was a key person for for me to listen to to Really wrap my head around the mental models for this industry and what's going on so Olaf it is a pleasure to have you on Bank list how you doing I'm doing great I'm very excited to be here and thanks for all your kind words yeah I think what we want to do is like pick your brain uh I think we want to understand how you've been so consistently early to everything and understand your thesis now because of any investor in crypto has been dedicated I feel like you've seen the most like you've seen all of the Cycles like all of the Cycles play out basically uh you've seen the development of um Bitcoin and smart contracts and crypto Banks and uh defy and now nfts and Dows and so we're really looking to understand your thesis on the space but but let's start here uh I want to zoom out and ask you this question how about this whole crypto thing has this crypto thing played out the way you thought and uh what have been some of the surprises along the way yeah I mean I think it's it was hard back in 2011 2012 when I was really getting deep into this um it's very hard to have you know back then I could not have imagined all the various ways this has gone um now that said you know my thesis from the beginning was that this was going to grow a lot and get very big right um I think that the specific way that has happened is is extremely surprising um you know I I think that the kind of Advent of smart contracts and all the various applications that those lead to you know driving a lot of what is now kind of the mainstream adoption through things like nfts and nd5 um was you know totally off my radar at the time right that was just a Bitcoin world you know I was interested in some alternative systems like name coin at the time that was basically a you know similar system to ens today like a DNS registry on the blockchain um but really that was the limit of what people were kind of imagining um we were talking about things like colored coins which you could sort of think of as nfts now um it's sort of you know I still have somewhere probably like some blue Bitcoin or something like that um so I I think some of these ideas have percolated um from the beginning but at the same time just the way it's played out in the sheer magnitude um that we've reached in such a short period of time I think it's faster than anyone could have predicted like I think if I would have said this is how fast and this would happen and how big this would get um 10 years ago I think I would have sounded like a crackpot um and I and I probably did uh sound like that it's always interesting to me to peel back the layers of the OG crypto culture back like pre-2015 because there's a lot of things you've named some of them that were really prescient of things to come like color coins were just an early version of nfts as you said namecoin where it was an early version of ens but then also at the same time there were many many other things that came about that no one really ever could have predicted back then like you know I think D5 definitely um uh could fall in that camp but one thing I definitely think is true about you Olaf is uh you're not necessarily patient zero but you're definitely really close to one of the earliest people that caught the bug whatever the bug was and so you know we can talk about like all these different use cases that were you know exciting and uh made you optimistic about the future of crypto but catching the bug is something a little bit more holistic when you kind of zoom out and not really focus on any one specific use case what made you catch the bug so early so uh 2011 I read you know my first introduction was this Gawker article that was about Silk Road um and it it talked about Bitcoins in that article and how people were using Bitcoins to sort of transact and I you know I had some background in um you know just internet deep internet stuff call it I was always interested in video games and weird forums and stuff like that and so I you know identified like okay this seems like the critical thing that makes this possible I was familiar with the Tor Network and all of these sorts of um systems that something like Silk Road was built on um and when I started reading more about how Bitcoin worked um my immediate reaction was this is sort of too good to be true this concept of an Internet Sovereign monetary system that's sort of run by an algorithm and not controlled by any Central person it just sounded like to sci-fi to be real um but once I really dove into how it worked and started using the software and everything I realized that um it worked like this actually was possible we have this um decentralized monetary system everybody can investigate you know how it all works um and while Bitcoin is is complicated um I've always held that it's a lot less complicated than Fiat money um and the sort of shadowy mechanisms by which um every Fiat money in the world operates um you know through unelected people that are in closed door meetings basically deciding the fate of um the monetary system of a given nation state so um I was really drawn to this idea of um you know taking away um control of the monetary system from you know what are basically Global Elites and putting it in the hands of you know regular people who can kind of opt into this internet-based monetary system um again it you know I think one of the beautiful things here is that it's an opt-in system nobody has to use it um everyone can just sort of voluntarily go sign up for it if they want to um and the fact that anybody in the world can relatively easily audit how it works again it's relatively easy it's it's not the easiest thing in the world but you can audit sort of how many uh Bitcoin will exist at any given date in the future you can figure out you know exactly what you own and it can't really be taken um from you in a sort of network level um uh way and so all of those things added up to me um feeling like this was both sort of one the technological Mega trend of my lifetime um you know I felt like I was a little too young for you know the early internet I was a little too young for mobile I guess in the shift to mobile um and I felt like this is this is going to be this sort of big technological Mega Trend um at the same time you know I've always loved the fact that crypto you know in its core it's it's deeply anti-authoritarian um I really do view it as a technology which has the capacity sort of um free people from systems that they didn't even know they were trapped in um and you really just transform you know the entire substrate of global finance and global monetary systems so all those ideas were just very big to me and deeply appealing to me I mean they still are the idea that we could sort of take away power from Central locus of control and return it to decentralized voluntary systems just feels like you know it is very hard for me to imagine who is against that and fundamentally the only people that are really going to lose in that situation are the ones who control the current system right um and it you know I I think broadly the other 99.99 of people benefit um from a removal of central locus of of power and a return to distributed systems that are kind of opt-in Open Source and anybody can interact with freely so um that's really what you know it's the it's what got me interested in this and it's how I sort of caught the bug so to speak um and so you combine sort of all that ideological um you you know stuff that I I think is is really cool and I really think it's it's genuinely like a capital G good thing for the world um you combine that with the fact that this is sort of this new high growth um Tech area where you can actually be a software engineer and deploy you know what are basically Banks or or trading systems or lending systems you know directly to the internet have a global user base from day one without any sort of registration or licensure or permission from any particular nation state or government body or anything it's just an absolutely fascinating Universe to me and so when I first got it involved in this um I felt like you know I can be part of this Mega Trend and I can change the world for the better um by doing this so I just found it you know extremely appealing the entire Bitcoin Universe also filled with you know very odd interesting people um and that was fun as well you know once I started going you know on the forums a lot I'm going to bitcoin meetups and stuff you know I just felt like okay this is really like a rag tag group of very interesting people um extremely intelligent and often very unusual beliefs um but really fundamentally I I think driven for the right reasons you know especially back in 2011 2012 like there was no opportunism here um there was no opportunity really it was just sort of an open source software project and everybody who was invested in it was um you know just interested in what was maybe possible for the future and I I love that inherent futurism embedded in crypto which is sort of we're all building for this future that doesn't yet exist but we all are confident you know will exist someday well I think many bankless listeners and certainly David myself are uh deep resonate with everything you just said like the capital the capital G good in in crypto and the reasons we're here uh it's funny that that you called the Fiat system shadowy because uh some in the Fiat system use that same word to describe us you know shadowy supercoders but really I mean I think uh folks in crypto don't take enough opportunity to flip that around and say things like which you just said which is no the existing Banking and Fiat system that's the shadowy thing everything we do is fully transparent auditable uh in code and uh embedded in a consensus engine that that don't privilege uh the the elite few who can control the dials um so that's a great description I guess maybe in in sort of a next stage of your crypto Journey I'm curious to hear because a lot of people who got into Bitcoin for some of the reasons that you mentioned actually stayed in Bitcoin and so there was this development of what some might call uh Bitcoin maximalism where sort of Bitcoin is the only asset in crypto there shall be no other assets and you know that is the thing that we're here for but you didn't fall prey to bitcoin maximalism and just keep contained to the Bitcoin space you made the jump into ethereum into into other chains later ultimately into defy can you talk about that what was it that attracted you uh about ethereum and about smart contract platforms and how did you get out of the the rut that some found themselves in of Bitcoin uh Bitcoin maximalism yeah so I think philosophically I think um every one of these blockchain systems has kind of two components one is The Ledger of who owns what um and the other is kind of underlying Tech platform that people can build on and transact on and interact with and I think part of it um is a Divergence of which of those two things is is sort of more important um I do think that an unusual thing you see across all of crypto is not you know your underlying beliefs or thesis about the world or the future informing your Investments but rather the Investments that you have chosen informing your sort of world view it's sort of this opposite thing um which I think is very unusual because it's so easy to move um around you know assets that people hold or systems that people interact with and so I do think there's um you know a belief that every time you launch a new blockchain or any sort of new system you sort of restart The Ledger of who owns what um in that you know ethereum wasn't airdropped to the existing uh Bitcoin holders it was sort of a new group of holders um launching a new parallel system and so um I do think that that's a lot of the mentality is that The Ledger influence what is sort of the most important thing and that all the sort of tech that underlies it is secondary um I I do think you know there is some sort of interesting argument to be made that if every altcoin had been airdropped you know to bitcoin through like an equivalent equivalency system um we might have a much more cohesive and happy happy world or something among all the various coin holders because there's not this feeling that the sort of Etch A Sketch was shaken um every time a new technology was launched um but I you know broadly have just always been interested in what's possible here um and the reality is when I um I met vitalik in in 2013 um you know read the ethereum white paper the day it came out um and you know was following the ethereum development progress until the system launched in 2015 and then was was using it um I just you know felt like this is going to enable new things that weren't possible on bitcoin and it's it's just that simple it's not um Litecoin right where it's sort of like a couple simple variable changes and it's like tweaked it's really a fundamentally new platform um I you know and I think similarly that same mentality has has infected a lot of people that were early investors in ethereum actually um that now there's these alternative sets of trade-offs and and novel systems that are launching um and people that are sort of holy about the um ethereum Ledger of who owns what and and don't like the idea that we're going to do a new Etch A Sketch Shake on on who owns what um every time we launch a new technology um I I think that broadly though I just care about um enabling new behaviors um and I think that efficiency improvements so cost reductions and throughput improvements lead to new types of applications that weren't possible before um a lot of micro payment or like very fast payment type applications you know really aren't possible on bitcoin or ethereum um and you know just always looking at how can we make smart trade-offs to expand the universe of what is possible because every time you build something new in crypto it it comes with trade-offs of some kind right just the fact that there is programmable um uh software on ethereum adds complexity um to reasoning about the core ethereum mechanism so Concepts like minor extractable value really alter your reasoning about like core ethereum security and those types of problems don't really exist on bitcoin so every every time time you expand the system you know it comes with trade-offs and I've always wanted to explore that trade-off space and see what's possible a lot of the things that have been built since ethereum make further trade-offs about you know various Hardware requirements for example to run a node and you know those bigger Hardware requirements might mean there's fewer at-home you know hobbyist note operators but at the same time it might lead to interesting applications that aren't possible on ethereum so I just broadly want to see all the experiments run and I'm not um religious about you know the ledgers of who owns what um you know being sort of the most important thing here see all the experiments get run and maybe let the market decide at the end of the day I'm curious about something you've known a lot of people in this space for a long time you said you met vitalik in 2013 and you've been able to observe him uh since that time what do you think about vitalik what's your take on the guy I mean I think he's a genius everybody agrees on that um you know I I just like when I first met him he showed me um a python tool that he'd written to make uh Bitcoin multi-sick um and this is back in 2013 I'd actually never seen multi-sick before um before that we didn't have multi-sig at a blockchain level you had to do something called shimir's uh splitting in order to do multi-sig on like a private key level so you could do multi-sig but it was like an offline multi-sig you couldn't get a multi-sig that was enforced by you know Bitcoin Economic Security and he was the one who first showed me like this command line tool to do that um so you know I think I recognized right away that he was ahead of the curve on maybe what's possible here um and he just struck me as incredibly intelligent um you know I I think so yeah I I mean I also think that he's like a missionary so you know I don't think any part of what vitalik is working on is um is sort of a mercenary approach to the world I think he um really just cares and wants to invent new things and wants to improve the world um so I have a lot of respect for vitalik and really anybody who approaches um the crypto space or really anything with that mentality one of the interesting things about your trajectory Olaf is that you had conviction it appears that you had conviction on bitcoin really really early where most people they see Bitcoin come across their feed and then they read the white paper and then they don't buy it and then they buy the top later uh but one of the interesting components about you is that you had a conviction very very early and I think you also had conviction on ethereum very very early in its in this lifespan as well what would you say uh is what would you say about ethereum is what lent you to have so much conviction about it early in its history when so many people were talking about how this would never work it's way too ambitious uh can't be done stuff like that what what aspects about the crypto industry at the time told you like yeah this ethereum thing is is kind of cool yeah I mean I think the main thing is people listen to what other people chatter about like way more than they just download the software and interact with it and you know see how it works um maybe read a paper that describes how it works um so I just have always felt you know crypto is so young yet 99.9 of the consumption by people in crypto is sort of secondary sources um for whatever reason I just think most people spend a lot more time on Twitter than they do just downloading software um you know interacting with apps and sort of reading papers about how this stuff works um so to me it's actually really easy it's just quit paying attention to all of this no noise and nonsense and chatter a lot of which comes with vested interests and just go actually use the damn thing and see if it makes sense to you um I I just think that you know it takes a certain amount of independent thinking to open the door and get into crypto on some level but then I'm always amazed at how little independent thinking there is after that um with just sort of like go look at it see it see if it makes sense to you see if it would be useful to you see if it's fascinating to you um so I I just am a big believer you know in crypto and everything in independent thinking you know you just have to um you know go to primary sources and use your mind to decide what you think um and in in crypto um there's just a huge amount of sort of Talking Heads um that determine what you know a lot of people think um and so I I just think it's this very weird one way I've described it is like 1 9.99 it's like one percent of people are like actually doing stuff nine percent of people are watching them really closely and understand broadly what they're doing and then those nine turn around and talk to the other 90 of people so the vast majority of people are listening to people who aren't even the ones doing the thing they're like the ones so it's kind of like this vast majority of the information is coming from like second or third Source um and so there's just all this chatter um and very little attention being paid to that you know one percent of of people that are actually sort of just building stuff so there's Alpha there it sounds like that you've you've you've exposed through the course of your work in crypto in like going to the primary sources doing the the Deep dive rolling up your sleeves and downloading software actually using crypto networks and being uh close to that one percent but I you know it feels crazy to call that Alpha it's just super basic to me like super you know like to say like oh you wanna you know be better at investing like just go use the thing that you're thinking about investing in is like I you know I feel stupid saying that's Alpha right it's it's super basic but um if there's you know one thing I've I've done it you know real you know for a long time it's basically that um you know stop listening to all of the Chatterbox and um and the troll box and just just go like check it out like for real and decide if you like it um I don't even think it takes more time it just maybe takes a little bit more focused effort um you know you have to troubleshoot some stuff especially if it's early and kind of buggy or something like that but um yeah if that's if that's Alpha then I yeah I guess that's what I would say you talked about how you appreciated the non-mercenary aspect of italic uh kind of alluding to you know he's here for the right reasons he's not here to to make a profit and leave he's here to build something really cool and see something better for the world uh what would you say you're here for Olaf uh if you like that aspect about vitalik what about you uh in this crypto space do you particularly find resonant with your goals and and your aspirations for the future of this industry yeah I I like um I like being you know a believer in the first really radical experiments so um whenever I meet somebody who has a really radical new world view um or new set of of beliefs about appropriate trade-offs um or like a new weird business model that they want to try um just that kind of tip of the spear stuff I I really love thinking through reasoning about and I love partnering with people to sort of have you know enable them to try to go fulfill fulfill their vision and hire a team that's that's unified around the vision and go build it um and I I would broadly say that the best investments I've ever made in crypto have been um you know if there's one theme it's the ones that sounded too crazy um or too good to be true um you know or just divisions that seemed like too big in a way um so I don't think there's you know if there's one mistake all of us have made in crypto it was basically not thinking big enough um you know I think no one really could have seen like how big this would get how fast it did that and um I think that you know partnering with people who have that early vision and being able to enable um their Vision I I gain that's makes me super happy just the fact that I can be sort of an early believer um in radical systems radical uh beliefs and and try to try to see it just grow and Blossom um in the world is is really exciting for me why do you think we all fall into those traps because I definitely see that everywhere it's just see humans just can't seem to comprehend how big this thing is why do you think that's such a universal truth with most people most people in crypto I don't know I I like you know there's a deeper conversation about like schooling and brainwashing um where basically it's you know I think independent thinking is like this incredibly scarce resource across the world um I think most people just look to their left and look to their right and basically do whatever their peer group uh does and believes whatever their peer group believes um you know this this goes Way Beyond crypto and I think you just see it play out in crypto which is um you know it's it's not like I'm gonna go read it for myself and and figure out what I think or what I believe it's just sort of like what are my friends doing what did my parents do and um you know I'm just gonna broadly like fit nicely into that world view so I I think there's a lot of um you know group think and like voluntary like sign me up for the brainwashing um that happens you know out outside of crypto but I think you see it play out in crypto just the same um where people don't have appropriate you know it's it's this weird mix of like skepticism um and incredible optimism it's sort of I'm going to be extremely skeptical about everything I hear but at the same time I'm extremely optimistic about what is possible yeah absolutely I think uh we forget how how much we're social creatures uh yeah as as humans and how much we we value and care about consensus um particularly group consensus and it's that contrarian thought that can really give us an edge uh in this industry and just in life in general um but you mentioned some of the wins that you've had in the past and being kind of tip of the spear uh being early imagine you count like early to bitcoin as as part of your your wins uh also early to ether is part of your wins um I think you were also pretty early to defy as well I remember uh polychain getting in early on like make your investment with a like a maker governance proposal can you talk about some defy in general but but also maybe more like like zooming out a little bit and talking about some of the the wins in crypto that you're most most proud of and seeing things before other people saw them yeah I think um I was always excited about what I called back then programmatic Finance this was like two years before the word defy um was coined um and so you know I was or as polychain was kind of the first um you know real in investor in maker Dao um we we were the seed investor in compound we were the seed investor and dydx um you know in a whole host since then like more than I can even um name um so I I think I always just felt um we have this great elegant decentralized system but then at the same time this incredible Reliance on gargantuan centralized platforms to execute trades and um other sorts of things other sorts of financial Tools in crypto things like loans um and so I always felt like it was going to be possible to embed all those financial toolings inside the blockchain also so we have this money system in the blockchain why can't we have a finance system in the blockchain too and it's pretty logical conclusion to me if you understand a programmability and sort of the ability not just to encode transactional logic but also Financial logic and have it be secured in that same very nice Economic Security you get with you know ethereum block rewards and things like that so um you know gee I don't mean to say that D5 seemed kind of obvious to me but um in a way it it always felt like this is a very promising area um you know and I I once it started really working um the other thing that I had been really excited about was Dows um and one thing that I didn't totally see and now it feels so obvious is the fact that Dows and D5 are like two sides of the same coin that basically the best way to house a D5 application is inside a doubt like um ownership structure um and governance structure so to me it's it's really cool where we have these two separate use cases in crypto and it turned out that um the perfect use case for Dows was basically to house defy applications um you know among other things but I think that's been like the breakout way to to use the Dow governance and ownership structure um so I I think there's more radical experiments um around the the corner as well um I I'm very excited about um this use of a kind of block reward style mechanism to reward other types of behavior so I was always really excited about liquidity mining um in D5 which is basically you know this bootstrapping mechanism um to get liquidity but I think you can more broadly you know I call it Network mining where you can sort of apply this block reward distribution scheme to all sorts of human behavior to build Network effects because solving this chicken egg problem um to bootstrap Network effects rapidly is one of the things that creates um you know kind of a natural monopoly effect around modern um web platforms where Network effects are very powerful in a system like Twitter um say and it's very hard to sort of break those and create a competitor um using the sort of network mining block reward system I think it's possible to do that um both in a gaming context in the social media context and once you sort of get the um Financial framework right I think you can apply that financialization to lots of different web platforms um Mark you know any sort of e-commerce Marketplace whatever it might be to sort of bootstrap those Network effects um and so you know these Financial tooling um I think continue we continue to see like the design space that this can be applied to all sorts of crowdfunding um that originally was just sort of these simplistic icos now um is doing so much more um so we see these experiments like Constitution Dao that I think are are really cool where you can raise huge amounts of money in a short period of time with a bunch of aligned people um so just this Capital coordination around things that you know you would never be able to sort of do that through any other mechanism you can't you couldn't like IPO a system to buy the constitution in a week it just it's just not possible um so I think that we continue to see you know D5 expand and that design space I think is still very very young frankly um and we need to get a lot of things right around Dows and governance and capital allocation inside Dao's I think we can improve a lot um you know and but broadly like the other things that I think um I'm very excited about is is basically like you know we were seed investors in avalanche seed investors in in Terra um you know and these kind of alternative systems to ethereum that have have trade-offs um that lead to sort of better performance properties um and then I think there's even more um exotic experiments you know the some of our seed Investments here are like uh filecoin polka dot uh dfinity um where it's not just about the financial logic being embedded inside the blockchain uh but also the web application interface so we're we're in this unusual place in defy today where you go to a centralized website in order to interact with the underlying uh Financial system that's embedded in the blockchain and if we could shift that to a system where the interface also had that same sort of blockchain based logic so it means that you could the the interface itself is open source forkable censorship resistant Etc um I think that's potentially another very big step coming up for crypto um which is so the full stack sort of gets decentralized and then you have full like web and mobile style um applications that are embedded inside blockchains so olafa I think we want to kind of switch switch gears to um to 2022 and kind of the the here and now and so the typical individual who's trying to navigate crypto in 2022 is is uh thinking about different things than the individual trying to navigate in crypto in 2013 right or even like 2017 and 2018 every every year every era every generation has a new set of questions that that need to be answered in order to understand how this how this industry uh how this crypto thing is going to shape up and so we have like five big questions that we want to pick your brain on and I don't know if we'll have time to hit them all but let me just read them out really quick because I think we want to touch on as many as we can and go in depth on the ones that make sense number one I think in people's mind the question of who's going to win the smart contract Wars maybe that's a simplistic framing but this idea of who's going to be the ultimate winner of the smart contract Wars is is a big question in people's mind another question is who's going to win the crypto money Wars is is that different like is Bitcoin the asset with the highest monetary premium uh a third is we're seeing the Advent of the multi-chain universe and and kind of ltus as well will we have the same D5 winners in this universe or we will we have a new set of winners a new set of applications uh so that's the third question number four so let's let's let's stop there actually because I think those three answers are super related and I'm happy to just kind of dive into it let's see that and then I I want to set up two more and then we'll come back to this can Dow's really scale and also how about crypto in the nation state how do these things interact but let's take the first the first three okay so this is smart contract War winners crypto money Wars and then uh D5 winners this is all in the same category of like who's going to win as the biggest baddest chain what are your thoughts on this okay okay so um this is a a complicated question that has to do with um it's actually related a little bit to what I said earlier about the state of who owns what relative to the underlying technological platform um so we've had this system that's pretty simple in the past where there's kind of ethi asset and eat the protocol there's Bitcoin the asset Bitcoin the protocol and it's always been pretty obvious and and simple that um there's value accrual to eth you know if people use ethereum um but that's mostly speculative right in a post eip1559 World transactional volumes more contract volume on ethereum does Drive value uh to the eth asset um but the vast majority of the value here is speculative in these assets um so what we're getting into is this very weird world where utility um and assets are sort of divorced and the one of the big reasons is Bridges so the ability to move you know protocol assets across chains with different utilities means that you can use um Bitcoin on ethereum you can use Bitcoin on Solana you can use eth on Solano um and so then you start to sort of get this divorce system where you no longer have the tech protocol and the protocol assets so neatly tied in and as these Bridge protocols proliferate I think it's going to become easier and easier and easier to move protocol assets across these different Utility Systems so then when you're thinking about this as an investor how do we think about value accrual um does use of an underlying system lead to Value accrual of the Native asset well ethereum for literally years has had way more use than Bitcoin way more transactional volume at this point you know it's it's hard to measure but with addresses there's way more active addresses and yep Bitcoin remains more valuable um than ethereum so just very simply saying wherever there's the most use you know that equals the most value I think is oversimplified um and in the system where you have so many underlying chains with very easy bridging of assets across them you know that question is actually a very deep and big one for uh crypto investors which is you know how much is use of a system and utility of a system tied up with value accrual to the underlying asset this is why I've always been very focused on you know how can we have the utility in these systems Drive value directly to the underlying asset and so these systems like polka dot pair chains that lock up dots based on the number of pair chains launched um you have a similar burning mechanism in the dfinity system as to the ethereum system you get to um a bunch of complicated questions about value accrual um the other broad belief I have is that um you know we talk a lot about layer twos um in crypto um but really I think all those layer two systems that are built say on top of ethereum broadly I think they'll end up integrating with other layer 1 blockchains I think most of them will end up launching their own native token and you'll quickly realize wait a second the the difference between a layer two on ethereum and and say Avalanche um is a lot less it's it's a lot smaller difference than I thought right it's really just Bridge ux um it's sort of the bridge experience is is very tightly integrated in a quote Layer Two but broadly I just view it as chains and bridges um I don't really view it as layer one layer two at the end of the day everything becomes its own um Sovereign system I mean you're even going to start seeing this with the they're really really large dapps on ethereum I think more and more they're going to start going to their own Sovereign chains and so then you just left with the system that's a massive number of underlying chains massive number of bridges um then it gets more complicated because you're going to have Bridge protocols right rather than having hundreds of these bespoke one-off bridges that are based on um you know broadly multi-sig right I think most bridges that some level are based on multi-sig um so it's it's still a security framework that is sort of a server security so like if you can hack the server you can hack the bridge um by contrast I think a lot of these bridging protocols that are trying to generalize the ability to bridge will have Economic Security and so the the security there isn't hack a server it's more like the equivalent of rolling back the Bitcoin blockchain which is a much stronger security posture so I think a lot of these Bridge protocols again they they start out as kind of a layer two for everything right or a bridge for everything but then over time you start to say well wait a second if everybody's using this bridge protocol to move assets across all these different chains why don't I just deploy my app straight to the bridge protocol right if it's kind of the meta system that's moving asset and application logic across the underlying systems so at the end of the day I think that what I'm trying to say is there's a lot of different sort of go to market paths so to speak with launching a a new Sovereign chain launching a layer two launching a bridge protocol at the end of the day though it just sort of feels like a whole bunch of different chains with assets fluidly moving across them and in that world like where's the value accrual and so that anyway that's that is I think the big macro question for crypto investors over the next maybe five years I want to get back to that question I want to actually hear your answer on in that world where is the value accrual like at least maybe it's uncertain at this point but like some different ways it could play out potentially in this scenario but I want to ask the question of uh you're talking about this world of it's all just um Bridges and chains basically one follow-up question I have or one may be pushback on that is like uh you were talking about the the ability to just move an asset from one chain to another but the reality is in moving that asset the um security a profile of the asset can drastically change right so I mean we saw that just this week with uh the hack of the Ronin side chain right where I don't know 173 000 if was just like yoinked uh because it was on another chain I guess bridged across to the Ronin side chain but the the security profile of the eth on the side chain was much less than the security profile of ether on ethereum of course we've also seen this with Solana and wormhole in the past and so there is this I guess counter idea that actually it's more than just Bridges and chains because when you port an asset from one chain to another you uh change the security profile of the chain and so they are these like zones of sovereignty and the idea behind layer twos and Roll-Ups is basically well you can kind of preserve a lot of the economic security of the asset when you move it from ethereum main chain to say a roll-up that's very closely tied to ethereum you preserve most of if not all of the security uh profile of that given asset do you buy into that at all that hey it's not it's more more than just chains and and bridges because we're actually needing to understand and address the security profile of these various assets when they cross those bridges to these different chains yeah I mean I totally agree that when the native asset moves around um it basically has a different value but I think that's essentially up to market makers to decide um and price in like you know if I move this Bitcoin to um ethereum you know is it worth 98 of a Bitcoin on the main chain um and so I do think it's it's basically going to be up to market makers to decide how to price in um the change in security posture um but yeah I agree with that absolutely that in and this is true by the way just of the assets themselves on the native chain um you know Bitcoin has a different sort of set of security properties than ethereum which has a different set of security properties than every other system so um I do think we're going to see that all priced in um but it it really mostly is a pricing thing um I I think at the end of the day for the average user sure they're not going to be in these siled worlds where um they're like well I need the Solana software to interact with the Solana apps and I need the ethereum software to interact with the ethereum apps and I need the ethereum asset to interact with ethereum apps I just think for the average user we're going to move to a more abstracted system where they're less siled they're less aware of the underlying infrastructure like I just want this nft I don't care which chain it lives on um and then the underlying application logic sort of handles the complexity under the hood and it all will come with different prices so I totally agree that it leads to different prices that the market makers will will decide um but you know I I think it mostly is a pricing change if you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative is trying to find the next

Twitter at maker Dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence in pursuit of answering these first two big questions which are which Chain's going to win the smart contract Wars and which one's going to win the crypto money War a lot of people uh use this mental model to understand the crypto industry as uh one some blockchains are about money and some blockchains are about technology uh like Bitcoin is certainly a blockchain about money right and maybe a technology blockchain might be something like a Terra Luna where uh you know it's it's they're not trying to make a new Sovereign store value because they're pegged to the dollar they're really trying to make something like a fintech platform how do you think about this spectrum uh and do you think that the winners of these chains are going to be optimized for money versus technology or do you think it's really going to be the change that can figure out how to do both foreign you know I mean I I think they're all the same like every asset is just uh an asset it's all just like kind of group think marketing branding to try to decide which one's money and which one's the technology it's um you know that said economic properties matter a lot um so you know there have been um interesting technologies that have fully flopped because they screwed up the economic system so I think a good example of this um was the the grin or mimblewimble launch of 2018 cool technology um really poor economic design like nobody could use it because of that um so it's not to say that um the economic design doesn't matter I think it matters a lot you've also seen a lot of systems in crypto that have uh actually really cool and Innovative economic design with very little else um you know they're not pretending to enable new applications or be really a new technology it's just like a really spiffy economic design and those often you know end up working pretty well um even though there's no kind of new tech so to speak um so broadly I mean I I think it's all just um it's all the same everything's trying to be valuable and um it it's all money sort of um I just think that it's the reality is it's just so new and such a new asset class our attempts to label all of these things as existing things we understand like money um is is again it's it's backwards looking like in the in the future um I don't think people like again this is a longer term future I think people won't view crypto so much through the lens of like comparing it to Fiat it's just like a completely new category um and it's it's really that all we've known growing up and everything is Fiat so we're sort of Trapped in that lens and try to say this is kind of like Fiat right but the reality is it's just a complete new thing um so I think the economic design matters a lot when it comes to Value accrual um and in crypto value accrual is very tied into functionality because the systems have to be valuable in order for the operations in the network to be secure right the entire system is based on economic security so the project of making the native asset valuable is a critical component of making the system usable and scalable how do you make the native asset valuable and maybe while you're answering that question let's pick up on that thread of uh in this world that you were just describing where does the value accrual happen where does the value pool and what happens if you extrapolate these things forward to like Bitcoin right now is the reigning monetary asset let's say in crypto if we're going to categorize things uh ether and ethereum the reigning smart contract uh platform right now with with ltus and alternative ones also uh dueling it out and battling out play this forward a little bit how do you think value accrual happens across all of these ecosystem players and all of these chains yeah I mean I'm trying to figure that out myself because I do think we're getting to a very um we are approaching a very confusing world where um there's so many different platforms with utility and so many different assets you know I I actually think a a um a Bitcoin maximalist so to speak argument I've never heard before but I think is relatively coherent is like there's going to be so many different systems with utility that there's really only going to be one asset with speculative value and that's most likely to be Bitcoin so it's sort of like the it's this weird bat where the more bullish you are on a bunch of different smart contract systems and a bunch of different device systems like the value accrual will all be Bitcoin right um Bitcoin the asset right so it's it's this that's like for example a very weird argument I think but I I think um it doesn't strike me as impossible that um you could have you know a system that has relatively small amount of on-chain activity still accruing way more value um than an alternative system with way more on-chain activity so I I think um I'm trying to figure it out too I think it's um it's complicated but the main thing is to realize you know I think we're going Way Beyond um this basic system where you know you just sort of see use so you speculate on the asset um which is I think the world we've lived in for for 10 years um it's more like okay there needs to be a value accrual system um where the more transactions and users there are in a system the more it directly derives value to that native asset outside of just speculation um which is why these systems like you know burning coins um per transaction I think is is so critical to build like a sustainable system in this new world so Olaf I want to get your kind of reaction reaction to this and bankless listeners will will know that uh both David and I are are um uh very ethereum bullish and and eth Bulls and and part of the reason we're eth Bulls is because we think a lot of the economics that you're talking about if you get past the specular value kind of um come to play in in ether as an asset and part of the reason we think so is like we pay very close attention to um like blockchain uh Revenue transaction fee revenue and ethereum is is Far and Away the leader in terms of the amount of transaction fee Revenue it generates you know right now it's like 20 uh 20 million or so per day I mean previously it's like 75 million per day but you look you scan the list of of competitors and you know uh the solanas and The Avalanches of the world are just doing a very small fraction of that at the same time they're issuing a lot in Supply as far as um uh block space for rewards right to their stakers and to their validators not so sort of thing and so if you look at sort of the supply the cost of issuance and then you look at the revenue you find that none of these chains are profitable ethereum included but then you get to a world of post the merge with ethereum where issuance Falls from like 4.5 percent to like in the in the negative territory potentially after burn and you start to get into some really interesting economics and value accrual for either the asset right and so that combined with like additional demand of of Layer Two feels like something like ether uh stands apart from the pack right so you got Bitcoin over here as a meme value narrative play monetary asset that's really cool and then you've got ethereum playing the game of like block space demand and utility and it's becoming like a productive asset and it's economics look really good but it's also under attack by these alternative layer ones who they don't have the economics down yet but they are starting to attract some usage and total value locked I guess my question is what do you think about ethereum in this world in the future like post merge it's got this list of competitors it's got Bitcoin on the other side it's kind of getting squeezed from both sides how do you think ethereum Fair years okay so there's a few things there so one is that um you know if you go back to how old a lot of these alternative systems are a lot of them are less than two years old right if you go back to um ethereum when it was very young um it probably was not accruing the sort of Revenue quote Revenue you're talking about really though when you say Revenue you just mean paying miners right like um so paying miners is not driving demand it's it's not actually accruing value to the underlying asset burning eth is accruing value to the underlying asset um the other thing is that frankly like the reason there's so much revenue is because people are having to pay a lot for transactions because um you know the the throughput is is so low relative to these alternative systems so I think like using that metric as something um I think it's a mixed bag it's showing there's substantial demand for Block space and ethereum um but at the same time like if we could you know 10x block space in ethereum safely um that number would drop precipitously even if but it might mean there's actually more users more applications um so it's it's kind of a weird metric I think to optimize around because it just shows that the system is at its scaling capacity in a way um and is you know relatively speaking very expensive to use um it does show that there's like a lot of it you know competition for Block space but these other systems are not having a lot of revenue for my miners through transaction fees because one they're more in the young bootstrapping phase which ethereum and Bitcoin went through as well um and you know they have more throughput so that there's really not the same kind of fees costs um you know paid to miners the other thing is that Revenue that goes to minors you know basically goes straight to the order book as a cell um effectively so it's it's you know Revenue to minors I don't think crops up the value of ether burned ether props up the value of ether in my mind um so what I do care about a lot is is ether burned through eip1559 I don't think that you know Revenue to minors is is a good case for for purchasing I will say value cruelties one thing about like post merge of course uh uh state steak ether it becomes not Revenue to minors but Revenue to validators who hold uh ether and are validating that ether and can be value accrual from that perspective but I agree with the revenue revenue to minors is is kind of a lost and sold but I think David you wanted to say something yeah uh leaning into the whole like ethereum makes a lot of Revenue because it has constrained block space right and uh one of the common denominators of uh the the blockchains that have Arisen in in the latter half of 2021 was that they all have super high throughput generally from uh reducing the total number of nodes count right like reduce the number of nodes that need to participate in the network you can push more transactions through the network so Olaf I'm wondering your position on uh just how important it is to preserve decentralization in some of these newer chains like we have this hyper decentralized Bitcoin uh we have this uh decently decentralized current version of of ethereum and hopefully this hyper decentralized future version of ethereum and then we have some of these newer alternative layer ones which really have achieved uh scalability and also sacrificed Revenue it to to use Ryan's frame of mind from a second ago uh to really just allow for more block space to be created so that their you know transactions are free how do you think about that that choice is that like a short-term choice or do you think that these things can these newer layer ones can maintain a compromised version of decentralization over the long term so I think decentralization um really the goal is security properties right and I think um it's very difficult to measure what those types of security properties might be I think every one of these systems makes trade-offs of one kind or another um to achieve security properties so you know broadly like number of nodes um I think matters I don't think it's like the single metric that everyone should be optimizing for um you know I I think it's just complicated like if you look at Bitcoin you know the number of mining pools that you have to add up to be over half the hash rate is not a ton um and you look in some of these alternative systems that you know don't use um a proof of work or a proof of stake type civil resistance you know then you have maybe a lot more people that have to add up to 51 but of course you don't have this um you know provable like civil civil resistance um in using a proof of work or proof stake type system so I just think that um the question of decentralization is a very complex one um and I think there's a big trade-off space and um I like that experiments are being run in that trade-off space I I don't think it's as simple as like a um you know just a spectrum from A to B and we're sort of moving along from really decentralized down to to less decentralized um I think that there's a whole bunch of trade-offs the other thing is I think it takes time um so Bitcoin you know when it was two years old I would argue was not a very decentralized system at all um it over time became extremely decentralized like Satoshi laughed and everything um I think ethereum similarly has become progressively way more decentralized over time um and a lot of that is social it's like who has the right to um kind of push a hard fork and everyone will opt into it I think over time it gets harder and harder and harder to hard Fork these systems um and I think you can view that as again depending on your perspective a feature or a bug I I think that it does take time though so Olaf tie this section off for us so what do you what do you think is more likely that we live more and more in kind of a multiple layer one type world or do you think it's more likely that the ethereum plus L2 Vision plays out and begins to uh claw back its market share so in a way does ethereum lose market share or does it uh gain market share in uh in in the future years um I mean I so as I said earlier I kind of think these alternative layer ones and the layer two systems are over time not going to look quite so different um I think one of them is effectively really neatly integrated into ethereum but once you have these layer two systems launch their own native token and start to think about integrating into other layer one systems it starts to once again be well wait a second why shouldn't I just deploy my app you know straight to this layer two maybe that's where where all the usefulness is and there's a native token there and everything so um you know I don't think it's as simple as every Layer Two is is um good you know is I just think that the difference between like an evm compatible chain with a really good bridge and um a layer two system is is not as as big um is as a lot of people think but at the same time you know broadly I do think um you know these layer two systems are absolutely necessary for ethereum like nobody can build low value apps on ethereum today um so yeah I mean it's so it's complicated I'm sorry that's a bit of anonymous no it's good I guess I guess the move here is like the strategy would be to bet on all the chains if that's the world that plays out you kind of have to have bets everywhere yep that's that's why we're polychain no problem yeah now from the beginning this has always been my um General thesis and I I don't think it's changed I think uh my conviction in that I think back in 2016 when I watched polychain that was not very well supported by evidence I think now that approach is way more supported by evidence um and even just in the investment performance I think it's been the best approach over the last five years Olaf about a year ago I was I think we were both at the coindesk consensus virtual conference and you were giving a talk and I was uh giving the talk after you and your talk was all about Dows and how it's going to change what it means to work uh and I was in The Green Room as you were giving your talk because I was up next listening to that and I was like wow this is brilliant and that was actually one of The Inspirations for an article that I wrote later on the bankless newsletter called Dallas and the future of work and so uh the next question that we have is can Dao's really scale but before I get to that question I'm wondering if you could you could just kind of summarize your thoughts on the future of Labor in the world when we live in a Dao enabled world how is this going to change what it means to work how is this going to change culture yeah so uh what I was talking about earlier with this concept of network mining where you can use block reward style mechanisms to incentivize lots of different types of human behavior not just like hashing or staking um but like playing a video game or executing some task or Tweeting or whatever it might be um I think there's this future world where a lot of work like just as a percentage of all labor it increases substantially the percent of people that basically work for a protocol right um on some level and it might not be like a a base um system like ethereum it might be an application with um its own logic but I think you know the number of people that are kind of working for a protocol I think will only expand um and I think that could be a surprising percentage of global labor if you look long enough into the future um especially if you think like many many different types of modern web applications could move to that model over the long term right um now the thing the question with Dows um and scaling them I really think that Dows just need to perfect governance and um Capital allocation I think if they can perfect um decision making around Capital allocation basically everything else falls into place I don't think that Dao's Should Be Imagined as operating businesses that are sort of scaling an operating team and like everyone's voting on each individual person's salary I think that's um not not the right envisioning I view it more like Dao as fund um where startups like get started to work for the Dow and then the Dow funds them and if they perform they get more funding and if they um you know start to fail the Dow can cut off funding Etc um so I think that Dao as kind of fund endow as capital allocator is the best way to imagine them scaling and I think it's just the best way to imagine Dao's functioning over the long term are there any Dows that really are emblematic of this philosophy of of scale Dows that are really just executing on on kind of the vision that you see for the future of Dallas anything that comes comes to mind now I actually wouldn't say that any Dows today like not nothing has is close to the platonic ideal um everyone is sort of working through it figuring it out um so you know I I think there's a lot of doubts making great progress but I think that we're gonna probably look back in a few years at the way we do it today as um relatively simplistic one of the things you said is uh you think that labor will end up working for many many more Dows than what people think today and I'm wondering if you can kind of just illustrate the patterns as to to that belief uh I I think um something to go on is something like successful Dows will find ways to just reduce the barriers to what it means to actually work for them just like like you said talking about like Tweeting or just doing these like you know very basic labors and a quote that Ryan always gives out is uh you got to give the protocol What It Wants right like uniswap wants liquidity uh you know compound wants deposits these future dowels are going to wants YouTube marketing cardano wants to do marketing uh like can you kind of illustrate how like one person might actually ultimately accidentally work for hundreds of dials if that's kind of what I'm getting at from what you're talking about yeah I mean um I think there'll there will be layers so let's say I start a startup to um improve the value of a dow and I start doing something um let's say something as simple as marketing just to give a basic example I'm running this whole marketing thing and the Dow's like you know what you're doing a good job um and we're going to Grant you a million dollars in seed funding to sort of expand um then I might hire somebody that has no idea or like doesn't really care about or know about the fact that the funding is like from a dow um so they you know technically work for this for-profit startup but really the the sort of capital behind the curtain um is a Dao um so I think you're going to see a lot of kind of trickle-down capital like that where not everybody necessarily realizes all the intricacies of how the capital got there um or is interfacing with the Dow but you know ultimately is is getting paid with money from the Dow Olaf our last question uh is is kind of talking not our last question the podcast but of the big questions that were on our mind um is is about crypto versus the nation state and uh I'm wondering if you see this as kind of a power struggle like will crypto come disrupt the nation state and will the nation-state be okay with that right from the early stages of crypto a lot of people in like you know 2012 2013 thought oh man the government's never going to allow Bitcoin to happen yet here we are with more institutional support than ever even even in some weird ways governmental support at least in some some Corners in some districts and we haven't seen many uh outright bands of crypto the nation state level so talk to us about this crypto and the nation states crypto going to disrupt the nation state are they going to coexist what's your take here yeah I mean there are um disruptive elements to crypto like it has to alter some of the logic um but I you know I don't think that crypto is like this singular thing that um will end the concept of nation states um however you know I do think that um crypto has the potential to divorce the concept of money and state in a way um you know we used to have church and state right as a tied up thing and eventually those kind of got divorced and they both coexisted we still have you know religion and and churches and we still have um the the state and the government so I think you're going to potentially see that sort of a you know the the inextricable link today between like Fiat money and the nation-state control of it I think you could see it be divorced I don't think that means that the state goes away um I do think like I said it Alters the logic though of how it all works there's a common Trope these days that people have lost trust in their institutions and I'm wondering if you are seeing me and Ryan definitely see this is like there's a Yin there's a uh equal and opposite force between crypto and the nation state where crypto certainly isn't coming to you know eliminate the nation state crypto will never fund like the police or the roads or all the things that we need to live our lives but also at the same time there seems to be some sort of like Poetic transformation from the decline of nation states people generally think that nation states are in a decline of relevancy which is happening at the same time of the rise of the relevance of cryptocurrency do you see kind of like this poetic balance or are these just two different things that are happening in different areas of the world I don't think it's a causal effect um today I mean I think it's just you know I just think the speed of technology and the speed of culture um is so fast now that it's outpacing the ability for the bureaucratic mechanisms of of the state to keep up um so I just think there's like a pacing speed problem where technology is moving too fast and related to that um you know I just think culture changes really fast um so beliefs individual beliefs or group beliefs about what's acceptable or what is um ethical or something like that is is evolving way more rapidly than like our legal system evolves um so I think that a lot of the feeling that the state is becoming sort of slow or incompetent or irrelevant or something um just stems from the fact that the rest of the world is moving at such a faster clip Olaf um I'm hoping you have some time for for a quick lightning round where we ask you some some questions overrated or underrated questions you have a few minutes for that uh sure awesome all right so how about this Bitcoin as an anti-inflation hedge going into the 2020s do you think that idea is overrated or underrated are underrated interesting eth as ultrasound money overrated or underrated underrated how about uh zkevn EVMS and some of the the ZK technology that's coming out these days overrated or underrated underrated oh boy I'm sensing a theme here all right alternative layer ones overrated or underrated underrated again how about how about I already know the answer to this nfts in their current state overrated or underrated and maybe focusing on in their current state in their current state overrated I'll give you guys one I'll give you guys one uh algorithmic stable coins overrated or underrated um underrated okay how about crypto hedge funds overrated or underrated overrated for sure okay that we're gonna have to take that one out of the lightning round why are crypto hedge funds overrated uh no I mean I'm um I'm I'm half joking but um you know I I think that um I like the concept of total democratized um Capital formation in crypto so you know I I like the structure of the kind of so-called Ico and group crowdfunding um I do think crypto has moved towards a system of of private fundraising and I would like to move towards a system that's a little bit more Open Access funding all right Olaf so let's uh let's kind of close this out and put all of these ideas together and give us kind of a synthesis so we you've been first to a lot of things and uh you talked to earlier how uh a lot of the things you refers to were actually obvious to you and it's because you were part of the one percent that was actually digging into these systems and and uh and figuring them out so I gotta ask the question what is obvious to you right now because we want to know what's obvious to to Olaf you've seen these things in advance what's obvious now um you know I I think um you know I I think one thing that feels inevitable is that a a crypto game that is really high quality and in itself is a really great game that grows really quickly combined with sort of crypto economic incentives um I think something like that is going to grow just about faster than anything in the world like faster than anything has ever grown um that feels like it's just going to happen is this like an axi or something different than this then yeah it's kind of it's you know it's it's taking uh some lessons from axi which are you know economic design features um it's refining those economic designs and it's layering on top you know a substantially more sticky game experience you've also survived in crypto for a long time Olaf any keys or insights for people who maybe this is their first cycle uh they haven't been in crypto for a while what does it take to survive in crypto for a decade I just stopped trading and start reading um and like using software I I there's just a lot of talk of um trading in crypto and when you're in a macro category that you believe is going to compound rapidly over the next set of years um I think it's very odd to try to outperform that by active trading rather than just by uh buying and holding I think everyone on that on this call can agree that that's probably the best move uh just because you're in crypto does not mean you're a Trader absolutely Olaf thanks for all the insights man this has been really fun to talk uh with you and and pick your brain on all of these important issues we uh we appreciate it yeah thanks for all the good questions guys and and the great conversation uh it's been a pleasure awesome guys we will include a link to find out more about polychain and uh Olaf of course we gotta conclude with this none of this has been Financial advice nothing like Financial advice whatsoever of course all crypto is risky Bitcoin ether alt later ones D5 it's all risky you could definitely
