welcome everyone to top signal the crypto show that brings you the same guests and personalities you know from the podcast you listen to and the videos you watch but instead of news information and analysis top signal is entertainment comedy and live ship hosting keeping up with crypto is work and top signal is not that the only rule that we have at top signal is that there is no fact checking everything you hear on this show by the hosts or the guests is in a superposition of a ship post psyops a factual statement and possibly the world's greatest alpha we won't know because we don't check

pleasure to be here a pleasure to be here it's been a dream come true to get on this uh this beautiful podcast so it's prestigious uh prestigious it's very excellent institution isn't up only no we're wrong but we already made that joke last week yeah my calendar it set up only yeah this is the walmart version of up only and we're happy you're here um hey i think we should dive right in dave i think we should take it away let's just freaking do it today's first game folks because as you know if you don't know in fact top signal is a variety show it's a crypto comedy variety show we're going to be doing different things with different people every episode we got the fire eyes guys on um and the first game we're gonna play today is the gangplays rsa or koopa so from the bankless side everybody is obviously familiar with our our dude rsa uh ryan sean adams um and we love the way he tweets right no no no rsa twitter no bank list probably and uh you know name your favorite meme of rsa so also on the other side on the millennial side because obviously ryan sean adams is a boomer on the millennial side we got koopa who is also given similar platitudes you go to these guys as twitter's for positivity for for excitement bullishness and just good outcomes right now as i was going through the twitters i was like well which one so that's the game now right which is which um all right so together we're gonna look at some tweets we're gonna deliberate together as a team on what we think it is on who's it is uh if you know cooper's gonna know i think on some of his tweets at least i hope um you know you can make a case for that if you want let's have fun do your thing we're gonna guess if it's rsa or koopa let's begin how long until we see a dow acquire another dow how long until we see a dao acquire another dao and as you see on the bottom ribbon there 15 retweets eight eight quote retweets 260 likes this could be either of them you know what i'm saying this could be this could be let's hear some takes yeah go ahead james what are you talking about what's coming to mind see generally off the bat i would have gone cooper trooper but actually it was two days ago and i saw the tweet so i i have a sneaking suspicion it might not have been cooper trooper that's fair he's just that's good evidence he said he saw the tweet do you have anything there's a little wrench wrench in the planes now doesn't it you could have held that one too but hey no that's a ryan shot adam's three so we're gonna give a point i'm gonna go ahead and give a fake point yeah if you're hearing points you're hearing bells no we're we're telling those babies up they don't mean [ __ ] but we're i'm look i got the mont blanc ready to go i'm i'm telling these up on my little legal pad i'm about to start playing if we got points at stake here about the yeah michael michael you need to uh share your screen because you can uh while it's not broadcasting to the youtube uh the people in the call can see the next tweet that's coming so what do i need to do yeah hit hit present yeah there you go i'll reformat it there we go all right super okay here we go there is there's basically there's so much basically free money in defy if you know where to look this one similar similar ribbon there right 13 retweets two quote retweets uh and 272 likes um coming in may 17th so we got we got some time yeah yeah maybe maybe james wasn't a degenerate twitter scroller and didn't see this one in recent memory um what are we thinking boys see i feel like see this is a problem because i know it's cooper i remember any time like basically basically yeah you know that's coop that's your boy wow okay ryan doesn't do the stars ryan doesn't do the stars yeah ryan's a problem tomorrow's gonna do a tweet with stars this is how we can find cooper's uh aenon account too just look for the stars all right let's let's do this one we often overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do in 10 well we can intend play the long game and you will always win if you have if you've seen this tweet before um don't say it but we often overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do in 10 play long game and you will always win right one of these positive fellows uttered this tweet see i think all this all this game is showing me is that the ovaries like the only thing i'm overestimating is the amount of time i'm spending like looking at cooper's tweets like literally 100 all right what's the answer callum well no no hold on column dude yeah yeah the hella quiet over there bro yeah what's going on dude so i'm gonna say there's a lot of like kind of forward-looking positivity here uh and that's something i really associate with my boy cooper trooper so i'm locking that in yeah i know your boy and you happen to know your boy all right there we go you guys are friends aren't you yeah [Music] all right i think we got another one oh yeah who's coming to crypto everyone oh i don't know i could see something like crypto everyone only 170 likes though didn't really didn't do so well not not something uh someone with 100k followers would get you know you think vancouver how many followers do you have uh enough enough oh i think it's late it's a bit of a little you never have another right all his friends are down to check for you you don't want to say i'll check for you any guesses who's taking a guess on this one i'm gonna i'm gonna go rsa i guess i'm going rsa because it's very broadly bullish [Laughter] rsa nice pick we're gonna give james a point lucas the point okay this is this is a good one the smartest people in crypto are all building crypto projects or integrations you do the math on what comes next you do the math yeah you do them that comes next you do the math i think the formula here is if it's broadly bullish it's ryan if it's extremely positive and outgoing it's cooper so i'm gonna go with ryan here following the formula nasty i don't know i'd say i'm going to say cooper on this one lucas i'm abstain i'm abstain i know the answer to this one again it's just another depressingly uh lucas said ryan he's wrong and he's wrong sweet bro loki nice calories nice pig this this one was a curveball though this definitely could have been ryan all right let's lock this one up last one this is the numbers too look at this february february of 2020 we had to crawl for this one one billion dollars locked up in d5 is a pretty cool milestone to see fire emoji see at this point you know people like ryan and cooper who tweet every single day they have nothing i bet you cooper doesn't even know who who this is ryan cooper does have a does have a fire emoji so that like tends towards cooper but i think he's a pretty cool uh pretty cool to see or pretty cool milestone that's like a boomer state you know i don't think cooper's saying pretty cool so i'm gonna lock in rsa for this i'm not actually sure yeah i'm not i'm not sure if cooper had the reach to get eleven hundred likes in february twenty twenty i'm just putting it out the door i'm gonna put it out ryan yep yep rsa i ain't getting a thousand likes from a generalized tweet like that [Laughter] hey well we we did it nice job uh yeah it looks like james you're gonna you're gonna take the round on that one dude nice job nice and quick because i couldn't even play the game it doesn't mean anything but yeah sorry cooper [Music] okay we're moving on um that was a good time thanks cooper for letting us use your tweets uh that was fun for us with no consent i appreciate it guys zero consent zero fact checking um now the gang plays code words um dave why don't you uh help us learn a little bit about what's going on with this game all right this is where we divide you guys up into two teams we got cooper and lucas paired up we got the the american boys and then we got the callum and james the the aussie new zealand boys paired up uh and so this is how this is gonna work we have a list of words ready to go uh and and one of you is going to be past the word the people watching the youtube will notice that you can now see the zoom chat being streamed on the screen and i'm going to uh one of these two team members are going to pick amongst themselves who is going to be the person guessing the word and the the other teammate will be the one trying to get the person to guess the word but you cannot actually use the word that you are trying to get them to guess make sense get it yep all right uh so american boys cooper and lucas who wants to deliver the word and who wants to guess the word um you got a preference i don't even understand the rules here but go for it it's just like it's like [ __ ] yeah so i'm gonna so i'm gonna i guess i'm gonna give cooper the word and he's gonna have a word he's gonna have to get you to say the word without actually telling you what the word is right okay so you're gonna be guessing the word all right so cooper's delivering uh james callum who's going to be delivering the word who's going to be guessing the word what do you think callum i'm thinking i deliver you guess yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay all right we'll do it we're [ __ ] all right well since since the hosts are in america uh we are going to allow the americans to go first uh and so cooper i'm going to dm you in zoom here the word and here it comes uh right now put a timer on this uh yeah okay oh and sorry very important how long so uh 30 seconds to guess as many words as possible so as soon as you get as soon as lucas guesses the word i'm going to send you another word you ready yeah wait do i do i need to get a timer set up here yeah mike you need to get a timer set up you ready okay hold on hold on hold the horses i got time no no we got this to our advantage rip it let's see i got a timer oh no dave um choose your phone use your phone i'm gonna do this it's okay okay so i'm

until advice probably yeah all right guys so that was the first half of the show in the second half of the show we got some patriot games what the hell is that coming up next and we got some around the horns for some topics going around in the crypto space want to get everyone's takes on them but first before we get there sponsors rugpole alcamix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stablecoin into the alchemix vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcemix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alcomix.fi that's dot a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x-f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomixfi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets i love alcomix man i just love in xerox gotta love them oh we're back hey welcome everybody welcome everybody excuse me just you know things i talk about in my free time um welcome back to the show if you're back if you're if you're in the restroom flush it up wipe it up we're back [Music] and hey i want to talk about this new game we're playing called patriot games um we got we got a global show everybody that's what i promised you i promised hard hitting hard hitters um and we brought the folks from new zealand to chat and i'm interested you know we got james and callum here um either of you can comment first like what's what's the vibe of d5 like in crypto what's the vibe down in new zealand right now you want to take that calendar um yeah yeah so i mean there's me and there's james um and then there are like a few kind of undercover people who maybe sit on their computer and like play with defy uh and then that's basically what we have a 30 person meet up in christchurch every month talk about d5 it's awesome but it's very low key okay so there's no access to like bank unbanked the indigenous or anything like no [ __ ] do you think new zealand works you think it's just i know indigenous people are new zealand we got we got no infrastructure it's only like we got like little straw huts that's it you guys are good with the back seats and stuff so yeah i don't know what you guys are capable of now well hey what you know i'm just curious um do you guys i think we know you guys probably know a lot more about the united states than we do about new zealand um like let's start here like what what what are the makeup of your guys is like uh do you have states provinces like yeah what's the situation there it's all governed like collectively as new zealand and it's sort of i mean i guess like local governments brought yeah just just lots of hearts basically i mean local government's broken into like smaller subsets but it's all governed in the same way and you guys live in which which subset would you say christchurch which is in the second okay and that's that's in what area this is going to be helpful in the moment uh so so new zealand's like this as a place and there's like all three of them here wellington in the middle and then christchurch down here so i'm like this town cooper is you guys paying attention to that yeah because this is the game the game is called patriot games folks um and the first thing we're gonna do is have uh let's have uh calum and james here play this game where they're going to try and guess and and as many as we're going to do a minute here oh [ __ ] [Laughter] but callum might be good at this yeah all right let's begin okay and you're gonna go for about a minute we're gonna do the same thing

pitch it this isn't a quiz you got it you gotta pitch it yeah i mean uh first out i do coordinate distribution and social token community ended up paying the core team out of proposal first which was great no pre-allocation no pre-mine um first major media dao i would argue and first to be doing critical politician work as a dow coming soon tm all right wow yeah we don't have the obs to support the fact that to show you i just gave him like four or five points right there like you guys know why he he knew what to say all right let's see uh lucas what do you guys say brother i was planning on saying bankless dial too um but i'll just i'll cop out and this number two is fire eyes down uh you know phenomenal projects industry-leading projects uh including git coin balancer avi um you know we're active governance participants across the ecosystem and you know i think we're really engaged [Music] uh i think i'll do like i guess um and yeah i mean maybe not mean i could have wishes but maybe both i think mira cartel started the dow revolution you know i mean moloch kicked it off and then metacartel made it into god mode um and sort of coordinated a bunch of people you know it's doing pretty chill stuff now but i think it certainly laid the foundations for everything that certainly we do but i think also like the wider device basically and there's a bunch of cool people inside of it and we give away money if you want to grant come to me to cartel nice nice nice free money's dope callum what do you think who else which dow has the best community dude all right i'm saying index kirk index co-op um built from the ground up built an incredible a bunch of incredible products that a bunch of people use have been really been first on experimenting with actually paying people to do work for the dow and their forum and their discord and just all of their chats and calls are great and it's not like you know completely grassroots ground up no top-down governments index code david writing it out for us all right just gonna press the dinger button over and over and over again my answer is maker dao what other dao can you even think of other than dao's maker dao started off the whole revolution of having on-chain applications governed by a community of stakeholders while it did have the foundation it also started off with the mkr governance token so it had mkr governance from day one so that's really really important so they committed to decentralization from get-go before dalls were even a dow uh maker dow was maker dow and it has an insane amount of on-chain cash flows on chain cash flows and so make your doubt hey so does this bankruptcy things in the chat i just want to say yeah bank was now got money coming in if you're in the dow you know what's good yeah thank you for the i think you're doing scoopa koopa um all right let's uh let's tally that up i got um i got cooper doing that one of course cooper got that one what no way yeah cooper had to get that one you gotta get that one one point each to the americans too that's not true all right um yeah nice job today but i like that comment but cooper gets another point so cooper's got two cooper definitely not one out on on us i'm feeling like there's something breaked a little bit yeah perfectly fair great game great host thank you yeah all right i think you guys saw the next one uh we have a lot of these to go through so which nfcs go reverse order reverse yeah let's go let's start with uh yeah one uh david you go last again but let's go calum right um i'm going to say board apes right now i think you know started off as like a generative nft meme but then you know people rallied around it they have merch they have you know shoes they have like additional nfts that are built off of those nfts um i think that's one that's like you know started off as a generative meme but it's actually built into a real community for that and a really sophisticated art style and i think when they came up with the eight board and the that bathroom situation when everybody was crowding around i think that was really cool too at the outset uh and also that it was cheap right that they were cheap when they came out point zero eight was cheap back then for people and a lot of people got to be able to be part of it great james what do you think uh i'm gonna do crypto kitties i think i think that was like my first i mean you know it was obviously after crypto punks but i think it was very very early on the pace and got a bunch of people excited about it i certainly was like a degenerate cat reader and and bred like hundreds and hundreds of crypto kitties uh and i think it's sort of like you know built the foundation for people being hyped up i mean maybe built flow as well which is least cool uh but also built up that if there's we don't like flow here yeah yeah you got zero points get [ __ ] up i miss a buzzer he he definitely got he definitely got a buzzer that i've being that i got a lot of points for yeah column has a lot of points on my little legal pad why would we go to lucas next uh what do you think which nfc has the best community um i'm gonna go to like the new rising star and say cool cats um i think they took like a really uh like authentic approach to like the artist i believe is like super involved and just taking a very authentic legitimate approach to like creating an nfp community and it's being uh reciprocated by the market right now so it's pumping their bags it's unbelievable and william gave us yeah i got him so cool cats super sick you got hella points for that lucas uh uh let's go to cooper on this one all right i'm gonna say axe infinity you're getting a third world people paid to play video games online you have multi levels of nfts you got land you got monsters you couldn't earn in-game and sell them on unit swap um highest protocol fees in any crypto project right now i think it's setting the stage for the next chapter of crypto and gaming in general which is fantastic i would say that look in their discord it's a fantastic community it's more about the people playing than it is the axes themselves and so all around i'm gonna have to go with axiomfinity wow and they're filipino i'm filipino as well thank you for shouting them out love to hear it that was a strong one david i think i think i want to abstain from this one as i got all of my all of my selections right from me you have anything to say about punks bro crypto punks i don't have one yet so i'm still waiting for those prices to come down yeah good luck i was thinking manufacturing factory would have been a good one i was also thinking they're down because they don't have that's how they launched because they sold an eft and a jacket um and that's how the initial tokens were distributed the more you know right now let's go ahead and uh i just got to go to cooper let's go unfortunately unfortunately it's cooper one more one as well i think americans get another point for being uh american oh that's so nice of you that's true that makes sense yeah that's like the longest okay i'm not gonna say no to that i like that very generously thanks thank you for paying your taxes to america all right confirmed stable coin firm circle goes uh public after uh or via stack merger you know usdc the stable coin we all have grown to love um we don't have to go around the horn whoever has an opinion here first can go um and just let me know which one okay uh get it i mean i think it's like good for institutional adoption of the space i think it's bad for the fact that uscc will probably be more open to regulation or regulatory capture um so yeah hopefully we can move to more decentralized stable coins asap that's right the conversation around decentralized stablecoins has really picked up lately um as as we know you can't really peg a die to ether you also you lose the peg and if you want to fix the peg you've got to peg it to usdc so it's just a wrapper for usdc so that makes me just really bullish on rye in general yeah that's my take plus one and i think like i reckon like non-picked assets too i reckon like and that's conversation happening in private like peaking to like a basket of stocks and house prices and gold and you know that being the pig where the pig itself actually moves like using one dollar unit is only because we're all [ __ ] and we need to like we'd like an easy number totally totally yeah it was actually um [Music] i was gonna say i think that this is a pretty on brand right now i think like coinbase kind of like uh blaze that trail and all these crypto companies that are very institutional focus are cashing in i think block five is about to has been like setting up for their ipo circle's another one i think gemini's kind of had some early discussion so i think like a lot of crypto companies that are more institutional more like billion you know in the billions right now are gonna definitely go public one way or another alright guys anybody else james you wanna you wanna chime in yeah i mean i think overall interesting um stable centralized stable coins do not excite me at all uh big ipos congrats i guess hopefully that the hopefully some of the coinbase the employees actually got shares and they don't just get like wrecked bought a a slightly more generous view here i think that usdc is the way that we get retail into d5 and i think that things like compound and coinbase with their fixed lending products are only going to be possible if we have the adoption of usdc so overall i think this is a good move for the space generally and i hope over time we can make it a little bit more decentralized in practice yeah here's a company who's going public and their entire freaking existence is based on ethereum so i think other people in this space should be able to take a look at that and open their eyes so excellent um you know what dave i really liked your i really like your take but i'm going to give that to lucas on this one um you're also going to get a point too so and then i think just just to vote i think cooper should probably get one too yeah nobody hears about retail adoption all right no one carrying point six seven just scores off sorry james oh man i'm coming i mean i guess that's from earlier right i [ __ ] up of time to get your [ __ ] back here there's it james um who is the biggest hero wow in crypto who is the biggest hero in crypto uh let's see whoever wants to go first who if you have an idea i'm gonna set the clock when you start who's the biggest hero in crypto this is where hey this is where the passion picks right the passion picks are here to bear you some points okay because i'm gonna do um i'm gonna do shout out to peter pan i think peter pan who started meta cartel and and hasn't inspired and brought up a lot of people i think certainly myself and then you know sort of fire eyes and coop and the rest of us through that process like peter has built a lot of [ __ ] cool [ __ ] um and much much love to him hopefully i'm allowed to swear i don't know mm-hmm oh yeah a lot of things peter pan is the guy that wrote the uh before bitcoin series which uh woke up everyone up to the uh cypherpunk movement a little a little bit more now that we didn't know about the cyberpunk movement but really illuminated it and actually resulted in one of the merch drops out of bankless dow the cypherpunk t-shirt nice can i go next yes please my crypto hero is patricia werthwaller from poep i think there's someone that made a name for himself in a space coming from a um more underdeveloped country you know having been able to be successful anywhere in the world and then taking that success and putting it into a public good for the ethereum ecosystem is literally the most following thing that you can do so i'm going to go with worthwhile as my crypto hero wow wow from po-op you said right yes sir sleeper dude all right who's next you met him in real life uh mike just fun fact you've met the you've met this man patricia bro yeah where in new york in new york consensus 2019 at the d5 event i you listen dude thank you patricio come come say what's up your cryptic person of the year bro like i'm happy i met you man how about you saw me dude [Laughter] who's next oh i'll go yeah obviously i'm gonna say griff green because firstly he led the saving of the entire ethereum space when the dow hack happened um and then after that he just kind of pushed forward on like the most pure like uh awesome things in the space never got caught up on like you know making money or making [ __ ] coins um and it's just also like the nicest guy in the world um so yeah rough green griff green nice [ __ ] nice pick i'm gonna go with uh sam cz sun the amount of rug pulls that he's prevented over the past few years is probably north of billions hundreds of millions probably so that did have saved us all probably some money at some point so um thank you sam i can see the rest of my time thank you sam yeah dave i think that leaves you oh gosh my the biggest hero i think in crypto's got to be amin soleimani the guy knows what's up he knows that this uh whole entire story was about coordination to begin with taught me i feel like almost everything i know about crypto at large and he's willing to stick up for things that he believes in he had a personal brand he had a personal uh you know commitment to ethereum and then he decided to burn that for some reason because he wanted to commit to positive sex positive work and so he killed his reputation in on purpose just lit on fire because he doesn't give a [ __ ] i think that's pretty cool um takes a big ball to really make that move happen uh and and also if you keep on searching on twitter and you go really uh deep down the amine rabbit hole you can you can see him uh [ __ ] a porn star if you really want you can literally see his big bowl you can literally see them uh and so do like some basic search searching that's a very basic exercise yeah so i won't really say that's why he's my biggest hero uh but that is a fun fact about i mean cool so it was all about means dick for david that's that's that's what the legacy of that was gonna be for everybody um good okay i think i'm gonna have to give that one to james oh you feel bad for the points now huh that's the end of the show well worried about the point james you picked you picked peter pan right yeah yeah yeah just so i could just so i could show the cypher funk uh dropping bankless down once more on the show um you know we hearken back to the peter pan thing and that so thanks again james everybody's going to get points here is going to hate you not only do you not remember if you don't give them points either oh did you get points you got pushed with that yeah the points too yeah wait where do the american points come in the american points true okay away oh oh damn you're right you're right you're right you're right michael come on slipping guys guys guys guys guys oh no you're right this accounting is all over the place i'm not i'm anti-quants i'm anticipating my school don't get the don't get this mixed up i can't count um all right to pair with the hero who's the biggest villain in crypto who's the biggest villain in crypto right now think about your hero who's the who's the villain um we're gonna go ahead and start with david uh i'm gonna go with uh sam bankman freed the guy is straight up called bankman his last name is bankman first off he likes putting his name all over not his name but ftx count the same all over buildings like who's the last person that we saw that likes to put his names on buildings hmm uh oh and just like you know made a bunch of money with centralized exchanges just not at all bankless uh you know it doesn't it's supporting solana doesn't really care about defy like the guy the guy's a villain through and through i don't know why he doesn't have an eye patch as a guy who needs an eye patch i'll add the context that he's planning on donating all of his wealth i'll believe it when i see it all right i believe it we'll see yeah okay uh controversial question lucas who is it dude who's the biggest villain these days craig wright probably i think that's like a natural answer he's uh easy one yeah he's kind of a [ __ ] so i don't feel like i don't really need to explain myself on this he yields his time again okay cooper who is uh who's the biggest villain in crypto these days biggest villain is no one we are all in this together [Music] [Laughter] have you never been rug pulled before cooper oh never in my life yeah there you go that's why cooper's happy when he gets rustled he's like you know man they really needed them i'm so happy other people could get money like that's all i want exactly right okay uh james or callum who's the biggest villain i'm about to not answer this question i'm about to answer this question honestly and be offensive uh my my meme answer can be uh the other james war so there's another james moore and crypto with the exact same name he's my personal villain he's my person he's a cool dude he's a nice dude but you know bad portraiture yeah he must be good-looking yeah exactly exactly i've met him in real life actually i actually haven't met you in real life but i have met him in real life oh oh so you're saying that i'm not well one was on top signal only one was on top all right uh who's the real answer we need to hear it we need to hear it this is the this is why people come to top signal they want to hear what james has to say about the book okay i'll give a good one though what about blockchain brad blockchain brad he's called out the boys he called out the uh a bunch of the team no i'm not about it i'm not about blockchain no we i don't know wait that's how you say it right that is the right name yeah that's the guy yeah yeah yeah yeah dude dislover i'm not a fan blockchain brad um all right callum right i'm gonna say charles hoskinson right because he's been lying from me about cardano being good and having smart contracts for [ __ ] five years right plus every time i meet someone who's like brand new to crypto at like a meet up or like anywhere all they have to say is like bro have you heard about cardano have you bought cardano blah blah blah blah um so i think he's hoodworking a lot of people into pumping his like low-tier [ __ ] coin so yeah chinese farmers what is with this incremental point-giving dude it just doesn't matter that's the point it doesn't matter but that's what we have this is this is the layup of after after crypto heroes and villains i appreciate the answer for charles hawkinson because yeah especially this bull market is a good one go ahead dave why don't you lay this one up for us yeah oh i got this one this article came out today uh on on coin telegraph saying chris black's combative approach inspired a uniswap proposal to raise 50 million dollars to bribe him to leave d5 forever until the money comes through however he'll continue his mission of bringing transparency to to defy by annoying devs with difficult questions so i think the question to the group is chris blech hero or villain and i think we should uh start with lucas hero but he i i already said this but hiro but he comes off like a prick i don't know he just needs to he needs to work on his approach he needs to really work i think he's trying to like he has good intentions but people don't like how he approaches things with those intentions so james chris blech i'm gonna be mean i'm gonna say like straight villain i'm gonna say you know like has sold has sold paid courses you know it tries to like purposely make money off the fact that he can be you know like annoying like create drama and i think like you know totally some of the points are really valid but if you do it in that kind of way i'm a class you as a villain yeah chris black hero villain um yeah like probably mild villain i just don't think i i think you know he has some good points but i don't think he adds much i don't think he adds more value to the space than he like creates in drama and problems fair enough cooper how positive are you about to be right now here we go come here let's go let's hear it in the chat let's hear it i must say the early interviews with d5 founders are actually very informative that's some of the first places i learned about balancer um a couple other defy summer projects so there is a string there i have really good content i know that it comes from a good place wanting to do safety and security so while it does come across contentious sometimes i think that it does have a good uh intent in mind and so for that i'm going to say corrupted hero a reluctant man he can't say anything negative what do you think dave oh god i think i i'd like to judge people by their intentions and i don't see chris blech's intentions as backing up what he is actually doing so he does things and while those things are positive perhaps allegedly his intentions are not positive his intentions are are negative trying to drum up a bunch of drama to support him his own brand and his own ego so therefore villain there's a spectrum here right spectrum between heroes and villains um we respect what chris has done um but i think those are pretty fair assessments of the situation today we also just talk about the fact that coin telegraph picked up this story and published it uh yeah yeah what the [ __ ] yeah yeah bear market [ __ ] bear margin [ __ ] hey also top signal picked it up look at that [Laughter] uh oh yeah uh the if you if you want to throw some comments in here we're gonna uh peter this out but uh the bogdanov twins bot eath the pump it dump it guys anybody have a hot dog on this one oh yeah who are these people who the [ __ ] are these freaks i think that my favorite comment was they actually exist and i thought that was the yeah uh commented me too i had no idea but apparently they're important to some looks like uh no i'm not even gonna guess oh that looks french okay well there you go oh maybe alex your friends okay how many more do we have here uh no let's let's get to let's skip to mine let's get to mine uh mike yeah this one right yes what token are you emotionally attached to what defy token are you emotionally attached to if you really want to give an nft answer this is the one guys this is the last one this one's for all the points those are all the points every one [ __ ] point here uh we're gonna pick a winner here okay so uh who wants to go first what token are you emotionally attached to everyone take a moment to think wow that's a tough one if you want to start talking go and start talking otherwise i'm just going to pick yeah i mean i can probably start i think i'll have to go ave i think you know from like the ethereum days i was like clicking on the buttons trying to lean east and really broken ui um the the ico was directly after crypto kitty started trading and so crypto kitties made bank and then you could put it or not vice versa maybe uh ethene came out and then i bought a bunch of crypto kitties with it giant [ __ ] mistake but i think uh have a [ __ ] lit and the team are cool and they're doing the right things emotionally attached you can only say ave if you actually owned it as east land so exactly yeah exactly yeah point point there right there okay let's go american next lucas um defy token i'll probably go index co-op so the index token um i just think the way that they did it is like very community driven community oriented and i just have to respect like what they've built over the past i think like six to nine months um they've done an incredible job for bootstrapping the community and like building d5 products in a decentralized uh manner so shout out to index co-op um your time make sure to buy the bed index which is coming out soon from the index co-op mm-hmm oh yeah that's in the bank of the banquet nice job all right let's go to james on this one oh sorry callum calm all right uh i'll stray like slightly not defy and say get coin because get coin you know had for the longest time didn't have a token had no intentions of you know creating a token um but i think it's the most ideologically aligned project and token with ethereum and i would have said but i think that would have got a you know yeah he's not a token he's not in tokyo yeah exactly exactly right yeah pretty good for fire eyes you know is how do you go from uh not quite being ready for a token to launching a token you know you put a fire eyes in the middle and then you're here do i give him the buzzer or the ding for that one [Laughter] all right cooper do you want to round it out or you want to let dave uh go first well i was actually going to say ethan then i got told that i'm not allowed to use that answer you can specifically we though so then then it means you can't you can't burn it and you can't stake it yeah so wheat i love uh wrapping it to bid on nfts it's fantastic great token no i was going to say because i owe my whole career to ether i owe my whole you know community and everything that i built to that ecosystem so i have no tattoos and if i would ever get a tattoo in my life it would be ethereum logo so that's definitely my emotional attachment to it i can definitely resonate with that i've never will never ever get a tattoo except for maybe the ether logo either on my back or on my ass one of the two yeah nice one on the ass he's two on the shoulder that's funny uh dude the token i am emotionally attached to oh gosh it's either gonna be rocket pool or maker dow i'm gonna go with rocket pool rocket pool because uh like like james says uh it was it's a a line it's in a token that's aligned with ethereum itself it fits the bill for decentralization permissionless of access permissionless of participation uh and it's very very very deep down in the protocol sync and it's a part of the ethereum it's in the app layer rocketpool's in the app layer but it's an app layer that benefits the ethereum protocol itself and so it's an app that the ethereum protocol uses itself to promote its own decentralization and security so i kind of consider rpl like a little satellite token that's orbiting around ether which is my other favorite asset uh and so rpl emotional attachment yeah pump my bags i'm into it another another what do we get like three of five fire eyes tokens hmm yeah yeah it's pretty good fire eyes just worked with everything no one said dank like yeah too easy too easy yeah i didn't get to make a comment but um polygon matic i'm very emotionally attached to i think it as a token i think it showed people what like hey we need to pay attention to layer twos right now and also here's what could happen if we all moved over to layer two on ethereum there's a lot of layer two just a chain owned sixty-five century i hit the post oh my the more you see my hylo is about to jump into this [ __ ] zoom and tell you what you better you're just you're about to summon me bro michael i see what you're doing all you're doing right now is pumping ryan's advisor back that is literally all you're doing he gave me one stipulation as being a host on his show on his on his platform and that was to pump his bags so uh yeah remember nothing on top signals fact-checked all right that one dude listen as much as i as much as i pretty damn sure cooper won that i i do really want to give this game to james um i was really happy i was complaining about it so now you're gonna you can try to give me some points back yeah you need to have some self-confidence it has nothing to do with pity if james is getting all the points it's going to have to come from calum so callum's going to have to go to zero but james can have five yeah there we go can we take it off those those dodgy american points that have been slipped i don't know what you're talking about right no dodgy points the american points just got added all right well uh james uh as our winner you're gonna get uh you can get 30 seconds to talk about whatever the [ __ ] you want go ahead oh okay okay wait wait dave can you can you get dave can you spotlight him he's pinned he's james is pinned okay go ahead uh i'm gonna talk about governance for 30 seconds i guess then uh and just like governance in general across protocols i think you know two years ago we learned about the term governance token we made infinite of them um and now it's actually about like executing on that and how like different communities you know firearms is obviously one community but thinking about you know we talked about the idea of like fire spawn or whether it be other you know communities that are popping up the more and more people that engage in this governance process you know this is what's going to make it open and transparent and really [ __ ] efficient is by more and more people getting involved and participating and actually like you know the upside of liquidity mining is 100 million dollars per week the upside of governance should be 100 million per week as well in my opinion and so i'm excited to see like more shitloads of money flow into the hands people participating in these things two points because you used uh two swear words right there wow nice that was good that was good um good job everybody hey another tops in the week in the books before we before we wrap this up uh we have a question from drostday um in the dao to koopa um well yeah he says how about guesses on how koopa troopa got his handle i bet a lot of the audience doesn't know including me koopa troopa it sounds like cooper sorry i'm starting there yeah and yeah was my dj name in college i used to play dj sets all the time i have a soundcloud account called koopa troopa that i'd upload all my mixes to and so we just ran with it you know from dj turned uh twitter influencer we're gonna run wow that's dope okay well there you go now you know he got his free game no matter what anyway somehow somehow koopa got his free game to shield his soundcloud literally uh and that's great all right and i think if uh the last slide is that then that's it awesome guys thank you for joining us on top signal the only crypto comedy show uh that you guys know and love so this was
