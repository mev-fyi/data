is ethereum good for the world and how will the world change or hopefully improve because of ethereum's existence I kind of just see it as a really nice platform that allows people to build apps that can interact with each other I think I have to admit the defy space where you have all these little pieces of puzzle and they somehow just assemble into this huge yarn ball and it doesn't collapse that's amazing and I think this is what this technology allows us to do whether that's good or bad for the world I don't know I would say that completely depends on what's getting built on top and I think that kind of depends on the ethereum community of what it allows to be built or what it prevents from being built so I would say ethereum isn't necessarily good or bad it's just a thing that allows people to do good or bad for the world
